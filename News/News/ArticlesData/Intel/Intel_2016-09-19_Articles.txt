News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Report: Estonian retailer accepting Kaby Lake CPU preorders by Wayne Manion  4:23 PM on September 20, 2016 Intel began shipping a limited selection of its new Kaby Lake CPUs to OEMs in July, and a few manufacturers have already announced products with the new chips. Desktop CPUs based on Kaby Lake architecture, part of the "optimize" phase of Intel's process-architecture-optimize cadence of product launches, aren't expected until the first quarter of 2017.  The three-month gap separating the present from 2017 hasn't stopped Estonian retailer Faunder from accepting pre-orders for the line-topping Core i7-7700K CPU. The Core i7-7700K, like its Skylake Core i7-6700K forebearer, is a quad-core, eight-thread CPU fabricated using Intel's 14-nm process technology. The Kaby Lake and Skylake parts fit the same LGA 1151 socket and have unlocked multipliers for Intel-sanctioned overclocking, when paired with an appropriate motherboard. The Core i7-7700K is clocked at 4.2GHz (200 MHz more than its Skylake predecessor) and packs 8MB of L3 cache, all in a 95W TDP. Faunder's Core i7-7700K product page lists a 4.5GHz Turbo Boost frequency, a 300 MHz increase compared to the current-generation chip.  Faunder is accepting pre-orders for Intel's latest desktop CPU for just over 360€. At current exchange rates, that figure comes to just over $400. For the sake of comparison, today's Core i7-6700K will drain a wallet of a little less than $350. U.S. prices for desktop Kaby Lake parts have not yet been announced, but new Intel parts are rarely substantially more expensive than outgoing SKUs.  Based on past releases, the upcoming Kaby Lake "optimization" step is likely to deliver the meager performance improvements along with reduced power consumption. Kaby Lake's video component will offer improved video hardware encoding and decoding support. Intel claims that Kaby Lake can pull as little as 0.5W while decoding 4K HEVC (H.265) video, compared to 10.2W for the same task on an equivalent Skylake chip.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160920006782/en/ IHS Markit Apple iPhone 7 teardown exploded view (Photo: Business Wire) After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple's total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. "Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple's main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses," said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. "All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past." Same shape. No jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device's haptic engine, which provides the "click" feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. "Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill -- not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine," Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7's storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone. From a cost perspective, the shift from 16GB/64GB/128GB iPhones to 32GB/128GB/256GB is a big jump. "Despite significant cost erosion in NAND flash over the last year, this increase in the overall memory cost definitely puts pressure on the bill of materials costs -- and therefore margins -- from Apple's perspective," Rassweiler said. Intel returns The Intel design win, and six years of absence that Intel had from the iPhone, is important to note. Even so, Intel still shares the processor business with Qualcomm. "Whereas Apple strives to have 'one iPhone model for all carriers and markets,' there are a number of different hardware permutations supporting various countries and carriers," Rassweiler said. "Apple will likely look for ways to simplify the design moving forward, which means one supplier whether Intel or Qualcomm will likely dominate, as part of supplier and SKU streamlining." According to Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics, IHS Markit, "Largely left behind in the 4G LTE market, Intel has finally worked itself back into the iPhone, which is a huge win, but not one that is going to be financially significant in the near term for Intel." RF paths Apple has also eliminated segmented antenna bands, which means the company is pushing all radio-frequency (RF) paths to the very ends of the phone both on the top and bottom. The aluminum uni-body construction and design forces all RF paths into those two locations. Whereas other smartphones use a glass back and RF components with antennas mounted on the ample back spaces, Apple is restricted to just two physical antennas. "This design limitation may force Apple to go back to an all-glass design again so that they can fit in 4x4MIMO LTE antennas and more features like wireless charging in the next iPhone iteration," Lam said. Modem moved The baseband thin modem has been moved next to the A10 processor. Prior to the iPhone 7, the thin modem was always on the other side of the SIM card receptacle. "This is a subtle change but likely shows us where Apple wants to take this," Lam said, "eventually putting the thin modem right on the apps processor package or even integrating it into the A-series processor." Officially water resistant iPhone 7 is now officially rated as water resistant. "We also saw evidence of this water proofing design evolution in the earlier iPhone 6S, which included additional gasketing around critical connectors, as well as the use of WiFi antenna at the end of the primary speaker box,"Lam said. "Doing so pushes the antennas near the only other opening, for better reception and transmission." Jet-black polished case Jet black polish is a new option on 128GB and 256GB models. "This is a new feature that produces a whole new look for the iPhone," Lam said. "It is a lower yielding, time-intensive manufacturing step that adds cost, as well as considerable value, pushing the retail price higher for those requesting this option." Antenna speaker design The antenna speaker design on the iPhone 7 came from the WiFi antenna packed into the speakers of Apple's MacBook. "Apple likes to reuse these unique designs throughout their product lines," Lam said. In a first for the iPhone series, the headset speaker now doubles as a stereo speaker. Upgraded camera While not as groundbreaking as the two optical paths in the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera has now been upgraded to optical image stabilization (OIS), for better low light performance. Improved battery life The battery has been increased to 1960mAhr capacity from 1715mAh in the previous iPhone 6s. This change is consistent with Apple's claims of improved battery life.

It tucks inside a sleek metallic body a nice screen, the latest Intel low-power platform and a 30 Wh battery. It's not perfect, but it's a great device for what it costs, so if you're in the market for such a compact slate/mini-laptop, you should have it on your list. The good nice looking and well built, available in 4 different colors, packs a good screen, modern hardware available in multiple configurations, good IO, long battery life, loud speakers, great price The bad some minor design flaws, cramped keyboard with quite a lot of flex, rather slow Wi-Fi, charges slowly Asus will update the popular Transformer Book series with a new model this fall, the T100HA. It’s scheduled for release at the beginning of October, with the base models starting at around 300E here in Europe ($299 in the US), and includes, among others, an updated Intel CherryTrail hardware platform, an USB Type-C port and a slightly redesigned outercase and dock. I’ve spent a few weeks with a pre-release version of the T100HA, identical in pretty much every way to those models you’ll be able to buy in stores in a few weeks, and I’ve gathered my impressions and thoughts in the following paragraphs. In very few words, the Transformer Book T100HA is a light and compact 10-inch Windows 10 tablet with a good screen, which is fast enough for your daily activities as long as you keep multitasking to a bare minimum and is able to last for between 8 to 10 hours of daily use on a single charge. A keyboard dock is included in the pack. If these have sparked your interest and if you’re interested in more details about this Transformer Book T100HA, then the long story awaits you in the rows below. This is the new 10-inch Asus Transformer Book T100HA Asus Transformer Book T100HAN Screen 10.1 inch, 1280 x 800 px, IPS, touchscreen Hardware Intel Atom CherryTrail  X5-Z8500 CPU 1.44 GHz CPU and Intel HD graphics Memory 2 GB RAM Storage 64 GB eMMC Connectivity Wireless N, Bluetooth Ports micro-HDMI, micro-USB, USB 3.1 Type-C gen1, microSD card reader, headphone jack Cameras 2 MP front, 5 MP back Battery 30 Wh OS Windows 10 64-bit Size Tablet: 265 x 175 x 8.5 mm (10.4” x 6.9” x 0.33”) Tablet + Dock: 265 x 175 x 18.5 mm (10.4” x 6.9” x 0.72”) Weight Tablet: 580 g (1.27 lbs) Tablet + Dock: 1140 g (2.51 lbs) Others docking station included, with keyboard, trackpad and USB 2.0 slot, available in 4 different colors Design, exterior and first look There are quite a few ultra-slim tablets out there these days, like the iPads, the Android slates or the magnesium built Microsoft Surface 3. But most of them sell for 400-500 bucks or more. Asus have a sleek Transformer Book as well, the T100 Chi we reviewed a while ago. The T100HA on the other hand is more affordable, but that’s not something you could tell based on the first impression, as this device feels like a more premium model. The tablet is slim, fairly light (1.27 lbs) and its outer case is mostly metallic, with an aluminum shell stretching around the back and the sides, while a shinny plastic rim acts as a liaison between the metal and the glass on the front face. The slate feels nice in hand and the rounded edges make it quite comfortable to hold and use. The build quality is pretty good as well, although the case does squeak when grabbed firmly, which suggests that the metallic shell is slim and not very sturdy. Overall though, the T100HA is a evolution when compared to the T100TA and T100TAM launched in the previous years. It’s smaller and lighter, it feels stronger and it’s going to be available in a bunch of different colors: White, Gray, Blue and Red. I’ve spent time with the Blue model and I think it’s a head turner, especially among kids. The color scheme is matched on the dock and some models are paired with a white, others with a black keyboard. On the other hand, when it comes to the IO, not much has changed, except for the addition of an USB TypeC port. That’s a first generation USB 3.1 slot though, so it won’t work with Thunderbolt peripherals, but will allow faster connection speeds (up to 5 Gbps) than the microUSB slot. It’s worth noting that the USB 3.1 slot is placed on the left side, while all the others are on the right. I was expecting to see the tablet bundled with an USB 3.1 charger, but this particular unit came with a standard microUSB cable in the box. That means that charging times are still a concern, on one hand, while on the other it means that using the tablet while charging is going to be difficult, since the included cable is very short (3 feet, less than 1 m long) and has to stretch all the way to the slate’s right edge. These issues could be addressed if the final retail versions will ship with an USB TypeC cable, but I’m pretty sure that’s not going to be the case here. Dock, keyboard and trackpad While the T100HA feels nice for a device that sells for under $300, the dock doesn’t exactly match it in terms of quality, as it’s made from a matte plastic and it feels somewhat hollow, cheap. I for one found it a bit weird that the dock is millimetrically shorter than the tablet, so the two don’t fit perfectly on top of each other. The fact that the tablet is a bit longer makes lifting the screen much easier than on other tablets, so perhaps that’s the reason why the two parts aren’t perfectly symmetrical. The dock latches to the tablet magnetically and the whole process of binding and unbiding the two is smooth and fast. You can easily attach the slate to the dock with a single hand, but you’ll need both hands to detach them, since the magnets are fairly strong. The hinge is solid and made from plastic as well. As a small detail, the dock rises on this hinge when the device is used as a mini laptop, thus the manufacturer designed two tiny feet on the hinge, which are also made from hard plastic. As a result, the T100HA will slide quite easily on a desk, as these feet on the hinge lack proper grip. Older Transformer Books had softer rubber feet on the hinge, from what I can remember, thus were more stable on a flat surface. Now, we’ve seen a similar hinge on the T100 Chi, however with this tablet there’s an actual connector that physically ties the tablet and the dock together. That means we don’t have a Bluetooth Keyboard dock on the T100HA, so it will only work when the slate is attached, but also means you’ll find a full-size USB slot on this dock (USB 2.0 only). Some of the older Transformer Books offered room for a HDD inside the dock, but that’s not the case here. In fact, the dock is so slim that a 2.5″ drive won’t be able to physically fit inside. There’s one more thing I have to add before moving on. The T100TAM and the T100 Chi were both top heavy when the tablet was connected to the dock and leaned back as much as possible. This newer T100HA no longer falls on its back, but at the same time the opening angle is limited to only about 130 degrees, so you will struggle to watch the screen head-on in certain conditions. These aside, let’s turn out attention on the keyboard and trackpad. You probably noticed by now that Asus went with a white keyboard on this color scheme and it looks beautiful. It allows the keys to be visible in dimmer conditions, which is extremely important, since they are not backlit. Aesthetics aside though, the keyboard is pretty much identical to those on the previous 10-inch Transformer Books. We’re talking about small rectangular keys with little space between them, but a full layout with all the important keys. The feedback is decent and the stroke fairly deep for such a thin device, but even so, I struggled to type accurately on this configuration, since the entire keyboard is so cramped. If you have smaller hands and you’re willing to spend the time to get used to the layout, you’ll probably pull it off though. As a side note, the keys are rather loud, thus typing in a quiet room can get a bit annoying for those around you, plus there’s a fair amount of flex and bounce in the keyboard’s frame, mostly because the dock is thin and made out of plastic. The trackpad is fairly spacious for a 10-incher and feels nice to the touch, despite being made out of plastic. It handles taps and gestures well most of the time, but if you need to press for clicks you’ll find the surface stiff and noisy. Screen Asus went with a 10.1 inch IPS touchscreen on this device and it’s a good one. The HD resolution (1280 x 800 px) might not be high enough for this day and age, and you’ll notice the pixels when readings texts or browsing, but it’s a detail I can live with on such an affordable device, especially since the screen’s other characteristics are above average. Those include the brightness, contrast, viewing angles and color reproduction, although you’ll need to use some sort of calibrating tool to correct the blueish tint that the panel gets out of the box. Check out the rows below for extra details: Panel HardwareID: AUOptronics AUO20D4; Coverage: 83% sRGB, 62% NTSC, 64% AdobeRGB; measured gamma: 2.1; max brightness in the middle of the screen: 460 cd/m2 on power; contrast at max brightness: 790:1; white point: 8100 K; black on max brightness: 0.59 cd/m2; average DeltaE: 1.87 uncalibrated, 0.79 calibrated . Now, I should add that the brightness readings seem a bit odd to me, as the panel does not appear to be as bright as my Spyder4 sensor claims. This could be due to the fact that the T100HA is running Windows 10 and the Spyder utility might have some issues with the new OS. So for now, take that reading with a grain of salt. That aside, is worth adding that there’s no active digitizer on this display, thus the T100HA is not going to be an ideal slate for inking and taking notes. Overall though, you’ll have little to complain about this display. Yes, premium tablets offer overall better high-resolution panels, but if you’re on a budget you’ll just have to settle for an HD only option, which should not be very hard in this case. Hardware and daily use experience The Transformer Book T100HA is built on Intel’s latest to-date hardware platform for low-power devices. In other words, it bundles an Atom CherryTrail X5-Z8500 processor, paired with 2 GB of RAM and 64 GB of eMMC storage on this tested model. Other configurations include 4 GB of RAM and a choice of either 32 or 128 GB of storage space. Software wise, the tablet comes with Windows 10 Home (64bit), but Windows 10 Pro might be bundled on some configurations as well. The T100HA is fairly capable, as long as you know what to expect and keep multitasking to a minimum The version I got to spend time with came with little to no bloatware, but I expect at least a few programs bundled with the final releases. Among those, an 1-year license for Microsoft’s Office 365 should be included, something you can find on all the other 10-inch slates available in stores these days. Now, Windows 10 performs pretty smoothly on this low-power configuration. Everyday performance is alright, as long as you know what to expect from such a device and don’t mind occasional sluggishness. I advise you to keep multitasking to a bare minimum and not use Chrome, which is known to be a memory hog. I’ve used Firefox instead, which performed well, but once you have more than 8-10 tabs open the device will start to struggle. On the other hand, I had no problems editing documents on the T100HA or watching all sorts of video content, including 4K clips on Youtube (on Edge, as on chrome the same clips were choppy) and 1080p/4K MKV and HEVC clips stored on the device itself. I used the default Movies and TV app and these movies barely put the processor to work, while with VLC Player the same files did not play smoothly. The good screen and the fairly loud speakers help with the multimedia experience, just don’t expect much in terms of sound quality. The speakers peak up at 80 dB (at ear-level) while playing Pharell’s Happy song of Youtube, and as a side note, they cause the slate’s metallic back to vibrate, even at lower volumes, which can be annoying when holding the tablet and playing music or videos. Now, my model came with only 2 GB of RAM and that takes a major toll on performance, especially since 0.8 GB are already occupied by Windows by default and some of it is used by the graphics, which leaves around 1 GB available for everyday use. The other issue is the rather slow storage eMMC storage solution, so don’t expect to launch programs instantaneously on this machine. I should also add that this particular unit did not perform as well as I was expecting in benchmarks. Immature drivers are usually to blame with these pre-production samples, but that means the final retail versions should be snappier. I did run a few tests and the results are listed below. 3Dmark 11: P405; 3DMark 13:  Ice Storm – 18977, Cloud Gate – 1825, Sky Diver – 951, Fire Strike – 223; CineBench 11.5: OpenGL 9.29 fps, CPU 1.20 pts, CPU Single Core 0.39 pts; CineBench R15: OpenGL 11.79 fps, CPU 110 cb, CPU Single Core 35 cb; x264 Benchmark 4.0: Pass 1 – 40.67 fps, Pass 2 – 7.86 fps; Octane 2.0 on Chrome: 7805 points. As you can tell, the numbers aren’t very good. But like I said, take them with a pinch of salt, the final units will be faster. In fact, this T100HA performed poorer than the Atom Z3795 powered Asus T100 Chi tested a while ago and is quite far from the Surface 3, which is one of the few other tablets powered by Intel Atom CherryTrail hardware available right now. Still, while the Transformer Book T100HA does not excel when it comes to performance, it does run cool most of the time and does last for many hours on each charge. The slate’s case barely reaches 30-33 Centigrades with everyday use, although it will get a bit hotter if you’ll play games (from the store) or perform other demanding activities. The inner components on the other hands reach temperatures of over 80 degrees often, but that’s no something you should be concerned about. *Daily Use – 1080p Youtube clip in EDGE for 30 minutes I should also add that the Wireless chip inside the Transformer Book isn’t very fast. Asus went for a Wi-Fi N only Broadcom chip, capable of reaching maximum speed of 72 mbps. In reality you should only expect around 50 Mbps right near the router and about 25-30 Mbps at 30 feet with two walls in between. That’s enough for daily browsing and enough to stream content from Youtube, Netflix or other sources, even in 4K. On the other hand, if you’ll need to copy content of and on the tablet, you’ll need to be patient, as both the Wi-Fi and the eMMC storage are slow. Last on the list there are the cameras, inherited from the previous Transformer Books: 5 Mpx on the back, 1.2 MPx on the front. I haven’t used the back shooter much, but I did try to use the front-camera for a quick Skype call in the evening and it proved to be pixelated and grainy. It will perform better in brighter conditions, but don’t expect much. The sound came out clean though and the two microphones are placed on the tablet’s top edge. Battery Life There’s a 30 Wh battery inside the T100HA and that’s enough to push the tablet for 6-10 hours of everyday use, as you can see from the few situations mentioned below (I’m using HW Monitor to record the average discharge for 30 minutes in each case, while the screen is set at around 120 nits – 40% brightness in this case). 1.6 Wh (~19 h of use) – idle, screen at 0%, Wi-Fi OFF; 4 Wh (~7 h 30 min of use) – very light browsing and text editing in Google Drive, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 3.2 Wh (~9 h 30 min of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in EDGE, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 4.8 Wh (~6 h  min of use) – 1080p fullscreen .mkv video in Videos and TV, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 5.5 Wh (~5 h 30 min of use) – heavy browsing in EDGE, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 5.9 Wh (~5 h min of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Chrome, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON. It’s worth noting that the T100HA did not last as long as the T100 Chi in out battery tests. Once again keep in mind this is a pre-production version and the final release models might behave a bit differently both in terms of performance and in terms of efficiency. However, comparing these result to those of the Surface 3, which is powered by very similar hardware, we can conclude the CherryTrail platform is not as efficient as the previous BayTrail-T hardware. The device came with a microUSB charger, as I mentioned above, and that means it will take more than 3 hours for a 10 to 100% recharge. The included microUSB to USB 2.0 cable is short (3-feet) and that means charging and using the tablet at the same time can be rather uncomfortable, unless you have a wall-socket right next to where you use it. There’s also the slim chance that the final retail units will ship with an USB 2.0 to USB 3.1 cable and you could charge the slate via the USB 3.1 slot, but I’m 99% sure that’s not going to be the case here, because it would mean that Asus implemented two different charging systems on this tablet. The long battery life is one of this slate’s best selling points Since the device is USB powered, you can also charge it from an external battery. Pricing and competition The Asus Transformer Book T100HA is expected to start at $299 (299E in Europe) and the base configuration will include the Intel Atom X5-Z8500 processor, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Other configurations will get up to 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, with the most expensive options selling for a little over $400. Now, if you plan to use this thing lightly and rely mostly on online services, the base model could be an option. Personally, I’d rather get a configuration with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage, it should handle everyday tasks much smoother and won’t run out of space as quickly. As for the competition, right now there are very few other slates built on Intel CherryTrail hardware, except for the more premium and more expensive Microsoft Surface 3. But there will be alternatives from Acer, Lenovo, HP, Dell and a few other OEMs in the next few months. On the other hand, there are plenty of BayTrail devices out there and most of them are discounted these days. The Asus Transformer Book T100, the HP Omni 10 and the Acer Aspire Switch 10E are just some of the options to consider, while the Asus T100 Chi and the Acer Aspire Switch 10 2015 come in as more premium 10-inch options. Follow this link for more details on the available 10-inch Windows tablets and mini laptops. Wrap-up After spending a few weeks with the Asus Transformer Book T100HA, I’m sure this is one of the best 10-inch slates you can get these days in the $300 to $400 price range. It looks beautiful and is strongly built, it packs a good screen, modern hardware and a large enough battery so it can last for 8-10 hours on each charge. It’s not drastically better than the competition in any way, but it is a more polished device and does not have any major quirks, anything that could turn you away from it. The T100HA is not for everyone though, as the performance might be lacking for some users and it’s really compact, which means it has a small screen, miniaturized ports and a shrunk-down keyboard. The Asus T100HA is one of the better 10-inch affordable tablets out there There is something else to consider as well. On one hand the T100HA is a more refined version of the older Transformer Books and other BayTrail devices, but it’s not a significant improvement in terms of performance, battery life or even features. And when we look at it from this angle, there’s a fair chance you will find better deals for your money among those previous generation 10-inchers in the months to come. Still, if you want a recent model and especially the redesigned case and the USB TypeC port, the T100HA is going to be hard to beat. In fact, I think this is a better pick for the money than the more premium Asus T100 Chi, and I’d have it on my shortlist for the end of this year, especially since I expect to see it discounted in quite a few places around Christmas and the Sales period.

I have waited quite a long time for a Review. This seems to be the First one. It made my decision easier. But i will wait for some gametests for starcraft2 hehe. Quite a nice Devise… Reply Stephen September 29, 2015 at 6:29 pm As reported not much difference to TA and I like the full sized USB 3 in dock and Office that doesn’t run out. You can put sd cards in up to 256gb and Windows 10 runs fine. Still if the price drops low enough Reply Mark October 3, 2015 at 9:31 am But this is much better in terms of hardware for the same price of the TA. For the same price as with TA with the 500GB dock, I think you would get the 128GB/4GB HA version, with the RAM upgrade being the most compelling reason for an upgrade. The back camera is also very important if you’re a student or an office worker as it would be occasionally useful for taking pictures of whiteboards and documents and such. Office 365 (assuming it’s Personal)… if the thing expires there’s always the Windows 10 Office apps to fall back. Or at least for a year ASUS may again release a better T100. 🙂 BTW, AFAIK the T100TA only supports up to 32GB microSDs, and speeds are also very limited. Reply Andrei Girbea October 9, 2015 at 7:02 pm The 4 GB of RAM is the only significant upgrade and I’d say it’s worth paying extra for if you plan to keep this thing for a while. Isaac October 6, 2015 at 2:15 pm Wich is better,the T100HA or the T100TAM? In terms of performance. Thanks. Reply Anand February 11, 2016 at 2:46 pm Thanks for the Review. I have one question. Does it support “Expandable Storage” ? it has card reader slot but no where it is clearly mentioned that storage can be expanded via Micro SD card Reply Andrei Girbea February 12, 2016 at 12:43 am It does Reply Anand February 12, 2016 at 9:08 am Hi Andrei, Thanks for your response. As you mentioned it supports Expandable Storage. Will I be able to install apps on the micro SD card ? Will there be an option to choose install location for Applications ? This feature will be really helpful. This will increase the storage space. Andrei Girbea February 24, 2016 at 12:25 am Well, yes, but the card is slow and I would advise against this. lucca March 16, 2016 at 2:09 am What makes you think, that the external SD-Card will be slower, than the internal SD-Card? (there is no real SSD inside, it’s just a embedded MemoryCard) Faye February 15, 2016 at 8:13 pm Would you recommend this laptop for blogging/photo editing for a traveller looking for a small and lightweight computer? Reply Andrei Girbea February 24, 2016 at 12:25 am Photo editing, not that much, unless it’s really basic stuff like cropping Reply lucca March 16, 2016 at 2:14 am Since the Modell is surprisingly fast for that size, weight and price, I would say yes (and you are not a Photoshop Pro who needs to works with many layers and filters) But be sure to take at least the 4 GB Modell … If you want much more Power (but be fine with less battery life) take a look at the surface pro 2 + . They are really fast (and expensive) But for basic needs the t100ha is fine. I develop WebApps with mine and I am happy with it. Reply Deepak Prabhakar March 16, 2016 at 1:22 am I have 2 Gb of RAM, can I extend it? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Those include the front-facing dual-speaker system, the recent Intel Moorefield hardware platform powering it, the 3G modem included, the dual-SIM support and, for sure not least, the price. But is the FonePad 7 FE375CG worth your hard earned buck and does it have any hidden flaws? Well, stick with me till the end of this review and you’ll find out. This is the Asus Fonepad FE375CG – a dual-SIM Moorefield powered 7 inch tablet that sells for roughly $200 But first, have a look at the specs sheet, so you’ll get a larger picture of what we’re dealing with here. Asus Fonepad 7 FE375CG spec sheet Screen 7 inch, 1280 x 800 px, IPS Hardware Intel Atom Moorefield Z3560 1.83 GHz, quad-core + PowerVR 6430 graphics Memory 1 GB RAM Storage 16 GB (11.1 available) Connectivity Wireless N, Bluetooth, GPS, 3G – HSPA (dual-sim) Sensors accelerometer, compass, gyroscope, light-sensor Ports micro-USB, microSD card reader (up to 64 GB card), headphone jack Cameras 5 MPx back camera, 2 MPx front camera Battery 15 Wh OS Android 4.4.2 KitKat with ZenUI Size 194.3 x 108.9 x 9.8 mm (7.65 x 4.29 x 0.39 inches) Weight 299 g (0.66 pounds) Others dual front-facing speakers, available in a bunch of colors, matching cases offered Price $199 Design and first impression On the outside this FonePad looks like a standard 7 inch tablet. It’s fairly compact and fairly light, pretty much like the Asus Memo Pad ME176C tested a while ago, although a bit thinner (as shown by the narrower lateral bezel around the screen) and longer. There’s glass covering the front face, with two individual cuts on top and below the display for the front-facing speakers, which are actually quite good and loud, as long as you don’t keep the device on the Power Saving option from the included Audio Wizard app. I believe it actually ships (at least this tested unit did) with this option selected by default, that’s why you might think the speakers are pretty bad when you’ll get the slate out of the box, but make sure you switch to Music or something else in Audio Wizard and you’ll be fine. The back is made from what looks like painted plastic and I have the Gold version for this review, which I’m really not a fan of. Luckily there are other colors available as well, but the coating seems fragile, somewhat cheap, and I worry it’s going to scratch and dent easily, so you might want to keep this inside a case. Asus does have a few of them available and I’ve tested the one called View Folio Cover, made of some sort of textured faux-leather, with a circular cut that pairs smartly with the software interface and shows various details, like the time and date, or who’s calling you. Other from that, you’ll fidn the standard features on the device, including the fornt and rear-cameras, the microUSB port placed on the top lip, plus the Power button and volume rocker on the right, again too close together, so you might end up turning off the screen while looking to turn down the volume. Phone and 3G abilities Back to what I said earlier, yes, this thing can be used as a phone. In fact, it offers room for two different SIMs and an up to 64 GB microSD card, all hidden behind an accessible plastic cap on the phone’s left edge. You can use either of the SIMs at the same type. When having only only inserted, it will be used for both voice and data services. When having both, you can select which one of them is used for data and then you can make/take calls or send/receive text-messages on either of them. The dialer is smartly designed to show you the available SIMs. For instance, when there are two inserted, you can select which one you want to use, when there’s only one, it only displays it and tells you if it’s inserted in the 1st or the 2nd SIM slot. I was satisfied with the cellular performance of this Fonepad. It does not support 4G/LTE speeds, but it’s still going to be fast enough for daily use. I also haven’t encountered any problems while taking calls on it, although the earpiece is not very loud, so you’ll have a hard-time hearing the other person in a noisy room, and the microphones don’t do a great job at catching your voice, so you’ll sound somewhat muted on the other end of the call. Besides that, the proximity sensor that turns OFF the screen when having the tablet at your ear is really slow and takes 1-2 seconds to react and turn the display back ON, which is going to be annoying if you want to let’s say quickly access something on the device while in a conversation. Add these to the weird looks you’ll get when talking on a 7 inch device and you’ll probably conclude this thing is not the greatest phone there. But it gets the job done if needed. And you can always tend to a Bluetooth headset and forget about those inconveniences. Screen There’s a 7 inch IPS otuchscreen on this Fonepad, fairly bright (Auto brightness is also available) and capable of painting nice looking colors. Some of you might complain about the 1280 x 800 px resolution and it’s true that pixels are visible when looking closely and especially when browsing and dealing with fonts, that looks somewhat fuzzy. But let’s not forget this is an affordable tablet and adjust out expectations accordingly. Yes, a 1080p display would have been great, but this one will do fine and helps extend the battery life while keeping the price down. If you do care a lot about pixel density and panel sharpness though, you’d better look somewhere else (and be prepared to spend extra). There’s a good 7 inch IPS screen on this phone, but some of you might not appreciate the HD resolution Hardware and software This is one of the first tablets powered by Intel’s new Moorefield hardware released into the wild, while most other tested lately were powered by BrayTrail-Z hardware. I’m not getting in depth here, but the Z3560 is basically a quad-core CPU clocked at 1.86 GHz with PowerVR 6 Series graphics. These are only paired with 1 GB of RAM, but even so, the tablet feels fast in daily use and scores highly in most benchmarks. (Keep in mind that this is still an early sample and results might actually improve on final retails units.)  Antutu v5.0 Beta 1 – got inconsistent results, ranging between 30000 and 47000 points; Quadrant – 17921; 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited: 14765; Manhattan – 1201 (19.4 fps, 1080p Manhattan Offscreen – Out of Memory , T-Rex – 2287 (40.8 fps), 1080 T-Rex Offscreen (1658 – 29.6 fps). MooreField is not majorly different from BayTrail-T though. They are both 22 nm platforms, but the Z3560 is a natively quad-core Silvermont based SoC with improved PowerVR (Rogue) G6430 graphics, hence the performance boost (mostly visible in the graphics department). The limited amount of RAM does drag down this particular implementation and is occasionally noticeable in everyday use. I will put up together a more detailed post comparing Intel’s BayTrail-T and Moorefield hardware platforms in the near future, so stay tuned for that. Software wise, the Fonepad FE375CG runs Android 4.4.2 with Asus’s ZenUI skin on top, which redesigns and enhances most interface elements, from the homescreens to the multitasking panel. And I do appreciate some of the changes, like the Quick Settings panel that also allows you to adjust the screen’s brightness and Free RAM in case performance gets poor or the app drawer where you can list only the downloaded apps or have them sorted based on popularity. On top of these, Asus does bundle some software on this FonePad, like they do on all their other slates. And that includes a File Manager, the Audio Wizard, the Splendid app that lets you adjust the screen’s white balance and color intensity, the Do it Later to-do list and task manager or the Webstorage, that includes some free cloud storage space for the first year with your tablet. There’s also the ZenLink suite that allows to easily share content between different devices and connect wirelessly to a big screen or remotely to a computer. Follow this link for more details on Asus’s software package. Long story short though, the Asus FonePad FE375CG does provide an enjoyable everyday experience. It’s fairly snappy, offers access to plenty of apps and can handle decently well most of the things you’ll throw at it, including games like Asphalt 8 or Real Racing 3. The nice screen and punchy speakers also add to the overall impression, as well as the impressive battery life and I’d say this does run mostly smoother than the Asus BayTrail-T Memo Pads I’ve tested recently. However, you should know that the tablet gets a bit warm on the back when pushed, in the middle, beneath the camera’s lens, and Intel’s Moorefield is still only a mid-range platform, so don’t expect this thing to be the fastest out there and get used to the idea that it will occasionally choke if you’ll push it heavily, especially since it only packs only 1 GB of RAM. Battery life This FonePad gets a 15 Wh battery and Intel’s platform is really efficient. A single charge will get you countless hours of stand-by time, with the Wi-Fi syncing in the back, and you can roughly expect 8 hours of daily use from this one or about 6 with the cellular modem continuously turned ON. If you plan on using it as a phone, the FE375CG will easily get you through the day as long as you let it rest from time to time. I did had to rush through this part of the review though and lacked the time to properly test the battery life under various circumstances, so I can’t exactly tell you how much it will last while running games or movies. I’ll hopefully update this part in the near future, but for now, take the numbers with a grain of salt. My overall impression on this slate’s battery life is solid though and I believe the Moorefield platform is a step forward from the Baytrail-T tested on the MemoPad ME176C and ME181C. Oh, and you also get several Power Saving Modes in case you actually want to squeeze the most out of this FonePad, while limiting performance and connectivity. Price and availability From what I can tell right now, the Fonepad FE375G will be soon available in stores in select regions, including Asia and Eastern Europe. I can’t say for sure though if the Western countries, South America or the US will get it as well, but I will update this section once I know more. My contacts at Asus suggest a price-tag of around $200 (200 euros), which is definitely not bad for what this thing has to offer. Wrap-up The FonePad FE375CG is imh the go-to option for an A-Brand tablet with cellular connectivity right now IF you’re on a limited budget. You can probably find cheaper 7 inch slates with a 3G modems from various OEMs, but I can’t comment on these, they vary from region to region. I can however recommend this FonePad. I own the original FonePad (the ME371MG, if I’m not mistaken) and this newer model is a major improvement in terms of performance, software package and battery life. And then you get those other goodies on top: it can take two SIMs, one for voice, one for data, it gets front-facing speakers, it’s available in different colors and Asus offers a handful of matching cases for it. The Asus FOnePad FE375CG has no major issues and is a solid pick if you’re after an affordable 7 inch tablet with 3G connectivity On the other hand, if you don’t need a cellular tablet, the Asus’s MemoPad ME176C remains a more affordable options, selling for just under $150. However, this Fonepad performs overall smoother and lasts slightly longer on a charge, but a Moorefield version of the Memo Pad will probably hit the shelves in the near future as well. Anyway, to wrap this up, I can hardly complain about anything on this tablet, and you know me, I always complain about something. There are minor aspects that Asus could improve, like the painted plastic case that feels a bit cheap or the overall Wi-Fi speed, which is not on par with the other (more expensive) slates I have around, but let’s not forget this is a 200 bucks device and it just can’t be spotless. On the other hand, some of you might complain about the low resolution screen and limited amount of RAM, and I agree that the latter can be a problem sometimes, but again, 200 bucks won’t get you those right now, at the time of this article (September 2014), not in an A-brand slate. So if you do want them, be prepared to pay extra for something like the Nexus 7 2013 LTE ($300+) or any of the new devices that will be launched in the near future (keep in eye on the new Nexus slate). To conclude, this is a good buy. But I’d like to know what you guys think about the Asus Fonepad FE375CG, if you like it or not, if you think it’s worth you money or you’d rather get something else instead. So make sure to leave you impressions and questions,  if any,  in the comments section below. I’ll be around to reply. Thanks for sticking by!

 Intel is paying over $23 million to bring in eBay's former CFO Eugene Kim Sep. 20, 2016, 1:20 PM 4,349 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CFO Bob SwanIntel Intel tapped Bob Swan to be its new CFO, replacing Stacy Smith who will now oversee the company's sales, manufacturing, and operations. Swan's hiring was a bit of a surprise, given his lack of experience in the chip business. He was most recently a partner at private equity firm General Atlantic, and before that, has spent 9 years as eBay's CFO. But perhaps what's more surprising is his lofty pay package that exceeds $23 million in total, according to a regulatory filing. Swan will get an $850,000 base salary, but is eligible for an annual bonus of $1.2 million and a hiring bonus of $5.5 million. On top of that, his new hire stock grant and annual equity award could each be worth $9.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Swan's compensation package is particularly interesting because it shows Intel's willingness to pay big bucks to bring in outside executives, even as the company's going through a massive cost cutting plan that involves its biggest layoff in history. Just last year, Intel gave a $25 million pay package to former Qualcomm exec Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala to hire him as the company's number two executive. Tricky timing "We do note a continuation of high pay for new talent however, with Mr. Swan's package coming in at a bit over $23 million," Bernstein's analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note. It'll be interesting to see how Intel's current employees take these high compensation packages given that the rest of the company is going through a painful reorganization process. We did previously hear rumblings from a number of current and former employees who questioned the logic behind these big pay packages. Still, Rasgon says Swan's hiring is a "reasonably positive" move given his experience in restructuring at a private equity firm. At eBay, he also oversaw more than 30 acquisitions and helped with the spinoff of PayPal. “Mr. Swan's most recent role in private equity (Operating Partner at General Atlantic), may enable him to bring a skillset to bear on Intel's ongoing restructuring and refocusing, as well as investing for growth…Overall our initial (outside-in) impressions of this hire are reasonably positive," Rasgon wrote.

It ceased development of its Atom chips for smartphones and tablets, ceding defeat to the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. It has now hinted it could return in the future. Intel has scrapped its next-generation Atom processors that would have found their way into future phones, tablets and convertible PCs. Instead, it has refocused its mobile ambitions on modem manufacturing, a business that appears to be more successful than creating processors. Intel has attracted Apple to its modems for the iPhone 7. This week, Venkata Renduchintala, president of Intel's Client and IoT division, addressed the company's departure from mobile in an interview with PCWorld. Renduchintala said the decision to axe the Atom chips was a result of rationalising the company's R&D spending. However, he said the current lack of mobile development doesn't mean Intel's out of the market for good. He hinted the company is already back at work, creating new products out of the public eye. "We had a couple of mobile SoC products that I don't think were worthy to continue to conclusion," Renduchintala said in the interview. "That doesn't mean we're no longer doing mobile platforms. On the mobile platform side, my commitment is to talk less and do more. When we have something to say we'll talk about it." Renduchintala described modems as a "fundamental technology" that's "as indelible for us as our competence in CPU or GPU." He said the company has a long-term road-map for its modem business and has already established itself with "credibility, relevance and importance" in the modem market. Intel's processors dominate desktop machines but have never achieved the same success in mobile devices. Only a handful of smartphones have used an Intel chip. Intel was caught out by the rise of smartphones and didn't have a suitable processor design ready when manufacturers started to source CPUs. They turned to companies such as ARM which was touting low-power, high-efficiency designs far more suited to products requiring an all-day battery life. Since then, Intel's technology has progressed considerably. Its ARM-rivalling Atom chips are a competent offering with considerable performance and efficiency. However, it came too late to the game and has never attracted significant manufacturer or developer attention. Its chips use a different architecture to ARM's ones and a lot of Android was never optimised for Intel's platform, due to a lack of demand. If Intel returns to mobile processors, it will need a more compelling product than its recent generations of Atom chips. It could run into the same problems as before though, creating an architecture but failing to convince phone manufacturers to use it. An alternative would be to license a design from ARM, creating a processor that's based on the same underlying structure as the CPUs already in Android and iOS phones and tablets. That could be an uncomfortable partnership for Intel but one that would at least give it a foothold in the mobile industry. Renduchintala also touched on Intel's other new frontiers of development. The company is moving away from desktop processors towards opportunities such as self-driving cars and the Internet of Things. Renduchintala said autonomous urban transportation is probably "about a decade away." Intel is aiming to build a mainstream computing system "that dwarfs anything that exists in a car today" to power these new vehicles.

Coreboot Is Being Ported To A New Intel Skylake-Y System Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 20 September 2016 at 12:12 PM EDT. 16 Comments Those wishing to use Coreboot on a modern Intel system (albeit with the closed-source FSP) will soon have another option to consider with an open-source, physically secure computer powered by a Skylake-Y SoC moving ahead with a port to Coreboot. Coreboot is being ported to the ORWL. ORWL is the "first open-source, physically secure computer" that is currently being crowd-funded on CrowdSupply. The ORWL has already raised $30k of its $25k USD goal with 16 days remaining. The ORWL will be powered by an Intel Skylake M3 or M7 SoC, Intel 515 graphics, and various storage options and other configurations. Ubuntu and Windows 10 are among the supported systems. What makes the ORWL physically secure is having a Cortex-M3 powered secure micro-controller built onto the motherboard, a secure key via NFC is also needed for booting, and any physical tampering with the unit will cause the auto-encrypted SSD to be erased. An active clamshell mesh around the computer ensures that the computer cannot be physically opened. The ORWL is planned to be open-source down to all schematics plus the relevant controller and key fob firmwares, etc. Those wishing to learn more about the ORWL can find the details via this Crowd Supply page. Pricing on this "secure" computer starts out at $699 USD. What's new to report on now is that ORWL/Design-Shift is moving forward and financing their Coreboot port for this system -- unlike some other vendors that just hope the community does the port, etc. ORWL has made public their statement of work with Eltan B.V. for ensuring Coreboot can power this system and it will work with both Linux and Windows operating systems. Those interested can read the SoW. The port will be open-source but like other modern Intel systems will rely upon the closed-source FSP (Firmware Support Package). While the binary blob from Intel is a disappointment, at least Coreboot will be running on another modern system. 16 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Electronic Arts and DICE have unleashed those details, and unsurprisingly, you’ll need a relatively beefy PC to run Battlefield 1 as it is intended. You’ll want at least a GeForce GTX 660 2GB or a Radeon HD 7850 2GB working in tandem with either an Intel Core i5 6600K or an AMD FX-6350. While those are pretty affordable specifications, keep in mind those are the lowest-tier CPUs and GPUs that will run Battlefield 1. Regardless of what kind of setup you’re running, you’ll need 50GB of free space and 8GB of RAM, though to get the most out of Battlefield 1, 16GB of RAM will be required. Here are the full minimum and recommended system specifications: Minimum Specifications OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Processor (AMD): AMD FX-6350 Processor (Intel): Intel Core i5 6600K Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB DirectX: 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB Recommended Specifications OS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later Processor (AMD): AMD FX 8350 Wraith Processor (Intel): Intel Core i7 4790 or equivalent Memory: 16GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB DirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB Battlefield 1 ended up being the largest beta in EA’s history, showing that players are definitely interested in this new World War 1 shooter. Electronic Arts also recently detailed the Season Pass for Battlefield 1, and it looks like players will have to plop down quite a bit of cash to get the full experience. Battlefield 1 is due out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC on October 21.

Richard Vogel/AP Analysts smile on Ceva after record Q4 results Ceva may be only Israeli company involved in producing iPhone Is Ceva inside? It will have to buy an iPhone to find out Like every new iPhone launch, Apple's release of the iPhone 7 created a worldwide buzz. After its release, experts physically dissemble the device, known as a "teardown" to discover which components the company used to create its latest flagship product. A big winner of these teardowns was Israeli firm Ceva, which licenses its designs to chipmakers such as Intel and Samsung, which in turn embed its digital signal processors within their chip sets, reducing the time and cost it takes them to bring products to market. The teardowns showed that for the first time Intel's thin modem, which uses Ceva's design, is in some versions of Apple's new smartphone. For the last several years Intel's competitor Qualcomm dominated the market for these chips. Ceva has not commented what royalties it expects for the sale of each iPhone, but industry observers value them at 9 cents per device. The good news for the company, which last had its products in Intel's chip sets five years ago in the iPhone 3 and iPhone 4, continued Monday when Canaccord Genuity raised its price target for Ceva from $38 per share to $40 per share. Its stock price on Nasdaq jumped 10.3% to a record $34.99 on turnover of $571,000, four times its average daily turnover, in wake of the news. The investment firm, as well as Benchmark, which kept its price target at $36, and Wunderlich all rated Ceva a buy. Concord analysts also raised their profit projections for Ceva, stating in their recommendation that they expect company royalties to continue to pour in during 2017 and beyond. Revenue for the company grew 28% to $17 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company was valued at $733 million following the  surge in its stock price.

By: Anthony Garreffa | HT & Movies News | Posted: Sep 20, 2016 2:46 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Begin rant: I'm sitting in front of my computer looking at the price of the Xbox One S console, as I'm about to buy my first console since the PS3. I never owned an Xbox 360, Xbox One or PS4, but the new Xbox One S has me convinced. I'm moving back to consoles for a very big thing: 4K Blu-ray, which doesn't exist on the PC right now - the mightiest platform of them all.     Seriously, it doesn't make sense.   Years later, I went to a PC store in my state and purchased a Pioneer DVDROM with an MPEG2 decoder card, and getting The Matrix on DVD right after. That night, I launched into the next generation of entertainment, with my PC at the center of it. The quality was on another level, but having my PC power by DVD drive was really something else for entertainment at my desk.   Fast forward to 2016, in a world of incredibly powerful smartphones, high-res/refresh rate displays, massively fast graphics cards, SSDs and CPUs - 4K Blu-ray is completely dead on the PC. What. The. Hell.   Intel pushes its next-gen Kaby Lake processors for 4K video, except there's no 4K Blu-ray support on PC right now. Our resident CPU lord Steven Bassiri talked about 4K video being very important for Intel in his overview of the Kaby Lake architecture. In the article, Steven said that Intel briefed him Kaby Lake, and that their new processor is in some ways a response to the "growing number of 4K capture devices". Steven added:"Most people know that the very popular GoPro cameras capture in 4K, but now with improvements to Intel's integrated graphics, working with them on-the-go should be much easier".     We can see in Intel's slide on Kaby Lake and the new media engine is built upon a Gen9 graphics architecture, and look to the left - 'input' with 4K HEVC 10-bit support, as well as the VP9 codec. Intel notes you'll have "improved media experiences with HEVC 10-bit, VP9".   Intel isn't the only company parading around that 4K is super important, futureproofing their products - except there's no 4K Blu-ray support, guys. NVIDIA and AMD are also pushing 4K, but it's more for the gamers - and not so much for 4K media playback. NVIDIA is definitely more pro-4K in the media side of things, with their awesome Shield TV device powering 4K content with providers like Netflix and YouTube.   But the question remains: where the hell is 4K Blu-ray on the PC? What's stopping the likes of Sony, Panasonic and Samsung making 4K Blu-ray drives for the PC?   Even smaller external USB 3.0-powered drives that could plug into laptops, too?   Nowhere. I demand answers, people. Recommended for You Star Wars: Episode 9 to be shot in 65mm, primed for... 'The Get Down' costs Netflix $16 million per episode...

The nation's second-largest telecom company said Monday it has demonstrated IoST services over its long-term evolution (LTE) mobile network, based on Intel's narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology. Besides Intel, KT has teamed up with Nokia, Kolon Industry and Daejeon Metropolitan City for the world's first IoST demonstration. "Through the world's first NB-IoT demonstration, we confirmed both the technological and business value of the new services," said Kim Hyoung-wook, executive vice president of the KT Platform Service Planning Office, in a statement. "We will expedite establishment of a nationwide NB-IoT network and push for partnerships with more than 500 enterprises under the GiGA IoT Alliance, aiming at taking the lead in the expansion of the IoST service market." KT said it is working with Kolon Sport, the outdoor apparel brand of Kolon Industry, to develop what it calls the IoT Safety Jacket. The jacket embeds Intel's NB-IoT communication module and sensors that detect unnatural movements of a user in distress and automatically transmit signals to rescuers even in remote areas with poor network infrastructure. It also has LEDs and acoustic sensors to help rescuers find the location of the missing person. KT also demonstrated a prototype IoT Smart Tent that can detect fire in or around the tent to automatically alert people inside. NB-IoT is one of the standard telecommunication technologies for IoT devices and services. It operates in the narrow bandwidth of 200 kHz and covers a wide area reaching more than 10 kilometers under low transmission speed. NB-IoT has been increasingly adopted for IoST in particular, as devices based on this technology consume less energy and cost less. KT worked with Nokia last month to demonstrate equipment synchronization of base stations and NB-IoT core networks. The latest demonstration of Intel's NB-IoT module and Kolon's outdoor activity products is expected to help KT provide diverse IoT services through its LTE network. "The demonstration is a very important achievement under the IoT partnership with KT," said Andrew Cope, head of Nokia's business in Korea. "Through partnerships, we will prove that the NB-IoT technology will realize diverse IoT services and public safety." Meanwhile, KT said it is also planning to cooperate with Daejeon Metropolitan City for public IoT services based on NB-IoT technology. "Daejeon will work with KT on NB-IoT to expand urban IoT services to smart city and environmental projects," an official at Daejeon Metropolitan City said. yoonsw@ktimes.com 1.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 20 September 2016 | MYT 7:02 PM Chip designer Ceva rallies as iPhone win to boost profit iPhone windfall: Analysts estimated that Intel and Qualcomm may equally split the thin modem supply for the iPhone, which could boost Ceva's adjusted earnings per share in 2017 by as much as 25 cents. — Reuters TEL AVIV: Shares in Israel's Ceva Inc hit a record high after firms specialising in dissecting and analysing electronic devices revealed its chip technology is used in Apple Inc's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus phones.  Ceva licenses its designs to chipmakers such as Intel and Samsung, who embed its digital signal processors within their chip sets, reducing the time and cost it takes them to bring products to market.  These "teardowns", as they are known in the electronics industry, showed that for the first time Intel's thin modem, which uses Ceva's design, is in some versions of Apple's new smartphone. For the last several years Intel's competitor Qualcomm dominated the market for these chips.  "Since 2012 our numbers were down because of Qualcomm," Ceva chief financial officer Yaniv Arieli told Reuters on Sept 20. "This year that's changing and our customers are successful in launching their own LTE chips," he added, referring to the chips used in 4G mobile communications.  Ceva's Nasdaq-traded shares jumped 10.3% to a record US$34.99 (RM144.93) on Sept 19 in more than four times its daily average volume.  Analysts raised their forecasts for the company, citing the teardowns, which can be found on the websites www.chipworks.com and www.ifixit.com.  "We view Ceva as one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+," said Benchmark analyst Gary Mobley.  He estimated that Intel and Qualcomm may equally split the thin modem supply for the iPhone, which could boost Ceva's adjusted earnings per share in 2017 by as much as 25 cents. Analysts on average forecast Ceva will earn 84 cents a share in 2016.  Canaccord raised its price target for Ceva to US$40 (RM165.68) from US$38 (RM157.40) and its adjusted earnings per share estimate to US$1.11 (RM4.60) from US$1.05 (RM4.35).  Ceva estimates its designs will be included in almost 200 million LTE phones in 2016 and is targeting 400-500 million phones annually within three years.  Arieli said this was not just from high-end Apple and Samsung phones but from emerging economies where smartphones costing under US$100 (RM414) are more popular. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Stocks Analysis , Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology You May Be Interested Acer unveils a notebook that's thinner than 1cm Nasscom cuts IT services sector growth forecast for FY17 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read RM8mil dragon attraction Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News Stocks falter; euro hits dollar low for year ECB chief Draghi hints at more stimulus to come Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 White supremacist ad allowed on Twitter, CEO apologises Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The 100 "Unnati Kendras" are on-ground facilities serving as common access digital learning centres for local citizens, with a focus on education, entrepreneurship and innovation. "Through continued work with the government and the ecosystem, we strive to make a tangible difference to individual lives and communities through the power of the computing," said Debjani Ghosh, Vice President, Sales and Marketing Group, and Managing Director, South Asia, Intel, in a statement. Each centre is equipped with Intel-powered devices, vernacular language content and relevant training programs for local citizens in the state, creating opportunities for skill development and digital empowerment. Through a network of 100 "Unnati Kendras" deployed at Common Service Centres, the company has made the experience of personal computing real for more than 250,000 local citizens till date. The highest consumer enthusiasm emerged in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana. Education and e-learning were the most popular uses of the PC at these "Unnati Kendras". According to Intel data, 44 per cent of the walk-ins wanted to use computers to access e-learning and educational content, with 28 per cent aspiring to use computers for creative self-expression and 28 per cent for entrepreneurial activities. --IANS anuj/na/vm Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Tata Trusts get I-T notice for tax avoidance Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Current Affairs Demonetisation will define new normal for Indian economy: Jaitley Gujarat HC allows Hardik to shift to Haridwar for fortnight Modi should apologise for demonetisation deaths: Congress PM meets President, briefs him about measures on demonetisation UP Principal Secretary, journalist injured in expressway accident [ more ] Top Stories T N Ninan: Our post-truths Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Cash crunch chokes off India palm oil imports Banks to serve only their respective customers tomorrow; elderly exempted Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal [ more ] Markets Cash crunch chokes off India palm oil imports MCX to levy concentration margin from December Gold quotes at huge discount, price hits 4-month low Sovereign gold bonds worth 14 tonnes in six tranches Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter [ more ] Companies Koovs raises $16 million from Times Group, other investors Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Natco plans to double drug filings next year Infosys invests Rs 14.5 crore in Danish artificial intelligence start-up [ more ] Opinion T N Ninan: Our post-truths Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

The European Court of Justice confirmed on Thursday the 1.4 billion dollars fine that the European Commission imposed on Intel after an antitrust investigation. In 2009, former EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes accused Intel of abusing its market position on CPU’s. After the EU’s top court ruling on Thursday, Almunia said that the decision in the Intel case “is extremely important”.  “The fact that the Court of Justice confirms all our decisions, from the penalty to all our objections to an anti-competitive behavior is something extremely important even more in the IT sector, the new digital economy, which is moving so fast and needs clear criteria, not only in our own decisions but also with the ones that comes from the law. It is a success of the European Commission, particularly of my predecessor Commissionaire Neelie Kroes, it is a success of the Directorate General of Competition, and it is a success for all the users that will find they can obtain computers and important parts of them at the lowest possible price, they will have a bigger choice, and with the guarantee that the European Commission is always supervising the good behavior of the markets.” Almunia added.  Print Related Tags Topics EU antitrust European Court of Justice fine Intel People Joaquín Almunia Sections Competition Digital Efficacité et Transparence des Acteurs Européens 1999-2016.

Diane Bryant, SVP at Intel and a big Oracle partner, spent an hour covering a very broad landscape and she did it with verve. There are so many intersection points between the companies that it's hard to present a coherent story. There is the Xeon E5 v4 processor that outperforms previous versions -- something you can expect from any Silicon Valley announcement -- and there are memory chips that power things like the Oracle Sun Xadata machine, which can encrypt data to make it more resilient to hacking. There was a lot more in the keynotes -- and all of it important, but perhaps only for segments of the audience. For the rest of us, there was a gee-whiz quality to those announcements, but at least being wowed is entertaining. Chips of the Future Now Perhaps the most interesting information in Bryant's presentation was that Intel was shipping a new line of chips that communicate not by moving electrons along predetermined paths but by using light emanating from incredibly small lasers that are manufactured on the same silicon substrate as conventional chips. Light enables greater speeds, and these chips -- classed as "photonics" -- have a big job to play in the future for things like networking and communicating with peripherals. I know I am not doing justice to photonics, but the most amazing thing to come out of the discussion was that Intel already has begun shipping those products. With this down payment, we can see the outlines of a future when computing is hundreds, if not thousands, of times faster than today's state of the art -- and who knows what that will mean in IT or the IoT? I am curious, for instance, if using light will generate less heat on chips and enable further component density. Writing the Cloud Chapter After that brain dump, Larry Ellison spoke in what can be termed only as brain dump No. 2. Larry also had a lot to talk about. After a really good earnings call last week -- in which it was evident the company has turned a significant corner to become a bona fide cloud company -- Ellison was in his element. He sold the benefits of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS to the point of repeating last decade's analogy about IT becoming a kind of utility, like water, gas and electricity. At least he was talking about the future and not denigrating cloud technology as he did before his conversion some years ago. In truth, Ellison always has been a cloud guy. He owned a big chunk of NetSuite and was a member of the Salesforce board at the very beginning. When he was denigrating the cloud, he simply was selling what he had at a time when his customer base wasn't ready to begin the herculean task of converting, whatever the benefits. That's different today with greater demands on IT and a new crop of younger leaders joining the ranks. Cloud is now cool. The Right Direction Still, cloud is not tomorrow for many businesses. Ellison's presentation was loaded with statements that suggested the conversion could take a decade. That explains why, even as it pivots, the company is very careful to bring along legacy customers by offering Infrastructure as a Service that provides half-step measures to get customers acclimated to the cloud. Another smart measure is the pending deal to acquire NetSuite -- a cloud ERP vendor with a track record of working with legacy systems to deliver most of the benefits of cloud computing without clobbering the status quo. Such dancing will be essential to Oracle's continuing success, because as we saw at the earnings call, Oracle's cloud business so far is coming much more from net new business and not from the installed base. Those customers still need convincing, and until then they need to make their current systems run well. If the keynotes did a job, it was to set up the cloud-legacy dichotomy in a positive light, forecasting a bright future with a company and partners that are prepared to nudge customers in the right direction.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals Reviews Dell XPS 13 review Hands on: Dell XPS 13 review Not yet rated By Nick Pino Laptops and netbooks  Dell's latest Kaby Lake laptop goes for (rose) gold Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Dell's refreshed XPS 13 is immaculately crafted, sports a sharp QHD+ touchscreen, Intel 7th Generation processors and a rose gold color...but opting for the premium color scheme is going to cost you. For New Intel Kaby Lake processors Svelte, sexy 11-inch form factor Ultrasharp QuadHD+ screen Against Rose gold price hike non-upgradable GPU Dell's taken a page from Apple's playbook with this year's XPS 13 model – now offering its powerful 13-inch Ultrabook in gorgeous rose gold. Sure, some might still consider the XPS series a cheap shot on Apple's MacBook Air, but this is a laptop even the team in Cupertino could learn a few lessons from. Take, for instance, the InfinityEdge Display that almost entirely eliminates the bezel, or the UltraSharp QuadHD+ screen with a stunning 3200 x 1800 resolution, just two of the many smart design decisions Dell continues to offer on this year's line-up. Oh, and Dell's got its own version of "one more thing" – the 2016 XPS 13 models are packing heat under the hood: a full range of Kaby Lake Intel processors. If this isn't the MacBook killer, I don't know what is. Design If the XPS 15 series is a butcher's knife – all business and cuts straight to the chase – the XPS 13 is the butterfly knife; it's slimmer and sleeker, but no less effective in the right hands. The non-touch version of the XPS 13 measures in at 0.33 x 11.98 x 7.8 inches (9 x 304 x 200mm; H x W x D), while the touch version comes in at a slightly larger 0.6 x 11.98 x 7.8 inches (15 x 304 x 200mm; H x W x D). At half an inch thick, the XPS 13 is in the running for the smallest laptop on the market. Smallest, but not slimmest. The HP Spectre holds that honor with its skeleton-thin 10.4mm-thick screen. But even if it doesn't quite claim the top spot, this year's model is as thin and light as it's ever been. Weight-wise, the XPS 13 is a totable 2.7 pounds (1.2kg). It's something you could toss in a bag between classes or take with you on your next business trip and barely notice it's there. (That said, it's probably for the best if you cover your new investment with a case just to be safe.) The screen itself is Dell's new InfinityEdge Display. Images go nearly to the edge of the screen with only a thin strip of plastic separating the glass from the edge. The distance separating the two, for the record, is a measly 5.2mm. The XPS 13 can be outfitted with an UltraSharp QuadHD+ screen with a brilliant 3,200 x 1,800 resolution, capable of displaying 2.5 times the number of pixels than a Full HD display. It's all shown on a 400 nit screen, making it as bright as the average LCD LED TV. But, if touch isn't your thing, there's also a standard FHD (1920 x 1080) InfinityEdge display as well. Looking at inputs, Dell's definitely taken to Apple's minimalist approach. All said, there are only two USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, a headphone jack, a lock slot and one USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port. If that port configuration sounds familiar, it's because it's almost identical to the inputs available on this year's MacBook Air, with the only exception being that the Dell XPS uses Thunderbolt 3 for faster 10GB/s file transfers. Then there's the fully backlit keyboard surrounded by a carbon fiber palm rest and precision touchpad. The keys felt comfortably spaced and the pad spacious enough to poke, pull and prod without feeling cramped – something that can be a real problem on 13-inch laptops working with limited real estate. Last up is the HD webcam that Dell snuck into the lower righthand corner of the XPS 13's display. It's strange placement to be sure and seems, to an outsider, like it was the sacrifice the team made in order to keep the bezel as trim as possible along the top of the screen. Performance and specs The exterior is nice, but there's no correlation between a carbon fiber palm rest and how well programs like Photoshop and Adobe Premier are going to run. Thankfully, to run those programs as smoothly as possible, the XPS 13 rocks Intel's 7th Generation Kaby Lake Core processors – the Intel Core i3-7100U processor that has a 3M Cache, up to 2.4 GHz; Intel Core i5-7200U processor with a 3M Cache, up to 3.1 GHz and Intel Core i7-7500U processor with a 4M Cache, up to 3.5 GHz. It's a decent assortment that should appease both the web surfing, word processing crowd and the power users alike. Memory options include 4GB, 8GB and 16GB Dual Channel LPDDR3 SDRAM running at 1866MHz, while on the storage side of things you can pick from a 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB PCIe SSD. (Can't decide how to build out your machine? It depends what your needs are, but 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD should see you through the next three or four years just fine.) Let's talk graphics for a second. Here's where the Dell XPS 13 could run into a problem. If you're looking to do anything more than light gaming on the XPS 13, you might have to look somewhere else – while Kaby Lake promises a number of advantages, the on-board Intel HD Graphics 620 GPU probably isn't going to hold a candle compared to a proper dedicated Nvidia mobile GPU. That said, every app I saw running on Windows 10 looked gorgeous on the QHD+ display. While most versions of the XPS 13 will ship with Windows 10, Dell also offers a developer edition of the series that trades out Microsoft's operating system for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and shaves $50 off the sticker price – a good deal if you're, say, a computer science student looking to cut some costs or working at a startup that's short on cash. The last stop on our tour of the specs sheet is the new Killer 1535 Wireless-AC 2x2 network card that supports Bluetooth 4.1 that offers two external 5GHz signal amplifiers to improve your performance at longer distances and boosts speeds to 867mbps. So all these components and 400 nit screen must mean that the XPS 13 has a shortened battery life, right? Wrong. Dell says that you can expect up to 22 hours from the 2016 models with the FHD screen or around 13 hours from a single charge on the QHD+ panel, thanks in no small part to the new processors and reduced physical space. Worth its weight in (rose) gold? Until now, I've carefully avoided talking about price. That's not done in an attempt to disguise the final cost of the machine, but more importantly I wanted to give myself enough space to talk about its value-to-dollar ratio. The silver edition of the XPS 13 starts at $799 (about £610, AU$1,060) for the base configuration out there. But to get the rose gold model you'll have to shell out at least $1,149 (about £880, AU$1,520). The rose gold version does have a few upgrades on top of the gilded exterior, but the price of admission is still higher than most Ultrabooks. Colors are nice, but is rose gold really worth an extra $350? We can't be that addicted to this whole rose gold fad. Can we? For $799 the price is right. The XPS 13 is a well-oiled, well-spec'd machine that emphasizes processor power for the most frequent tasks like web browsing. Loaded up with the right components, the XPS 13 is a workhorse that could theoretically last the next few years without suffering any massive slowdown – though I'll need to put it through its paces before I can make that call with any authority. Early verdict The Dell XPS 13 squeezes a 13-inch laptop – packed to the gills with the latest Kaby Lake hardware and stunning QuadHD+ display – into an 11-inch form factor. It's a feat of engineering and worthy of all the praise we've given it these last few years. To that end, this year's models are just as svelte as their predecessors but they have the added bonus of extra processing power and a beautiful – if somewhat overpriced – rose gold exterior. The Dell XPS 13 with Intel 7th Generation Processors goes on sale October 4 and starts at $799 for the silver version, $1,149 for the rose gold version and $949 for the developer edition that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | September 19, 2016 -- 20:44 GMT (13:44 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry Intel said Monday that Bob Swan has been named the company's next chief financial officer. Swan will take over for Stacy Smith, who's switching to another role leading Intel's manufacturing, sales, and operations teams, on Oct. 10. Smith was Intel's CFO for nine years.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said Swan brings "financial acumen and strategic insight" to the executive leadership team as the company continues its transformation efforts. Earlier this year, the tech giant announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs -- or nearly 11 percent of its workforce -- as part of a major restructure prompted by the decline in PC sales and other hardware. At the time, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he believed Intel could transform from a PC company to "a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices" by focusing on technology for connected things, memory, Moore's Law, and cloud. Last week, Intel increased its third quarter revenue forecast, citing an expected turnaround in the PC market prompted by the replenishment of PC supply chain inventory.

The world's largest chipmaker said earlier this year that Smith, who has been Intel's chief financial officer for nearly a decade, would shift to a new role. Swan, 56, joins from private equity firm General Atlantic and will oversee global finance and IT organizations, as well as corporate strategy office, Intel said on Monday. He will take up his new role, effective Oct. 10. Swan, who also served as eBay Inc's chief financial officer, left after the company spun off PayPal Holdings Inc last year. Intel raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years on Friday as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. The company's shares were unchanged in aftermarket trading on Monday. They closed down 1.3 percent at $37.16.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 19, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: Intel.  On Sept. 16, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced an upward revision to the financial guidance that it provided back in July. The company says that it now expects revenue of $15.6 billion for its third quarter (give or take $300 million), up from a prior forecast of $14.9 billion (plus or minus $500 million), as a result of "replenishment of PC supply chain inventory". Intel said that in addition to the inventory dynamics, it is "also seeing some signs of improving [personal computer] demand".  The good news expands beyond revenue as well. The company is raising its gross profit margin guidance from 60% to 62%. Intel attributes this improvement mainly to "higher PC unit volume". And finally, the company says that its operating expenses will now come in at "approximately $5.2 billion", a slight increase from previous guidance of $5.1 billion. Let's take a closer look at what's going on here. PC inventories apparently lighter than expected Intel doesn't sell personal computers directly to consumers. Instead, it sells key components (mainly processors) to personal computer vendors. Those vendors then take these components and integrate them into complete systems that are sold to end users. Those vendors need to keep inventories of both components as well as completed systems in order to be able to satisfy customer orders in a timely fashion. For example, if Joe Public goes to the Dell website and places an order for a new system, Dell needs to already have the components around to build the system that Joe ordered. Those system vendors need to make their "best guesses" as to the kind of demand that they will see for personal computers -- those demand forecasts almost certainly inform Intel's production and sales plans, which is how the chip giant is able to provide reasonably solid quarterly sales guidance to investors. What appears to be going on here is that the personal computer vendors found themselves with lower inventory levels of components/personal computers than they would like. As a result, they have seemingly ordered more processors from the chipmaker in a bid to bring their own inventory levels up to better support the demand that they expect for their products.  Why is margin guidance up? In addition to the better-than-expected PC processor sales, Intel also guided gross profit margins up, which obviously helps to amplify the profit growth that higher revenues at flat margins would have brought. Intel attributes the margin increase to higher personal computer chip sales volumes. One point that might be a little confusing to some is why margins would actually go up with revenue, but it's not too hard to understand. Remember that Intel owns and operates its own chip manufacturing factories and that the vast majority of the chips that the company produces are targeted at personal computers. To build and equip these factories, Intel needs to make significant capital investments. The cost of these factories flows through to Intel's financial results in the form of depreciation. The depreciation essentially shows up as part cost of goods sold, or COGS. Recall that gross profit margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross profit (which itself is calculated by subtracting COGS from net revenue) by total revenue. The depreciation costs that Intel incurs in a given quarter are essentially fixed, and that cost is spread out across the number of chips that the company ships in a given quarter. They're also a significant portion of Intel's total cost of sales, as the slide below illustrates: Image source: Intel.  If Intel is able to ship more chips than it had previously expected, then that depreciation cost is spread out over a greater number of units. This means that the effective cost to manufacture each chip is lower, leading to better gross profit margins. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

GoLINC will connect all devices on the network Simple web interface. GoLINC's user interface provides the user with the ability to navigate and manage any configuration Durability. GoLINC is able to survive even when the trains are passing through harshest environments. Ability to interface with Locomotive Data Acquisition Recording System (LDARS). LDARS features a crash-hardened memory system, to protect data in the event of an accident. GE Transportation began working on smart trains in 2014, with a set of software solutions. The company plans to continue developing new smart train capabilities in order to "extend locomotive life, lower fuel consumption, decrease emissions, increase velocity and improve operating ratios," according to the press release. GE's 21,000 locomotives, located in more than 50 countries worldwide, will all eventually connect using Predix. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers On Monday, GE Transportation and Intel Corp. unveiled a "superbrain" platform solution that turns freight trains into mobile data centers. These smart trains will operate with the GoLINC platform, which provides processing, wireless communication, data storage, and video capacity.

(LXRX) INTC, WD and LXRX stock are signalling breakout potential Sep 19, 2016, 9:56 am EST  |  By Johnson Research Group     Investors are going to spend much of the week waiting on the Federal Reserve for the decision on interest rates before committing new monies to the market. The question of whether rates will go higher is all consuming for many, but those of us watching the technicals and trends already have an idea of the stocks we want to hold regardless of what Janet Yellen says later this week. Large cap technology and pharmaceutical companies continue to have favorable cash flow as traders are migrating monies away from the dividend paying sectors. Today, we look at three companies benefiting from that cash flow: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX). Intel Corporation (INTC) Along with other large cap technology stocks, Intel has undergone a fundamental turnaround increasing the demand for their chips and technology. INTC took a jump higher Friday as the company raised earnings guidance and now we’re looking at a situation where the analyst community is going to start fueling prices even higher. This morning, Intel shares have already received one upgrade in price. With only 57% of the analysts on Wall Street recommending INTC stock as a buy, we also expect to see a number of upgrades. 8 International Stocks Priced to Beat the U.S. Intel shares jumped above their top Bollinger Band on Friday on heavy volume. The move strengthens an already strong momentum trend for the stock, as INTC shares have support from short- and intermediate-term trendlines, as well as a strong moving average convergence divergence. The move shifts Intel into a new bullish trend that is likely to move faster than the market, as the analyst community raises its outlook. This is even more likely to happen as INTC breaks above the $38 level, which would mark new highs for the stock since the 2000. Western Digital Corp (WDC) Western Digital stock moved lower from the $55 level after its last earnings report. Now, WDC stock is poised to cross back above this mark, which will grab the attention of technical traders. In addition, we’ve just seen a very bullish crossover of trendlines that should paint a bullish intermediate-term outlook. First, the $55 level has been resistance for Western Digital shares. The last time we saw WDC stock try to break above this point, it stumbled at resistance from its 200-day moving average. This time around, the 200-day is below the stock and actually poised for potential support. In addition, the 20- and 50-day moving averages for WDC just completed bullish crossovers, indicating that the bullish trend for the shares is growing stronger. Historically, this intermediate-term bullish signal precedes outperformance of the shares against the market. The current technical picture looks to be lifting resistance for Western Digital shares and opening-up a target price of $60. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LXRX) Another sector of the dividend cash migration is big Pharma. Pharmaceuticals took a beating earlier in the year, as the presidential candidates signaled that they may take on the Phama industry over pricing issues. The political rhetoric has died down, leaving a number of undervalued stocks that are making technical improvements. Apple Inc. (AAPL): How the iPhone Changed the World, 10 Years Later Lexicon shares jumped off the charts earlier in the month on positive news regarding one of its drug trials. LXRX stock has consolidated since then in preparation for what appears to be another rally higher. The 20- and 50-day trendlines of Lexicon Pharmaceuticals just shifted into a bullish trend, as both are ascending and the 20-day has crossed above the 50-day. Historically, these patterns result in better-than-average performance for the drug maker that should attract more technical buyers. LXRX stock will face a critical test soon as it approaches the $20 level. This mark has provided chart resistance for the shares before and may trigger some profit taking. A move above $20 will convince the technicians that the longer-term trend favors even more upside for Lexicon, drawing even more buyers into the mix. As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

If all the focus goes into the high-end, it is easy to get complacent, or living in a technology hub can feel like a bubble. This is why several times a year I wander through the local Brick and Mortar retailer to see what is on offer to users that simply walk in off the street to buy a tablet, notebook, or a casual £99 Bluetooth speaker purchase, as what happened this week. I'm in the UK, so our sole brick and mortar option is typically PCWorld, however it emulates Best Buy in a number of ways. What I Had Noticed Before Looking through the arrays of notebooks and laptops on offer, prior to my recent visit this week, it was very clear that pickings for AMD processors were very thin. Since the demise of netbooks, and Intel's Ultrabook strategy, almost all AMD offerings on shelves were restricted to a single unit, or under 1 in 20 on the show floor, and typically a budget device with low-quality displays, track pads, and build quality. Part of this, as I learned when a sales executive took me through a Best Buy in the US, is due to marketing in the store itself. Companies can invest in aisles all to themselves at a retailer at select stores or nationwide, or if there is an overriding feature that several companies share, they can invest in an aisle together under the feature heading. Aside from the aisles, there are end caps, pre-fabricated displays, video walls, and all manner of possibilities. Some users will be familiar with store-in-store elements from Samsung or Apple, where they pay for dedicated floorspace and dedicated salesmen to be trained in solely their product. Closer to the front door of the store costs more, too. Due to the way that these brick and mortar locations sell their internal space, those with big marketing budgets have an advantage, as well as investment from OEMs (like Intel, HP) as a bonus for large volume component purchases. It ends up being a sizeable investment to in-store sales, and more eyeballs end up on potential halo products like an Omen, an Alienware or a Zenbook. There's also an added factor, albeit anecdotal, that it might be common for sales staff to not suggest brands that have been commonly associated with low-performance in the past. Understandably, AMD has a roughshod time at this. Due to their well-documented size and budgets, being able to assist their major partners in store-focused placement is fairly difficult. Their major partners are HP and Lenovo, so with that in mind those budgets may be very region focused for some hardware configurations for sure. It's also difficult to train store staff in the hardware without investing in the shop floor as well, unless they already have a sizeable interest in the specific market. Despite that 1 in 20 figure, which has been generous in most cases (including the Best Buy right near AMD's Austin office, or the Fry's in Sunnyvale), smaller retailers that go after the second-hand market seem to have had a better ratio than that. Speaking to a few of these retailers on Tottenham Road in London, the £200 second hand AMD APU-based notebooks get a sizeable interest from students on a shoestring budget, if only for mild gaming and LAN gaming (using pen and paper is still fairly common in UK universities in lectures, apparently). These retailers tend to sell a number of low-end devices, such as Pentium, i3, A6 and A8-based with HD/900p TN panels, which might not be a sizeable representation when we normally discuss new sales, but indicates that a number of users are still cost-driven in that price range. So Why This News Post, What's Changed? Earlier this year we posted a lengthy discussion about AMD Carrizo based notebooks, and how there was a disconnect between AMD, OEMs, and repeat business through positive user experience enabled via smarter hardware decisions. We received a lot of feedback from that, especially identifying that Carrizo as a base processor offered reasonable performance when applied with the right companion hardware. As part of the launch with the 7th Generation platform after our discussions, they had said that they had worked closer with their key partners to enable better configurations to drive experiences, along with better strategies for getting eyes on the hardware. With that in mind...  Typically a tech journalist's week has a few meetings, perhaps a prebrief or two, and it just so happened that a VP for an unrelated company was in London, we met nearby and we talked shop. On the way out, I ran some errands and spent some time in PCWorld. I wasn't expecting to see much - it's a small store with Apple in the front and TVs in the rear, and the selection they tend to have across their 20-30 notebooks is barely mid-range, with one or two exceptions. So expect my surprise when I found five AMD notebooks in that set, with one out of the three desktops on show being the OEM version of the A10-7860K. These weren't old systems either - four of the notebooks where the new AMD 7th Generation APU (two Bristol Ridge, two Stoney Ridge), with one being 6th Gen (Carrizo-L). #1: Lenovo Yoga 510, £430 The first one that popped out near the front of the shop was the Stoney Ridge device, spotting a large 'AMD 7th Gen' sticker. This was a Lenovo Yoga 510, with a touchscreen and 360-degree hinge, being marketed as a 2-in-1. Under the hood was an A9-9410, which is a single module 25W AMD APU using 2nd Generation Excavator modules, with a 2.9 GHz base and 3.5 GHz turbo. It has 192 streaming processors at a base 800 Mhz (more when there's headroom), but because it is Stoney Ridge there's only access to single channel memory. At least Lenovo paired it with 8GB of DDR4-2133, which is eminently better than a 4GB option. The 14-inch 1366x768 TN panel from AUO was dire, even from a minute or two with bad viewing angles, and storage came via a 1TB Western Digital mechanical drive. WiFi was at least 802.11ac, albeit 1x1 from the QCA9377 controller.  CPU-Z showed that the silicon was the ST-A0 stepping, which suggests that AMD did a relatively good job during tapeout. Unfortunately CPU-Z 1.77 doesn't seem fully geared for * Ridge laptops (a point worth noting later), but the benchmark gave 987 for single thread and 1741 in multithread. Not having used the CPU-Z benchmark seriously before (and there not being that much a store will let you run with free will), but a cursory glance online puts the FX-6300 at 1152, and a stock i7 920 gets a score of 998 for single threaded performance.  #2: HP Envy 15 x360, £630 Interestingly I had originally walked past this. All the AMD official logos had been removed from the keyboard and specification list beside the notebook, which struck me as a little odd. HP is arguably AMD's biggest partner for notebooks, with the Envy and Omen being two of the most premium devices for Bristol Ridge that have been announced. Part of me might suspect this is for a reason, or it could just be a case of Hanlon's Razor and someone forgot/they weren't ready.  The Envy was the most expensive AMD notebook on display, offering a typical HP premium design ID with a near-top line A12-9700P under the hood. This uses two 2nd Gen Excavator modules for four threads, a configuration called Bristol Ridge, and runs at 2.5 GHz base with 3.4 GHz turbo on the cores. The A12 ensures the 'R7' name on the integrated GPU, but this has 384 SPs (6 CUs) rather than the full compliment, and it runs at 758 MHz for a total of 15W TDP on the processor. HP paired the SoC with 8GB of DDR4 memory, although we were unable to determine if this was single channel (1x8GB) or dual channel (2x4GB) as CPU-Z is not currently configured for 7th Gen detection. The system has two drives - a 128GB SSD from an unknown vendor as a boot drive and a 1TB mechanical storage drive from HGST. The panel was a clear 1080p IPS, and the track pad was certainly larger than I had expected. Internal Wi-Fi is a 2x2 solution using Intel's 802.11ac 7265 controller.     One thing worth noting is that this was the only system with a Type-C connector. This is USB, and based on the logo seems to be a USB 2.0 implementation. #3: HP Pavilion, £400 In the more budget section of the store were two systems, but I essentially passed over this design from HP. It uses an A9, implying Stoney Ridge and 1x8 GB of single channel DDR4-2133. This came with a 2TB mechanical drive, and looks very similar to previous HP Pavilion systems.  Further to the other HP system, this was also devoid of any AMD logos.  #4: Lenovo Ideapad 310, £350 However the Ideapad 310 intrigued me. It was the cheapest model on display, cheaper than both the Stoney Bridge models, but came with a 15W Bristol Ridge A10-9600P, a dual module/quad thread design running at 2.4 GHz/3.3 GHz. The APU has support for dual channel DDR4-1866, and I'd half expect this 8GB model only had one memory module, but the rear of the device had a large enough section for users to add in their own memory. The APU also has a 384 SPs (6 CU) design for graphics, running at 720 MHz. Other specifications include an Intel 802.11ac module, an integrated DVD drive, a 1080p screen (unfortunately TN) and a 1TB mechanical SATA storage drive for £350. There have been instances in the past where an OEM uses a bargain basement design, but sticks in the high-end processor (Like the 9800) as a big 'wow' factor, but the cooling and the build quality gives the game away after a few days of use. Nonetheless, part of me feels that another $20 on an IPS panel would actually provide a good experience, as long as the design supports dual channel memory. If that's the case, I'd stick in 32gb of what I have lying around, a spare 1TB SSD, and it would be a nicely workable system for Anandtech on the road. Maybe that's just me.  #5: A HP 550-103NA Desktop, £500 When AMD launched the Kaveri Refresh line of processors, sometimes known as Godavari, alongside the number of consumer-focused processors was a line of OEM-only parts. The consumer line was the 7000 series, whereas the OEM line was the 8000 series, but fundamentally it was the same silicon and same set of specifications, except the OEM-only parts were designed for the HPs, Dells, Lenovos and other system integrators with different support packages therein. For the UK at least, these tend to be online only purchases, at least anecdotally from my experience any AMD desktop in a brick and mortar store tends to be AMD FX based on the AM3+ platform. So I was quite surprised to see an AMD Kaveri Refresh system in a HP desktop with a reasonable design ID. The system on display used the 65W A10-8750, the OEM equivalent of the A10-7860K, combined with an R5 330 discrete graphics card as a dual graphics solution (512 SPs at from the APU, 320 SPs from the discrete card). It's a slightly lopsided configuration, aimed mainly at supporting multiple screens or different connection types.   The system had 8 GB of DRAM, and I was able to barely see into the case to confirm it was in two memory modules for dual channel operation. Storage on the system was marketed as a 2TB drive, however the system did have a 128GB SSD as a boot drive as well. Interestingly while looking through the side vents in the system, I noticed that the motherboard had been put in upside down but also reversed, similar to the Corsair 600Q that we recently reviewed. There are many reasons for this, and I asked if we could open the case up so I could see inside. Unfortunately after asking the floor manager, I was told that opening the case would break the warranty, so I wasn't able to get a better look in the internals, but it was certainly interesting to see these OEM systems on the shop floor. So You Saw Some AMD Systems, So What? As a pure observation, the fact that my singular trip showed a greater proportion of AMD designs available for eyeballs on a shop floor is an anecdotal indicator that AMD's OEMs are being bolder and/or more confident with their AMD designs. Sure, none of the ones I saw were absolute stunner systems, with a peak value of 650GBP ($717 pre-tax) and none in a real ultrabook/XPS13 style, but the numbers and variety shows a marked change in what a consumer can see when they visit a store. I spoke with the store rep who shadowed me during my visit, and I asked whether people were actively interested in any AMD systems. He replied that there was no specific interest, unless gaming was an aspect. It's worth noting that the PCWorld didn't have any of the usual MSI/Acer gaming notebooks on display, so the best gaming laptops on show would have been the products using AMD APUs. It sounded as if the only reason a laptop with an AMD APU would be actively promoted if the customer specifically said gaming was a priority. It's an interesting take, and one that AMD would gladly take. The store rep picked my brain a bit about the state of the industry, and what we might expect in the future. I recanted what we've learned over the last few weeks about Kaby Lake and Zen, as well as a little bit of VR discussion. Compared to some previous store reps I've spoken with, even though he wasn't up to speed with the absolute latest, he certainly knew about specific processors, graphics cards and general perceptions of the big OEM players in that space. Kudos to Raj, it was a fun half hour!  With regards Zen notebooks in the future, Lisa Su mentioned during an August presentation that after the launch of the high-end desktop parts and AMD in servers, notebooks are expected in the second half of 2017, or essentially 12 months away. I suspect during Computex and/or IFA next year, we might start to see some interesting Zen designs for notebooks. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

In high end gaming laptops , if they use an interposer for GPU+HBM, they might as well add a CPU die too. A huge APU doesn't seem doable with dual channel DDR4.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 18, 2016 New Part Day: A Truly Secure Workstation 86 Comments by: Brian Benchoff September 19, 2016 There is a chain of trust in every modern computing device that starts with the code you write yourself, and extends backwards through whatever frameworks you’re using, whatever OS you’re using, whatever drivers you’re using, and ultimately whatever BIOS, UEFI, Secure Boot, or firmware you’re running. With an Intel processor, this chain of trust extends to the Intel Management Engine, a system running independent of the CPU that has access to the network, USB ports, and everything else in the computer. Needless to say, this chain of trust is untenable. Any attempt to audit every line of code running in a computer will only be met with frustration. There is no modern Intel-based computer that is completely open source, and no computer that can be verified as secure. AMD is just as bad, and recent attempts to create an open computing platform have met with frustration. [Bunnie]’s Novena laptop gets close, but like any engineering task, designing the Novena was an exercise in compromise. You can get around modern BIOSes, coreboot still uses binary blobs, and Libreboot will not be discussed on Hackaday for the time being. There is no modern, completely open, completely secure computing platform. They’re all untrustworthy. The Talos Secure Workstation, from Raptor Engineering, an an upcoming  Crowd Supply campaign is the answer to the untrustworthiness of modern computing. The Talos is an effort to create the world’s first libre workstation. It’s an ATX-compatible motherboard that is fully auditable, from schematics to firmware, without any binary blobs. RISC architecture is going to change everything. ‘Secure’ isn’t a word you would use in conjunction with a modern Intel processor, and AMD is just as bad. Most ARM processors are out, because there are binary blobs floating around even when the processor isn’t tied up in NDAs. Even graphics are hard to make secure, and while open source GPUs exist, they’re not exactly powerhouses. To make a computer fully secure, you’ll have to go outside the usual architectures, and the market for a secure computer simply isn’t there to warrant a completely new architecture, anyway. For the Talos, Raptor Engineering chose IBM’s POWER8 processor. This architecture is now most common in computing that has a few more zeros on the price tag than what Microcenter offers, but historically the POWER line can be traced back through the CELL processor, the GameCube, and [Zero Cool]’s sweet clear laptop. The rest of the hardware includes 8 DDR3 slots supporting 256GB of RAM, 2 x16 PCIe slots, 4 x8 PCIe slots, one legacy PCI slot, an internal mPCIe slot, 8 internal SATA 6Gb ports, 2 external eSATA 6Gb ports, 1 HDMI port, 8 USB 3.0 ports, 2 external and 2 internal RS232 ports, and an internal GPIO header. The full list of specifications and supported operating systems is available on the Raptor Engineering website. It should be noted this is not the only POWER8 motherboard available. Tyan produces a POWER8 server motherboard, although it is not as open as the Talos. Even with the Talos, there are some restrictions on how open and secure it actually is; thanks to NDAs, some of the PCIe subsystem is not auditable. Although the Crowd Supply campaign is not live yet, we know the cost of an entry-level Talos system with an 8-core 130W TDP POWER8 CPU will come in at about $5,300. A standalone board less CPU will be available for about $4,000, according to Raptor Engineering. That’s pricey, but not terrible when it comes to high performance enterprise workstations. You’re paying for security and auditability here, and we hope Talos is a success, if only to prove there is a market for truly secure computing.

Of course we don’t actually know they ARE, but we don’t know they AREN’T. And that’s about as close as you’ll get, I think. What does the NSA buy for their servers? Don’t tell me, it’s a secret. Report comment Reply Jaakko Salo says: September 19, 2016 at 6:33 am Auditability of all schematics and code are stated here as what would give Talos “better security”. Oh wait, but not really because the PCIe subsystem is *still* not auditable. In any case, one could say all of this is BS because someone, somewhere, will eventually have to *produce* the hardware, and that actor is very unlikely to be the end user who actually uses the hardware. The manufacturer themselves are still to be trusted no matter how open the code and schematics are. Report comment Reply siluxmedia says: September 19, 2016 at 4:16 pm Purchasers will be provided with 150hours of uninterrupted footage from various angles of the manufactoring processes.

Report comment Reply John says: September 30, 2016 at 3:01 pm That’s why they also include footage of all the ICs being designed and manufactured as well as driven to the assembly plant. Also video footage of rectal probing for all employees to ensure they aren’t hiding any counterfeit chips. Report comment M says: September 20, 2016 at 8:59 am Well, see that’s the thing. Having the schematics and code, someone out in the community can check up on them. People can trace pathways, decap chips, and dump roms. It’s a pain in the butt, sure, but you don’t have to have *every* user do it, just enough of them to catch issues. That’s the kind of mechanism that drives open-source’s reliability. (as for the PCIe subsystem, someone’s figure out a hack to disable it if you really want, probably with a pair of pliers) Report comment Reply anon says: September 19, 2016 at 4:40 am “A standalone board less CPU will be available for about $4,000 […]” I think this can easily be misread as “A standalone boardless CPU” (a CPU without a board), which is backward, as far as I know the pricing. Report comment Reply Greenaum says: September 19, 2016 at 5:25 pm That’s what I thought it meant. “Let’s eat grandpa”. Commas are important! “A standalone board, less CPU, etc etc”. Or could have used “without a CPU”. Report comment Reply Galane says: September 19, 2016 at 7:52 pm Or just use without instead of less.

I’ve known quite a few people in exactly her situation, transitioning, generally really good, nice people.

You know autistics are over-represented among people who claim to be the other gender. And the entirety of people who claim to be the 58 fictional genders. It’s part of their basic lack of understanding of social stuff, they get the wrong end of the stick about men and women, and think that some thing or other makes them “really” a woman (or less often, a man). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuZFThlOiJI has some good stuff about this toward the end. I have more respect for people who just want to be, say, a woman, and get on with it, and then try their best to live as women. But some people just want to be transgender, as if it’s an end, not a means. There’s always been attention-seeking fuckwits. And it’s a shame because they generally make the cause they’re appropriating look like a bunch of idiots. Any old bigot can point to half a dozen loonies, and they’re the easiest ones to find, the loudest, and claim that they represent the group as a whole. Same thing applies to Muslims, actually. But these idiots don’t actually care about the cause or group they’re supposed to be defending. Because it’s all just part of some malfunctioning psychology. Still the way certain persons like to rig the argument so that dissent is impossible, and disagreeing with someone is denying them their right to *exist* (?!?!?), as well as bullying, terrorism, and arson in a naval dockyard, makes them impossible to get sense out of. Which is fine by them. You also see the same thing in religious fundamentalists. Quick to resort to shit-throwing and claiming they’re being oppressed and mistreated, just because everyone doesn’t agree with their arbitrary notions on how the world is. The discussion on the Internet, which we’re not having here, seems to be that this person is, basically, mad and an attention whore. Does their cause no good. Sensible people know not to take the loonies as representative of the whole, but there’s always been a shortage of sensible people. And politics in a wider sense has gone right down the toilet, so calm reason and rationality is not something you’ll ever hear in the media or politics. Report comment Reply RÖB says: September 19, 2016 at 6:01 pm I am very surprised about what you say regarding autism and gender identity. All those who I have cared for, and who may be described as autistic, have been pre-teen or adolescent so I have no grounds to argue the matter. So I will stick to what I do know. Autism is a spectrum which we all exist on. It’s a quality that all humans have to some degree. Did you know that in the early days NASA employed autistic mathematicians because their attention to detail meant that would not make the mistakes more average people do. Autism is a difference to average and it has attributes that are an advantage over an average person and some attributes that make life a harder – mostly through non-acceptance. Report comment Dax says: September 20, 2016 at 1:09 am “Autism is a spectrum which we all exist on.” No it’s not. It’s not like some sort of Kinsey scale of social awkwardness. It’s an actual developmental issue that results in typical symptoms and traits. Just because “neurotypicals” sometimes exhibit some of those same traits to varying degrees doesn’t mean they’re a little bit autistic – any more than having a bit of a cough means you’re slightly turberculotic. Those on the spectrum have actual neurological and developmental issues, those “on the spectrum” (often self-diagnosed) are simply put there by correlating a checklist from the DSM without proper diagnosis. Report comment Dax says: September 20, 2016 at 1:28 am “You know autistics are over-represented among people who claim to be the other gender.” You’re mistaking cause and effect: self/mis-diagnosed autists are prevalent in any group of people who are narcissistic/egomanic because it is a convenient excuse for acting poorly in relation to other people. Autism does involve difficulties in developing what’s called a “theory of other minds”, where a child at some point of growing up realizes that other people have minds of their own, which leads to a kind of self-centered intuition about the world, but this is not the same thing. Gender dysphoria is all about the person’s self-image much like with anorexia or compulsive body modification through cosmetic surgery, or the desire to be amputated, and so transgenders tend to be or become highly self-centered, sometimes to the point of solipsism, as they battle with their mental illness – and it is a mental illness. Aside from people born with ambiguous genitalia and other actual cogenital issues, people who simply suffer from the desire to change gender can be effectively treated with antipsychotics. The only problem is that transgenderism isn’t politically considered to be a mental illness, so the people with gender dysphoria can’t get proper treatment. Instead of giving them antipsychotics, people try to accomodate their illness and even let them get cut up and put them on hormone replacement treatments, which doesn’t end up nice because the underlying mental illness doesn’t go away and the people often end up killing themselves. Report comment Dax says: September 20, 2016 at 2:11 am Twin-studies have shown gender dysphoria to be heritable – that is to say of biological cause – about 60% of the time. That means a bit less than half of the transgenders out there are not genuinely so, but suffering from some kind of psychosis or other issue that is not helped by everyone pretending that Tom is Jane or vice versa. The crazy transgenders are often actually schitsophrenic – the reason they think they’re the other gender, or what they think is “other gender” and what that means to them, is a cognitive distortion, and those can be any odd association or behaviour, such as a person who thinks “the number three is listening because it has a nose”. It’s a sort of cognitive synesthesia – mixing of thought and meaning – or commonly known as having your wires crossed. It doesn’t necessarily need to make any sense, and usually there’s more than one such distortion which makes these people generally difficult and unpleasant to interact with. And then there are the transtrenders, who claim to be transgenders without any offical diagnosis simply to gain attention. Being attention seekers, they’re again narcissistic/egomanical and ultimately unpleasant to interact with.

Ability to not engage in emotionally-loaded discussions which are not based on arguments supported by facts is, in my opinion, the very basic skill any tech person possess.

Why would be such skill suddenly lost when, %deity forbid, the topic changes from tech to whatever else? Personally, whenever i am dealing with either a physical piece of equipment or software, i have zero interest in sexual, culinary or fashion -related inclinations of the person who made the thing. On the other hand, whenever i am out in the bar in search of non-procreation-aimed sex, those topics become relevant and programming//machining skills are not. But that’s me.

On that issue, was it Sprite_tm who managed to run Linux ON a hard disk? On the disk’s own ARM controller chip? Yeah there’s only so much you can trust. Stuff like encryption can help, where it’s done as close to the user as possible so only encrypted data, worthless to spies, gets passed through most of the levels of the system. Open source BIOSes are a good start. The other stuff can come in time. FPGAs might offer a nice option, bringing custom hardware into ordinary people’s reach, so stuff like NICs and maybe even SSD controllers can be brought back into the ownership of the guy who actually paid for the machine. SSDs in particular are nice, since writing custom code to run a mechanical hard drive is gonna be a bit of an effort. SSDs in comparison are just memory chips, well understood, so with copies of the right specs a bespoke full-custom SSD isn’t beyond the abilities of alpha-level hackers like Bunnie or Jeri. And then once it’s written, it can make it’s way around the world, people can check the code and compile their own hardware. Of course you have to trust the FPGA, but since they have so many uses, trying to put spy-hardware in there, for very specific and particular uses, is beyond practical I think. Since Xilinx have no idea which one of their chips is going to end up as a NIC, SSD controller, or graphics chip.

After that the first BIOS instruction executes. After BIOS comes up, microcode patches can be loaded to amend microcode to modify other housekeeping tasks.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Venkata Renduchintala is president of Intel's Client and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Credit: Qualcomm More like this Intel's siloed business units unify around IoT and connectivity Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets IBM cloud chief: The next phase of cloud is a race to add value Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel is now more than just a PC company. At industry events, the company's keynotes feature drones flying around, robots walking on stage and musicians creating tunes from wearables. The chip maker is helping BMW build an autonomous car, will sell modems to Apple and is leading the development of next-generation 5G cellular networks. For all these new markets, it will provide chip and data-center technologies. The transformation is happening partly under the leadership of Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Client and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses and Systems Architecture Group at Intel. As Intel's second-in-command, he helped cut struggling products like mobile CPUs and sharpened the company's focus on IoT, servers and connectivity. Hired from rival Qualcomm late last year, he's an outsider trying to rid Intel of its historical resistance to change. He's also bringing fresh ideas and wholesale changes to Intel, which promises to bring a new dynamic to the Silicon Valley institution. IDG News Service spoke with him on a range of topics including VR headsets, IoT, autonomous cars, competitors and the decision to cut products. This is an edited version of the discussion. IDGNS: How have you settled into your new job? What drew you to Intel? It's been a really interesting process of acclimation. It's a great mixture of feeling, like an organization where I think my experience and my interests can really help the journey [CEO] Brian [Krzanich] wants to undertake with the company. The scale at which Intel can play is probably going to be very difficult for others to match if you look across client, networking and the data center groups. The goal is to be able to think as one Intel. IDGNS: There have been questions on how you would fit into Intel, which has a closed culture and history of promoting executives internally. Many people hired from external companies haven't worked out. One thing that's really important to understand is that Intel is a company of tremendous heritage. I'm not coming in to fix anything. I'm coming in hopefully to add another dimension and an important ingredient to the management team that Brian has at his disposal. It requires me to respect what Intel has been able to achieve and the caliber of the management team and the brands assimilated. I don't think Brian hired me to maintain the status quo. I think what he wanted was a strong ingredient of outside-in thinking complementing the original thoughts. I'm feeling very comfortable now in being able to feel like I've got a good bunch of colleagues who know where I'm coming from; we can speak straight to each other and we can actually have really good discussions.  IDGNS: You had to make some decisions on cutting products Intel has worked on for years as the company's priorities were reset. How tough was it? When you come into a company you have a degree of objectivity that isn't tainted by your attachments to the genesis of certain projects. For me it was a fairly structured, objective discussion where you make decisions in a transparent and open manner. As long as you can walk people through your thinking, you can take what was very controversial and make it very logical. I'm passionate about technology but I'm also passionate about profitability and how the two are married in a seamlessly reinforcing way. IDGNS: What's the reasoning behind cutting mobile processors to focus on modems? First of all, we rationalized what we were spending our R&D on. We had a couple of mobile SoC products that I don't think were worthy to continue to conclusion. That doesn't mean to say we're no longer doing mobile platforms. On the mobile platform side, my commitment is to talk less and do more. When we have something to say we'll talk about it. On the modem side, it's a fundamental technology and this is where I think it comes down to being as indelible for us as our competence in CPU or GPU. We've set ourselves up with a very interesting road-map, but more importantly, we've established a degree of credibility, relevance and importance as a key technology partner with a number of key players in the industry that I think is really important. IDGNS: What are your top priorities and goals? I have three uber-level goals. One is to continue to drive our client computing business to a position of stable profitability in the face of a slowly declining [market]. I think we're doing well in that area. The second is to grow and scale our IoT business from something that's very interesting to something that's really substantial in the longer term. The IoT business for us is a microcosm of the entire company coming together -- we're creating a type of all-for-one, one-for-all mentality. The third is to maintain a degree of vibrancy in the technology leadership of our entire systems architecture organization. It's developing all the core technologies that really moves the competitive needle forward. IDGNS: Intel's untethered mixed-reality headset called Project Alloy was big news at IDF. What are the expectations from Alloy and how are things going? The whole point of having tetherless VR is a big deal. Everything we're doing in Alloy we're going to open-source. We can take VR and evolve it from the very rudimentary definitions today of [VR] in a smart phone that you clip into some kind of visor. You can move it to a capable, embedded PC that's driving two to three teraflops of computing and generate a really immersive experience. That was really it -- taking ideas out from the lab, productizing them, solving all those problems of integration, figuring out how RealSense and depth camera fits into all of that, figuring out how to do merged reality, and saying "now go scale the ecosystem." IDGNS: Is the VR headset the new PC? I think it's another very interesting growth opportunity for the PC. I think it can generate a specific class of products in its own right. It will generate different segmentation points and probably a custom piece of silicon built on the PC platform that amplify the use case. So we're very excited about the whole VR space. IDGNS: Intel hasn't given up on Moore's Law, though many believe it is reaching its end. How is Intel preparing for a future when manufacturing reaches atomic scale, and how will chips look beyond Kaby Lake? Nobody inside Intel is coming anywhere near the kind-of-like fatalistic conclusions about where Moore's Law is. Intel has had a stellar track record in delivering node generation like clockwork. Maybe we've moved from a two-year to a two-and-a-half-year cadence, but we already see light at the end of the tunnel. We will continue to drive process technology and nobody is calling timeout on anything. We're working hard on 7-nanometer, we're talking about pathfinding for 5-nanometer. All of that is in the throes. We made a great announcement on Kaby Lake -- that's using an evolution of 14-nanometer transistor geometry that gave a substantially improved user experience compared to Skylake. We're going to continue to do more of that as we continue to drive process leadership.  IDGNS: Are you happy with your current chip line-up -- Kaby Lake for PCs, and Atom for IoT? We have a competent portfolio of products. I'm in no way shape or form concluding they are complete and aren't going to benefit from augmentation. For me I think it's really wanting to understand the use cases a lot more. I don't see an IoT strategy for Intel being one where everything is delivered by Intel. It's integrating a number of different technologies that could be indigenous to Intel, or could be created by other companies, but managed in a way where people could look at Intel as somebody providing the overarching framework of integration. IDGNS: IoT is a big part of Intel's future. What's the strategy for that market? That's a significant business. I think we're just starting. As you see the advent of autonomous driving vehicles, you see robots and drones start to ship in scale: those are very high value opportunities for us. We characterize our IoT interests into three verticals: industrial, transportation and retail -- all of them have an end-to-end dimension where we're providing a client environment, the networking infrastructure and the data analytics platform that drives all of that through industry partnerships. IDGNS: Would in any way the ARM foundry deal help Intel achieve its goals in IoT and other areas? Would you be open to the idea of taking an ARM CPU license, as an example? Open to? Yes. My view is fairly straightforward -- that Intel's IoT plan has to not only be able to harmoniously integrate Intel-based microprocessors and MCUs, it has to be able to aggregate and harmoniously integrate a plethora of different types of MCUs, whether it be ARM-based, MIPS-based, or proprietary MCUs. All of them have the ability to monitor, sense data that they want to get on to an information highway of some kind. Our ability to [support] many different client environments is going to be a necessity in any vertical IoT strategy we have. There are many areas in the ARM ecosystem where Intel can pragmatically play in for its own benefit. I'm a big believer in paying respect to established ecosystems. IDGNS: Self-driving cars are a big deal for Intel. Could you talk about projects in the pipeline? Our goal is to provide the type of computing power that dwarfs anything that exists in a car today, but basically make it mainstream. What we're doing on our Xeon Phi processor for machine learning and deep learning, what we're doing in computer vision and also supplemented by radar and lidar. Being able to aggregate that data, generate intelligence, make decisions on it with assistance from machine and deep learning algorithms -- that's all happening as we speak. IDGNS: How do you see the autonomous car market evolving? I see the first explosive area to be in the urban transportation environment where  services like Uber and Lyft will evolve and develop. There's going to be a lot of experimentation and path-finding to do in addition to technology creation. We're probably talking about a decade away. Stamina to invest is going to be really important;  those that have the stamina to stay the course are going to win big. IDGNS: Nvidia is approaching the automotive markets aggressively with its GPUs; how will you compete? I have a great deal of respect for Nvidia. But every time I think of Nvidia, I think about Californian wine where they can make great wine but it contains only one grape -- great Cabernet Sauvignon or a great Chardonnay. I love French wines and French wines are blends where you need to be great at growing Cabernet, great at growing Merlot, great at growing Cabernet Franc. The art is in the mixture. That's the benefit Intel has. We have GPU, we have CPU, we have custom silicon, we have embedded storage, we have FPGA. Nvidia's going to basically say "I've got GPUs and I've got GPUs and I've got GPUs." Great strategy, but it doesn't give anywhere near the extensibility, flexibility and scalability that Intel is able to offer. IDGNS: How will 5G influence changes in the way devices are made and work? 5G is as much about the transformation of the network and the infrastructure as it is the client environment. [There is] going to be an even greater demand from mobile broadband bandwidth, people are going to want tens of gigabytes per second, if not hundreds of gigabytes per second. We're going to see much greater pervasiveness of client devices. If you talk about autonomous vehicles or delivering health services over a mobile network, you need to be able to make life or death decisions based on that. The network has to transform and the data center becomes a much higher order entity that's focused on massive data analytics that orchestrates that entire network.

According to investment bank Benchmark Company, Israeli signal processor designer Ceva Inc. (Nasdaq:CEVA); LSE:CVA) is "one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+." Benchmark bases its assessment on teardowns of the new Apple smartphones. Benchmark analysts Gary Mobley and Plamen Sirakov note that Apple's smartphone market share and unit sales are declining, but add that "Despite Apple's woes in the past year, many pay close attention to components used in Apple's iPhone flagship." As for Ceva, the analysts write: "It’s official! Intel is inside, and with it, so too is CEVA. For the first time, Intel’s thin modem is used in the iPhone, at least for some versions of the iPhone 7/7+. Qualcomm’s thin modem continues to be used in CDMA versions of the phone including those used on networks owned by Verizon, Sprint, most Chinese operators as well as those operated in Hong Kong and Puerto Rico, according to ChipWorks. Just as Qualcomm and Intel are splitting the thin cellular modem business with Apple, they too are splitting the associated RF and PMU content. "According to our sources and calculation, Intel and Qualcomm may split the thing modem supply 50/50-, and if true, our FY17 non-GAAP EPS estimate for CEVA would jump by as much as $0.25. To be more specific, we are modeling 50% 4G LTE royalty units growth for CEVA in FY17, and Apple alone could account for the entire delta. One must also consider tremendous growth and market share gains for CEVA-based Leadcore, Spreadtrum and Samsung LTE modems. "CEVA’s DSP IP is NOT used as part of the dual-camera image processing in the iPhone 7. However, the trend, in general, toward dual cameras should drive future licensing opportunities for CEVA and should drive design wins for CEVA’s existing 30+ vision and imaging licensees. "While teardowns available today cannot confirm this, we also believe CEVA's BT IP is being used in the AirPods. While the high price ($159), short battery life (five hours) and fear of losing the Pods may limit the unit sales potential of the AirPod, CEVA generates $0.005 in royalty per AirPod unit sold."

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Are things finally looking up for Intel Corp.? After all, the microprocessor giant’s technology has even made its way into Apple’s latest iPhones. According to reports, the chip maker is supplying a portion of the modems for Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Last week, Intel raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years, citing improving demand for PCs. The firm said in a statement that PC makers were replenishing laptop and desktop inventory, which means Intel is likely to ship out more chips. This is consistent with reports that PC shipments beat expectations in the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide PC shipments totalled 62.4 million units, a year-on-year decline of 4.5%, beating the forecast of a 7.4% fall, according to research firm International Data Corp. (IDC). Historically, most of Intel’s sales have come from the PC business. But the world’s largest chip maker has been struggling for the last few years as users shift away from PCs to mobile devices for their computing needs. Sales for the firm’s PC business, which includes chips for phones and tablets, declined 3% to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. This means Intel is looking for revenue streams outside of the core PC-based business, both globally and in India. In the PC business in India, Intel is targeting newer markets that extend beyond the large cities, to new users of technology who have not yet had access to computing so as to establish relevance of technology for these citizens. The company has collaborated with the government to make this possible – their work with CSCs has resulted in Ek Kadam Unnati Ki Aur, wherein Intel provides access to computing devices and relevant local content and training to non-urban citizens. But it is Intel’s Data Centre segment that is the crucial part of its India operations. Globally, it is the data centre business that delivers almost half of Intel’s operating margins and is expected to grow revenue at ~15% through 2018. “Our strategy is data centre architectural transformation, wherein computer, storage and network resources transform to become software defined infrastructure (SDI) that enable flexible, agile and on-demand services. We have an outstanding portfolio of products available and a very strong road map of data centre portfolio to accelerate this transformation,” said Debjani Ghosh, vice-president of the sales and marketing group and managing director of South Asia at Intel. In driving the cloud vision, Intel is collaborating with software and hardware partners including Dell, HP, Cisco, Red Hat, VMware and other local equipment manufacturers. Ghosh is optimistic about the future of Intel. She believes there are two key factors that will continue to give Intel growth opportunities in the Indian market. “First, our agility to develop products and solutions across a breadth of industry requirements. We are creating a common, flexible, industry standard architectural foundation across server, storage, and network,” says Ghosh. The second factor is local and global collaborations. Last year, Intel collaborated with C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) to train 20,000 developers over the next seven years to build applications for high performance computing, to enable India to be a part of the select league of advanced countries with the top supercomputing machines in the world.

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion (roughly Rs. 48,811 crores) in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. (Also see: Global Tablet Market Continues to Shrink: IDC) However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering.HP, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion (roughly Rs. 1,04,325 crores), plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion (roughly Rs. 99,644 crores), plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. (Also see: PC Shipments in India Declined 2.2 Percent in Q2 2016: IDC) RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Tags: Intel, IDC, HP, PC, Laptops, Tablets, Mobiles, Internet iOS 10: Ten Cool Things to Try in Apple's Latest Mobile OS Intel Raises Revenue Forecast as PC Market Improves     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Micromax Canvas Spark 4G Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » RDP ThinBook 1430B 14.1 I...

Recently it has been hinted that could be the case, but in case allusions and hints weren’t enough, a teardown conducted by the folks at Chipworks has pretty much confirmed that Intel’s modems are present on the iPhone 7. In Chipworks’ teardown, they confirm that the Intel XMM7360 modem is being used in the iPhone 7. However they note that the iPhone model that the did the teardown with was the Model A1778 version, which basically points to the GSM model, so it is unclear if the CDMA version for Sprint and Verizon will yield a similar modem. However as per our previous post, we did point out that Intel’s modem is not compatible with the CDMA standard that Sprint and Verizon are currently using, meaning that more likely than not we will still find Qualcomm’s modems in those models. It is also why Apple has yet to make the transition to Intel completely, although we guess keeping multiple suppliers so as not to be too dependent on one company is also pretty normal practice for a lot of businesses. In any case at the end of the day, this shouldn’t really affect your phone’s performance, but as WIRED points out, this is the first time an Intel mobile chip has found its way into a high-end flagship device, and given Intel’s struggle to break into the mobile scene via SoCs, perhaps modems could be its way in.

English Cafe > Tech > Samsung Samsung inches closer to top in global chip market   Published : 2016-09-19 11:21 Updated : 2016-09-19 23:55 [THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics' semiconductor business has gained growth momentum in the April-June period on the back of its robust NAND flash memory business, latest data shows. According to a report by market research firm IHS, Samsung gained a 11.3-percent market share in the global market for integrated device manufacturers, including memory and non-memory chip companies, chip design houses, and foundries, in the three-month period. The figure is the second highest, behind US chip powerhouse Intel which attained 14.7 percent market share. Samsung Electronics’ vertical NAND flash memory chip. Samsung Electronics As a result, the gap between Samsung and Intel decreased from 4 percent in the first quarter to 3.4 percent in the second quarter. The gap has been constantly dropping every year: 5.3 percent in 2012, 4.2 percent in 2013, 3.4 percent in 2014 and 3.2 percent in 2015. Samsung has been able to narrow the gap below 4 percent again in the second quarter thanks to the robust sales of its NAND flash memory chips. The Korean tech firm's NAND flash business unit saw its second-quarter sales increase 5.4 percent on-year while the NAND flash memory sales of Intel whose flagship business is still that for non-memory chips for PCs and laptops dropped 1.2 percent during the same period. Samsung’s supply of NAND memory chips for Apple’s new handsets iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and its own Galaxy Note 7 reportedly boosted its revenue in the memory chip segment. The two companies were followed by Qualcomm, Broadcom and SK hynix, which secured 4.6 percent, 4.3 percent, and 4.0 percent, respectively, in the second quarter. Although the US chip company has been ramping up its efforts to increase its presence in the global memory market, transforming its chip manufacturing factory in Dalian, China to one tailored for NAND flash chips, for example, it has not produced outstanding results in terms of sales yet. “In a bid to take the lead in the NAND flash memory market, Samsung could increase the production capacity by building more manufacturing facilities,” Hwang Min-seong, an analyst from Samsung Securities, anticipated in his recent financial report.

FDX also plans to boost rates for customers shipping large packages. “Effective 2/6/17 FedEx Express and FedEx Ground fuel surcharges will be adjusted on a weekly basis. Currently, adjustments are made on a monthly basis with a two month lag between the US Government published fuel indexes and the fuel surcharges. Adjusting on a weekly basis will reduce lag time from two months to two weeks, which provides a closer alignment between fuel costs and fuel surcharges at the time of shipment,” according to an Oppenheimer note posted by Barron’s. Tennessee-based FedEx reports earnings after the close of U.S. markets today. Tobira Therapeutics Inc (TBRA) Shares of Tobira Therapeutics Inc surged more than eight-fold on volume that was more than 35 times the daily average after Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) said it will acquire the company for $1.7 billion. That is a massive takeover premium, representing nearly 20 times TBRA’s previous market value. TBRA makes treatments for liver disease, and also focuses on therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Allergan’s offer values Tobira at $28.35, or more than six times where the stock closed yesterday. “Tobira holders also will each receive one contingent value right to receive as much as $49.84 per share, linked to certain development and regulatory milestones,” according to the Wall Street Journal. As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"We view Intel as more than just a PC company, and alternatively as a 'Moore's law' company with its ability to extract value through process leadership and the best wafer manufacturing in the world," analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note to clients Monday. "Furthermore, we recognize a large economic transfer from their PC end market to their Data Center Group, driven by explosive cloud, carrier (NFV & SDN) and HPC expansion."

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Latest News, Release Date and Rumors: Apple Laptop to Have Flatter Keyboard and Come with Bluetooth AirPods? Specs and Features By Neal A. Lasta Sep 20, 2016 | 6:51 AM Apple's much-awaited MacBook Pro 2016 is the subject of many rumors to date. The speculations range from specs to release date and so much more. Here are the latest. Specs The specifications of the newly released Apple iPhone 7 may provide hints about what the MacBook Pro might look like or how it may perform from an internal standpoint. Specifically, the iPhone 7 now uses an A10 Fusion processor instead of the Intel processors found in previous iPhones. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit As such, there is a good chance that other upcoming Apple products will use A10 Fusion chips as well, such as the MacBook Pro 2016. On the other hand, A10 Fusion chips may only work well with mobile devices like the iPhone 7, and Intel X86 processors may still be the better choice when it comes to MacBooks. The Apple iPhone 7 design doesn't include a headphone jack, and some ponder on the possibility that the MacBook Pro will botch the jack as well. Along with this, MacBook Pro 2016 users might be introduced to Bluetooth-powered AirPods. The MacBook Pro 2016 will have a flatter keyboard; on top are function keys that are displayed digitally and have the ability to change into different options depending on the application on screen. Other rumored features of the MacBook Pro 2016 include OLED touchscreen panel and Touch ID, a slimmer and lighter body, 13-inch screen, and larger trackpad that showcases Force Touch Technology. The MacBook Pro 2016 will have a USB Type-C port that has a very fast data transfer capabilities thanks to Thunderbolt 3.There will be two kinds as rumored; one that has an 8GB RAM and another that has a 16 GB RAM. Release Date Many people thought the MacBook Pro 2016 will be launched alongside the iPhone 7 last September 16. That never materialized, so the new rumors point to a new release date which falls within the last quarter of this year. However, Apple has not even provided the least bit of details regarding any plans to develop any new laptop. With Apple keeping silent about any release date or any development whatsoever, the MacBook Pro 2016 is far from being a certainty. Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reports that the new MacBook Pro will be released on October. iPad Mini 5 Other recent rumors suggest that the new MacBook Pro release this year will be followed by an iPad Mini 5 release next year. Some of its rumored features include 32 GB of storage, 3D Touch, better chipset, and A9 processor.

Stock Bounces Back After China Concerns Wane (AAPL) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) Recent Posts: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Facebook Inc (FB) stock continues to be a Wall Street darling as it received yet another price target increase on Monday. This time it comes from Citigroup Inc (C) analyst Mark May, who believes that the concerns about decelerating ad loads are overblown and that worries about Snapchat taking a bite out of Facebook are unfounded. His price target follows another positive report from Nomura Holdings, Inc. (ADR) (NMR) last week. Meanwhile executives continue to unload shares of Facebook stock as the shares move higher. Facebook Stock Price Target: $158 Citi analyst Mark May increased his price target on Facebook stock by $10 to $158 per share in a report dated September 18. He believes that it “feels like it is still early days” for the social network. However, he adds that over the last few months, investor sentiment has shifted toward the negative end of the spectrum. In order to analyze this shift, he applied his own stress test to the company. Specifically, he looked at the concerns about the potential slowdown in growth of the ad load and the threat Snapchat might pose. May believes that concerns about the impact of the expected deceleration in ad load growth on Facebook’s core ad revenue are overblown. He explained that current forecasts imply an increase of 3% to 4% or 30 basis points on ad load growth in 2017 and 2018, which he views as reasonable. He views the concerns about Snapchat are unfounded based on his analysis of third-party and company-reported data. He noted that the amount of time the average user of the core Facebook platform continues to grow and doesn’t appear to be impacted by Snapchat. The analyst cited Sensor Tower data, which was used by Nomura to prove the same point last week. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google He added that there looks to be an upside basis to consensus because the forecasts imply conservative growth expectations in areas such as ad load and cost per thousand impressions. Further, he doesn’t believe current estimates include any contributions from WhatsApp or Messenger, which are already at scale, or any possible new opportunities like longer-form video or e-commerce and payments. Profit-Taking on FB As analysts continue to push Facebook stock, executives at the social network continue to unload shares. Among those who have sold shares of the company This month are CEO Mark Zuckerberg, General Counsel Colin Stretch, Director Jan Koum and Chief Product Officer Christopher Cox. Zuckerberg has sold more than $300 million worth of Facebook stock over the last month. Why Shopify Inc. Stock Is on the Rise Today Regulatory filings also show that Westwood Management recently sold 600 shares of Facebook stock, although it remains the firm’s largest position at 10% of its portfolio. Also Swedbank AB (ADR) (SWDBY) unloaded about 193,000 shares but still held more than 2.57 million shares. Facebook makes up 2.5% of the firm’s portfolio and is its 15th biggest position. Shares of Facebook edged downward by as much as 0.17% to $128.85 during regular trading hours on Monday but are ahead marginally in Tuesday’s early morning trading.

HP will work with Digital Promise Global, the Global Business Coalition for Education, Microsoft and Intel to establish centers equipped with computer systems and teacher training services to give refugee students access to the latest education technology and provide adults with the opportunity to learn essential business and IT skills. This week, HP also committed to provide technology and HP LIFE training resources to the International Medical Corps Livelihoods Center pilot in Istanbul, Turkey.  As part of this initiative, HP will make online freelance opportunities available to refugees.  In addition, HP agreed to support the opening of two Lynke and Blue Rose Compass tech centers for refugees, also in the Middle East. These centers will provide training and support for refugees in app design and other technical work.  In total, HP is committing more than US$1 million in technology and training support to help refugees, alleviate poverty, and improve the lives of more than 100,000 people in the coming year. “The refugee community is full of untapped potential, but is challenged with growing those talents and skills due to a lack of access to technology and the digital world,” explained Nate Hurst, HP Chief Sustainability and Social Impact Officer. “By opening these new HP Learning Studios and supporting a variety of initiatives, HP is empowering refugees to build a better, more prosperous life through access to quality education and employment opportunities.” HP Learning Studios will be equipped with its latest technologies, including HP Sprout, a fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution with 3D object capture, editing and multiple streamlined 3D print options, and x360 convertible PCs powered by Windows 10, along with a Dremel 3D Printer.  The core curriculum will be powered by HP LIFE e-Learning courses, which include 25 online modules on essential business and IT skills in seven languages. As part of this effort, HP will support the creation of additional free online courses and curated content specifically designed to help refugees develop the skills and expertise necessary for freelancing and ecommerce.  “We are looking forward to collaborating with HP on this important effort, sharing our expertise to bring innovative, high-quality learning experiences to refugee students,” said Karen Cator, CEO of Digital Promise Global.  This new commitment builds on HP’s ongoing effort to aid in the refugee crisis. In June 2016, HP was among the first 15 private sector companies to join the White House Call to Action. As part of this pledge, HP committed to working with the administration to drive new, measurable and significant commitments that will have a durable impact on refugees.  For more information on HP’s most recent work to aid refugees, including the Global Alliance Institute, Girl’s Truth Seekers Education Project, USAID and UNIDO, please visit the HP Newsroom.

Christopher Karody, Editor, DroneBusiness.center said, “[InterDrone] brought together a ‘who’s who’ from every corner of the drone industry.

Stock Bounces Back After China Concerns Wane (AAPL) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) Recent Posts: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Intel Corporation (INTC) has received a pair of price target increases and a trio of positive earnings reports as its earnings preannouncement last week showed improving trends. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts remain bearish on Intel but raised their price target, while a bullish JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst also raised his price target. Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) also weighed in on the chip maker‘s preannouncement. Intel Surprises with Better-Than-Expected Results Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore and team reiterated their “Underweight” rating but increased their price target for Intel from $31 to $34 per share. They note that the preannouncement on Friday indicated the best sequential growth in nine years but add that channel replenishment was one of the drivers of that growth. As a result, they don’t believe it would be a good idea to buy Intel shares on the strong performance. They explain that the strength is not actually indicative of end demand but rather inventory build across ODMs, OEMs and distributors. They don’t believe the strength will continue into the fourth quarter and thus are expecting a “slight decline.” 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google However, they also said the better than seasonal strength in the third quarter does provide a resolution for their concern about excess inventory on the chip maker’s balance sheet. Intel Revises Guidance Upward On Friday, Intel revised its third quarter guidance upward, with management now expecting September quarter revenue of around $15.6 billion, representing a 15% sequential increase and 8% year over year increase. The new outlook is 5% higher than the previous guidance for $14.9 billion, as Intel replenished its PC supply chain inventory. Intel also increased its outlook for gross margin to 63%, an increase of 100 basis points. It also guided for a $100 million increase in operating expenditures, bringing it to $5.2 billion for the third quarter. In addition to the inventory replenishment, Intel also expects its data center business to post strong results. The Morgan Stanley team said one very important thing to keep check will be just how strong Intel’s data center business was during the third quarter. Although the data center segment didn’t drive the upside to revenue, Intel management has remained confident that double-digit growth would resume in the quarter. JPMorgan Raises Intel Price Target JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur is at the opposite end of the spectrum with an “Overweight” rating on Intel. He raised his target from $42 to $44 per share, citing improving demand trends in laptops, gaming PCs and the U.S. as being an additional driver of the upside in the third quarter (on top of the supply chain refill). How Apple Inc. Ranks As a Top Dow Analyst Pick (AAPL) He is especially bullish on the chip maker’s data center business, as he expects double-digit growth from it with upgrades in 25G networking products driving the growth. He also expects demand among enterprise customers to continue improving and believes Intel will benefit from the refresh of the Broadwell servers. Praise for Intel’s Data Center Business Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer did not adjust his price target, leaving it at $40 while maintaining his “Outperform” rating. Like Sur, he expects strength in Intel’s data center business but added that the chip maker should benefit from its share of Apple’s iPhone 7 modem business, in addition to improving prices for memory and what he views as a “cheap” valuation. Despite the improved outlook, shares of Intel slumped on Monday, declining as much as 1.37% to $37.16.

Northamber almost strikes cheery note, warns profit a year off Intel has hired veteran tech CFO and sometime troubleshooter Bob Swan to take over from long-time numbers supremo Stacy Smith. Swan, or to give him his full press release name, Robert “Bob” H Swan, joins from equity outfit General Atlantic, where he was an operating partner. Stacy Smith, “as previously announced, is taking a broader role within Intel leading manufacturing, sales and operations.” Before his stint at General Atlantic, Swan spent nine years as CFO of eBay. That’s a fairly chunky job, but equally interesting from our point of view was his stint at EDS in the early noughties. Swan joined EDS after the previously solid as a rock firm had issued a shock profit warning after its 2000 $6.9bn Navy Marine Corp Intranet deal unravelled. Swan was brought into steady the ship, after the deal blew a massive hole in the services firm’s finances. Just an example, in Q1 2005, EDS reported that on that contract it made a loss of $57m in the quarter on revenue of $166m, down 27 per cent on the year. In fact, Swan steadied it so well, that after he left in 2006 to take up the CFO job at eBay, the firm was in a reasonable enough state to sell itself to HP for $13.9bn. We’ll just gloss over Swan’s stint as CFO of Webvan, one of the mega disasters of the original dot com boom, and "Bob's" first foray into the world of tech after spending over 20 years learning the ropes at GE. Intel’s financial performance has been slightly erratic over the last couple of years as it deals with the changing shape of the computer, server and mobile industries. It’s nowhere near being the sort of basketcase EDS or Webvan was. But we’re guessing Swan isn’t joining just to keep things ticking over. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Zoia | WardsAuto EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Something happened in the past year to turn autonomous-vehicle development from a science project to full speed ahead, Intel’s Elliot Garbus says. Autonomous vehicles could be $1.3 trillion boost to U.S. economy. Related Media Uber Headed to Detroit U.K. Insurers Outline Autonomous-Vehicle Policies Fields: Mobility, Autonomy Mean Moving on From ‛One Fordʼ Strategy NOVI, MI – What a difference a year makes. That’s the picture drawn by Elliot Garbus, vice president-Internet of Things Solutions Group for Intel, in discussing the quickly shifting landscape of autonomous-vehicle development. “A year ago, I would have had a clear vision of autonomous,” Garbus says in a keynote presentation here at the SAE 2016 Convergence conference and exposition focused on automotive electronics. There were the disruptors, the Silicon Valley startups that were in go-fast mode conducting what Garbus says largely were seen as “science projects” around autonomous-vehicle development. That contrasted with the more measured approach by automakers, which were focused on a step-by-step rollout of advanced systems that slowly would add up to autonomous drive. “But something happened on New Year’s (Day),” the Intel executive says. “And a race began.” Garbus rattles off the number of moves by automakers and others in recent months to step up autonomous-vehicle development and get cars to market faster, including Ford’s push to have vehicles in hail-service fleets by 2021, General Motors’ acquisition of a stake in Lyft and purchase of developer Cruise Automation, Google’s expansion of real-world testing of its driverless technology and Baidu’s (China’s Google competitor) planned entry into the sector. There also is his company’s tie-up with BMW and Mobileye expected to lead to development of an open technology platform for autonomous vehicles, Garbus adds. “So the race is on; (autonomous) is coming.” Look for the technology to surface first in fleets, both for moving passengers and goods, he notes, because autonomous vehicles will need to operate in more controlled environments along well-mapped routes and with regular service intervals. One thing needed is better external communication between the vehicle and the cloud, which will store vital data used in part to update onboard software. Garbus sees automakers moving to 5G cellular service to increase the bandwidth and boost the communication speed. Intel will begin experimenting with 5G in vehicles used at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Korea. “A tremendous amount of computing will be required, so we’ll need the bandwidth,” he says. “This is a critical piece of autonomy.” Autonomous-vehicle technology has the potential to have a $1.3 trillion impact on the U.S. economy in fuel saved, productivity gained and the expected reduction in fatalities and injuries, Garbus says. Car insurance costs are expected to drop up to 80% over the next 10 years, he says. “That (alone is) stunning, and quite an economic incentive.” dzoia@wardsauto.com @DavidZoia Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 20 September 2016 | MYT 2:41 PM Intel hires Robert Swan from General Atlantic as CFO New CFO: Intel Corp named Robert Swan chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Stacy Smith who is moving to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. — Reuters Intel Corp named Robert Swan chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Stacy Smith who is moving to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. The world's largest chipmaker said earlier this year that Smith, who has been Intel's chief financial officer for nearly a decade, would shift to a new role. Swan, 56, joins from private equity firm General Atlantic and will oversee global finance and IT organisations, as well as corporate strategy office, Intel said on Sept 19. He will take up his new role, effective Oct 10. Swan, who also served as eBay Inc's chief financial officer, left after the company spun off PayPal Holdings Inc last year. Intel raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years on Sept 16 as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. The company's shares were unchanged in aftermarket trading on Sept 19. They closed down 1.3% at US$37.16 (RM153.92). — Reuters You May Be Interested Acer unveils a notebook that's thinner than 1cm Nasscom cuts IT services sector growth forecast for FY17 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read RM8mil dragon attraction Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 White supremacist ad allowed on Twitter, CEO apologises Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Airplanes. Cloud Computing. And Alien Abductions. Blog Twitter Aviation Museums Archives IoT is Software trying to grok Hardware Thoughts on platforms, standardization, scale, and economics in information software, digitally enhanced products, and their convergence in the Internet of Things. If I had a hammer Clemens Vasters Follow Mönchengladbach Email Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn XING Instagram Github Stackoverflow Pinterest Foursquare YouTube Flickr Vine The (mainstream, information) software industry thrives on standardization and scale. For servers and desktops, Intel’s x86 architecture has become the universal foundation, the UNIX userland model (and Windows) reign on the server, the PC desktop/notebook space is overwhelmingly dominated by Windows and OSX, tablets and mobile phones are similarly split between Android and iOS. The software industry likes some level of platform competition, but things tend to shake down to two major choices, and sometimes we end up with quasi monopolies. There’s obviously endless variety of apps and services on top of those foundations, but the software industry really loves monoculture when it comes to platforms. Platform wars in the industry, like the “Windows vs. Linux” evergreen, or “Android vs. iOS” are driven by that desire for monoculture. Software is a complex world, and most people in the industry have little choice but to invest deeply in a particular slice of that world in terms of learning and experience so that they can stay competitive. If their chosen slice of the world doesn’t end up becoming everyone’s favorite monoculture it threatens people’s carreers. People make bets on the future and then try hard to make “their team” win. The people in software love one winning platform - “theirs”. Monoculture (and “duoculture”) is great for scale. If you’re building a mobile phone app, you build for Android and iOS. If you’re building a desktop application you build for Windows and OSX. Or sometimes you start just with the bigger target or the target that’s most used by your target audience. Any of those platform has hundreds of millions of end-users to try your product on. One of the most interesting aspects of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) wave is that it represents the software industry’s attempt to make sense out of the diversity of “Things”; a diversity that is entirely alien in the mainstream software industry. “Things” is a giant and impossible technology umbrella. Under the term “IoT”, the software industry discusses adding digital capabilities to “Things” that span anything between a super tanker ship to a throwaway digital label sticker on a cereal box. And it’s often outright amusing when the software industry treats “Things” as if their approach to making hardware was novel in itself and that the true complexity of building “Things” were not existing. Another difference that software people struggle with, sometimes with outrage about the perceived unfairness of it all, is that the barriers to enter any market requiring manufactured products are significantly higher than in software; you’ll always need a lot more than a notebook, a coffee shop to camp in, and some base funding for cloud compute and storage resources. Creating tangible “Things” requires broad mix of engineering talents, there’s a supply chain to manage, and there are often complex sets of (internationally diverging) safety and other standards regulations to comply with. And because most industries don’t favor monoculture and one king for every hill as much as software, there will always be competing vendors that will aim to play the profit margins game better, and therefore it makes a real difference whether a particular component can be sourced for a few cents more or less per unit and that there is no costly unused capability. Software’s strategy to deal with heterogeneity is standardization; and therefore the mainstream computer/software industry comes up with platform: There are dozens of different tiny computers (“maker boards”) that each provide enough ecosystem scale for someone to invest their time in. Arduino/Genuino has a thriving community, because it provides a family of boards with a matching set of easy-to-use tools that work equally well across that family. Most of those tiny computers have a common way to speak to external components like attached servos and sensors. And those tiny computers are easily networkable, and their software platform has ways to easily integrate with other software on server computers or in the cloud. It’s software’s take on hardware. That sort of standardization is, so far, not hardware’s take on hardware; especially not at consumer product scale. Very many if not most toys you can buy in a toy store today have some electronics; nearly every kitchen appliance, big or small, contains electronics; cars are rolling miniature “data centers” with several dozen microcontrollers and processors. Quasi any of these digital components has a custom design that is made of the exact components required to fulfill a predetermined set of tasks, even if those can be enhanced and varied with software. Microcontroller types come in dozens and sometimes hundreds of different variations that satisfy a basic demand for some level of platform commonality, but nevertheless differ in available memory, nonvolatile storage, clock speed, power consumption, shielding, physical footprint, and special capability such as on-chip cryptography or signal processing. “Embedded systems developers” have the particular skill to deal with such a diverse capability zoo where devices have very little in common and there is no platform standard. The maker boards are great prototyping platforms, but at consumer scale they are far from being cost competitive with a custom circuit board and specially selected and sourced components. It might not be so terrible if that cost could be offset by vastly broader, software-based functionality in a product, but how many devices in addition to the general-purpose phones and tablets do we need where software plays center stage? There’s a different kind of standardization that is common in everyday hardware and that’s centered around user interaction. A hammer is a hammer. In products where a basic function is well known and doesn’t require “smarts”, electronics best enhance the capability; it quickly tips over to the silly if they attempt to take center stage. There are a few and (mostly) intuitive variations for how to control a water faucet in a washroom; the electronically controlled, sensor-operated faucet has become the modern default choice for public spaces. Sensor-operation has several clear benefits, requires no cerenomy to operate, and the function doesn’t get in the way of the design. It’s a perfect enhancement. Software’s leaning towards monoculture sadly reflects in interaction design and how that spills into IoT devices. Today, software generally surfaces to people through some form of a pixel grid display, and it allows interaction via keyboard, touch, stylus, or some pointing device - because that’s how the standard, general-purpose consumer information and communication devices interface with people. That interface model is not necessarily the best way to use functions of a special-purpose tool or machine. Without having such obvious prior art to look at, the most common “IoT” software solution for turning on a faucet might just be to put a touch screen display next to it or, worse, require the user to use a smartphone app. Software wants to play and retain center stage. The hipster “IoT” door bell (or door lock; there are now plenty to choose from) comes with an app and the maker really wants you to think of it as thing you care about as an important part of your life. There’s a motion sensor, a camera, two-way calling, and an affordable cloud service for just a few dollars a month. You can get push notifications! The app has new features every month. And statistics! But these cookie-cutter, standalone door bell devices are mostly clunky and look awfully out of place on mostly any building, and outside the demo videos, few of their features matter after the first excited week of ownership. Besides, if you really need two-way calling between your mobile phone and your door bell you could buy available solutions for more than the last two decades, and in a myriad of style options that fits the design and architecture of your house. And you still can. And some of them even have apps now. Because there’s an existing industry that has done building entry systems for a hundred years and they have, amongst other things, also figured out how to construct those things such that you can’t just easily rip them off the wall and walk away with them. And they already do digital keys, smart phone NFC, card readers, and finger-print access control in a modular fashion; they don’t aim to get in the way or take center stage and the manufacturers have well established relationships with architects and firms who install those systems. For most devices and tools used in our daily lives, we care about the primary function and the form. A spoon needs to be a good spoon. It needs to be comfortable to eat from, comfortable to hold, have an attractive shape, and it must not easily bend out of shape or be susceptible to lasting discolorations. There are indeed several IoT startups that want to hit it big with “smart” forks and spoons; if those spoons or forks are not primarily excellent spoons and forks and then also some sort of revolutionary diet tracker, nobody except the extreme techno geek fringe will ever care about them. And nobody, nobody! will ever want to battery-charge a spoon. Excellent water fixtures are difficult to make. Excellent windows are difficult to make. Excellent piping and pressure vessels are difficult to make. Excellent gears and drives are difficult to make. Excellent vehicle suspension systems are difficult to make. Excellent rocket engines are difficult to make. Machines that have moving parts and that need to deal with the reality of physics, reliabily, safely, and sustainably are hard to make. And the market differentiation for these machines is that they do their primary job better than any other machine, which is largely a physical interaction function that may then be aided by supporting software. But software doesn’t take center stage. As you get to large composite machines like cars and trucks and aircraft, there’s a giant network of multiple tiers of suppliers that form long value chains. Silicon Valley’s favorite auto maker, Tesla, employs dozens of global “Tier 1” suppliers for the various vehicle subsystems outside of what they consider their core competency (in their case, batteries and motors), just like any other car maker. Much of the integration in these complex machines is already digital. Many car steering wheels are rotation sensors with force feedback that feed into the steering system, potentially corrected by assistance systems like lane-keeping or the electronic stability program. If you feel the steering getting stiffer at high speeds that happens because some software makes that happen. The latest generation vehicles from the leading automakers with radar-assisted cruise control will initiate auto emergency braking and actively refuse to run into an obstacle if it’s physically possible to avoid doing so. The array of airbags around you will pop in milliseconds if a collision is inevitable. All software controlled. All highly specialized systems. Hard real time. Some of those systems have just one feature, and often that feature will never run through the main action sequence during the lifetime of the vehicle. This is software that’s not in the limelight. It’s not “agile”, fairly slow moving, and generally subject to rigorous quality assurance processes because letting an oversight slip may end up killing someone. That software is largely not understood by the hipster quarters of the software world. “Software is eating the world” is a recent software industry meme and is often used pointing to the ride-share or apartment-sublet brokers that, so far, cleverly manage to push the capital investments to their “associates” and monetize the information channel between those service providers and the customers. Others point to the torrent of home automation and entertainment gadgets brought about by the IoT hype. The fact is that software already ate a huge chunk of the world, but not necessarily in plain sight. Software on devices often interconnects and orchestrates components, but it’s mostly insular in nature and not wired (or radioed) up to the rest of the world - and in very many cases that is a blessing since software found on devices today had often been written without any expectation that it would ever have to stand up to external security threats. Some of the “Internet of Things” wave is about the information software industry coming to the realization that this other world exists and it discovers, sometimes in horror, how different that world is. Some of that wave is about pretending that intelligence in devices hasn’t existed until about now and that a coffee maker with a timer function or a thermostat with an outdoor sensor (and a timer function) is somehow novel. The most interesting tension developing around the IoT will be how to achieve product scalability. There are analyst predictions for tens of billions of new connected devices in the next 5-10 years, far eclipsing the number of mobile phones. But mobile phones are a class of functionally very similar devices with very similar hardware for which just two competitive operating systems exist, splitting nearly 95% of the market. There’s a driver ecosystem, there are capability profiles, and there is therefore a good foundation for a broad array of common tools and utility libraries to build solutions on. The overwhelming number of special-purpose devices are custom designed to do a particular set of tricks. There is hardly any standardization and the capabilities as well as the components that provide them will necessarily diverge. Available energy budget, required compute power, available physical space, and required environment robustness, and achievable retail/wholesale pricing force hard constraints for devices where software does not take center stage. In addition, many of the tools from IT land are inadequate. Embedded device programming is often “low level” in order to deal with aforementioned constraints, but also because acceptable compromises in IT, such as a second-long pause for memory garbage collection, are wholly inacceptable for real-time devices. It’s far from obvious how a investment-happy and rapid-growth industry with the wide profit margins enjoyed by the software industry can emerge out of such a diverse environment. “IoT” is in large parts about finding middle ground between the monoculture-fueled breadth of platform tooling and capabilities and the wealth of libraries that can grow on top and the need for razor sharp focus for what a device needs. And it’s about software grokking that with physical tools and devices, the are a lot of humble background roles to play in order to make helpful products, and that the key to unlocking useful scenarios is not one device, but a combination of them. We use dozens of tools and devices in the kitchen for a meal, we use dozens of tools to fix the outdoor patio. Each is important for a task, but I’m not going to develop a particularly deep relationship with any one of them. I care about a stocked toolbox more than I care about each tool. A few cheap and humble functions implemented in a common fashion across many devices may quite well enable great higher order scenarios that uniquely benefit from by local or Internet connectivity. I’d love to be able to say “Alexa/Cortana/Siri, where did I put the size 3 cross-slot screwdriver?” and I get told “You put it into a box on the second shelf from the top in the right kitchen storage cabinet last time I saw you having it. There’s also one in the toolbox in the garage.” I’d like that a lot more than my screwdriving performance statistics on an app. Really. Go make that. The “Internet of Things” is not a Silicon Valley startup phenomenon. Adding connected digital capabilities to tools, toys, devices, and machines that surround us at home, at work, and during our fun activities, is something that the software industry will surely be able to help with. But the manufacturers who must ultimately lead in making the “Internet of Things” real are those with experience, depth industry requirements knowledge, supply chain relationships, and capital investments to deliver excellent safe and robust tools, toys, devices, and machines; with digitally enhancements as a secondary capability. Excellent software in an awful hammer still makes an awful hammer.

Since the Israeli maker of collision-prevention technology sparked the controversy on Wednesday, Mobileye’s share price has fallen 2.8% and was trading early Monday New York time at $42.98. Tesla, meanwhile, has risen 5.6% to $207.12. In a Reuters interview, Mobileye chairman Amnon Shashua contended that Tesla was “pushing the envelope in terms of safety” with its AutoPilot driver-assist system based on Mobileye technology. Tesla fired back that it dropped Mobileye in a commercial dispute. The Los Angeles Times quoted Bill Selesky, research analyst at Argus Research, as saying Shashua’s comments raised questions as to “whether this technology is ready for the public” right now. “Just the fact he came out with something, I think would be a negative for the company and ultimately the stock,” he said. (TheMarker Staff) Ceva rallies after market learns its processors are inside the new iPhone Shares of Israel’s Ceva took off Monday on news that its digital signal processors are being used inside Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+. The reason is that Apple revealed that Intel is now supplying many of the modems for the new device and Ceva is an Intel subcontractor, entitling it to royalties from iPhone sales. The financial website Motley Fool estimated that if Apple ships in the upcoming product cycle120 million to 130 million units, Ceva CEVA could see $5.3 million in royalty revenue, a major addition to its sales last year of $59.5 million. “We view CEVA as one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+,” said Gary Mobley, an analyst at Benchmark Company over the weekend. Barron’s magazine added, “For investors, aside from buying Apple shares, one of the ways to make money off the trend may be to invest in Ceva.” Ceva shares were up 9.4% at $34.71 midday local time in New York. (TheMarker Staff) TipRanks in collaborative pact with Nasdaq Israel’s TipRanks has launched a cooperative program this week with the Nasdaq Stock Market for its service ranking analysts and financial bloggers based on their stock picks’ performance. A link to the TopRanks’ system appears on the Nasdaq website as of Sunday, offering investors analysis of their portfolio, tips on how to diversify it, risk analysis and analysts’ opinions and performance comparison with other portfolios. “This is an important collaboration, which will expose us to millions of new users and let Nasdaq monetize users,” said CEO and co-founder Uri Gruenbaum. He declined to provide details about the revenue-sharing agreement the two sides have.  TipRanks counts about 4,000 premium users who pay a fee for access to more data and analytical tools and has revenues in the single millions of dollars. “Our system enables us to look at all the stock traded in the American market and give each one a rating,” he said. (Shelly Appelberg) TASE shares lose momentum after early advance Tel Aviv shares drifted lower from early highs Monday even as markets in Europe and Wall Street moved higher. The blue chip TA-25 index ended virtually unchanged at 1,448.67 points, while the TA-100 gained 0.2% to 1,270.31, as just over 1 billion shekels ($270 million) in shares changed hands. Insurance stocks led gainers, with Migdal ahead 2.5% by closing at 2.44 shekels and IBI Insurance up 1.7% to 175.50. Mazor Robotics led TA-100 gainers, advancing 3.6% to 43.90 while Kenon added 2.8% to a 7.3% jump the day before to end at 40.17. Blue Square Real Estate rose 3.7% to 154.80 after it lowered the interest it pays on bonds following a ratings upgrade by Midroog. It was the biggest gainer among TA-100 shares for the day. Partner Communications led TA-100 losers, falling 2.2% to 2.44. The Israel Corporation lost 1.1% to close at 653 shekels. Jerusalem Economic Corporation ended down 0.2% to 8.87. Shareholders rejected an offer from the Saidoff brothers to buy 30% of the company at 7.25 a share.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 19, 2016 at 3:43PM Image source: Getty Images. For investors, it's usually a good idea to greet pitches about the "next big thing" with a hefty dose of skepticism. After all, these hyped-up technologies rarely deliver the transformative shift that they promised. And even if the next Segway scooter or Kindle e-reader does somehow change the rules, that's no guarantee that it will produce good returns for the shareholders of the companies involved. Yet that's no reason to ignore the major trends that threaten to reshape entire industries. One particularly powerful emerging technology is drones, those tiny flying vehicles that you're probably noticing zip through the skies around you with more frequency lately. According to a recent report from PwC (link opens PDF), drones have the potential to replace $130 billion of business across key areas of the economy, including transportation, security, and agriculture. The media and entertainment sector is right in the crosshairs of this shift, with nearly $9 billion of possible impact. Snap a great video Start with the most obvious application: aerial photography and filming. After all, one of the key benefits of a drone is that it can capture images and video with more flexibility and at a tiny fraction of the cost of a helicopter. That's what makes the segment so attractive to GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), whose cameras already find themselves attached to drones that are produced by other companies. With its Karma release this week, the sport-camera specialist aims to tackle this space and begin to capitalize on the fact that consumers already see it as a drone company even though it hasn't sold one under its own brand. Karma is out there. Meet Karma 9.19.16 #GoProKarma https://t.co/45sp1cQa3G pic.twitter.com/zON1m2jzHm — GoPro (@GoPro) September 15, 2016 Teaser video from the Karma drone. Source: GoPro. "We're uniquely positioned to be successful out of the gates with Karma, given the strength of GoPro's brand in the drone category," the company's chief financial officer told investors early this year, adding, "even though GoPro has not had a drone product." That optimistic reading will be put to a serious test this holiday season. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), which produces the tech that powers tiny portable cameras, is another important company to watch in this space. GoPro is one of its biggest customers, and a successful launch of Karma might help it recover its lost growth momentum. However, Ambarella's high-end product focus, which includes features like 4K resolution and electronic image stabilization, also position it for growth in applications outside of the consumer world -- in places like the professional filming of commercials, movies, and sporting events. Investors are hoping that this quality focus is the right strategy to defend against low-cost competitors that are flooding the market. Make a visual impact Rather than just filming the entertainment, however, drones can also turn into the main draw themselves. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) last year put on a light show that featured 100 drones moving in concert to orchestra music. "We have visions of going from 100 to 1,000, over time," CEO Brian Krzanich said, in a nod to how easily the technology could scale. Source: Intel. The applications of Intel's hardware and software solutions include sporting events where drones would entertain onlookers during breaks, as well as use in populated areas where they might project or carry advertisements. In any case, these devices will play a key role in its Internet of Things division. Disney (NYSE:DIS) is also looking to be an early adopter of this technology for entertainment purposes. The House of Mouse plans to use drones around its theme parks for creating lighting effects and potentially replacing those loud nightly firework shows. The devices could eventually do much more, though, including animating dozens of small, or a handful of giant, flying puppet characters in the skies above its resorts. In a few years, the drone shows might just become a staple at Disney parks and help keep those ticket sales churn higher. It's impossible to predict which companies, if any, will capture persistent returns from the emerging popularity of drones in the entertainment and media world. The good news is that investors have a wide range of risk-return matchups to consider -- everything from highly dependent companies like GoPro and Ambarella to more diversified options like Intel and Disney.

Swan, finance chief at EBay Inc. from March 2006 to July 2015, will oversee Intel’s finance, internal technology and strategy offices, the chipmaker said Monday in a statement. He had been an operating partner at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC. Intel had previously announced that Smith was leaving the role he held for nine years to lead manufacturing, sales and operations. Swan, 56, joins a company trying to reinvent itself as a more general provider of chips because its main product, processors for personal computers, is suffering from a multiyear decline in demand. He’ll help Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich transition the company and defend its lead in server chips, a lucrative market that provides much of Intel’s profits. Swan will receive a hiring bonus of $5.5 million and a starting base salary of $850,000, according to a company filing. The company’s shares declined 1.4 percent to $37.16 at the close in New York prior to the announcement. The stock has gained 7.9 percent this year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This time the Telugu entrepreneur who made it big in the Valley is focussing on computing and phone devices. After co-founding and building the California-based Soft Machines, which developed a chip that attracted the attention of global semiconductor giants, Mahesh Lingareddy began work on Smartron with a co-founder two years ago that aims to become a Huawei or Samsung of India.Focus on IoT Mahesh sees a huge disruption happening in the Internet of Things (IoT) space. He said the two-year-old Smartron is developing phones, notebooks, IoT devices and an IoT app store that can be called ‘Made in India’ products, completely designed here. The firm has already launched two products — one phone and an ultra book. It has two research and development centres in Hyderabad and Bengaluru with a total strength of 170 employees. “Two more are coming before end of the year. And three more in second quarter of next year. Tronx, the IoT app platform continues to get better and richer,” he said.Bought by Intel? Meanwhile, Soft Machines declined to comment on reports that suggested chip-maker Intel acquiring Soft Machines. “We decline to comment. Soft Machines has no comment to offer on rumours and speculations appeared in the press,” it asserted. Several websites had reported last week that the chip-maker is buying Soft Machines for $300 million. Narsi Reddy Posham, Managing Director of Smartron, said the company sees the possibility of getting the products manufactured in India. “We are now sourcing them from Foxconn’s bases outside, going forward we will see possibilities to source from its facilities here,” he said. The company will launch an IoT Hub that will help connect all the ‘smart’ devices in a house or office. Hiring plans As it lines up more products, the company is going hire over 300 people in a year. “By the end of next year, we will have 500 employees in all. Most of them would be engineers, while others will be into marketing and sales,” he said. “At present we are selling the products on Amazon. We will be available on Flipkart and Snapdeal too in some time. We have tied up with Redington for offline sales,” Narsi Reddy said.

(Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) raised its Q3 top-line guidance, citing better PC matrices. The company could generate margin expansion over the next several years, provided it is able to successfully “grow its focus areas while deemphasizing PCs,” Argus’s Jim Kelleher said in a report. He maintained a Buy rating on Intel, while raising the price target from $41 to $45. Intel announced an upward revision in its Q3 revenue estimate from $14.9 million, plus or minus $300 million, to $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The non-GAAP gross margin forecast has been raised by 100bps to 63 percent at the midpoint, reflecting volume leverage on higher PC production. “We regard the higher level of PC sales as somewhat seasonal and mainly related to inventory replenishment at distribution,” analyst Kelleher mentioned. Transaction With PE Firm Intel has recently announced plans to partner with private equity firm TPG to jointly invest in a spin-out of Intel Security, which was formerly known as McAfee. The transaction values the business at $4.2 billion. While Intel would not recover the complete investment of $7.7 billion it made in McAfee, the company would receive $3.1 billion in cash from TPG and retain a 49 percent stake in Intel Security, Kelleher noted. Beyond PC “Assuming Intel succeeds in growing its focus areas while deemphasizing PCs, the company’s gross and operating margins should expand over the next several years. Intel remains an impressive cash generator, and its rich dividend yields about 2.8%,” the analyst wrote.

(Investor's Business Daily) Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) gained more than 3 percent on Friday after the company revised its revenue forecast and other financial metrics higher due to improving PC demand. Related Link:Chip Stocks Mostly Soar As Intel Raises Q3 Guidance Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research commented in a research report following Intel's boosted guidance that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s upcoming new Mac computers are the "prime reason" for Intel's improved outlook. Related Link: Chip Stocks Mostly Soar As Intel Raises Q3 Guidance According to Chowdhry's checks, Apple is already seeing strong back-to-school sales. Specifically, Mac computers are outselling Windows PC computers by a margin of three to one, and according to some checks, more than 80 percent of incoming students bought a Mac. Chowdhry continued that the new Macs are just entering production and should launch in the third week of October. The computer will be "significantly refreshed" with a redesigned keyboard. Meanwhile, initial indications suggest the new computer "will have a strong demand." The analyst further suggested that when Intel issued its initial guidance early in the quarter it was "not aware" of Apple's production demand. The company has now updated its guidance to "primarily reflect the demand form Apple's new upcoming Mac's and is less to do with Windows PC's demand." Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Oracle's OpenWorld is in San Francisco. Supremo Larry Ellison has given his Sunday keynote. Here's a summary of what the database giant is going to reveal today in easily digestible chunks. And, yeah, warning: everything is now cloud. Anything you'd call an application or a software service is now a "cloud" at Oracle. Oracle Database 12c Release 2 is going to be first made available via the tech goliath's cloud service. The Oracle Analytics Cloud will include trained AI models so you can feed in data from sales, marketing, customer feedback, complaints and such stuff to predict outcomes using the supplied machine-learning packages. Oracle's Data Cloud also now touts anonymized customer and business profiles from 1,500 organizations, which is information you can use to train applications and make decisions. New Adaptive Intelligent Applications, running on Oracle's cloud, suck in information about your staff and customers and spit out recommendations on how to squeeze the most out of them. They are basically cyber-PHBs. In Oracle's own words: "These new Adaptive Intelligent Applications ... apply advanced data science to learn and ingest data about an organization’s users and their behaviors to deliver targeted information to customers and employees." The apps can be potentially used in... Finance to negotiate better rates with suppliers and plan better for tedious stuff like cashflow and end-of-the-quarter payments. Human Resources to pick out the best applicants for jobs. Marketing and Commerce to work out what ads work well and what don't. Supply Chain management to select the right distribution channel given the latest transport pricing and availability. There's a new Oracle Engagement Cloud that's essentially a customer service super-portal of "sales automation, service request management, knowledge management, and customer self-service." The frightening sounding Oracle Financial Consolidation and Close (FCCS) Cloud for beancounters to produce quarterly and annual financial reports, and the equally terrifying Oracle Revenue Management Cloud to monitor and audit contracts and money coming into a business. The Oracle Student Cloud for universities to store and process undergrads' records. For healthcare HR departments, there's the Oracle Human Capital Management Cloud for managing "complex labor rules and contractual terms that enable customers to define eligibility rules for core Human Resources and criteria for benefits, absence, time, and labor and payroll." There's a Oracle Internet of Things Cloud that can gobble sensor data in real-time over the 'net. And the Oracle Supply Chain Management Cloud that, well, does what it sounds like. Oracle's Cloud Platform will rent out bare-metal boxes like some kind of fancy data center colocation operation. This is supposed to act as a halfway house for organizations that want to move their software off premises and into the cloud but can't quite make the leap yet, so they'll spin up services on servers in Oracle's data centers. The Oracle Ravello Cloud Service will run VMware and Linux KVM workloads on Big Red's servers, and the Oracle Container Cloud Service supports Docker to deploy container images on Big Red's hosted boxes. Oracle’s Application Container Cloud Service has gained support for PHP, Node.js and Java. The new Oracle Cloud Stack Manager can be used to create and run applications built out of platform-as-a-service software. The Oracle Identity Cloud Service has appeared to manage user identities for off and on-premises accounts. The Oracle Security Monitoring and Analytics Cloud Service will look out for security threats on systems hosting enterprise applications. Then there's the Oracle API Platform Cloud Service "to create, secure and manage their APIs with zero code and pre-built analytics charts, while being able to run the API gateway within the Oracle Cloud, on-premise or on third party clouds." That's enough cloud for now. Ever cloud had the cloud feeling you're cloud being cloud beaten around the cloud head by something? There's lots of other minor little bits and pieces that have been added to Oracle's existing off-premises offerings. We'll be following OpenWorld this week so keep your eyes peeled for updates. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 16 Comments More from The Register Lack of Hurd mentality at Oracle OpenWorld: Co-CEO's cloud claims fall flat live on stage OpenWorld When polling in keynotes goes bad 26 Comments Salesforce claims 'record' quarter record at Oracle and SAP's expense More Salesforce on more AWS promise 7 Comments HP Inc dumps Salesforce, adopts Microsoft's cloudy CRM There is no honour among clouds 6 Comments The next time Salesforce goes down, you'll get six reasons why SaaS-o-saurus Rex preparing more granular status service for September debut 2 Comments Salesforce Einstein: Enterprise AI breakthrough, or CRM Clippy?

The report said Apple used TSMC to make at least some of its A10 Fusion SoCs, probably using its InFO packaging process as well. Both Intel and TSMC were expected to win the sockets in the latest iPhones announced earlier this month. The teardowns confirm earlier reports of deals that represent millions of dollars of business to both companies, probably making Intel the third largest supplier of cellular baseband chips behind Qualcomm and Mediatek.

Mrs Ruto appreciated the various partners who have come together to put up the program saying that it has been her desire to see women and girls have digital literacy. "I thank the various partners that have come together to create this program. It has been my desire to see every woman and girl be technologically conversant because every woman is the same. I am looking forward to a day when each woman will be holding a tablet and swiping it to show that they are technologically savvy," said Mrs Ruto The Office of Her Excellency Mrs Ruto has partnered with Intel to provide laptops, Airtel to provide internet and Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to provide digital curriculum. Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development Director Mr Julius O Jwan expressed enthusiasm over the number of women who have shown interest in digital literacy from the previous caravans touring the country. Ms Suraj Shah, Intel Africa Program Manager for 'She Will Connect' said that Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa have benefited from the program.

The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets.  However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering.  HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5% in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved.  FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking."  Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States.  "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to US$42 (RM173.50) from US$40 (RM165.23).  Intel said on Sept 16 it expected third-quarter revenue to be US$15.6bil (RM64.44bil), plus or minus US$300mil (RM1.23bil), compared with its prior forecast of US$14.9bil (RM61.55bil), plus or minus US$500mil (RM2.06bil).  That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts on average were expecting US$14.90bil (RM61.55bil), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilising at Intel, and raised his price target by US$2 (RM8.26) to US$38 (RM156.99).  Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1%, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher.  Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6% at US$37.53 (RM155.05) in afternoon trading.  Up to the close of Sept 15, the stock had risen 6.1% this year, underperforming the 20.8% gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period. — Reuters You May Be Interested Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail SpaceX seeks US approval for Internet-via-satellite network Microsoft offers EU concessions over its US$26bil LinkedIn bid Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 White supremacist ad allowed on Twitter, CEO apologises Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Define your site main menu Understanding Ethernet Networking Ethernet refers to the family of Local Area Network implementation that was jointly developed by Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation and Xerox Corporation. It consists of certain specifications and standards as well as hardware devices and components. Ethernet Connection The Ethernet protocol provides for a verity of cabling options, one of which is a specification referred to as 10Base5. Connecting cable is known as AUI (Attachment Unit Interface) and network attachment device is known as Media Attachment Unit (MAU) rather than transceiver. CSMA/CD Ethernet is a baseband LAN specification invented by Xerox corporation operates at 10 Mbps using CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection). As a contention-based environment Ethernet allows any station on the network to transmit when ever the Ethernet network is quite. Collisions could be found whenever stations listen for traffic and hear nothing and transmit regularly. In this situation both types of transmissions are damaged and device should transmit later. Back-off algorithm is used whenever colliding stations should retransmit data. Ethernet Network Design Ethernet was designed to serve in network with sporadic, occasionally heavy traffic requirements. A network using Ethernet is usually considered as a low cost LAN. Layer 1 and Layer 2 of OSI model related services are provided by Ethernet. For creating an Ethernet network, you have usually implemented a network interface card on a primary circuit board. Cabling conventions of Ethernet describe use of transceiver for attaching cable to physical medium. Transceiver may perform some physical layer functions such as collision and detection. The transceiver cable connects end stations to a transceiver. How to Set Ethernet Full and Half Duplex Full Duplex Ethernet Full duplex provides the means of transmitting and receiving simultaneously on a single wire. Full duplex Ethernet is used between two endpoint like for between switches and servers, between switches and routers etc. Full duplex also permit bandwidth on Ethernet and Fast Ethernet networks very easy and cost effective and also fast.. By using features such as Fast EtherChannel, "bundles" of Fast Ethernet connections can be grouped together to increase bandwidth to increase bandwidth up to 4000%. Full duplex broadcasting is used in Gigabit Ethernet to increase collective bandwidth ranging from 2 Gbps to 2 Gbps for point to point links and also used to increase distances of for specific type of media. Further more Gigabits Ethernet Channel allows creating 8 Gbps connections between switches. Full duplex Ethernet minimize chances of collisions so that CSMS/CD does not need to be used for flow control. . However, a full duplex flow control method has been put forward in the standards committee with flow control as on option clause. This standard is referred to as IEEE 802.3x; it formalizes full duplex technology and it's expected to be supported in future Gigabit Ethernet products. Because of the volume of full duplex 100 mbps network interfaces cards (NICs), it is likely that this standard will realistically apply to Fast Ethernet. Half Duplex 10g Ethernet For half duplex transmission, CSMA/CD will be utilized to ensure that stations can communicate over a single wire and that collision recovery can take place. CSMS/CD implementation should be same as for Ethernet and Fast Ethernet and also it allows creation of shared Gigabit Ethernet using hub of half duplex via point to point connections. Because the CSMA/CD protocol is delay sensitive, a bit budget per collision domains must be created. When CSMS/CD is used delay sensitivity is always there however full duplex operation has no delay sensitivity and collision domains are defined as time passes fo maximum length frame transmission. This transmission, in turn, governs the maximum separation between two end stations on a shared segment. When network speed grows, frame transmission speed decreases and collision domains diameters is maximum. Budget of collision domain is used as maximum signal delay time for different networking components like repeaters, MAC layer and medium also. Increase in speed of Ethernet speed depends upon some terms that how you are implementing CSMS/CD. Speed which is more than 100 Mbps packet sizes are shorter than length of slot time in bits. (Slot-time is defined as the unit of the time for Ethernet MAC to handle collisions). Handling slot time problem you may find carrier extensions in Ethernet specifications. Carrier extensions are used to add bits to frames until frames meets the minimum requirements which slot time is needed. Following this method, smaller packet sizes can cover with minimum slot time required and it permit seamless operation with current Ethernet CSMS/CD. More change to the Ethernet requirement is the adding up of frame bursting. Frame bursting is an optional feature in which, in a CSMA/CD environment, and an end station can transmit a burst of frames over the wire without having to relinquish control. Other devices are put back to stop transmission when there is no idle time on wire. .The transmitting station that is bursting onto the wire fills the inter-frame interval with extension bits such that the wire never appears free to any other end station.

Matthew Jolliff Hello, I am having the following problem: I have a LG desktop PC that is running Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 3 and a Toshiba laptop PC that is running Windows 7 Home Premium. My ISP is Comcast. I have a Motorola Surfboard DOCSIS 3.0 modem and a Linksys Wireless-G WRT54G Version 8.0 broadband router. I also have to ethernet cables that state they are category 5. When I hook up the router, all that is supposed to light up does. I plug the cable from the wall to the modem, then to the router, then to the desktop. I have unplugged and replugged everything in making sure to follow the correct order. However, when it looks as though everything is hardwired correctly, I can not access the 192.168.1.1 website and if I try running the “Easy Link Advisor” CD that came with the router, it says it can not detect the router. My first question is, could it be the cables? I read somewhere that category 6 cables were being used, but haven’t found anywhere that states they are necessary. When the router is not hooked up, they work just fine from the modem to the desktop. My second question, if not the cables, is there something I am overlooking? I appreciate any help in advance.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak  ⋮  Rumor Intel Core i7-7700K Flagship Kaby Lake Processor Listed For Pre-Order – 7th Gen CPUs May Work With 100-Series Chipset By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 months ago 294Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel’s fastest Kaby Lake model has been listed by an online retailer months before its release. The processor, known as Core i7-7700K will be the flagship offering. Based on the optimized, 7th generation architecture, Kaby Lake will be delivering improved clock speeds along with decent IPC increments. Intel Core i7-7700K Listed Online – Fastest Clocked Core i7 To Date Kaby Lake has already been introduced on low-power platforms. In the months ahead, Intel would launch Kaby Lake for high-end and mainstream platforms. This would include both mobility and desktop PCs. While Kaby Lake is very similar to Skylake, improvements to the 14nm node deliver increased efficiency and faster clock rates. Intel showcases their 14nm+ wafer which is used to manufacturer 7th gen processors. Intel calls their latest process as 14nm+ which is currently the most advanced form of the 14nm node. This node has up to 12% performance increase over previous 14nm chips. 14nm+ has been thoroughly detailed in our previous post here. Intel’s K Series Kaby Lake CPUs: So talking about the details, first up, we have two “K” series models. These chips have an unlocked design that indicates that they are built for overclocking. The flagship is the Core i7-7700K features 4 cores, 8 threads and 95W TDP. This chip has a base clock of 4.2 GHz and boost clock of 4.5 GHz while featuring 8 MB of L3 cache. The official part number for the model is CM8067702868535. Listed over at an Estonian retail site, the chip is available for pre-order at 360.35 €. This brings the price to roughly $400 US. Now the price is definitely not final and exaggerated since launch is still far away. Actual price should be around the same pattern as the Core i7-6700K. The second chip is the Core i5-7600K. This is a quad core chip without multi-threading support that packs 6  MB of L3 cache and a 95W TDP. The chip features a base clock of 3.8 GHz and would turbo beyond 4 GHz.

The second part of this story is also related to the Kaby Lake chips. Listings over at Geekbench database show several Kaby Lake desktop chips operating on an ASUS Z170-K motherboard. These chips include the Core i5-7400, Core i5-7500 and Core i5-7600K. The motherboard is based on the 100-series chipset which gives us a hint that early samples are already compatible with existing motherboards. It’s up to Intel and their board partners to decide whether they would retain this compatibility down the road when Kaby Lake launches or limit it to the new 200-series boards. As of now, I have a feeling that 100-series and 200-series would allow compatibility with Kaby Lake chips but 200-series motherboards will have better I/O capabilities such as Optane SSD support. Here’s What To Expect From Kaby Lake Desktop Processors Intel Kaby Lake processors in general would be getting increased core performance (expect the usual 5-10% improvement) unless Intel plans to do something very different with Kaby Lake which seems highly unlikely. The processors will retain the basic features such for enthusiasts such as enhanced full range BCLK overclocking and 95W “Unlocked” options to choose from. Intel 200-series chipset will feature support for Kaby Lake CPUs and the latest Optane SSDs. (Image Credits: Benchlife) The Intel 200-Series PCH is a crucial update for the upcoming family of processors as it will allow support for them. The Intel 200-series PCH will include several SKUs such as Z270, H270, Q270, Q250 and B250. While the new chipset doesn’t include any major changes over the Skylake PCH, it does include support for Intel Optane technology. The new tech utilizes Intel’s 3D XPoint memory to deliver high-performance SSDs and memory solutions. The KBL-PCH will be able to support Mansion Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4), Brighton Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4) and Stony Beach (Optane Memory PCIe/NVMe Gen 3 x2 (m.2)) solutions.

In the days leading up to Wednesday’s policy announcement, market volatility has spiked following two months of relative calm. In the last six trading sessions, the benchmark S&P 500 has moved at least 1 per cent four times, twice up and twice down, whipsawed by shifting perceptions of what the Fed may do. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, is holding near two-month highs. Following a week of mixed economic data, investors pared bets the Fed will raise rates next week. As of Friday afternoon, traders predicted only a 15 per cent likelihood of a hike after its two-day meeting, according to the CME’s FedWatch website. “Most of the indicators I’ve seen suggest that the markets really don’t anticipate there’s much chance of a hike this month,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “If they come with a rate hike, a lot of investors will scramble.” If the Fed, as expected, holds off, the focus will shift to its December meeting. Investors were betting such a move was more likely than not as of Friday, with a 52 per cent perceived probability. “If we hear a hawkish tone, in essence getting the market ready for December, the market can absorb that as long as you have the (strong economic) data underpinning,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. One investor believes Fed officials want to raise rates in order to prepare options should the economy soften in the near future. However even hinting at an increase sparks a sell-off that stifles their intentions. “If nothing happens and we begin the cycle of ‘will they do it in December or not?,’ I think volatility continues some,” said Peter Tuz, President of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. He added that elements feeding into volatility also include the US presidential election and global economic conditions. The benign rate environment has helped fuel major US stock indexes to all-time highs in July and August. The S&P 500 now sits about 2.5 per cent below its record close, and it remains up about 4.5 per cent for 2016. The Fed’s decision also will factor into the performance of high dividend-paying telecoms and utilities shares, which tend to benefit from low-rate environments. The sectors have each climbed about 13 per cent in 2016, topping other groups, but have pared gains in recent months. “If the rate increase is priced out, and the Fed language suggests that, then you could see money coming back into these stocks and sectors where yield is a big component of their total return,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Real estate is another high-dividend-paying sector benefiting from muted Fed action, helped by the expectation that mortgage rates will stay low. Real estate stocks will mark on Monday their first full trading day as a major S&P 500 sector, breaking out from financials. “If the Fed holds off, I would think that they would do pretty well,” said Aaron Jett, Vice-President for global equity research at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles. Wall Street was near session lows late on Friday morning as Oracle led a decline in tech stocks and financials came under pressure in the wake of Deutsche Bank’s mammoth $14 billion fine. The far bigger-than-expected penalty was levied by the US Department of Justice to settle claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities. Deutsche Bank’s US-listed shares were down 9.2 per cent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.98 per cent, the steepest among the 10 major S&P sectors. The KBW Bank index fell 1.25 per cent, putting it on track for its biggest weekly decline since the Brexit vote in late June. “The size of the Deutsche fine is putting pressure on the financials and is combined with the likelihood of the Fed putting off raising rates next week,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 72.62 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 18,139.86. The S&P 500 was down 10.01 points, or 0.47 per cent, at 2,137.25. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.19 points, or 0.27 per cent, at 5,235.50. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← German banks count cost of global shipping crisis Swarovski lights up Muscat with the launch of fall 2016 collection → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Philippine’s Marcos finally gets a hero’s burial amid protests Car bomb injures five in Thailand Trump’s daughter at talks raises eyebrows Chinese astronauts return to earth Read More ...

It’s good to see the Dell XPS 13 again. We were very taken indeed with the 2015 edition of this compact notebook, awarding it a full five stars in our review and heaping praise on its design – that near-borderless monitor really keeps the size down. And now it’s getting a 2016 update, complete with new seventh-generation Intel Core processors and a new colour option. There is one obvious change...The gadget gods have decreed that every product released in 2016 must come with a gold-but-also-a-wee-bit-pink finish, and the XPS 13 is no exception. But here's the specs that matter - the new model comes with a choice of new i3, i5 and i7 Intel chips, and better battery life than its predecessor (Dell says 13 hours if you’re Netflix streaming or web browsing, 22 if you’re just using productivity apps), higher speed Wi-Fi and a Thunderbolt 3 port that’ll allow a single XPS 13 to power two external 4K displays, as well as single-cable docking. Aside from the above, the specs are unchanged from last year’s edition. The base model features a 13.3in 1080p screen, Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage, and upgrades can take that to a 3200 x 1800 touchscreen, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. There’s no sign of the new model on Dell’s Australian site yet, but in the US the 2016 XPS 13 starts at $US799, although you’ll need to pay more ($US1149) for the rose gold model.

Now, however, leaked information has reportedly surfaced regarding the company’s graphics chip road map, revealing that AMD’s Navi cards won’t actually arrive until sometime in 2019. The leak also claims there will be three Vega solutions instead of two. If that information is correct, then AMD has pushed Navi back a year. That follows AMD’s recent decision to push Vega product releases back from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017 for unknown reasons, although there is speculation that AMD wants the graphics cards to roughly launch in the same window as its first “Summit Ridge” processors for the high-end desktop crowd. The Vega graphics cards will focus on that market as well. Related: AMD’s latest deal with GlobalFoundries could help close the gap with Intel Right now, AMD offers two variants of its current graphics chip: Polaris 10 and Polaris 11. The Radeon RX 480 and Radeon RX 470 cards use the Polaris 10 graphics chip, while the Radeon RX 460 uses the Polaris 11 model. In 2017, there will be products based on three Vega GPU variants: Vega 10, Vega 11, and Vega 20. Products based on the Vega 10 graphics chip are slated to arrive in the first quarter of 2017 for the enthusiast market. This chip will rely on AMD’s 14nm GFX9 graphics core technology, and will sport 64 compute units that encompass 4,096 shader processors. This chip will provide up to 12 TFLOPS of single-precision floating point performance, and will by accompanied by 8GB or 16GB of local next-generation “stacked” HBM video memory. The power requirement is expected to be 225 watts. AMD’s Vega 10 products will compete with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 graphics cards. The company is expected to provide a graphics card with two Vega 10 chips that has a power requirement of around 300 watts. AMD also plans to go after Nvidia’s updated GeForce GTX Titan X card with a product based on its Vega 11 graphics chip. Vega 11 is expected to pack a hefty 6,144 shader processors. One of the more interesting things about the latest leak is the mention of a Vega 20 graphics chip. It will be based on GFX9 cores stemming from GlobalFoundries’ smaller 7nm process technology, allowing AMD to pack more cores into the Vega graphics chip. However, Vega 20 is rumored to have only 4,096 shader processors, indicating that the resulting graphics card may include 32GB of “stacked” HBM2 video memory, a smaller form factor, and a lower power requirement of 150 watts. Vega 20 will reportedly also support PCI Express 4.0. Finally, Navi will arrive in two variants: Navi 10 and Navi 11. While the technical specs are unknown, AMD says that Navi will be scalable and support next-generation video memory, likely HBM3. Given its Vega products were pushed back into 2017, AMD’s move to delay Navi shouldn’t come as a surprise. News regarding the Vega and Navi chips arrive by way of a road map stashed away on a server stationed within AMD. That said, file a good chunk of this information under the rumor umbrella. What we do know is that Vega products are slated for the first half of 2017 as AMD has repeatedly acknowledged, so hopefully a good deal of these rumors will be put to rest toward the beginning of 2017.

The penny-stock success story, which surged sevenfold after hiring the cyber security guru in May, just slumped 42 percent over two days, capped after the New York Stock Exchange refused to list shares for a planned merger. Its market value is $48.9 million, down from $104 million on July 7. The decision put a damper on the Harrison, New York-based firm’s plans to acquire D-Vasive Inc., sending MGT’s stock down 25 percent to $1.89 on Tuesday. The drop compounded the company’s 23 percent decline on Monday sparked by a subpoena from the Securities Exchange Commission requesting “certain information.” It’s been anything but a smooth ride for MGT, which added $90 million in market value in May after saying it would hire McAfee as chief executive to aid the transition from video-game maker to cybersecurity firm. The stock showed remarkable resilience in the following weeks despite the company not generating any revenue -- never dropping below $2.24 a share -- until selling this week sent it tumbling. “We are determined to consummate a transaction that brings our cybersecurity technologies to market in order to solve the pressing privacy and security issues that society faces,” McAfee said today in a statement. MGT intended to issue 43.8 million shares to acquire D-Vasive, which would almost triple the number of MGT shares outstanding. The listing of new shares to acquire a private company could require the issuer to meet the same requirements needed for a first-time listing, according to the NYSE website. NYSE spokesman Brendan McManus declined to comment on the decision to reject the proposed share issuance. The stock has been a battlefield of fans and detractors of MGT, with bulls pointing to McAfee’s hiring and the pending acquisition of D-Vasive, a Wyoming company that MGT says is developing “anti-spy” applications. Meanwhile, bears pushed short interest on MGT’s stock to the highest in history in late July. The measure is still more than double its two-year average. This isn’t the first time in recent weeks MGT’s plan to capitalize further on McAfee’s name has run into issues. McAfee earlier this month sued Intel Corp. for the right to use his name in new ventures, saying Intel warned him that any use of his name will infringe on the company’s trademarks that it acquired when it bought his company in 2010, according to his complaint in Manhattan federal court.  MGT plans to rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies. On Monday, MGT received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information from the company. In a statement, the MGT said in a statement that it has “no indication or reason to believe that the company is or will be the subject of any enforcement proceedings.” Current CEO, Robert Ladd, when interviewed by Bloomberg earlier this month, wouldn’t provide any details of MGT’s planned business beyond saying it intended to develop its own technology. He declined to comment about the NYSE’s decision to block MGT’s share listing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The display remains the most expensive component, costing an estimated $43, followed by an Intel modem and other baseband chips worth an estimated total of $33.90. Apple's quad-core A10 Fusion chip is the third most expensive item on the bill of materials, costing an estimated $26.90. Meanwhile, the larger 1,920 mAh battery is said to cost just $2.50. The larger rear-facing iSight camera and improved 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime camera cost a combined $19.90, according to IHS Markit. Electromechanical components, including the Taptic Engine, antennas, connectors, microphones, and stereo speakers, cost an estimated $16.70 combined. iPhone 7's 2GB of RAM supplied by Samsung, and 32GB of flash storage supplied by SK Hynix, are estimated to cost a combined $16.40. An audio codec and audio amplifier supplied by Cirrus Logic, an NFC controller supplied by NXP, a Bosch Sensortec-made barometer, along with an accelerometer, gyroscope, Touch ID, proximity sensor, and other sensors, cost an estimated $14 altogether. The accessories included in the iPhone 7 box, including a Lightning-to-USB cable, Lightning-to-3.5mm audio adapter, EarPods with a Lightning connector, and 5W USB power adapter cost an estimated $11.80 combined. IHS raises Apple's total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 to $224.80 after adding $5 in "basic manufacturing costs" related to assembly, insertion, and testing. A 32GB iPhone 7 Plus costs $649 as a point of comparison. However, the bill of materials does not factor in costs related to, among other things, research and development, software, licensing costs, and transportation. The accuracy of the component costs is also questionable. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he has never seen a cost breakdown that is "anywhere close to being accurate," adding that they are generally "much different than the reality." At least in comparison to IHS estimates for previous iPhones, the iPhone 7's bill of materials is seemingly costlier than the iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5, each estimated to start at $200, and the iPhone SE at $160.

Rating: 33 Votes Small White Car 8 weeks ago I know people moan about how these prices aren't accurate don't reflect other costs, but I find the year-to-year comparisons to be quite informative. It doesn't matter what the actual numbers are, it still shows that Apple is striving to squeeze more into these phones than ever before at the expense of their margins. And that's interesting info. Rating: 22 Votes ftaok 8 weeks ago These cost breakdowns are always so irrelevant. They don't tell much of a story at all. So all of those parts that Apple buys, like the Intel modem for $33.90, doesn't cost Intel that much to make. So let's pull a number of of the air and say that it costs Intel $13.24 for the modem. Then whoever is supplying the stuff that Intel has to buy to make the modem isn't selling at cost either. Eventually, it's all free since the air, water, sand, etc to make all of the stuff is available at your local beach. Apple so greedy! I cringe every September when this post comes out to imply that the iPhone costs $200 to make. Rating: 22 Votes danakin 8 weeks ago Before people lose their spit over how much profit the Cupertonians rake in per device, stop to consider costs for: * Research and Development * Marketing * Shipping * Taxes * Legal * Regulatory compliance * Facilities (leases and sundry expenses) * Salaries and benefits * Warehousing * Product testing * Event planning and management * Internal and Retail training I'm sure there are others but those are at the top of my head. Also if customers and/or suckers (depends on your perspective) choose to dole what what they're asking for, then keep charging what the market will bear. Capitalism folks!

Hardware costs are only a portion of the total costs that go into each device. the fact that the iPhone 7 actually comes with industry standard hardware finally (2gb ram, and the 32gb base storage) and is clearly costing Apple more to produce from a hardware standpoint, it's clear that Apple is lowering margins on iPhone sales, which is kind of the opposite of "greedy" Rating: 14 Votes Cuban Missles 8 weeks ago The cost estimates does not include OS or Software. It does not include marketing and other expenses. It does not include taxes, tariffs, shipping. It does not include profit and investor return. It does not include R&D. When you do, I believe that Apple states gross margins around 40% putting the per phone closer to $400. Rating: 13 Votes Gasu E. 8 weeks ago Cue the "greedy Apple" illiterati.

It's not without flaws and Asus did have to cut some corners here and there, but that was expected from a device that sells for this little. The good sleek and light, decent keyboard, can handle daily tasks and multimedia activities, lasts for a long while on a charge, very affordable The bad miniaturized ports, erratic touchpad, limited on-board storage space Hi everyone, Mike here and in this video we’re going to talk about the Asus EeeBook X205TA / X205, which is a brand new compact laptop selling for only $199 (actually, it’s even cheaper now than initially announced). There are a few other notebooks that go for around the same amount of money these days, like the 11 inch Acer Chromebooks. But this one comes with Windows 8.1 and that allows it to run most of the software you’re already familiar with from your other computers. Well, at least to some extent, as the X205 is not a power-horse, not by far. But we’ll get to that in a few second. First though, check out the specs sheet, so you’ll know what to expect from this laptop, and also the video review, if you don’t feel like reading the block of text (however, some details are not included in the video). The Asus EeeBook X205TA is a compact and affordable Windows laptop The X205TA is not yet available in stores at the time of this post, but the unit I’ve tested is pretty much identical to what you’ll be able to buy in a few weeks. Asus EeeBook X205TA spec sheet Screen 11.6 inch, 1366 x 768 px, TN Hardware Intel Atom BayTrail-T Z3745D CPU and Intel HD graphics Memory 2 GB RAM Storage 32 GB flash-storage Connectivity Wireless N, Bluetooth Ports 2x USB, micro-HDMI, microSD card reader, proprietary PSU, headphone jack Battery 38 Wh OS Windows 8.1 Size 288 mm or 11.3 in (L) x 196 mm or 7.7 in (W) x 18 mm or 0.70 in (H) Weight 954 g (2.10 lbs) Others stereo speakers, available in several colors, webcam The Video Review Hardware and daily use The EeeBook X205TA is primarily meant for light everyday activities. It can then handle browsing between a couple of different tabs, watching video content and listening to music, editing some texts and maybe some pictures as well. It can run Microsoft’s Office suite (does come with a Trial version of Office that requires activation and the final release versions will include a 12 month Office 365 Personal license) and software like Adobe Photoshop if you want to, just make sure you’re not going to ask too much out of it, as it will choke easily if pushed. And that’s because this EeeBook is built on an low-power high-efficiency hardware platform, with an Intel Z3745D processor, bundled with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, which can actually become a problem quite fast. Both the RAM and eMMC storage are soldered and NOT upgradeable. The thing is you’re not left with a lot of spare space after having Windows installed (roughly 14 GB), so Asus definitely had to cut a corner here to meet the low price tag. And that leaves you with two options: either use the included cloud space offered for free in Asus’s WebStorage environment, or expand the storage space with the help of a microSD card. To be frank, I was a bit disappointed this laptop does not support standard sized SD cards, that would have been useful for downloading pictures from my cameras while on the go, but that’s probably not such a big deal for most potential buyers. Overall though, the X205 is a fairly capable little fellow and it can do a lot of things for you. The daily experience is enhanced by the loud and punchy speakers placed on the belly, but towards the front of the chassis and by the fact that this runs completely noiseless, since it houses no fans and no moving parts inside. The EeeBook X205TA is the modern netbook: faster, thinner, lighter than before, and at the same time noiseless The Wi-Fi chip is fairly capable of well. It can’t match my Internet speed, going to only about 30 Mbps near the router, but at least the speed and signal strength don’t drop away fast as you step a bit further. I was able to stream 1080p video content with no buffering and download all sorts of things of the Internet without feeling slow, and in my book that’s good enough for a computer that only sells for $199. The laptop’s belly has no cooling cuts in it, and none are in fact needed, which leads to a simple and beautiful design. You can take it apart by unscrewing the 12 or so regular Philips screws that hold in place and that gives you access to the internals. However, it won’t help much, as everything seems to be soldered on the motherboard. In fact, you can see how small the MB is and how most of this laptop is occupied by the battery, which is also hold in place by a few screws and could be replaced down the line, if needed (and if Asus or third parties will provide replacements). I was hoping to be able to upgrade the storage, but there seem to be no dedicated storage stick like on some of the other mini-laptops I’ve tested, so there’s no way to up the 32 GBs through a hardware upgrade. At least none that I can tell of, and that’s a bit annoying, as the 32 GB of space is hardly sufficient for a Windows 8.1 laptop. You could try to go the Linux road. I planed to try Ubuntu or Mint on this myself, but my Linux knowledge is virtually null and I did not have the time to do it this time. Hopefully in the next few weeks. One final thing I was looking to mention here are temperatures and performance under load. The X205’s case remains cool under light use and the temperatures won’t reach for the stars when running the Prime95+Furmark stress-test either. You can see the numbers in the pictures below. It could be worth mentioning that the internals get to about 80 C under stress and both the CPU and the GPU run and sub-default frequencies (around 900 Mhz for the CPU and 300 Mhz for the GPU), but these should not matter much for the average buyer Asus targets with this laptop, who should understand from starters the the X205 is meant for light casual activities, and not serious chores or multitasking. Keyboard and trackpad The typing experience is not bad on the X205 and is helped by a fairly good keyboard and a nice typing position, thanks to the roomy palm-rest and the laptop’s low profile. The keys are firm and offer decent travel and feedback, for this size range of course, but they do feel a bit cheap to touch, plasticky. And besides these, the layout is vertically cramped, as Asus opted for shorter rectangular keys and not the square keys I was expecting, and the arrow keys are small, just like on the older Asus EeeBooks launched a few years ago. The shorter keys do leave room for the spacious palm-rest mentioned before and an oversized trackpad, which I do appreciate. In everyday use though, the latter proved occasionally erratic and moody, although it worked alright most of the time. But sometimes ti double clicks all by itself or sends the cursor flying to the edges, and these mostly happen when you put the computer under a heavier loud than it can handle. Even so, this is one of the few aspects where the X205 needs extra tweaking. Luckily, the jumpy cursor is usually a software problem and could, at least in theory, be addressed by future drivers updates. We should hold our judgement for further reviews, just keep the potential issues in mind. Design and build quality Now, let’s take a few steps back and have a wider look at this thing. The EeeBook weighs just under 1 kilo, which is about 2.1 pounds. It’s also thin and has a compact footprint, so it will easily fit in a backpack or even a bag. And besides these, it’s fairly tough and definitely doesn’t look bad either. If you’ll grab it firmly and squeeze it, you’ll heard the creaks associated with cheap plastic machines, but judging by how much this thing cost, I’d say it’s more than adequately built and finished. The entire case is made out of soft matte plastic that spreads across the lid, the interior and the belly, with the screen’s bezel being the only black element on this laptop, and Asus will offer the X205 in a few different colors. The materials feel nice to the touch and there’s little to complain about the finishing quality. However, If we’re to get picky, I do have two nits to mention: first of all, the case catches smudges and finger oil easily, which are especially visible on this dark blue version, and second, the lid-cover does flex a little bit, but that doesn’t seem to affect the screen’s integrity in any way, although pressing the lid hard does translate in ripples on the screen, so you might want to get a sleeve for this thing when carrying it in your backpack and be careful not to have many heavy objects sitting on it. And there is one other thing that I’ve noticed: the laptop’s rubber feet seem poorly made and I fear they are going to wear off easily. Time will tell, but again, a minor aspect. Display There’s an 11.6 inch display on this laptop, with 1366 x 768 px resolution, a glossy finishing and a TN panel. The latter translates in rather poor vertical viewing angles, with the Costner and colors quickly fading away, which is characteristic for low priced screens, but even so, as long as you get to look at it heads-on, this aspect shouldn’t bother you much. The screen leans back to about 130-140 degrees, which is not perfect, but will do, and actually lifts itself up on two small plastic feet, which leaves more space underneath the laptop (better cooling) and slightly raises the keyboard (better typing position). I just hope these feet won’t break in time, but they seem solid, so there’s no reason to worry much. The screen lifts up on two small plastic feet In fact, I for one was fairly happy with the display. If you’ll look at the numbers below you might say otherwise. The measured contrast is appalling, the screen having trouble displaying accurate blacks at high brightness. The colors might sound awful as well and the laptop does have a very cool (as in blueish) glow, which could be addressed with the included Splendid app if you enjoy warmer images. But the truth is, when you’re actually using this thing in practice, it’s not going to be that bad as the numbers are suggesting. Panel HardwareID: AU Optronics AUO235C; Coverage: sRGB 58% , NTSC 41%,  SdobeRGB 43%; measured gamma: 2.3 ; max brightness in the middle of the screen: 247 cd/m2 on power; contrast at max brightness: 90:1 (?); white point: 7900 K; black on max brightness: 2.78 cd/m2; average DeltaE: 8.48 uncalibrated, 4.37 calibrated . Asus could have gone with a matte finishing, since this is not a touchscreen anyway, but they decided instead, which is going to affect bright-light legibility. They’re using the same approach on the C200 Chromebook, with whom the x205 might actually share the screen. The screen is a notch better than what’s you’re getting on another $200 computer, the Acer C720 Battery Life I did mention earlier that the EeeBook X205 does last for a long while on a charge, and that was no underestimation. There’s a 38 Wh battery inside this laptop and paired with the efficient hardware, this translated for me in about 10 hours of daily use, that includes browsing through a few different tabs, writing several thousand words, watching a few Youtube clips once in a while and occasionally listening to some music, with Wi-Fi ON, screen at about 60% and the default Power profile (you don’t have Power Modes on this platform). I was also able to loop a 720p .mkv file for about 9 hours in WMP-HC and stream the Big Bunny HD 1080p clip from Youtube for nearly 8 hours. On top of that, the laptop can last in stand-by for weeks and Intel’s Always Connected ability will make sure that all your updates and emails are waiting for you the moment you decide to bring this one out of sleep. It comes with a very compact 10Wh brick and a long cable. Charging the battery from 5 to 99% takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes, providing you’re not doing anything on it during this time. Big battery, compact charger with a long cable – a winning combo Pricing and availability Update: The X205TA is now available in the US and it’s actually cheaper than initially predicted. See this link for details. $199 in the US/CA , 199 euro across the pond and £169.99 in the UK. That’s how much you’ll have to pay for the EeeBook X205TA , starting October 14th, when this little fellow will start shipping. That that was bogus. I can’t say for sure when this thing will actually hit the stores. My Asus contact said (in the first part oc October) that “it’s not coming anytime soon”, but couldn’t provide even a rough estimate.  However, it might reach other countries sooner. Wrap-up At the end of the day, Asus actually did a great job with the EeeBook X205TA, which checks most of the right boxes. After using it for the last week, there’s a single thing that really annoyed me, albeit only occasionally: the trackpad. I was also not happy with the microSD and microHDMI slots (would have preferred full-size versions) or the fingerprint magnet case, but these are definitely not deal-breakers. The limited storage space could be though, you’ll really need to properly organize your content and leave the included partition for Windows, if you don’t want to have to reinstall it fresh once every couple of months. But that’s about it, there’s only that little to complain about on a 200 bucks laptop. That’s why I believe this thing can be a solid travel companion, especially since it’s light, sturdy and lasts for a long while on each charge. It will also do good as a laptop for kids and school, because it’s so affordable that you won’t mind as much if it gets dropped or it breaks. And last but not least, it could be an option for anyone looking for a small inexpensive computer that runs Windows and all the compatible software. There’s not much to complain about the X205TA, that’s why this could be a great Windows-running mini-laptop if you’re on a very tight budget Just make sure you understand what the Atom platform inside this X205 can do and what it can’t and adjust your expectations accordingly. Otherwise, it might prove too slow, but if you do plan on using it for light daily tasks, there’s imh no other more capable mini-laptop you can buy brand-new for $200 these days. Not even a Chromebook. But I’m confident Asus won’t be running free in this segment for long. HP already announced their Stream notebooks for the end of the year, and the other manufacturers will soon follow, which is great for us, the average consumers. Cheap windows laptops are coming back. Netbooks are coming back, only better than before. Are they something many will be interested in? Perhaps, perhaps not… We’ll see. Anyway, there you have it, these were my impressions on the Asus EeeBook X205TA. Let me know what you think about it in the comments section below and post your questions as well, if any, I’ll be around to reply. And if you’re in the market for an affordable and compact laptop, you should definitely check out this post as well.

Reply FILA November 17, 2014 at 9:39 pm no, only the storage was specified in the review where its soldered, nothing was mentioned about the RAM. I was wondering the same thing. I would of bought this and upgraded the RAM but looks like you cant. Sucks. And I doubt using a memory card for RAM will be fast enough wil November 28, 2014 at 12:28 am Thanks for the review was worried fits my needs in front of store now 99us plus 32gb sandisk 9us !!! Henry January 5, 2015 at 8:42 pm I’ve purchased 3 of this Asus X205T and love everything about it, You mention that the 32GB Flash Storage is NOT upgradable, Is that really True? Bumber, maybe there another possible way????? and If i purchase any microSD Card that is maybe anywehre from 64GB to 128GB will the Flash storage of the X205T continue to start using and microSD when the built-in 32GB storage goes to end of line or gets Low on Storage Space. I tried doing all the Window Update on the OS and it ended up using all the Flash Storage and the Windows Update was NOT even finish yet but the good news after using all the storage is that the OS didn’t really Slow Down you can still use the laptop, you just can’t store or install anything else. So…do you know if the microSD card that you attach can actually extend the Life of the current Factory built-in Flash Storage? Andrei Girbea January 6, 2015 at 1:50 pm Yes, the eMMC is not upgradeable from waht I know. And no, the system won’t automaticaly use the microSD card when it runs out of internal space. You’ll have to carefully manage the space yourself and store all your content on the card. Windows updates eats a ton of space, that’s true, but I can’t see a way past that, other than peform only some of the updates.

Mike March 8, 2016 at 12:04 am As Andrei said, it’s mentioned in the review that the RAM and flash storage are not upgradeable: “Both the RAM and eMMC storage are soldered and NOT upgradeable.” What you can do is use a high-capacity Class 10 and install most of your programs there. Some won’t install to an SD card, but most will, including Firefox, Opera, Corel PaintShop Pro X6, LibreOffice, Dropbox, Filezilla, Notepad ++, Foxit PDF Reader, Avira Antivirus and others. Certain programs won’t, and you can’t easily run a virtual machine from the SD card. Overall, it’s a fast computer. My next project: Install Linux (LXLE distro) on this. Richard Sachs March 6, 2016 at 6:20 am Just bought one to replace my HP Stream 11, which I use for travel. Slightly disappointing; 1 as the screen cannot be dimmed all the way and 2, if you do turn the screen off, the computer will go to sleep. I listen to Pandora, much the same as a clock radio, and I like the screen off or at least “auto-off” in a few minutes. The power management does not give you this option as does the HP. Same Windows 8.1 but different options 🙁 I’m ready to put it on ebay! Any help? Reply Jason October 13, 2014 at 2:03 am Excellent review Mike. I’m interested in the 64GB version of this. What are the three LED’s on the left front of the keyboard? I’m hoping one is a drive activity light. TIA Reply Andrei Girbea October 13, 2014 at 2:22 am The first one on the left is drive, the middle one is battery and I can’t remember what the last one is 🙁 . The 64 GB version is a better buy imh as well, but it depends on how much it’s going to cost. $229 would be fair, but not more. Reply Ganesh November 12, 2014 at 4:36 am Bro can I ask you about the charger. Is it like most notebooks where the brick will allow 240v and also 110v that is used in the US? I live in a country with 240v but I am going to US for a holiday and plan to buy the x205. Hope you can help me on this Mathias October 13, 2014 at 12:43 pm Where did you get the release date from? You’re the only one with one, so just wondering Reply Andrei Girbea October 13, 2014 at 3:50 pm Some of the Italian websites reported on this release date a while ago, after a press release in their countries. Knowing Asus though, I’d expect delays. Reply Mathias October 14, 2014 at 2:11 am I’ve been waiting for bay trail laptops for a while now, and this one is really cool. Also badly in need of a laptop, so please do update when you get more info on availability :D! Andrei Girbea October 14, 2014 at 11:22 pm I asked my Asus contact today about this 14th of October date and he couldn’t give a definite answer. All he knew is that over here in Romania it won’t be available this month, but it could be available earlier in the western countries. Will get back if I find out anything. Mathias October 18, 2014 at 9:09 pm A french guy on YouTube told me that “F205TA-BING-FD019B” – A 4GB version of the Eeebook x205 had shown up on several sites in France, noting that it would arrive in the following days. I’m guessing early November, as many sites, including Windows’ blog, notes that it’ll start shipping “in November”. Mathias October 13, 2014 at 12:44 pm Hey, how do you know October 14th is the release date? Can’t seem to find it anywhere else. Reply Fábio October 14, 2014 at 12:01 am Hi. Very informative review, however I still have a few questions. Will the microSD go completely in, so we don’t have to worry about it breaking off by accident? How well does the microphone (and camera) perform when using something like the popular Skype? Is the power supply universal? Or is it standard micro USB like most phones and tables? Reply Andrei Girbea October 14, 2014 at 11:19 pm the MicroSD card goes all in. The Mic and the camera are, well, decent, but not great. Will handle Skype decently in a properly lit room, but if you’re in darker environement everything is going to look noisy and grainy. The Power supply is not universal, it has a proprietary tip (NOT microUSB). Reply Interested in this buddy October 17, 2014 at 4:52 pm Hi. What is maximum capacity of microSD card this laptop supports, and in what speeds, or classes? Reply Andrei Girbea October 17, 2014 at 6:00 pm 64 GB from what I’ve been told, but haven’t tried it, I don’t have such a big card available. Should handle Class 10 without a problem Reply :) October 17, 2014 at 6:12 pm Thx. Any news about launch date in europe? Andrei Girbea October 18, 2014 at 11:43 am no really, not for now hshs October 17, 2014 at 4:59 pm Hello can you have review for HP stream 13 and which is better in case of performance thx Reply Andrei Girbea October 17, 2014 at 6:02 pm I’ll try but can’t promise. Not sure if the HP Streams will be available over here. Performance wise though, they are goign to be close, since they are built on similar hardware Reply MC October 19, 2014 at 2:11 am Hi, thanks a lot for this really great review. Does the screen look really bad? I want to use it for watch few videos sometimes and I’m a bit scared by the x205’s screen quality Reply Andrei Girbea October 19, 2014 at 1:39 pm Depends how you define “Bad”. As long as you’ll watch it straight ON, should be OK. From and angle though, viewing angles are bad. And as you can see from my tests, blacks aren’t great on this and are mostly displayed as dark-grays, that’s why the contrast is poor. Reply SteamDine October 20, 2014 at 10:31 am Excellent review. Question is – will it be linux friendly out of the box , and accept Ubuntu or Mint distribution instead of Win8.1 ? Reply Andrei Girbea October 20, 2014 at 1:32 pm I wanted to try this out by didn’t quite have the time. I might get it back just for this, but my experience with Linux is pretty much none. How’s yours? Can I get in touch via email in case I get this back and get stuck? Reply SteamDine October 22, 2014 at 12:11 pm No problem. I ordered this netbook (amazon pre order), and probable some where in Mid November will try to put the Linux on Any way , you may always try to put Ubuntu or Mint on SD card and try to make it boot from it with no effect on Win8.1 on SDD . Andrei Girbea October 22, 2014 at 7:56 pm I wanted to do that but was a bit short on time when I had this for reviews. Will try to get it again just to try Linux on it. John November 27, 2014 at 6:59 pm I’m really interested in this question as Amazon reviews of this model have people complaining that the BIOS is crippled so that Linux cannot be used at all. With this item on sale Black Friday I have very little time to make purchase decision. eargent October 21, 2014 at 11:28 pm Just found your site, it’s really great. Thanks for the very in depth reviews! Since both this ASUS X205TA and the Acer C720 got a 4/5 from you, would weigh in on which one do you think you would pick? Disregarding that one is Chrome and the other is Windows 8.1, just on performance. Which one would you go for? Maybe you can do a side by side comparison like you did one for the Acer C720 & ASUS C200 in the future. Thanks! Reply Andrei Girbea October 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm Hi, I already posted a comparison on my other website, you can find it here: http://www.ultrabookreview.com/4726-acer-chromebook-c720-vs-asus-chromebook-c200/ As someone who owns the C720 and use it occasionally, I’d probably go with the Asus, as ut runs WIndows and can do things a Chromebook can’t. Chromebooks and Chrome OS are fine if all you need can be done in a browser, but not if you might need specialized software (edit images, maybe a small clip, run a certain program, etc). Besides this, the X205 (or the C200) is fanless, and that matters a lot. On the other hand, the C720 is somewhat snappier, the X205 will choke faster if you try to run multiple things at the same time. Reply ktriebol October 28, 2014 at 3:40 pm Does this laptop run the full version of Windows 8.1, or is it lightened in some way? Reply Andrei Girbea October 28, 2014 at 3:54 pm full version Reply Mike October 28, 2014 at 8:44 pm do you know the supply voltage level of the X205? Reply Andreas October 29, 2014 at 9:42 am Thanks for the review! What is the voltage of the power supply? 12V? 19V? Reply Andrei Girbea October 29, 2014 at 5:22 pm Hmmm, I haven’t checked that out, to be frank. But why is this important? Reply Andreas October 29, 2014 at 5:32 pm We are planning to charge it with a 12V solar system and need to know if that is possible. And I cant find that inforation anywhere else. Andrei Girbea October 29, 2014 at 7:06 pm I see. Well, sry I can’t help you. Daniel October 29, 2014 at 4:14 pm What charging voltage does this Laptop require? Is it possible to charge this with a 12V or is 19V required? Reply ktriebol October 29, 2014 at 10:59 pm Is Windows 8.1 that is installed on this laptop 32 bit or 64 bit? Reply Andrei Girbea October 31, 2014 at 2:17 pm 32 bit Reply Interested October 31, 2014 at 2:20 pm In your opinion does that matter and if yes whats the difference between those two architectures? Andrei Girbea November 1, 2014 at 12:55 pm It shouldn’t. Maybe there are some programs that only worj on the 64bit version, but the vast majority will work on both. And since there’s no way to upgrade RAM on this thing, in which case having a 32 bit OS could have been problematic (32 bit Windows can only use 3.2 GB of RAM). James November 29, 2014 at 4:19 am Is the ASUS capable of running 64 bit windows? Windows 7, or 8 Drivers? The graphics are great I’d just like too see if this little thing can run Left for Dead 2 and some higher end games. porpo November 2, 2014 at 12:36 pm Does the usb of asus x205ta can read an external hard drive? 1tb? Reply Andrei Girbea November 2, 2014 at 1:46 pm yes, it can read USB external hdds Reply Mathias November 2, 2014 at 6:40 pm Have you heard anything about a release in Europe, or other parts of the world? France was supposed to get it, but I haven’t heard or seen anything about a release date. Reply Andrei Girbea November 3, 2014 at 5:04 pm Not more than what I’ve noted in the review Reply Artem November 4, 2014 at 6:41 am Hello! Can I install ubuntu? Will it work in full force? Drivers have a ubuntu on it? Reply Andrei Girbea November 4, 2014 at 4:47 pm Not sure, haven’t tried it Reply Tejas November 5, 2014 at 8:38 am Are there any other laptops coming in the near future which are better than this in the 200$ segment, or would you still suggest this. Reply Andrei Girbea November 5, 2014 at 3:23 pm THere’s the Chromebook C720. Not necesarily better, but different, worth checking out. HP announced their Stream line, starting at $199, but can’t say how good those are going to be yet. Nothing else that I know of. Reply Robin Majumdar November 7, 2014 at 5:10 am Excellent review – thanks for sharing, it’s just been released for ordering here in Canada. Reply Sara November 7, 2014 at 7:26 am Does this laptop have a cd/DVD drive? If so, can it burn CDs? I Reply Andrei Girbea November 7, 2014 at 7:01 pm it doesn’t. you can buy an external DVD drive and use it to play/burn dvds and cds Reply Bruce November 10, 2014 at 12:29 pm Will programs run from an attached hard drive or micro SD? Reply Andrei Girbea November 10, 2014 at 1:03 pm Yes Reply Benjamin November 12, 2014 at 3:40 pm Is it possible to see which eMMC module this is using ? Reply Peter November 13, 2014 at 9:29 pm Do you have any idea at all when the 64gb version will be available? I haven’t been able to find any information at all. Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:08 pm No, no idea right now. And I can’t say for sure whether a 64 GB model will actually be available at all. Reply Brad December 13, 2014 at 11:52 pm Hi.

Also, is the memory expandable? Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:09 pm the Memory is soldered and not expandable. As for LOL, no, I’d say it wouldn’t be playable even on the lowest settings in 13 x 7 Reply Robert Tau November 15, 2014 at 12:03 am Funny, entertaining, and informative! Thanks for the great article! Looking forward to your review on the HP Stream notebooks… Reply Greg November 15, 2014 at 5:23 am I just purchased this for my wife from the Microsoft website. Have read on Amazon reviews that people have put in a 120 GB card and it worked fine. Even if just a 64 works you are still going to end up with about 80gb to play with. For web surfing a back up pc, I don’t see how one can go wrong. By the way, $179 at Microsoft right now, run don’t walk! Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:10 pm But the card does not sit flush when connected, which is annoying. There might be some sollution to use a microSD card and a special adapter though, so the card won’t potrude on the side. Reply Prabin November 16, 2014 at 5:16 am How well does office 13 perform on it? Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:13 pm Decent as well as you don’t mind waiting for things to load and don’t plan to use huge excel files Reply Jon January 28, 2015 at 4:17 pm So does that mean that multi page excel spreadsheets with calculations connected between the page like loan calculators will be show or will the computer just freeze?? Andrei Girbea January 28, 2015 at 11:21 pm Should show. Will probably take a while to load. Can’t tell for sure cause I don’t know how complex those excells are. DO they lag on a regular computer? If yes, than the X205TA will perform poorer, if not, you should be alright. Ruf November 17, 2014 at 11:32 pm The touchpad issue is a “deal breaker”. Lots of complaints about the lack of scrolling w/ Smart Gesture. What’s worse is that ASUS doesn’t have a fix. Stay away from netbook for now. Reply Jay November 18, 2014 at 8:13 pm Thanks for pointing out that storage cannot be upgraded. That’s what I was concerned about and the reason I wouldn’t buy it. It’s on sale today at BestBuy for $140. You should definitely try Linux. For this small computer, try PCLinuxOS 32-bit KDE-minime. Much better than LinuxMint (which is the OS I use for all my computers) for newbies (have installed it for my 10 and 12 year old grandchildren and they love it) because it works well in 1G of RAM and uses less than 3G of HD space. Somewhat XP-like (as is Mint). Ubuntu is more like Win8. You can easily test it on a bootable CD or USB which this Asus supports through its USB ports. Thanks for your article and YouTube video. You may want to read about the advantages/disadvantages of Linux at starkman.com/articles/Linux4CPAs.shtml Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:19 pm Thanks, I’ll look into Linux in the future. Planned to do it for this laptop but didn’t quite have the time for it Reply John November 28, 2014 at 9:21 pm Jay, have you successfully used Linux on this specific model? In the Amazon reviews for this model multiple people say that the model has a crippled BIOS which can’t boot Linux. Reply Sven November 19, 2014 at 3:27 am Can it really handle Photoshop and basic photo editing (300 pics in-row): captioning/color/saturation/cropping/light adjustments etc.? How about smooth youtube / netflix viewing? Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:20 pm Youtube and Netlfix FHD are smooth if you’re not running antyhing else at the same time. But I don’t think it can handle batches of 300 pics in photoshop. I’d stick to an older version of Photoshop (CS2, for example) and batches ot 10 pics at a time Reply Phil November 20, 2014 at 7:22 am Great in-depth review and video! I also liked your review of the ASUS T100. Which would you recommend of the two? I have read lots of reviews of the T100 and played with it in store. The keyboard is fine for me. I don’t NEED touch, though it might be fun as a tablet. I just want something I can take away on holiday and use with a full version of Word and Firefox for a work plugin. So something light and cheap, in case it gets stolen. The X205 is cheaper here in Australia – about AUD$145 cheaper – even with the T100 on sale. Anyhow, any opinion would be helpful. I know the specs, I just want to know the gut-feeling from somebody who has used both for some weeks. Thanks! Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:24 pm Difficult to compare the two. This thing is basic and cheap, the T100 is a 2-in-1 with a touchscreen and can be used for things the X205 cannot (as a tablet, for reading, watching movies, etc). The T100 also comes with Office included (not sure if that’s the case in AUS as well, check it out). IN the end it’s up to you to decide if the T100 is worth paying extra. Reply Phil November 20, 2014 at 7:23 am Also, will this boot from a USB stick? I want to install Windows 10 technical preview on it. Cheers.

Reply Andrei Girbea November 26, 2014 at 7:55 pm Thank you. I’m not a native English writer, as you can probably tell, so mistakes do slip up. I hope the value of the content rises above these, but if you don’t mind and have the time, maybe you could point me towards those “dozen others”? I’d really apreciate that. Thank you in advance. Reply Kevin December 3, 2014 at 10:56 pm Are you serious Phil? Are you so narrow minded that you can’t imagine that some people do not use English as their native language? You should be embarrassed for yourself. Reply Bruce November 26, 2014 at 11:08 pm Phil, I’m embarrassed for you – there are two r’s in embarrassed 🙂 Reply Ryan November 26, 2014 at 11:49 pm Thanks for your review. I had thought it’s an old model, yet it turns out to be recently released one. Does it even weigh less than an 11-inch Apple MBA (2.4lbs)? That’s really impressive even considering its plastic material. What I concern is its 2G RAM. Do you need to wait long for initiating a business app like Word or Excel? Reply Andrei Girbea November 27, 2014 at 1:26 pm those apps should start decently fast. howeve,r if you load big files, that will take a while Reply edchris November 27, 2014 at 3:29 am Someone above asked about the charge voltage. I have an older EEE, running XP, that the charger crapped out on, was hoping this one would fit both. It doesn’t, the ends are different. However the voltages are the same. They all accept 120-240V input, the out puts are 19V. I’m not sure why they didn’t use the more common 12V output, but it says right on the charger-output 19V DC. Reply Ganesh November 27, 2014 at 2:53 pm Thanks bro for your answer. So I can use the US brick in a country that has 240V? You sure? Reply edchris November 27, 2014 at 3:33 am I just picked one up in Canada on Nov 26, my older EEE had the “P” key quit, & I can’t charge the battery. Tried a new battery, won’t take a charge, so I said screw it & spent $219 CDN for the new X205 Still getting used to Window 8,(the old one was XP). The Company gives us Ipads, but for a workstation I like the keyboard & touchpad, along with MS Office. Pretty limited use so far, but it seems fine for use during all the time I spend on planes. the biggest pain I found is it won’t transfer from XP, & I wish it was a full size SD Card. Reply Ryan November 27, 2014 at 5:02 pm Hey bro, where did you get your X205TA? BestBuy or Staples? I am also thinking about getting one. Reply Dave November 28, 2014 at 4:16 am Staples has them for $99 today only. Just ordered one in store. Jo November 28, 2014 at 4:12 am Does the X205TA run online and downloadable games well? Sims, roller coaster tycoon etc. Reply Andrei Girbea November 28, 2014 at 12:49 pm Very old PC games, maybe. But it’s not made for games Reply Lloyd G LeCain November 28, 2014 at 5:25 am Could you upgrade to 8.1 pro? Can you use a mouse with it?

I read from another blog, which mentioned that there is Office365 Personal. Reply Andrei Girbea November 28, 2014 at 12:51 pm It doesn’t from what I know. The HP Stream 11 is another $199 laptop that does though Reply Moety November 28, 2014 at 1:43 pm I purchased this as a early black friday deal without reading the specifications. However after using this laptop much to my surprise it worked well. The size is small but it works great for traveling, this will replace the tablet just due to the keyboard. Value for regular use is awesome. Your review was very detailed and the pro’s were enough for me to purchase two. Thanks. Reply Courtney November 29, 2014 at 6:06 pm Hello As far as printing docs, how does that work? I was considering a chrome book, but printing seemed complicated( I am less tech savvy and will use better if it’s wireless or “cord” printer). I also needed skype or tango and the chrome book did not have that either. Second question: is it possible to “lock” screens so my 13 month old can “play” without deleting something Reply Courtney November 29, 2014 at 6:22 pm I thought of another question- How can I upload pictures from smartphone and camera? Reply Skylar November 29, 2014 at 7:19 pm I think the sale is over, but I picked this up in Canada from the Microsoft store for $179CDN (205CDN/$180USD after tax+shipping). I popped in a 64gb microSD for another $25. I then redirected my basic folders (documents, pictures downloads, etc.) to go to the SD card to leave the HD available for program files and such. I’ve been running Outlook, OneNote, Word, 15 tabs in Chrome, and paint.Net simultaneously before getting a memory error (once I push up to 25 tabs in Chrome that happens). I also clocked a full 12 hours of battery life with this sort of use. At the size, weight, battery life, and full laptop functionality, this has definitely killed my use of tablets. Reply humming bird November 29, 2014 at 9:13 pm I got it yesterday for 179.99 from best buy. I think I was a bit frustrated for a while but I could def use this for quite sometime. great review! I have smudges all over mine after a night of use. lol Reply Courtney November 30, 2014 at 7:12 am Hello I am not very tech savvy. Can you let me know how printing docs works on this laptop? I was considering a chrome book, but heard of having to use external ports to print( sounded confusing); I need ability to print wirelessly or from a “plugged in” printer Skype or tango use is important, can the asus do that ? Lastly, I liked that you could ” secure” the chrome book, so my 1 year can ” play” on laptop without me worrying he deleted or accessed important content. Can ASus do this? Thanks for dealing with my “elementary PC language and knowledge”, I appreciate it! Reply Ryu December 3, 2014 at 1:32 am Hi, I recently picked this up for $99. I discovered that there was an 8 gb recovery partition made that I cannot delete or even use. I tried deleting it thru dishonest means, and it crashed. Upon reboot, I was greeted by the message that my PC needs to be repaired, due to error 0xc0000225. I can only get the UEFI Firmware Settings to start up, along with Startup settings. Is there any way to restore this system to factory settings? The old videos about disabling boot booster and mashing on the F9 key etc don’t apply here, because there IS no boot booster. (And I just have no idea what the hell I’m talking about.) MAIN THING: Can someone help me restore this laptop before I head to Staples for an exchange/refund?

I just ordered 1 from Staples online for $149 since I will be in the US in about a week or so. Here in France, it’s available for about 254€ (wtf !!) on Amazon, or else in 1 or 2 electronics shops for 219€, which is still about 100€ more than Staples. Doesn’t seem to be available anywhere else. Why such an enormous difference in price??? Reply Tobbe December 15, 2014 at 9:13 pm Yeah, the European price is ridiculous compared to what it sells for in the US. Too bad the US keyboard has one less key than most European keyboards 🙁 Makes it that much harder to use for us with alphabets with more characters than in the English alphabet. Reply GabsJL December 18, 2014 at 2:49 pm Yes, you’re right about the keyboard. I probably won’t be using it for long texts or emails in French, Spanish or Italian, but for web browsing, Short emails, watching films…it should be fine. Will love the look on people’s faces when I say how much I paid for it though lol ! Brenden December 7, 2014 at 5:14 pm I see 3 open connectors on the motherboard. Two to the right of the wifi card, and the third one on the top right below the lcd screen connection. 3-5 inches from the other two connectors. Any idea what they could be for?

I bought a 64gb micro SD card, and all is well. I had some issues with my wifi and downloaded their latest patch, BAD idea, now I can’t connect that to any wireless. Fortunately, I had a mini usb wifi adapter that works fine, but with the wireless mouse, I’m out of ports. Any idea on the location of the original drivers? I’ve emailed ASUS, and got a reply from them with tomorrow’s date. Guess I’ve crossed the date line overseas. Thank you Reply Beherid January 23, 2015 at 10:45 am Added all the updates and no problems. The Wi-Fi is great, it rarely drops, if at all. Reply Dennis December 25, 2014 at 7:56 pm Andrei Girbea, great review. I am wondering why there is no premium model. Here are some drawbacks, both Intel and Asus fault. This is what I want in a premium version of this laptop. 1. A 64Gb eMMC 2. 4Gb memory (in memory slot), with 32bit you only get about 3.4Gb of memory you can use, but it is a must to have 4Gb of memory with Win7, Win8 2. Standard HDMI-port 3. Separate headphone and mic jacks 4. Stanard SD and Micro SD slot (128Gb support if possible). 5. Option to install a mSSD card in the unit. (I have been wondering why this is not possible for a long time, in tablets and other units. This could remove the need for large SD-card storage. 6. IPS screen display 7. All the port should be up where screen is and not so close to where you have your hands when using the computer. It is nice to see that finaly some small netbooks are comming back. Tablets are fine but it they are not for everyone, I like small computers like my asus eee PC 102b that has worked wonders. It is old, slow but has everything I need in a small portable computer. As of now, the Acer Aspire E-11/ E3-111 option is better for me, just add more ram and a SSD and you have Macbook Air 11 but far cheaper and running full windows. To bad this computer is low budget, would love to see this one in a more premium version as it would be the perfect replacement for a tablet. Great review ! Reply Audrey December 31, 2014 at 11:22 am Hi there!

Try pluging it in. Press and keep pressed the power buton for several seconds (up to 10). Do the same thing 2-3 times if it doesn’t boot up after the first try. As a side note, is there any sound coming out of the laptop when those lights are lit? Put you ear next to the back and tell me if you hear anything at all? I wonder if the laptop actually boots but the screen isn’t disconnected, thus there’s nothing diplayed. Either way, if the computer doesn’t start after these, you should get in touch with the shop. You might have been sent a defective unit 🙁 Reply some dude March 22, 2015 at 11:31 pm curious as to what sound you would expect a machine with no hard drive and no fan to be emitting during bootup… anonCA April 9, 2015 at 6:57 pm @some dude – You would hear the high pitch frequencies of an active processor. Not an obvious sound from normal distance, but you can definitely hear something going on with an ear pressed against the laptop. dhruv June 13, 2015 at 2:38 pm Hey I’m having the same issue with mine.

Thanks, Reply Max February 27, 2015 at 1:31 pm re Steve’s problem – when mine wouldn’t turn on, I phoned ASUS; turned out the trick was to hold the power button down for a full 30 seconds (maybe that turns it fully off when it’s in a confused coma, after which it can be started normally). This isn’t mentioned in the manual. The service rep was polite, but took 15 minutes to reveal this solution. Two-finger “SmartGesture” scrolling on the trackpad stops working; rebooting reactivates it for me, but someone said ending this process in Task Manager worked for them. I still don’t know how to stop the cursor from flying to random spots at times while I’m trying to type, but I suspect it comes from accidentally brushing the trackpad. If so, the solution may be to plug in a mouse and disable the trackpad. Reply Sydney April 17, 2015 at 2:54 am Thank you so much! I was having the same problem and this worked perfectly.

I have a question about memory and storage that I’m a little confused about after reading this paragraph: “And that’s because this EeeBook is built on an low-power high-efficiency hardware platform, with an Intel Z3745D processor, bundled with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, which can actually become a problem quite fast. Both the RAM and eMMC storage are soldered and NOT upgradeable. The thing is you’re not left with a lot of spare space after having Windows installed (roughly 14 GB), so Asus definitely had to cut a corner here to meet the low price tag. And that leaves you with two options: either use the included cloud space offered for free in Asus’s WebStorage environment, or expand the storage space with the help of a microSD card.” Can you add or expand the memory using a microSD card? The first paragraph kinda seems like a no and the second kinda sounds like a yes. PS your review is very thorough and good- I’m 100% sure that my confusion is due to my lack of knowledge. Reply Andrei Girbea November 3, 2015 at 1:16 am Hi Lane, yes you can expand the storage space with a microSD card. The first paragraph tells you the internal storage space, the 32 GB eMMC, cannot be upgraded. Sry for the confusion.

Reply Muhammad November 24, 2015 at 9:19 pm I bought this laptop manufacturer refurbished for $220 CAD, with the intention for using this exclusively for studies and work. This machine fits that category appropriately. Space is not an issue. After Windows you’re left with around 22 GB. I have a 64 GB Micro SD and a 128 GB USB; but anything from 16 to 32 GB should suffice. Don’t forget cloud storage options for potentially limitless capabilities. Browsing the web, watching and streaming videos, playing music and other processes work perfectly on this machine. It was meant for something like this. I do not game on this machine. Even for a refurbished product I average ten and a half hours of daily use. If I watch videos exclusively for most of its life, I average eight hours which is outstanding. The real kicker for me is the battery life and portability. I can spend one day at school or work with this laptop on one charge. I only ever charge this when I’m not using it or during downtime. But this feature is absolutely critical for me. If you want something to travel with or just use in general but lightly, this is what you need. It beats having a Chrome OS and its limited capabilities. I have been using this laptop for almost three months and have had no issues. Kudos to you, ASUS. Not sure how you pulled this off.

Bricked… No recovery protocol, it took 8 attempts to get Asus North America to issue and RMA (never never never lose your invoice – best to scan and upload it to google photos-) Finally it is back at the Asus repair depot. Waiting to see how they do. Worst thing was I bought it for travel and ended up lugging a dead machine across Japan. Asus service was useless at handing me over to Asus Japan, had to wait until I got back, then 7 more attempts before they agreed it was in warranty and issued the RMA So, barely worth what it cost, even on sale Reply constance bryant July 14, 2016 at 7:09 am You are righto n regarding this asus eeebook.

Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaard-skin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. De belangrijkste veranderingen die in bèta 2 zijn doorgevoerd zijn hieronder voor je samengevat. Fixes done in Beta 2: Any game controller was non function due to recent refactoring. This has now been fixed with the added bonus of deadzone settings for joypads. PVR section got a variety of fixed ranging from usability to possible crashing Fix possible issue if internet stream used a redirect Fix “could not connect to repository” popup No longer handle data migrations from pre-Kodi v14 versions. Add fallback path to Kodi settings if the skin you use hasn’t received an update yet Several fixes done to passthrough audio handling Fix possible crash on loading context menu add-ons Add Android Nougat new passthrough audio API which special thanks to Google developers for adding this. De-interlacing setting underwent some changes recently and some problems came to light. Skin and add-on updating doesn’t check for dependencies if they are not in a repository. From now on on any upgrade Kodi we will go through all available updates and install them before starting Kodi. Fix DPI unawareness on Windows where it would start in the zoomed in if it wasn’t set to 100% Thanks to Microsoft for giving us the correct way of solving it.

(Leuk voordeel dat hij ook op MN NAS staat ) Maar helaas nog steeds geen shared library, dus als ik aflevering X van serie Y heb gezien wordt dat niet bijgehouden op elke kodi player. (Tenzij je handmatig een script en database maakt, maar dat gaat mijn kennis te boven) +2 kroegtijger @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:08 MySQL database en alles wordt netjes bijgehouden. Enige nadeel is dat je wel alle KODI-versies gelijk moet houden omdat bij versie-updates ook de database wordt bijgewerkt. Verder werkt het perfect, en wordt zelfs de EPG daar netjes in bijgewerkt. Afhankelijk van je NAS kan je dat daar ook prima op kwijt. Heeft niets met scripting van doen, en met een minimum aan inzet kan je ook zonder enige db-kennis dat draaiend krijgen. Is links en rechts nog wel wat ruimte voor verbetering in hoor, zoals dus versie-beheer, maar ook bijvoorbeeld addons e.d. zou prettig zijn als dat centraal te regelen valt. +1 rbr320 @kroegtijger • 20 september 2016 21:07 Enige nadeel is dat je wel alle KODI-versies gelijk moet houden omdat bij versie-updates ook de database wordt bijgewerkt.Geldt dat alleen voor de major version zoals Kodi 16/17, of ook voor de minor version (Kodi 16.0/16.1)? In het eerste geval lijkt het me namelijk te doen, maar als je ook de minor version exact gelijk moet houden wordt het een stuk lastiger. +2 kroegtijger @rbr320 • 20 september 2016 21:43 Over het algemeen zijn het alleen de majors, maar op de wiki kun je het hele overzicht bekijken en zien welke versies met elkaar overweg kunnen. Zie hiervoor http://kodi.wiki/view/Database_versions Zoals je kan zien is bijvoorbeeld tussen 17 Alpha 1, Alpha 2 en Alpha 3 een verschil in versie in MyVideos, maar is dat verschil er niet tussen Alpha 3 en Beta 1. Meestal houden ze het wel "beschaafd" en zijn databaseupdates beperkt tot volledig nieuwe versies (alpha's zijn zogezegd work in progress, en dus kan je daar verschillen in verwachten. Beta's zijn meer voor het eruit halen van bugs en daar is de kans dus al een stuk kleiner dat er naar een nieuwe db wordt uitgeweken). Een uitleg over MySQL en Kodi kun je vinden op http://kodi.wiki/view/MySQL maar er zijn ook andere methoden dan MySQL. UPnP kan bijvoorbeeld ook maar er is ook een AddOn die het zou kunnen. Persoonlijk ben ik meer liefhebber van de MySQL-oplossing omdat het de meest universele methode is, en je er het makkelijkst ook weer andere bewerkingen op los kan laten. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het manipuleren van content, genereren van listings, backup/restore mogelijkheden etc. +1 Bliksem B @rbr320 • 20 september 2016 22:29 [...] Geldt dat alleen voor de major version zoals Kodi 16/17, of ook voor de minor version (Kodi 16.0/16.1)? In het eerste geval lijkt het me namelijk te doen, maar als je ook de minor version exact gelijk moet houden wordt het een stuk lastiger.Volgens mij ook bij 16.1 en 16.0, niet bij fixes. Andere oplossing om het shared library probleem op te lossen, kan door gebruik te maken van de interne UPNP server: je draait 1 kodi als UPNP server en vervolgens voeg je deze in je library. Een andere oplpossing (welke ik zelf gebruik) is door Emby server te gebruiken. Lijkt op Plex, alleen ze hebben een gratis native add-on voor Kodi. Deze synct al je bestanden inc waar je gebleven was. Emby heeft als voordeel dat je voortaan ok je bestanden overal te wereld kunt benaden via een webinterface (zoals plex). Ook is Emby wat groffer qua indexeren van bestanden. [Reactie gewijzigd door Bliksem B op 20 september 2016 23:00] 0 MacPoedel @Bliksem B • 25 september 2016 14:29 Er is ondertussen voor Plex een heel gelijkaardige add-on (eigenlijk gewoon een herschreven versie van de add-on voor Emby) die toelaat om Plex als backend te gebruiken van je Kodi bibliotheek. https://forums.plex.tv/di...et-kodi-talk-to-your-plex Verder doen Plex en Emby grotendeels hetzelfde, maar moet zeggen dat ik de apps (althans de Android app en de web interface) voor Plex beter vind dan die van Emby. +1 EdwinB @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:10 Ik gebruik de website (en Kodi plugin) Trakt.tv om te synchroniseren. Extra voordeel is dat je dan altijd je kijkhistorie hebt en bij een herinstallatie van Kodi weet je dus ook meteen weer wat je al gezien hebt. +1 Ultimo @EdwinB • 20 september 2016 20:43 Dit lijkt me de beste oplossing in mijn geval, dank! +1 tcviper @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 19:59 Daar hebben ze iets voor gevonden: Plex of Emby +1 Dimiz @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:01 NAS > Plex rPI > OpenELEC > PlexKodiConnect Zo synct ie alles ;)! Ik kijk overal buiten de deur via Kodi m'n series/films, en als ik thuiskom ga ik direct weer verder op m'n TV! Soms in bed nog klein stukje op de telefoon . +1 Dacuuu @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:07 Gebruik de Upnp functie van kodi, dan heb je wel een shared library. +1 Tidaku @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:07 Dat kan heel simpel met de plugin watchedlist. Je kan daarmee ook je afspeelstatus naar de cloud uploaden. +1 cypro66 @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 22:16 voor het syncen van wat je gekeken kun je de Trakt.tv intergratie gebruiken.. Dat werkt heel handig is eenvoudig te configuren. Account aanmaken op Trakt.tv en plugin in Kodi installeren. That’s it. +1 mykieonline 20 september 2016 20:06 Of je gebruikt een mySQL database als shared library: http://kodi.wiki/view/MySQL Zo heb ik het hier thuis draaien, waarbij ik beneden een windows machine heb staan met kodi, en boven een RPI met openelec. En ik heb op mijn android tablet kodi draaien, maar die gebruik ik eigenlijk nooit. Alledrie verwijzen ze naar de centrale mySQL database. Nadeel is wel dat als er een nieuwe kodi versie uitkomt, ik niet kan upgraden tot er ook een upgrade van de openelec versie is, want anders gaat het soms mis. +1 Idiocracy @mykieonline • 20 september 2016 20:11 Ga voor https://libreelec.tv/ Is 1op1 vervangen die wel gewoon geupdate word +1 Nelissuh @mykieonline • 21 september 2016 10:56 Daarom ben ik overgestapt van OpenElec op OSMC. LibreElec (afsplitsing van OpenElec) is ook een alternatief. OSMC en LibreElec zijn beide veel sneller met updates dan OpenElec. +1 callofduty 20 september 2016 20:09 Ik draai nu Emby op mijn server maar wat is het verschil met Kodi ? +1 ThaStealth @callofduty • 20 september 2016 20:30 Emby is een media library manager die je als plugin in Kodi kunt krijgen. Zo zorgt Emby ervoor dat alle media die je op een player kijkt bijgehouden word (zodat je op een andere player kan verder kijken). Ook heeft Emby de mogelijkheid om via de browser te spelen. +1 Ome Ernst 20 september 2016 20:53 Doordat de RTL XL app versie 1.1.2 onder deze versie niet werkt, is de WAF factor helaas wat lager. Ook gaat bij mij op spontane momenten de TV aan, dit in combinatie met CEC.. Op dit item kan niet meer gereageerd worden.

I’ve noticed that this condition is especially true on laptops. Normally, the disk usage will go up to or close to 100% for a few seconds or even for a couple of minutes, but then should settle down to something more reasonable (usually under 10%). If you consistently see a very high disk usage, it means there is something else going on that isn’t quite right. To start, you can check your disk usage by opening up the Task Manager in Windows 10. You can either right-click on the Start button and select Task Manager or you can press CTRL + SHIFT + ESC. If you just see a small list of apps, click on More details at the bottom. On the main Processes tab, you’ll see a quick overview of the CPU, Memory, Disk and Network utilization. For me, unless I’m doing something on the computer, the disk usage is normally right around 0. In a bad case, you’ll see something like below where disk usage is 100% or very close to it. In some cases, you might see just one process that is causing the high disk usage, but in other instances, the process that is causing the spike may change. Now let’s talk about how we can determine what is causing the issue and then come up with a solution. In some cases, the solution is easy and in others, it’s a bit trickier. Before we get into those, here’s what you shouldn’t do. Don’t Try These Solutions On the web, I came across a whole bunch of solutions that just didn’t settle well with me because they can cause more problems later on. Try to avoid doing anything listed below: Disabling the BITS service – It’s required by Windows for your PC to be updated and it won’t help disabling it. Disabling Windows Search or Superfetch – Again these are core Windows services and you should not disable them. Modifying Page File – You should leave it so that Windows manages the page file. Don’t try custom values. Disabling Windows Defender – Except for Method 6, don’t disable Defender. Method 1 – Upgrade Firmware for SSDs If you have an SSD installed on your machine and are having the disk usage problem, it’s most likely a problem with the firmware. SSDs are fast and unless you have some program that is accessing the disk all the time, it really should never be at 100% for more than a few seconds. Here are a couple of links to the SSD firmware updates for some of the major brands: Crucial, Samsung, Kingston, Intel, OWC. Method 2 – Perform a Clean Boot If you have never performed a clean boot, now is the time to learn. A clean boot basically loads Windows with the fewest drivers and startup programs. A clean boot will help you determine whether the issue is being caused by Windows itself or by a third-party program installed on Windows. Microsoft has a great article on how to perform a clean boot. I recommend trying it because is usually fixes a lot of other issues too. It’s a bit time-consuming, but totally worth the effort. Just set aside a few hours on a weekend to get it done. If you find that everything loads fine on a clean boot, then slowly enable each startup program one by one until you determine which program is causing the slowdown. You can then uninstall it or disable it. For starters, always start by disabling any third-party anti-virus/anti-malware program as those programs can have a tendency to access the disk all the time. In online forums, I’ve heard a lot of people complain that Skype was the cause of the disk usage spike. So try uninstalling Skype and see if that works. Method 3 – Upgrade Memory (RAM) Another thing you want to check is to see how much RAM you have installed on your machine. Since Windows 10 can run on older devices, I’ve seen a lot of people install it on old desktops and laptops. This is fine, but you need to make sure the machine has a decent amount of RAM, meaning nothing less than 4 GB. You can also open Task Manager and click on Performance and then click on Memory. As you can see, I have 16 GB of memory and about 6 GB is in use. This means if you have 4 GB of RAM on your computer, all the memory would be exhausted. Everything that can’t be fit into memory is paged to the hard disk. So basically Windows will use your hard disk as a temporary memory device. If you have a lot of data that has to be written to disk, it will cause your disk usage to spike and your computer to slow down. If you notice that the line in this graph is close to the top, then it means you probably need to upgrade the RAM on the computer. Method 4 – Use High Performance Power Plan With some computers, the hard drives are smart and will try to power down or change RPM to save power. One example is the green/blue Western Digital hard drives. It sounds like a great feature, but I don’t think it really works all the well in practice. To avoid this problem, go to Power Options and select the High Performance power plan. In addition, click on Change plan settings and then expand Turn off hard disk after and set the minutes to 0. This will ensure that the hard disk does not power down or go into the low power state, which can cause the disk usage problem. Method 5 – Disable MSI Mode This solution is more obscure and probably won’t help most people, but it’s worth mentioning because Microsoft has specifically stated that this is an issue in Windows 10. Basically, it has something to do with AHCI, which is technical jargon you don’t need to know. When you have this issue, Disk Usage will show 100%, but when you sort the column, there isn’t any particular program or process that is showing high disk usage. You can read the Microsoft KB article here and attempt the fix. Method 6 – Disable Windows Defender with 3rd Party AV By default, Windows Defender should disable itself if you have third-party anti-virus installed on your system. However, in some instances, this does not happen and running two anti-virus programs at the same time can cause excessive disk usages and a bunch of other problems. To check if Windows Defender is disabled or not, click on Start, then Settings, Update & Security and then Windows Defender. Make sure Real-Time protection and Cloud-based Protection are turned Off. Again, you should ONLY do this if you have third-party anti-virus installed on your system. Method 7 – Disable Windows Notifications This solution has been widely distributed on the Internet, but I’m not sure whether it really works or not. I believe it does for certain versions of Windows 10. Anyway, it doesn’t really hurt to disable it, so that’s why I’m going to mention it. Basically, you disable extra Windows notifications that are basically advertisements. Go to Settings, then click on System, and then Notifications and Actions. Simply turn off the Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows. It’s worth noting that all your normal notifications will work just fine, you just won’t see any useless ones from Microsoft. Method 8 – Check Hard Disk for Errors If nothing above is working, then you could actually have a problem with your hard drive. There are several ways to check the health of your hard drive, which I’ve written about before. Check Disk and System Files Check Hard Drive for Errors In many instances, repairing errors on the drive fixed the problem. In other instances, replacing the drive was necessary. Hopefully, one of the above solutions will work for you. One last resort option is to perform a clean install of Windows 10, which will fix the problem for anyone who happens to have malware installed on their systems and maybe don’t know it. If you have any questions, feel free to comment. Enjoy! September 20th, 2016 by Aseem Kishore File in: Windows 10 There are 0 comments, care to add yours?

It's packed with features, but should you buy it? By: Tyler Bernath | SOHO NAS/DAS in Storage | Posted: Sep 20, 2016 4:20 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 83%Manufacturer: QNAP Page 1 [Introduction] Page 1 [Introduction] Page 2 [QNAP TVS-682] Page 3 [Test System Setup and Web Management] Page 4 [Benchmarks – Single Client and SMB Performance] Page 5 [SMB Workloads] Page 6 [Power Consumption and Final Thoughts] Introduction     After a long hiatus, I managed to get my hands-on one of the latest appliances from QNAP, a six-bay NAS, but not in the standard form factor one would expect. Instead, this solution uses four 3.5" bays and two 2.5" bays, but that's not all.     The TVS x82 series covers quite a range of appliances including a 12, 8 and the six bay we have in house. These are all planted on the Intel Skylake platform and use an H series chipset. In using a desktop platform for this appliance, QNAP has opened an entire world of possibilities with this NAS including the ability to use a dedicated GPU if you go with the 450W PSU model. Adding to that functionality, this solution is ready for your 10 and 40GBe NICs and can also handle expansion for USB 3.1. These capabilities are being served up for businesses, professionals, and some enthusiasts looking for a purpose-built unit for tiered storage.     The best way to show what this solution has to offer is to look at the graphic above; QNAP has packed this NAS with high-level components, and that starts with dual m.2 functionality at the top next to full height DDR4 memory slots and for our sample a Core i3-6100 processor. Again with the PCIe expansion slots, you can fit any number of options into the chassis while the rear panel will give you plenty of connectivity with four Gigabit Ethernet ports, three HDMI port along with built-in speakers.     With all of the above, the QNAP TVS-682 with Core i3-6100 and 8G of memory is holding an MSRP of $1299.99 with a two-year warranty.

(AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) 2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Earnings Recent Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc.

(CSCO) Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Can’t Count on a Save From Santa Claus Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and United States Steel Corporation (X) View All Posts Optimism appears to be in the air on Wall Street, with U.S. stock futures pointed higher as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting to discuss monetary policy. The Fed will deliver its decision tomorrow afternoon, after the Bank of Japan delivers its own judgment on the Japanese economy. Until then, August building permits and housing starts are the only economic data on tap. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.31%, while S&P 500 futures up 0.36% and Nasdaq-100 futures rising 0.35%. Monday’s options activity retreated sharply in the wake of Friday’s September-expiration driven flood. Overall, a below-average 14.1 million calls and 11.9 million puts changed hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, calls were in demand as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to 0.56, while the 10-day moving average ticked lower to 0.63. 9 Dividend Stocks for a Full Calendar of Safe Income Providing fuel for Monday’s options volume, analysts at Citi issued a bullish research note and boosted their price target on Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). Meanwhile, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) call activity remained elevated after the company boosted third-quarter guidance on Friday. Finally, GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) was hit with a wave of call activity after the company unveiled the new Hero5 and the Karma drone cameras.  Facebook Inc (FB) If you are worried about a slowdown in Facebook’s ad load growth or competition from Snapchat, Citi has your back. The brokerage firm reiterated its bullish stance on FB stock yesterday, and lifted its price target to $158 from $148, implying a 22% upside from current levels. While Citi admitted that competition was a serious concern, it thinks Facebook’s ad load should grow significantly more than current expectations to hit the Street’s lofty earnings targets. Options traders appeared to tentatively agree in Monday’s trading action. Volume came in at 328,000 contracts, and while calls accounted for 56% of the day’s take, the call percentage of daily volume was below average for FB stock. Facebook’s September/October put/call open interest ratio also shows a bit of trepidation, arriving at 0.88, which is higher than the ratio’s August range near 0.65. In other words, while call OI still outnumbers put OI among near-term options, puts are being added at a faster rate. Intel Corporation (INTC) On Friday, Intel shocked investors when it boosted its third-quarter guidance due to strong demand in the PC market. The semiconductor giant now expects revenue of $15.6 billion, up from its prior third-quarter forecast of $14.9 billion. What’s more, Intel lifted its gross profit margin guidance from 60% to 62% citing “higher PC unit volume.” Call volume has risen sharply on INTC stock during the past two sessions. On Monday, INTC saw total volume of 219,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 68% of the day’s take — a figure well above average. Short-term call speculators have heavily targeted the $38 strike, which sports over 3,600 contracts in the weekly September 23 series. However, put traders have also gotten in on the act, with some 6,900 contracts now open at the $37 strike in the series. GoPro Inc (GPRO) At its much-anticipated unveiling event on Monday, GoPro finally took the wraps off its new Hero5 and Karma drone product lines. The Hero5 is the first new camera model for GoPro in about two years and replaces the Hero4 as the company’s flagship model. The Karma, meanwhile, is GoPro’s answer to critics of the company’s lean product line, and is also a move to address increased competition from camera drone makers, which have risen in popularity recently. Utilities SPDR (ETF) (XLU) Could Be a Strong Buy Soon Options traders appeared enthused about GoPro’s new offerings, with volume rising to more than 209,000 contracts following the reveal. Calls won the day, accounting for 57% of GPRO’s total options volume. Looking out to the monthly October options series reveals high expectations among some GPRO options traders, as peak call OI for the series totals nearly 13,000 contracts at the deep out-of-the-money $20 strike. Peak put OI for October, meanwhile, numbers roughly 9,700 contracts at the further-out-of-the-money $8 strike. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Then look past PlayStation and Xbox game consoles and consider a truly high-end PC. This is where it's at if 4K and virtual reality are high on your list of priorities, as nothing else comes close in terms of sheer performance. Do however be prepared to spend big. The hardware requirements of ultra-high-resolution gaming are such that price tags for enthusiast rigs can become downright frightening. A new games console may cost a couple of hundred quid, yet that's pocket change compared to extreme PCs that could set you back many thousands. It's a playground for deep-pocketed gamers, and if you're eligible for entry, the Scan 3XS X99 Carbon Fluid Extreme SLI is brought into focus. Priced from £5,700, Scan's rig is a custom-built showcase of 2016's best PC components. This is the sort of price point at which Intel's X99 chipset and Nvidia's Titan X graphics cards start to make sense, yet it's a sign of the times that even on a build as premium as this, there's a need to keep costs down by playing it safe in some areas. The most obvious example is the Corsair Graphite Series 760T chassis. It's a perfectly decent enclosure, with a nice large window and a roomy interior, yet our immediate reaction is that the plastic front fascia and overall style aren't in keeping with the components within. We might have preferred, say, a be quiet! Dark Base Pro 900 or a Cooler Master MasterCase Maker 5, and it's a shame Scan doesn't offer an alternative case as part of its customisation options. As it stands, those seeking something more unique from a visual perspective need to consider an even pricier Dream PC. Should you happen to be a fan of the Corsair case, you're going to love what Scan's done on the inside. Our £6,500 review sample arrived with an Asus RoG Strix X99 Gaming motherboard kitted out with a 10-core, 20-thread Intel Core i7-6950X processor, 32GB (4x8GB) of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-2666 memory and not one, but two Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB graphics cards. 64GB of system memory is available as an optional extra, but either way, the core components are about as good as it gets. Liquid cooling is, of course, included as standard, with Scan opting for an EK-based loops that encompasses all three processors. Running through the kit list, we have an EK Supremacy Evo CPU block, a pair of EK FX Titan X GPU blocks, an EK Res X3 reservoir, an EK XRes 100 pump, tubing filled with Mayhems Pastel Ice White fluid, and two EK Coolstream radiators. The 360mm rad in the roof is joined by a trio of Corsair ML120 Pro fans while the front 280mm rad is paired with two Corsair ML140s. Better still, Scan's engineers have applied custom fan profiles in BIOS to ensure noise levels are kept down to a minimum. The tidiness of the build is without a doubt a plus point, with excellent cable management evident throughout, and the core components tick a lot of the right boxes. Storage is provided by a 512GB Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD as well as a customary 2TB Seagate hard disk, power is sourced from a Gold-rated 850W Corsair RM850i supply, and a couple of LED strips tie-in with the Asus motherboard for Aura RGB lighting customisation. Building such a machine on your own with products sourced from various outlets would no doubt shave a couple of hundred off the price tag, however there is something to be said for peace of mind when you're spending these sorts of sums. Scan's machines undergo an eight-stage build process that's fully trackable online, followed by a 24-hour stress test and an 88-point quality control check. Once passed, dispatch is within five days (three if you opt for fast track) and the system is backed by a three-year warranty that includes on-site parts and labour for the first 12 months. A warranty from a reputable UK retailer holds extra weight and it also covers the out-the-box overclock. Not content with the core components in their factory state, Scan goes the extra yard and increases frequencies on all meaningful fronts. The Core i7-6950X is overclocked to 4.2GHz across all cores, while both Titan X GPUs see boost frequency stretched from 1,531MHz to 1,706MHz and memory jumps to an effective 10,360MHz. Eager to see what £6,500 worth of overclocked, liquid-cooled and potent PC goodness can do in our benchmark suite? Then let's take a look at some numbers.

There are twelve configurations on Dell's UK website, ranging in price from £601 up to £1,019 (ex. VAT). The 10.8-inch Dell Latitude 11 5000 Series, with the Latitude 11 Keyboard. Image: Dell The Latitude 11 5000 Series uses the classic detachable-screen laptop design comprising a tablet section, with all the ports and connectors in its casing, and an attachable keyboard to enable document creation and editing. The tablet and keyboard are sold separately, and there are two options for the latter: the Dell Latitude 11 Slim Keyboard costs £169.31 (inc. VAT, or £141 ex. VAT), while the Dell Latitude 11 Keyboard (sent for this review) costs £218.15 (inc. VAT, or £182 ex. VAT). The Dell Latitude 11 Slim Keyboard (left) is a keyboard, protective cover and stand, while the Latitude 11 Keyboard (right) docks with the tablet to form a clamshell laptop. Images: Dell The tablet variations are plentiful: as well as the usual variants on processor (both Core M3 and Core M5 Skylake variants are available), and storage (128GB, 256GB or 512GB SSD), and RAM (4GB or 8GB), it is possible to select self-encrypted SSDs, a fingerprint scanner and a smartcard reader on the tablet. These latter options are what lead Dell to claim that the Latitude 11 5000 Series is "The world's most secure 2-in-1 for business". The core specifications of my review sample -- a member of the 5179 sub-group -- were a 1.1-2.8GHz Intel Core M5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD running Windows 10 Professional, plus those security features. The Latitude 11 5000's full HD touchscreen has a pixel density of 204ppi. It can go bright enough to be readable outdoors. Image: Dell For a 10.8-inch tablet this is a relatively weighty device, starting at 710g for the 5175 models and 760g for the 5179 models. The tablet is on the chunky side too, with a desktop footprint of 280mm by 175mm. My review unit, with its integrated smartcard reader and fingerprint sensor, was 14.3mm thick, while the 5175 models just sneak under 11mm. I was able to bow the tablet slightly without applying a great deal of force. There's some airspace behind the screen back on the smartcard-equipped models that allows the back to flex inwards and creak a little. Pressing down hard on the back caused some feedback on the screen. A protective carrying case may be necessary, despite the use of magnesium alloy in the chassis. Top ZDNET Reviews Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Gyration Air Mouse Voice There is quite a lot of bezel, which makes it easy to hold the tablet without accidentally activating the touchscreen. That's useful, but large bezels always look incongruous when you're working in laptop mode. The screen is protected by Corning Concore Glass and is quite reflective. The display resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (204ppi) is standard across all 12 Latitude 11 5000 models. It's not difficult to read, but given so many variants I'd like to see a couple with higher resolutions. The screen does go very bright, which should help those wanting to use this device outdoors. Ports, connectors and buttons are ranged around all four sides of the tablet. The power button, a small status light that illuminates when the tablet is charging, and a microphone are on the top (in landscape orientation). The left edge has a headset jack, a volume rocker, another microphone, a speaker, a Micro-HDMI connector, a full-size USB 3.0 port, and a USB Type C port. The latter is used for charging, and also provides connectivity for docking, video, audio and data. On the right edge there's a Windows button, a second speaker and, under a hinged cover, slots for Micro-SD and Micro-SIM cards. There's an NFC sensor area on the back of 5179 models, but this is lacking on the more basic 5175 variants. Sound output through the stereo speakers is reasonably good. Top volume is loud enough to reach around a small table and audio quality is adequate -- if inevitably treble-heavy and bass-light. The optional Dell Latitude 11 Keyboard is robustly built and adds a second battery to boost the mains-free longevity of the 2-in-1 combo. The battery makes the keyboard rather heavy, and raises the overall system weight to 1.48kg, which is quite substantial for a 10.8-inch device. The overall footprint is increased too, as the keyboard hinge protrudes some 15mm from the back of the chassis when the laptop is closed. The tablet and keyboard are held together very securely by two metal lugs on the keyboard section. I was not concerned that they might part company, even if I lifted the whole thing up by one of the top corners of the tablet. Tablet and keyboard are separated by pushing a catch in the centre of the hinge, which draws the locking mechanism back. The hinge does not fully rotate, but takes the tablet to an angle of about 120 degrees. That's good enough for typing, but doesn't offer the flexibility of laptops with 360-degree screens. The keys are well spaced and reasonably comfortable to use, although there's not much travel and the overall feel is a little less responsive than I'd like. There is a two-level backlight, which helps when you're working in dim light. The Latitude 11 Keyboard on our review sample had a tapering double-height Enter key that took some getting used to. Image: Sandra Vogel/ZDNet My main issue when typing was with the Enter key (see above). Although it's a double-height key, the bottom half is half-width, and it took me a little while to acclimatise and hit it accurately every time. (Photographs at Dell's website show a different key design, with a horizontally oriented single-height Enter key.) Those who make frequent use of the trackpad may find it a little on shallow. There's not much Dell could have done about that, though: creating more depth for the trackpad would have meant reducing the spacing between the keys or significantly reducing the height of the Fn key row -- or most likely both of these. There is a stylus in a housing on the right edge of the Latitude 11 Keyboard. This is thin but well weighted, and its internal battery charges while it's in the housing. I do wonder whether housing the stylus on the tablet itself might not be preferable -- a key stylus use case is data entry in tablet mode, after all. In laptop mode you can't rotate the screen fully to face outwards, nor can you reverse the screen docking orientation to achieve the same end. Apart from the stylus housing there are no ports or connectors on the keyboard, and its edges have been styled with a neatly curved design. The dull rubberised finish on both keyboard and tablet is quite grippy, but after just a couple of hours of use it had attracted greasy fingermarks. Dell doesn't quote a battery life on its UK website for either the tablet or the keyboard. When the keyboard is attached its battery is used first, so the tablet always has the maximum charge left when it's detached. In our experience you should get an 8-hour working day out of the tablet/keyboard combo under relatively light workloads. As an example, three hours of document creation and web access in laptop mode reduced the keyboard battery from 100 percent to 40 percent, while the tablet battery dropped by just 1 percent. Conclusions Dell's Latitude 11 5000 Series tablet, when combined with an optional keyboard, becomes a capable small-format business laptop -- particularly with the higher-end security features on the 5179 models. However, the price seems high for what's on offer here, and there are some niggles, including the lack of 360-degree screen rotation, the rather hefty weight of the tablet/keyboard combo and the moderate screen resolution.

HPQ, -0.22% announced a commitment to open new HP Learning Studios in the Middle East. HP will work with Digital Promise Global, the Global Business Coalition for Education, Microsoft and Intel to establish centers equipped with computer systems and teacher training services to give refugee students access to the latest education technology and provide adults with the opportunity to learn essential business and IT skills. This week, HP also committed to provide technology and HP LIFE training resources to the International Medical Corps Livelihoods Center pilot in Istanbul, Turkey. As part of this initiative, HP will make online freelance opportunities available to refugees. In addition, HP agreed to support the opening of two Lynke and Blue Rose Compass tech centers for refugees, also in the Middle East. These centers will provide training and support for refugees in app design and other technical work. In total, HP is committing more than US$1 million in technology and training support to help refugees, alleviate poverty, and improve the lives of more than 100,000 people in the coming year. "The refugee community is full of untapped potential, but is challenged with growing those talents and skills due to a lack of access to technology and the digital world," explained Nate Hurst, HP Chief Sustainability and Social Impact Officer. "By opening these new HP Learning Studios and supporting a variety of initiatives, HP is empowering refugees to build a better, more prosperous life through access to quality education and employment opportunities." HP Learning Studios will be equipped with its latest technologies, including HP Sprout, a fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution with 3D object capture, editing and multiple streamlined 3D print options, and x360 convertible PCs powered by Windows 10, along with a Dremel 3D Printer. The core curriculum will be powered by HP LIFE e-Learning courses, which include 25 online modules on essential business and IT skills in seven languages. As part of this effort, HP will support the creation of additional free online courses and curated content specifically designed to help refugees develop the skills and expertise necessary for freelancing and ecommerce. "We are looking forward to collaborating with HP on this important effort, sharing our expertise to bring innovative, high-quality learning experiences to refugee students," said Karen Cator, CEO of Digital Promise Global. This new commitment builds on HP's ongoing effort to aid in the refugee crisis. In June 2016, HP was among the first 15 private sector companies to join the White House Call to Action. As part of this pledge, HP committed to working with the administration to drive new, measurable and significant commitments that will have a durable impact on refugees.

Taking things to the next level is Battlefield 1, the developer’s latest entry that steers EA’s visceral juggernaut back to The Great War. Due to arrive for PS4, Xbox One and PC on October 21, two weeks ago DICE hosted a public beta test allowing would-be early adopters to take the period shooter out for a spin. It went down a storm, too, attracting a staggering 13.2 million players and spotlighting a variety of technical niggles that the developer will now set about fixing. Make no mistake, the Battlefield 1 creative team are now entering crunch time ahead of launch – if they weren’t knee-deep already – but we do have word of the minimum and required system specs for those on the hunt for the PC version. You can have a gander at the technical minutia, below. Minimum System Requirements: OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Processor (AMD): AMD FX-6350 Processor (Intel): Core i5 6600K Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB Graphics card (Nvidia): Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 2GB DirectX: 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB Recommended System Requirements: OS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later Processor (AMD): AMD FX 8350 Wraith Processor (Intel): Intel Core i7 4790 or equivalent Memory: 16GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB Graphics card (Nvidia): Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB DirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Available Disk Space: 50GB All in all, these requirements hail from the higher end of the spectrum – this is a DICE game, after all – but a 50GB file size does seem fairly manageable on paper. Battlefield 1 is penciled in for launch on October 21 when DICE will beckon PC, Xbox One and PS4 players back to throes of World War I. Those on the latter two platforms can be in with a chance of winning a copy of the upcoming shooter by entering our latest contest, the details of which can be found here.

A report showing a steep drop in new residential construction may ease concerns about the possibility a near-term interact rate hike by the Fed. U.S. stocks ended lower on Monday, as interest rate concerns amid the release of a strong housing market reading squeezed the early momentum witnessed by the markets. The averages opened higher and saw a short spike but declined steadily following the release of the housing data. After grazing the unchanged line in late afternoon trading, the indexes moved roughly sideways before pulling back into negative territory going into the close. The Dow Industrials ended down 3.63 points or 0.02 percent at 18,120, the S&P 500 Index closed 0.04 points lower at 2,139 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,235, down 9.54 points or 0.18 percent. The breadth among the Dow components was even, with 15 stocks receding, while the remaining 15 stocks ended higher. Wal-Mart (WMT), Apple (AAPL), Verizon (VZ), Intel (INTC) and Merck (MRK) were among the biggest decliners of the session. Among the sectors, steel and utility stocks gained ground, while most of the other major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves. On the economic front, the National Association of Home Builders reported that homebuilder confidence improved notably in September. The housing market index rose to 65 from a downwardly revised reading of 59 for August. The present sales condition index rose 6 points to 7, representing a nearly 1-year high, the index measuring prospective buyer traffic was up 4 points to 48 and the sales expectations index gained 5 points to 71. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for October delivery are sliding $0.53 to $42.77 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $0.27 at $43.30 a barrel. The most actively traded November futures are down $0.56 at $43.30 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,317.20, down $0.60 from the previous session's close of $1,317.80. On Monday, gold rose $8.90. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 101.84 yen compared to the 101.93 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1180 compared to yesterday's $1.1175. Asia The Asian markets closed mixed, as risk aversion once again reared its head ahead of two major global central bank decisions. Crude oil was also lower in Asian session. The Chinese, Hong Kong, Indian, Indonesian and Japanese markets closed lower, while the rest of the markets advanced. The Japanese market ended lower as the yen stabilized at the upper 101-yen level against the dollar. The Nikkei 225 Index opened lower but managed to snap its losses and move into positive territory by late morning trading. After hovering in the green until late afternoon trading, the index pulled back and ended down 27.14 points or 0.16 percent at 16,492. Food, textile, pharma, retail, brokerage, insurance, real estate and most export stocks came under selling pressure. On the other hand, housing, chemical, banking, utility and paper stocks advanced. Mining stocks ended mixed Australia's All Ordinaries Index opened higher but quickly reversed and fell below the flat line. After being in the red for the better part of the session, the index recovered going into the close to end up 3.60 points or 0.07 percent at 5,397. Most sectors advanced, led by IT, material and utility stocks. However, energy and telecom stocks pulled back sharply. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 19.59 points or 0.08 percent before ending at 23,531, and China's Shanghai Composite Index closed at 3,023, down 3.05 points or 0.10 percent. The minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's September monetary policy meeting hinted at stability in interest rates, as historically low rates help the economy shrug off weakness in investment in resources. Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that house prices in Australia rose 2 percent sequentially in the second quarter following a 0.2 percent drop in the first quarter. Economists expected a sharper 3 percent increase. Annually, house prices rose a less than expected 3 percent. Europe European stocks are higher for the second straight session. After opening on a lackluster note, the major averages in Europe have managed to grind higher and are currently seeing notable strength. In major corporate news, U.K. home improvement retailer Kingfisher reported higher adjusted pre-tax profits, as sales grew. However, the company cautioned of softness in France in the near term. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced that Emma Walmsley, currently the CEO of the company's Consumer Healthcare division, was appointed CEO Designate and will succeed Andrew Witty when he retires on March 31, 2017. On the economic front, data released by the German Federal Statistical Office showed that producer prices in German fell 1.6 percent year-over-year in August, slower than the 2 percent drop in July. Wholesale prices have been on the wane since August 2013. Excluding energy prices, producer prices were down 0.3 percent. U.S. Economic Reports The two-day FOMC meeting gets underway later today, although the decision is not expected until Wednesday. New residential construction in the U.S. pulled back by much more than expected in the month of August, the Commerce Department revealed in a report on Tuesday. The report said housing starts tumbled by 5.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.142 million in August from the revised July estimate of 1.212 million. Economists had expected housing starts to drop by 1.7 percent to a rate of 1.190 million from the 1.211 million that had been reported for the previous month. The Commerce Department also said building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, dipped by 0.4 percent to a rate of 1.139 million in August from a revised 1.144 million in July. The decrease surprised economists, who had expected building permits to climb by 1.3 percent to a rate of 1.167 million in August from the 1.152 million originally reported for the previous month. ?Stocks in Focus Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) reported third quarter earnings and revenues that rose more than expected amid a notable increase in home deliveries. Forward Air (FWRD) lowered its third quarter revenue growth guidance range to -2% to 2% from 1-5% and reduced its adjusted income per share guidance to 48-52 cents per share from 61-65 cents per share. The predicament was blamed on lower freight volumes. Reacting to the schedule 13D filed by Alden Golden Capital, Pier 1 Imports (PIR) said it would continue to engage with its shareholders and evaluate opportunities to increase long-term shareholder value. Steel Dynamics (STLD) pre-announced that it expects third quarter earnings per share of 63-67 cents per share, up from 25 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said it would benefit from meaningful metal spread expansion and a higher rate of growth in realized steel product pricing than in the additional costs for higher prices ferrous scrap utilized. Intel (INTC) announced the appointment of Robert Swan as its CFO, effective October 10, 2016, replacing Stacy Smith, who is taking a broader role within the company's manufacturing, sales and operations. Rambus (RMBS) announced the appointment of Cypress Semiconductor (CY) executive Rahul Mathur as its CFO. Autodesk (ADSK) announced a plan to repurchase of up to 30 million of its shares. Adobe Systems (ADBE), FedEx (FDX) and KB Home (KBH) are among the companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet AT&T Stream Saver To Limit Video Quality To 480p Genentech: Actemra Meets Endpoints In Phase III GiACTA Study Digi Rejects $13.82/shr Proposal From Belden - Quick Facts Schnuck Markets Recalls Ready-to-eat Grilled Chicken Products Kidde Recalls 3.6 Mln Combination Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detectors Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

World Routes moves to a different location every year to highlight different aviation markets. It is the only route development forum that brings together aviation professionals to discuss new air services on a global scale. Chengdu is located in western China and has a population of over 1.4 million. It is home to 271 Fortune 500 companies, including IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Chengdu´s GDP increased by 7.9 percent in 2015 to CNY1.08 trillion, which is 1.1 percent above the national average. The tourism industry in China has led to high demand for air services. Between 2012 and 2015 Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport´s passenger numbers increased by 40 percent from 30 million to 42 million. During this time dozens of new international routes were launched to cities including Vancouver, Frankfurt, Doha, London, Melbourne, San Francisco, Moscow and Paris. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 47 million by the end of this year. The government aims to create a CNY one trillion (USD153.8 billion) aviation market by 2020 and a national construction program will increase the number of Chinese airports to 260, one of which will be in Chengdu. Chengdu Tianfu International Airport (currently under construction) will have the capacity to handle 40 million passengers when the first building phases are complete.

The eagerly-anticipated headset is seen as being at the forefront of VR, competing with the likes of HTC's Vive and Sony's forthcoming Playstation VR. It is being launched in the UK, Canada and Europe six months after the US amid a huge order backlog. However, it comes at a premium price and needs a high-end PC to work. Here's what you need to know: How do I get one? The Rift is going on sale at Curry's PC World, GAME, John Lewis, Harrods and online on Amazon for £549. Shoppers looking to try one out can do so by finding a nearby demo. Demand is expected to be high: Amazon is only allowing one order per person, for example. However, the headset doesn't work on its own. Users will need a high-powered PC to run games or other software - at present no Mac has the required specs, with Oculus founder Palmer Luckey saying the company will support Macs when Apple releases "a good computer". For PCs, Oculus recommends at least 8GB of RAM, an Intel i5 or better and a high-powered graphics card. Its recommendations are available here and you can check if your computer is up to the job here. If you don't have a good-enough computer, you'll be looking at paying £1,000 and up for one. What does it come with? Inside the Oculus Rift pack is the headset itself, a sensor to track your movement that you place on the desk in front of you, a remote control, cables (the headset can plug into the controller if it isn't wireless, as well as a computer and a power source), and an Xbox controller. What's in the Oculus Rift box? The headset also comes with the VR platform game Lucky's Tale as well as a selection of VR videos and movies. Oculus is also developing special "Touch" controllers that will be more suited to VR, but at present the only way to play it is with an Xbox controller. What is virtual reality like? Part of the point of virtual reality is that you really have to experience it to know what it's like, but it's safe to say it's unlike anything you'll have tried before. With headphones on, playing in a dark room, it's entirely possible to forget the outside world as sounds, flashes and objects bombard you from all sides. Funny reactions to using the Oculus Rift Play! 02:30 You may have experienced Facebook's 360-degree video or Google cardboard, but virtual reality such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or Sony PlayStation VR is as different to that as the gulf between listening to a car stereo and the front row at the opera - everything is brighter, more detailed and more immersive. However, many people experience motion sickness or dizziness, especially after playing for some time. What do I do with it? At present, VR is primarily aimed at gamers - partially because it is the easiest way to create an immersive experience and partly because the tech junkies who own high-end PCs like to play games. There are now dozens of games aimed at players, from racing to shoot-em-ups and sports. However, Oculus and other virtual reality companies are trying hard to broaden its appeal, from films to education and apps. For example, the Oculus store features an interactive horror story called the Elevator Ritual and a space VR experience. Mark Zuckerberg trying out Oculus Rift Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook bought Oculus for $2bn (£1.5bn) two years ago because Zuckerberg believes virtual reality could be the future of social communication: people may be able to hold meetings or interact with family members on the other side of the world by putting a headset on. VR is also being used for psychological therapy and education. Is it safe? There have been few long-term studies into the health effects of virtual reality, although there have been several concerns raised. Some worry that the visual experience of moving while your inner ear doesn't agree could create long-term problems. Others say that VR could damage eyes, although the effects are uncertain. At present, the main dangers appear to be around nausea and dizziness, which may take some time to wear off. Around 1 in 4,000 may experience blackouts or seizures, according to Oculus. The company recommends that users take a 10-15 minute break every half hour and says under-13s shouldn't use it. The other risk is that by not concentrating on surroundings you could fall over a wire, household object or pet. What are the competitors? Oculus isn't the only company getting in on the act. HTC's Vive VR headset, launched this year, has won high praise, and comes with VR-dedicated controllers out of the box, although it is more expensive than the Rift. VIRTUAL REALITY WARS A more mainstream option, since it does not require a high-spec PC, will be Sony's PlayStation VR for the PS4, due to be released next month. Samsung also has its Gear VR headset for use with its own smartphones, although this is a less-powerful experience.

The ecosystem's launch partners and third-party validated hardware, which include Advantech, Silicom Ltd. and Lanner Electronics are paving the way towards a truly open and software-based solution for SD-WAN that eliminates the need for proprietary hardware. Customer benefits of a truly software-based SD-WAN solution and ecosystem include: Lower Capex and Opex versus a proprietary hardware-based solution A broader range of hardware platforms to better meet new technical requirements, such as targeted managed services and/or customized do-it-yourself deployments Rapid delivery of specialized platforms to meet specific business opportunities Pre-loaded Versa software on all certified appliances provides platform choice while delivering the packaged hardware experience customers expect Higher performance and more scalability using highly-efficient, multi-core Intel processors and optimization techniques, such as a Data Plane Developer Kit (DPDK) The ability to easily and agilely add features or capacity without a hardware replacement Each launch partner announced today brings a unique customer vision to the ecosystem. Advantech, a global intelligent systems leader, has developed a scalable range of white box platforms to support Versa SD-WAN and SD-Security software. More than just commodity servers, Advantech's platforms have been fully certified by Versa and profiled for exact performance and feature sets. Integration into Versa' Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and serviceability framework guarantee seamless deployment and lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). The platforms scale from dual core Intel® Atom™ Processor C2000 platforms to Intel® Xeon® Processor D-1500 based mid-range systems to dual socket Intel® Xeon® Processor E5 series appliances. Lanner Electronics, a leading global manufacturer of network appliances, has created an integrated solution that merges Versa SD-WAN software with Lanner's virtual customer premise equipment (vCPE) platforms. Lanner Electronics and Versa Networks have tested and validated an integrated solution that delivers flexibility and cost advantages for creating agile and profitable managed services. The joint solution enables service providers to centrally and cost-effectively manage a truly NFV-based and software-defined WAN at their network customers' sites, instead of the traditional investment in proprietary hardware and hands-on management. And Silicom, an industry-leading provider of high-performance networking and data infrastructure solutions, has announced that its ADI Engineering Division appliances are now shipping and are fully certified with Versa SD-WAN and SD-Security software. Silicom's appliances are precisely optimized for SD-WAN and vCPE applications, with support for LTE and Wi-Fi, higher port density and the newest Intel CPU and acceleration technologies. Silicom's appliances targeting the SD-WAN market scale from the Intel® Atom™ C2000 family to the Intel® Xeon® Processor D-1500 series, all of which are available for the Versa application. The Move to Truly Software-based SD-WAN Networking is seeing the same migration from hardware to software-based architectures that compute and storage have seen over the last decade. 'Software-defined' platforms for the network started in the data center and local area network (LAN) via software-defined networking (SDN), but more recently the technology has moved to the WAN with SD-WAN. But not all SD-WAN products are fully software-based and hardware independent. Versa SD-WAN is a purely software-based approach that is based on a dynamically scalable, multi-tenant and service chainable system. It includes support for 3rd party virtual and physical appliances and legacy network protocols, providing easy integration with existing network routing and VPN architectures. Coupled with a wide range of software-defined security functions (next-gen firewall and UTM), Versa provides integrated Internet security and access control features for customers deploying direct Internet and cloud application access. When paired with the cost-effective and powerful Intel-based platforms within the Versa open SD-WAN ecosystem, customers can maintain the experience of appliance deployments while realizing the full cost, performance and agility benefits of "software-defining the WAN," as well as creating higher profit managed services. "We are excited to be partnering with global CPE leaders Advantech, Lanner and Silicom Ltd. to accelerate the WAN's evolution to software," said Kumar Mehta, CEO and co-founder of Versa Networks. "With Versa's innovative software platform, and the high value CPE from our partners, this ecosystem and architecture will be able to deliver a truly impactful operating and profit model for next-generation managed services like SD-WAN and SD-Security."
