By Chris Duckett | April 8, 2017 -- 03:25 GMT (20:25 PDT) | Topic: Hardware When you ask Intel how it is doing in the realm of artificial intelligence, you will likely hear a figure saying how 97 percent of all AI workloads run on Xeon hardware. But that number is far from being the full story. In the realm of neural networks, the chip giant has a real competitor in the guise of Nvidia, after Intel has, by its own admission, been "absent" in the area. "It's really not too late ... we're in the first half of the first innings," Barry Davis, Intel general manager of Accelerated Workloads Group, told ZDNet last week. Intel is changing the way it approaches AI, after its old playbook didn't have the best results. "[In the past] we would have said: 'If you build it, they will come. Here's our silicon, here's our software, and the BIOS and low-level code, have at it.' It's not enough anymore," Davis said. what's hot on zdnet From heart attacks to fainting, this watch flags up health threats before they strike The 10 best smartphones of 2017 so far For internet privacy, a VPN won't save you DevOps: What is it, and how can it help your business? The general manager conceded that Intel didn't understand the market well enough, and has moved from focusing purely on silicon to looking at solutions. "We would talk a lot about building blocks, we would talk a lot about technology," he said. "Intel is one of the largest software developers in the world, [but] nobody knows it. "Our partners, our customers are looking to us to not just give them this silicon, a driver, and maybe a little piece of application on top as a reference code and have them do all the work themselves. "We've got to prevalidate, which is a huge task ... we have to build the silicon, build the software or work with parties on software, validate all that together -- which is the new thing making sure that validation is done -- make sure there is an ecosystem of support out there, and then hand that to someone to sell." One facet of how Intel is redoing its AI approach is to make sure frameworks run on its hardware. An example of this is the partnership struck this week between the chip giant and Preferred Networks, the Japanese maker of deep-learning framework Chainer. Under the deal, Chainer will also have Xeon support alongside its existing Cuda implementation. Davis said that in the future, the chip maker will be making further such deals around frameworks, as the battle for developer mindshare moves up the stack into applications. "If you go to [Preferred Networks] website, they're doing a lot of work with Nvidia. Frankly, we were absent for a while, we weren't there, now we are -- Chainer is a good example, Tensorflow is a good example with our buddies at Google ... the work we've done in Caffe that has all been upstreamed ... working on MXNet for Amazon. "If I go back to the parallel in the HPC market, years ago it was all about tuning the application, getting those applications written. Now in AI, with the way this market has developed with the frameworks as that intermediate layer, now I think more general-purpose AI applications will start coming out, and they will come out at Intel, and GPUs as well and that's okay, because it's all going to be a kind of level playing field." According to Davis, part of the reason why it is still early in the AI game is because it is far from being standard enterprise functionality at the moment. "Every enterprise will have some datacentre with some level of workload -- I cannot say that about AI in those datacentres," he said. "Lots of AI today is happening at the Googles, Microsofts, Amazons of the world -- the big CSPs [cloud service providers] -- and they do all the work themselves, and that's true for all workloads. They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, it's not deployed into the general market yet -- not really." When those CSPs begin to launch AI-as-a-service, Davis expects both Intel and Nvidia to be supported. "When the cloud guys put out a service, typically they want to put out everything. If Intel is there and Nvidia is there, they are going to want to have both, because they don't want to have to presuppose what their customer base is going to want to use." With a fast-moving market -- such as Intel's new Lake Crest architecture for AI training, Google boosting inference on its custom-built Tensor Processing Unit, and IBM and Nvidia joining forces to offer Tesla P100s within its IBM Cloud -- Davis said anyone that says they know where the market is heading is lying. "It's changing so fast," he said. "You can't draw a line anymore, because it is all over the place, which means it is exciting and scary at the same time." Releasing entirely new architectures is not something that Intel is commonly known for, but that is exactly what it is doing with Lake Crest and its upcoming Crest lineup. Chief technology officer of Intel Artificial Intelligence Product Group Amir Khosrowshahi told ZDNet last week that Lake Crest came about after his company Nervana, which was subsequently purchased by Intel, had been looking at optimising parts of Nvidia's AI ecosystem. "There is so much circuitry in a GPU that is not necessary for machine learning ... this is crud that has accumulated over time, and it's quite a lot of stuff," Khosrowshahi said. "You don't need the circuitry which is quite a large proportion of the chip and also high cost in energy utilisation. "Neural networks are quite simple, they are little matrix multiplications and non-linearities, you can directly build silicon to do that. You can build silicon that is very faithful to the architecture of neural networks, which GPUs are not." To Davis, the timing is right to introduce developers to a new architecture. "You do have to take a leap of faith at some point, but you don't want to do it every generation," Davis said. "We want to establish Lake Crest, Spring Crest as an architectural capability, but two years from now, three years from now, I don't want to have to start all over again -- developers will kill us. "You take the leap when you need to, but you don't keep thrashing them." Lake Crest will be an accelerator card, but as the architecture matures, Intel will bring it closer to the CPU. "You have to start that somewhere, you have to start the ecosystem development, you have to establish the architecture, and you do that in a discrete solution and then you migrate it towards the CPU over time. Now you only do that if there is a good reason to -- we believe there is a chance there's a good reason to," Davis stated. "If I just said to myself: 'Nvidia is good enough' ... that might be good. Three or four years from now, when deep learning is tightly integrated into the workflow of a user in the datacentre, what's going to happen at that point in time? "Now all of a sudden, this thing is odd man out. It's not going to be integrated, it's going to be an attached co-processor; it's going to have execution flows that stop, go up here, do something up here, come back down; latency is going to be increased; performance is going to be reduced." By bringing Lake Crest closer to the CPU, Davis said that does not necessarily mean similar silicon, but it could be instructions and architecture features. "Lake Crest as a capability today, it's plus 300W, that's not going to show up in a car any time soon, or in an edge device. "It's the algorithms and the IP in the architecture which will show up. It's the capability, it's the processing elements. It's Lake Crest the architecture, not the chip, will impact our microcode and the way we develop instruction sets. "There's already some instructions we are looking at for CPUs that came out of the Nervana guys." As devices at the edge of networks become more sensitive to power-consumption restraints, Davis said he doesn't believe there will be a great deal of training going on, but rather inference. And for power-efficient inference, Intel has an ace up its sleeve in the form of field-programmable gate arrays [FPGAs] due to its Altera purchase in 2015. "A year ago, it was all about 32-bit training, overnight it went to 16-bit -- now we went from single precision to half-precision -- now they are talking about 8-bit, 4-bit, 3-bit, and 2-bit. Yes, a GPGPU or a CPU for that matter can do 8-bit training, but not with any power savings against 16-bit," Davis said. "That's where a FPGA comes in. "If overnight, all of a sudden, 8-bit inference becomes important, we can do that in an FPGA. You want to put that into a GPGPU, you need two years ... you need that hardware development cycle to get that out. "I'll admit I don't think we bought Altera for AI -- but we did get a unique solution that will support our AI strategy, and we got a little lucky." Wherever the market chooses to go, Intel is more than likely to be there with a silicon offering. The chip giant's AI portfolio now contains a quartet of processors: The standard Xeon, the higher-performance Xeon Phi, a Xeon coupled with Lake Crest, and a Xeon paired with Arria 10 FPGA. Despite criticism that it is taking a shotgun approach, Davis retorted it is a best-tool-for-the-job approach. "Everyone is going to have a little bit of a different solution, and we are not exactly sure where everything is going to go."

Exclusive: Perry Hicks highlights latest news about surveillance Devin Nunes revealed Published: 8 hours ago Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print By Perry Hicks Thanks to the bombshell dropped by Fox News correspondents Catherine Herridge and Pamela K. Brown, we now know why former House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., rushed to the White House to appraise the president. Classified files only Nunes and ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., have seen indicate that the surveilled individuals were subject to such high definition scrutiny that their everyday lives were detailed. Fox quotes Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., as characterizing the reports as something one would expect from a private investigator working a divorce case. These revelations bring into question the veracity of FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers. Both stated to the House Intel Committee that “We have no information to support those (the president’s) tweets.” At minimum, their denials appear to be no better than lies of omission. In order to collect that kind of detail on a good number of individuals, considerable manpower (and therefore money) must be expended. Comey admitted to the committee that the FBI had been investigating allegations of Russian election interference since last July – the very month following then Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton. In that meeting, Lynch claims she and Clinton only discussed personal matters, such as grandchildren and golf, and not Hillary’s 30,000 emails missing from her private and wholly unprotected email server – the very server she sought to hide from FOIA requests and on which she conducted classified government business. Lynch’s denials of collusion are laughable. Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have associations, if not histories, of conducting just this kind of skullduggery. Recall how Obama’s 2004 U.S. Senate opponent, Republican Jack Ryan, had his divorce records unsealed despite his and wife Jeri’s objections. While it was the media that petitioned to have those court records opened, it was Barack who richly benefited from the unsealing. It was also Barack that was the petitioning publications preferred candidate. However, we must also remember that Obama’s chief adviser, David Axlerod, had formerly been a political analyst for the Chicago Tribune. Destroying one’s opponents isn’t called “the Chicago way” for nothing. Then, there is Hillary’s record of employing private investigators to crush her husband’s paramours and victims. Such despicable and clearly third-world behavior can be expected from such proxies as a goon squad of private investigators, but from America’s national security apparatus? The FBI? In order for the public to have any confidence in an “independent” investigation into the conduct of Susan Rice, Loretta Lynch and even the FBI itself – one that ironically will have to be conducted by FBI agents – James Comey must be fired and a new, untainted director appointed. President Trump should also put NSA Director Mike Rogers on the hot seat and demand answers as to why he made untruthful claims to Congress. As a newcomer, perhaps he was misled by Deep State loyalists. Perhaps not. Nevertheless, the trail from the unmaskers and leakers must be followed back to those who ordered the surveillance of American citizens purely for political purposes. Those guilty of committing these felonies must be pursued and ultimately brought to justice. Learn more about the man front and center in the news today. Get Rep.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Weekly Rewind: Flying taxis, cheap shipping… Weekly Rewind: Flying taxis, cheap shipping container homes, and more By Lulu Chang — April 7, 2017 1:30 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends A lot can happen in a week when it comes to tech. The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from everything you need to know about AT&T’s unlimited plans to how you can watch the NFL on Amazon — it’s all here. ‘Thursday Night Football’ is coming to Amazon Prime next season Amazon scored a deal with the NFL to stream 10 Thursday Night Football games during the upcoming season. The news, confirmed to Digital Trends via email, is a serious blow to Twitter, which secured the rights for the same coverage last season. This time, however, Amazon outbid not only Twitter, but also YouTube and Facebook. The retail giant paid a reported $50 million to take the prize — that’s $40 million more than Twitter’s payout last year. Read the full story here. Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which service is the streaming king? When it comes to subscribers, the undisputed king of on-demand streaming music is Spotify. The Swedish-born service helped pioneer the current market and has tens of millions more paid users than the competition, not to mention millions more free users. But Apple Music, known for its high-level exclusive releases and full integration into Apple’s popular iOS system, is the hottest service on Spotify’s heels. Apple’s streaming service has shown impressive growth in its audience since its inception, so which is better? Read the full story here. Has Intel turned into a virtual reality film studio? We found out Few companies have been as integral to bringing the future to computing for as long as Intel. Now the technology conglomerate is putting its chips where the films are, acting as a sort of “tech whisperer” to help filmmakers create in virtual reality. Does this mean Intel, and other companies that power VR films, are becoming de facto movie studios? assisting moviemakers in acheiving their look is nothing new to Intel. The company provided processing technology to Dreamworks Animation in 2008, for instance. If you thought 2009’s Monsters vs. Aliens looked cool, you can thank Intel. Read the full story here. Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes Do you have an inordinate amount of shipping containers? Are you trying figure out what to do with all them? In the unlikely event that the answer to this question is “Yes,” you’ll be pleased to learn that they’re far more practical than you may have imagined. And if you answered in the negative, then good news! You can grab yourself a decent size shipping container for just over $1,500. Read the full story here. NASA’s retiring EO-1 satellite changed how we see Earth with these stunning photos Last week, NASA retired one of its greats — the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. Initially commissioned for the agency’s New Millennium Program, EO-1 proved to be the satellite that could. Its one-year mission nearly extended to 17 years. EO-1 was never meant to be such a star. In fact, its original purpose was to test and refine technologies for future Earth imaging. It was launched on November 21, 2000 with 13 new technologies, three of which had never been tested. Many of the most stunning images were capture by the Advanced Land Imager (ALI). Read the full story here. Next Page 1 of 2 Page 1 Page 2

Twitter Facebook What one company learned from testing Intel's superfast Optane SSDs Aerospike finds its database running significantly faster while testing Intel's Optane SSDs Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 08 April, 2017 06:46 - - - - print email Comments Intel's large-capacity Optane is like the Ferrari of storage: It's super fast, it's cool and it's expensive. Also, it isn't for everyone yet. That was reiterated by Intel when it introduced its first large capacity SSD, the Optane SSD DC P4800X, last month. The 375GB DC P4800X is aimed at high-end applications. Optane is also available as low-capacity cache storage on motherboards, allowing Windows 10 and other applications to load faster. Before release, Intel gave Optane SSDs to a select few customers who had a chance to get their hands dirty with the new technology for longer than a year. The testers included Facebook, IBM, Lenovo, and database company Aerospike, which believes Optane could unite DRAM and SSDs.  Aerospike's database has a hybrid architecture that can take advantage of Optane as both a NAND flash and DRAM replacement. The company also found its database running significantly faster on Optane than on SSDs based on NAND flash. Beta testing Optane was important because it's different than NAND flash, and software needs to be tuned for Optane's hybrid memory and storage features. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich has said that Optane could play a unique role in buffering chapters of video games so they load up quickly on PCs.  Intel claims that Optane DC P4800X SSD's random writes are up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, while reads are around three times faster. Intel has said the P4800X is not meant for everyday applications or sequential tasks. Next year, Intel will ship Optane DIMMs to replace DRAM. Optane DIMMs will need to be more durable and faster than SSDs based on the technology because they are on a faster memory bus and will have to survive a larger number of reads and writes. Intel claims Optane will offer more gigabyte density in DIMMs than conventional DRAM. Optane is based on 3D Xpoint technology, a new form of non-volatile memory that is based on the resistance of cells.  Aerospike was able to play with Optane for longer than a year ahead of its release. Intel's testing platform was comprehensive and helped bring Optane to market significantly faster than NAND flash, said Brian Bulkowski, founder and CTO at Aerospike.   Today's Optane storage can take 10 times more writes than today's standard TLC (triple level cell) or MLC (multi-level cell) NAND flash and also has much higher write speeds, Bulkowski said. There is also a significant difference on how the Optane and NAND flash SSDs work. In Optane, data can be accessed at the bit level, which is unlike NAND flash, where data is accessed in blocks. Optane can change bits or bytes, which is something that conventional NAND flash or rotational drives can't do. NAND flash relies on the overwriting of data, and "garbage collectors" cleaning out blocks of data, which can upset the read times. The ability to address data at the bit level makes Optane's reads and writes much faster.  Optane also has an average of 30 drive writes a day, while NAND flash tops out at around 10 drive writes, Bulkowski said. Optane gives tremendous flexibility to how Aerospike deploys its software because it helps speed up critical tasks like database indexing.  The Aerospike database is highly flexible thanks to its hybrid memory architecture, meaning it can be deployed on different types of systems including all-flash arrays, converged infrastructures, or through major cloud services like Amazon AWS.  The software is notably adaptable to a cluster topology via direct-attached storage managers. The database architecture can be broken into spokes and set up for high availability through database replication on interconnected servers. Optane cuts the network round-trip time, and that helps build a faster and more reliable database. Aerospike's database can help can create an environment where Optane can be used like RAM for in-memory processing or SSD for caching or hot storage. A similar feature called Memory Drive -- a virtualization layer that helps Optane SSDs mimic DRAM -- is offered by Intel.  The database performance will shoot up when 3D Xpoint moves on to the memory bus with DIMMs, which will be much faster than the NVMe/PCI-Express bus for SSDs, Bulkowski said.   Interesting innovations are going on in NVMe over Fabrics (also called NVM-F) data transfer protocol, which will establish software-defined storage connections without the Fibre Channel volume managers. It gives Aerospike a direct and fast path to storage like Optane over networks like Ethernet. It also gives flexibility for the database to map in new storage, Bulkowski said. It remains to be seen who the buyers of Optane will be. The storage is offered in the cloud via IBM Bluemix, where companies can port their code and be spared the high cost of acquiring Optane. Bulkowski said his company will provide recommendations on storage based on performance, budget and buying habits. The upcoming Optane DIMMs may command a premium price, he said. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

Matthew Heller April 7, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* In the second insider trading case arising from the $15.3 billion takeover of Mobileye NV by Intel, two Virginia men have been charged with making $925,000 in illicit profits based on nonpublic information about the pending deal. The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission accused Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul of “highly suspicious” transactions, alleging they acquired Mobileye shares and call options after the adult children of two Mobileye founders told Shaoul’s adult children, with whom they were friends, about Intel’s interest in the maker of sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles. Recommended Stories: Two CFOs Tell a Tale of Fraud at HealthSouth Former EY Auditor Charged With Insider Trading Former iPayment Execs Charged With $11M Fraud After the takeover was announced on March 13, Mobileye shares rose 28.2% in one day. The charges filed Wednesday against Cluff and Shaoul came nearly two weeks after the SEC brought a similar case against two Israeli residents, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman, who allegedly generated more than $4.9 million in gains by trading illegally in Mobileye stock. According to the SEC, the defendants in both cases were connected to Mobileye through the academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and where Shaoul, an Israeli citizen, had studied. The SEC said Cluff and Shaoul traded in two accounts held in Cluff’s name, including one that had been dormant for six years and one opened on Jan. 29, 2017, around the time Mobileye and Intel began formal merger talks. On Feb. 1, Cluff allegedly used the new account to acquire 3,782 Mobileye shares at a cost of nearly $161,500. By March 10 — the last trading day before the announcement of the takeover — the account held 3,414 Mobileye shares and 1,209 call options with strike prices between $50 and $55, the SEC said. Mobileye shares closed at $47.27 on March 10. After the announcement of Intel’s $63.54-per-share-offer, Cluff allegedly sold 862 Mobileye call options for proceeds of $617,563 and, according to the SEC, his accounts have unrealized gains of approximately $335,000. The SEC has obtained a court order freezing assets of Cluff and Shaoul.

Also, it isn't for everyone yet. That was reiterated by Intel when it introduced its first large capacity SSD, the Optane SSD DC P4800X, last month. The 375GB DC P4800X is aimed at high-end applications. Optane is also available as low-capacity cache storage on motherboards, allowing Windows 10 and other applications to load faster. Before release, Intel gave Optane SSDs to a select few customers who had a chance to get their hands dirty with the new technology for longer than a year. The testers included Facebook, IBM, Lenovo, and database company Aerospike, which believes Optane could unite DRAM and SSDs.  Aerospike's database has a hybrid architecture that can take advantage of Optane as both a NAND flash and DRAM replacement. The company also found its database running significantly faster on Optane than on SSDs based on NAND flash. Beta testing Optane was important because it's different than NAND flash, and software needs to be tuned for Optane's hybrid memory and storage features. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich has said that Optane could play a unique role in buffering chapters of video games so they load up quickly on PCs.  Intel claims that Optane DC P4800X SSD's random writes are up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, while reads are around three times faster. Intel has said the P4800X is not meant for everyday applications or sequential tasks. Next year, Intel will ship Optane DIMMs to replace DRAM. Optane DIMMs will need to be more durable and faster than SSDs based on the technology because they are on a faster memory bus and will have to survive a larger number of reads and writes. Intel claims Optane will offer more gigabyte density in DIMMs than conventional DRAM. Optane is based on 3D Xpoint technology, a new form of non-volatile memory that is based on the resistance of cells.  Aerospike was able to play with Optane for longer than a year ahead of its release. Intel's testing platform was comprehensive and helped bring Optane to market significantly faster than NAND flash, said Brian Bulkowski, founder and CTO at Aerospike.   Today's Optane storage can take 10 times more writes than today's standard TLC (triple level cell) or MLC (multi-level cell) NAND flash and also has much higher write speeds, Bulkowski said. There is also a significant difference on how the Optane and NAND flash SSDs work. In Optane, data can be accessed at the bit level, which is unlike NAND flash, where data is accessed in blocks. Optane can change bits or bytes, which is something that conventional NAND flash or rotational drives can't do. NAND flash relies on the overwriting of data, and "garbage collectors" cleaning out blocks of data, which can upset the read times.

Also, it isn't for everyone yet. That was reiterated by Intel when it introduced its first large capacity SSD, the Optane SSD DC P4800X, last month. The 375GB DC P4800X is aimed at high-end applications. Optane is also available as low-capacity cache storage on motherboards, allowing Windows 10 and other applications to load faster. Before release, Intel gave Optane SSDs to a select few customers who had a chance to get their hands dirty with the new technology for longer than a year. The testers included Facebook, IBM, Lenovo, and database company Aerospike, which believes Optane could unite DRAM and SSDs.  Aerospike's database has a hybrid architecture that can take advantage of Optane as both a NAND flash and DRAM replacement. The company also found its database running significantly faster on Optane than on SSDs based on NAND flash. Beta testing Optane was important because it's different than NAND flash, and software needs to be tuned for Optane's hybrid memory and storage features. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich has said that Optane could play a unique role in buffering chapters of video games so they load up quickly on PCs.  Intel claims that Optane DC P4800X SSD's random writes are up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, while reads are around three times faster. Intel has said the P4800X is not meant for everyday applications or sequential tasks. Next year, Intel will ship Optane DIMMs to replace DRAM. Optane DIMMs will need to be more durable and faster than SSDs based on the technology because they are on a faster memory bus and will have to survive a larger number of reads and writes. Intel claims Optane will offer more gigabyte density in DIMMs than conventional DRAM. Optane is based on 3D Xpoint technology, a new form of non-volatile memory that is based on the resistance of cells.  Aerospike was able to play with Optane for longer than a year ahead of its release. Intel's testing platform was comprehensive and helped bring Optane to market significantly faster than NAND flash, said Brian Bulkowski, founder and CTO at Aerospike.   Today's Optane storage can take 10 times more writes than today's standard TLC (triple level cell) or MLC (multi-level cell) NAND flash and also has much higher write speeds, Bulkowski said. There is also a significant difference on how the Optane and NAND flash SSDs work. In Optane, data can be accessed at the bit level, which is unlike NAND flash, where data is accessed in blocks. Optane can change bits or bytes, which is something that conventional NAND flash or rotational drives can't do. NAND flash relies on the overwriting of data, and "garbage collectors" cleaning out blocks of data, which can upset the read times. The ability to address data at the bit level makes Optane's reads and writes much faster.  Optane also has an average of 30 drive writes a day, while NAND flash tops out at around 10 drive writes, Bulkowski said. Optane gives tremendous flexibility to how Aerospike deploys its software because it helps speed up critical tasks like database indexing.  The Aerospike database is highly flexible thanks to its hybrid memory architecture, meaning it can be deployed on different types of systems including all-flash arrays, converged infrastructures, or through major cloud services like Amazon AWS.  The software is notably adaptable to a cluster topology via direct-attached storage managers.

The most-read story this week involves the brand McAfee coming back to the channel as TPG Capital's acquisition of Intel Security was finalized. Channelnomics spoke with the company's channel chief, who explained why he thinks being known as McAfee again will help channel partners. He also discussed how departing from Intel's umbrella and infrastructure will afford new partner enablement opportunities.

Xerox is also nodding at partners these days as CEO Jeff Jacobson aims to use SMB-focused channel  partners to aid a pivot to growing markets. With the CEO saying the majority of its 2016 revenue came from mature, flat and slightly declining markets, where it is a leader, it will need to focus on both areas ahead. With the help of the channel it will pursue production color, managed document services, the A4 laser multi-function printer entry space and the SMB market, the Xerox head said.

During its North American Partner Conference in Las Vegas, NV last week, Channelnomics spoke with a couple of storage executives about Red Hat's storage business, which has been predominantly direct. The execs are looking to change this, starting with the addition of more than 20 North American resellers it's looking to enable around its SDS offerings. The vendor noted its storage channel will look a bit different than that of traditional storage vendors. The story: Red Hat SDS business to become less direct 4). Ongoing trepidation about the PC market continued this week as Gartner predicted that vendors dependent on the market are in trouble as the consumer space has yet to bottom out. The analyst firm expects PC shipments to take a five-million-unit cut this year, with sales being flat. Still, Gartner believes the market is "stabilizing", meaning it's certainly one for partners to continue watching. Start here: PC market set to see more casualties - Gartner 5). Another area channel partners need to be watching is ransomware. This week, Channelnomics spoke with solution providers and VIPRE about how channel partners should be equipping themselves to engage in the war against this cyber threat. With aversion to change, education gaps and a landscape evolving in more ways than one, partners have much to do in order to fully protect customers and capitalize on the opportunitities ransomware brings.

A review of some of the Intel's biggest acquisition failures might provide insight into how they have gone so wrong -- and a clue as to if Intel's latest string of purchases is destined to meet a similar fate. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Apr 7, 2017 at 10:40AM Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced it was spending $15.3 billion to acquire Israeli computer vision and machine-learning company Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY). In December 2015, the company paid a whopping $16.7 billion for chip maker Altera Corp, known for its field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These became the two largest acquisitions in the company's storied history and cap off a string of recent purchases Intel has made to position itself in the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI). Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon estimates that Intel has spent more than $30 billion on acquisitions in the last several years. Unfortunately, the company has a sketchy acquisitions track record, and several previous buying sprees have been disastrous, leading to massive writedowns. In 2010, technology website TechCrunch went as far as to say, "This is an awe-inspiringly bad track record, and likely puts Intel as the worst acquirer in tech history." Intel itself admits its less-than-stellar record. In a December 2015 interview with Bloomberg News, Intel Vice President Wendell Brooks stated, "There's general acknowledgment within the executive team and the board at Intel that we haven't done as well as we could do on past acquisitions."  Intel autonomous cars driving growth. Image source: Intel. Missed the move to mobile Failure to innovate left Intel behind the curve when phones and other mobile devices began their trek toward mass adoption. Between 1999 and 2003, the company spent over $11 billion acquiring companies in the cellphone and communication chip space and never gained a foothold in what was to become one of the largest migrations in tech history. It eventually sold off its cellphone chip business for a measly $600 million in 2006, missing the smartphone revolution that began just a year later.  Another dubious acquisition was that of antivirus software company McAfee in 2010 for $7.68 billion. The company aspired to embed security features onto its hardware and expand into additional markets beyond that of its signature chip business. Many felt the deal was ill-advised, with Forbes detailing prior the deal closing, "There is no synergy, no channel benefits, marginal revenue enhancement (considering the price), no new markets, and no meaningful strategy." Intel ultimately sold off 51% of its stake in the company for $4.2 billion.  Banking on new trends This record of questionable purchases hasn't slowed the company in its attempts to expand beyond its core processor market. Intel was recently singled out by market research company CB Insights, who noted that Intel ranks third in acquiring start-ups in the nascent field of AI over the last five years, having added three companies in 2016 alone. Nervana focused on deep learning, a sub discipline of AI that mimics the human brain's capacity to learn. The companies hope to develop an AI system that will integrate with Intel's existing processors. Itseez developed software for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, drones, cameras, and autonomous driving. Movidius specialized in hardware for computer vision used by drones and cameras, and it developed a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that accelerated computer vision and deep learning. CEO Brian Krzanich at Intel's AI Day 2016. Image source: Intel. Deja vu all over again or lesson learned? Questions remain as to whether this time will be any different. CNET notes that in some instances, Intel gave up on promising areas of business before they reached their full potential. On some occasions, the company ventured too far from its core proficiency only to realize its mistake too late. Finally, in many cases, Intel's company culture was such that it failed to embrace products outside of its core processor markets. Intel's current CEO Brian Krzanich appears to be taking a different approach with these latest acquisitions. In a move that may bode well for the future, Intel uncharacteristically decided to leave Mobileye's team in Israel and supplement them with Intel's existing team. This change in attitude, particularly if it comes from the top down, may break Intel's string of broken acquisitions and missed opportunities and provide the company with a path beyond the processor.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 7, 2017 at 12:30PM With the launch of its Haswell architecture in 2013, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) introduced a then-new branding scheme for the graphics technology embedded in its personal computer processors. The standard, relatively low-performance graphics processors would be marketed as Intel HD Graphics. A step up from Intel HD Graphics would be a technology marketed as Intel Iris graphics. And, at the very highest end of the product stack, Intel had a technology called Iris Pro. Image source: Intel. Intel's reasoning for building multiple different tiers of graphics technology is simple; it believed that it could charge more for chips with more sophisticated graphics technology, thereby boosting its processor average selling prices and ultimately profits. Intel's Iris graphics, which was primarily found in Intel's low-power notebook processors, saw a reasonable degree of success as major system vendors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Dell, and others adopted it. The company's Iris Pro graphics, on the other hand, was found on higher-performance notebook (and, in some cases, desktop) parts. Iris Pro, unfortunately, didn't see much success. Apple adopted the first-generation Iris Pro parts in its 15-inch MacBook Pro and today uses Intel's second-generation Iris Pro parts in its 21.5-inch iMac, but the Mac maker abandoned Iris Pro with the 15-inch MacBook Pro that it launched back in October, opting instead to use a discrete graphics processor alongside an Intel chip with just Intel HD Graphics. I expect that the next 21.5-inch iMac will also feature a discrete graphics processor paired with an Intel processor with HD Graphics. Iris Pro appears dead as the company did not release an Iris Pro product as part of its recently launched seventh-generation Core processor product line. In this article, I'd like to go over how Intel could potentially resurrect Iris Pro. Why was Iris Pro cancelled? Intel never "officially" explained why its Iris Pro product line was canned, but the bottom line is this: Intel builds chips that its customers (the major personal computer vendors) want to buy. If there were significant demand from Intel's major customers for Iris Pro parts, then Intel would surely have continued to build them. So, Intel stopped building Iris Pro because it didn't see demand for the products. This leads us to the question of why customers didn't find value in Iris Pro. That one's easy to explain, too. With Iris Pro, Intel added a lot more graphics resources to its chips, which in turn led to a ballooning in chip size. Larger chips are inherently harder and more expensive to produce than smaller ones. Image source: Intel. Not only were the Iris Pro chips themselves much more expensive to build than their non-Iris Pro counterparts, but the use of Iris Pro also necessitated the inclusion of an on-package memory technology, known as eDRAM ("Embedded DRAM"). This further added to cost. Higher cost isn't a problem; the alternative to a larger Iris Pro chip with embedded memory is the use of a stand-alone graphics processors, which, too, adds significant cost. The problem was that Iris Pro added meaningful cost, but its performance and power efficiency were rather disappointing. It simply makes more sense for computer makers to use relatively low-end stand-alone graphics processors than to use Iris Pro. How does Intel fix these problems? The first step that Intel needs to take to fix the issues that sunk Iris Pro is for Intel to simply build a better graphics architecture. I think that Intel's graphics architectures will continue to improve over time, and perhaps at some point in the next couple of generations Intel's graphics architecture will become robust enough to realize its original vision with Iris Pro (i.e., low-end discrete graphics processor replacement). Beyond that, though, there's still the issue of manufacturing cost. Intel recently talked about how it plans to chop up its future personal computer processors into discrete blocks, rather than try to integrate everything into a monolithic piece of silicon. This so-called "disaggregation" doesn't fundamentally change how much area a high-performance graphics block would take up (so there's still a cost adder), but since the graphics portion of the chip would be separated from the rest of the chip, the yield (and therefore cost) issues associated with a large monolithic silicon die wouldn't be present here. Foolish takeaway I have no idea if Intel is currently planning to resurrect its Iris Pro graphics technology in future chips. Leaks suggest, at the very least, that Iris Pro won't be coming back in the company's eighth-generation Core processors. It'll be interesting to see if Intel changes course with its ninth-generation Core processors or beyond. If the company can develop more compelling and more cost-effective solutions than it did with its prior attempts at Iris Pro, then maybe system vendors might be interested in buying such chips in the future. However, if Intel can't fundamentally tackle the challenges that plagued the previous Iris Pro parts, then Iris Pro will remain in the graveyard of failed Intel product lines.

Apple might be going pro with the iMac. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 7, 2017 at 8:15AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-centric website MacRumors recently reported on a recent post in blog Pike's Universum, in which a purported list of specifications/upgrades for Apple's next-generation iMacs -- which the blog says will be coming in "late October" -- is provided. Though you can see the full specification list here, there's one part of the specification list that's worth doing a sanity check on -- the main processor. Image source: Apple. No more Core processors for the iMac?  Apple's iMac computers have traditionally used chip-giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Core processor family. Today, Apple's iMacs can be configured with Intel's Core i5 chips, the middle-of-the-pack within Intel's Core processor lineup, or Core i7 chips, the cream of the crop. This new rumor claims that, instead of using Intel's Core chips, Apple will use Intel's Xeon E3 processors. Despite the fancy-sounding name, Intel's Xeon E3 chips are little more than Intel's Core processors with a few additional capabilities enabled -- namely, support for ECC memory and vPro technology. ECC memory -- ECC stands for "error correcting code" -- is a type of memory that, according to memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU), includes capabilities designed for "detecting and correcting single-bit memory errors." "By detecting and correcting single-bit errors, ECC server memory helps preserve the integrity of your data, prevent data corruption, and prevent system crashes and failures," Micron's webpage explains. I suspect that, if Apple really does shift its iMac line to Xeon E3 processors and away from Intel's traditional Core processors, it would be doing the shift mainly for ECC memory support. Does this make sense? If Apple's goal is to position the iMac -- and indeed, the Mac itself -- as a "professional" platform, then the use of Xeon E3 processors with ECC memory makes perfect sense. Apple already uses Intel Xeon E5 processors coupled with ECC memory in its Mac Pro line, so it's not as though use of such technologies would be unprecedented. What's worth noting, though, is that, while the use of Xeon E3 processors with ECC memory may appeal to professionals and prosumers, these features don't really buy the average consumer much. In fact, Apple will almost certainly have to jack up prices on its ECC-capable iMac computers to compensate for what are likely to be higher memory prices. So, does Apple force all potential iMac buyers to eat the costs of more expensive memory? Or does Apple simply offer "Core" options and "Xeon" options? Given how pricey Apple's iMac computers tend to be anyway -- and the supply-chain complexity of supporting too many computer models -- Apple may simply bet that its customer base won't mind a modest price increase due to the slightly pricier memory, and go all-in on Xeon. Foolish takeaway If Apple's goal is to position its Mac products as true "professional" products, while pushing more consumption-oriented consumers over to its iPad product line, then a move to Xeon-based iMacs (and MacBook Pros) with ECC memory support may be the right way to go. Apple may find that Xeon processors -- by their server/workstation heritage -- are more marketable to the professional/prosumer crowd, and even "regular" consumers might be enticed by the fact that, when they buy an Apple product, they get a Xeon processor rather than a "pedestrian" Core processor. I have no idea if this rumor is true, but it's certainly plausible.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Reuters/Chaiwat Subprasom Just a couple of days ago, Apple surprisingly announced that not only is the company going to release an iMac 2017 refresh, it’s also going to launch a pro model of the all-in-one desktop. The Mac maker did not go into details about the potential specs of the upcoming iMacs, but a new report suggests that the new desktops are going to pack powerful components. According to the Pike’s Universum, the new iMacs could house a number of upgrades that should make the desktop line-up potent enough for both regular consumers and pro users. Citing a “little bird [that] is usually pretty accurate,” the blog alleges that Apple’s new computers could include up to 64 GB of ECC RAM, AMD graphics, Intel Xeon E3 processors, faster NVMe SSDs and Thunderbolt 3 ports. Intel has yet to launch a Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, but the chip could ultimately be the E3-1280 v6 bundled with Intel HD Graphics P630. The 16 GB of ECC RAM is upgradable to 32 GB or 64 GB, according to the blog, which is in line with the most recent Mac Pro. In comparison, the current iMac line-up has 8 GB of non-ECC RAM, upgradable to 16 GB or 32 GB. ECC RAM is capable of detecting and patching up errors that can damage files and systems, so it’ll be swell if the iMac 2017 models have it. The blog claims that the “faster” NVMe SSDs can hold up to 2 TB while the AMD graphics are supposedly for VR (virtual reality) and pro app support. The likely addition of the Thunderbolt 3 ports comes as no surprise as they are currently included in the newest MacBook Pro. Apple is also apparently going to upgrade the new Mac Pro’s display and consider a name change for its operating system. “Apple is also working on [an] 8K display for the next generation of Mac Pros, which, by the way, will be much more like a PC with the next generation EFI BIOS,” alleges Pike’s Universum. “The next version of macOS won’t use a mountain [or] park name anymore. [There are] two names in the running. One starts with [an M].” According to MacRumors, one of the Cupertino, California-based tech giant’s trademarked names that could fit the description is Monterey. The blog likewise claims that the new iMacs are going to be released in late October together with a brand new keyboard. It also declared that the next Mac mini “won’t be so mini anymore.” Pike’s Universum and its report should be taken with a grain of salt. The blog is really not known to be a reputable source of Apple’s development plans. But one thing is for sure, the iMac 2017 units are coming. Apple itself confirmed that.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech Reviews / PC Specialist Fusion Zen (Ryzen 7 1700X, GTX 1070) PC Specialist Fusion Zen (Ryzen 7 1700X, GTX 1070) Leo Waldock 20 hours ago Featured Tech Reviews, General Purpose PC, PC, Reviews, Tech News Rating: 8.5. PC Specialist has launched its Fusion Zen PC which is built around the new AMD Ryzen 7 1700X CPU and a GTX 1070 graphics card. KitGuru has been impressed by Ryzen 7 with its eight cores and 16 threads and it is quite mind boggling to consider that Intel charges more than £1000 for Core i7-6900K which has a similar specification and level of performance where the AMD silicon costs less than £400. This means PC Specialist Fusion Zen is priced in the mid-range yet potentially has the legs to mix it with much more expensive workstation hardware. When you watch our video you will see we describe Fusion Zen as a hybrid PC that can play games, edit video and handle mundane tasks such as writing documents. The question is, does PC Specialist Fusion Zen perform sufficiently well that you can ditch Intel and move over to AMD? Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p60 HERE   Specification: Case Cooler Master MasterBox 5t Gaming Case CPU AMD Ryzen 7 1700X Eight Core CPU (3.4GHz-3.8GHz/20MB Cache/AM4) CPU Cooler Corsair H60 Hydro 120mm Motherboard Asus Prime X370-Pro (DDR4, 6Gb/s, CrossFireX/SLI, AURA RGB) 2 x USB 3.0 and 2 x USB 2.0 ports on back panel 2 x USB 3.0 on front panel Memory 16GB HyperX Savage DDR4-2133MHz (2x 8GB Kit) Graphics Card Zotac GeForce GTX 1070 8GB SSD 500GB WD Blue M.2 HDD 2TB Toshiba 3.5-inch Hard Disk SATA-III, 6GB/s, 7200rpm, 64MB Cache Power Supply Corsair 650W CS Series Modular 80 Plus Gold LED Lighting 2x 50cm RGB LED Strip Sound Card On-board 6 Channel (5.1) HD Audio Networking 10/100/1000 Gigabit LAN Port Operating System Windows 10 Home 64-bit Warranty 3 Year Standard Warranty (1 Month Collect & Return, 1 Year Parts, 3 Year Labour) The list of components used by PC Specialist ticks most of the boxes. Every part is a recognised brand and the signs of cost cutting are subtle, rather than in your face.  For example PC Specialist has used a Cooler Master MasterBox 5t case which looks good with its red and black colour scheme and mirrored front panel yet it is relatively cheap. You get 16GB of DDR4 memory, which is perfectly sufficient, and the SSD is 500GB which is large enough to hold Windows and a bunch of games. As we say in the video the SSD you see in the sample PC is SanDisk X400 which will be updated very soon to Western Digital Blue. In addition to the Solid State Drive you also get a 2TB hard drive which is heaps of bulk storage. Things go slightly downhill in two areas where PC Specialist has chosen a Hydro H60 120 liquid cooler and a 650W CS power supply. Both these components are found towards the lower reaches of Corsair’s extensive product range. The obvious point here is that stepping up to a more desirable 120mm cooler and higher quality power supply would add around £50 (or more) to the price of the system and these are the decisions made by PC builders every hour of the day. Balanced against that, we have the utmost faith in PC Specialist’s reputation and three year warranty. Indeed we had to make use of the warranty ourselves as the Zotac graphics card apparently took a knock in transit with the result that the cooler wasn’t making proper contact with the GPU. Temperatures hit the lower 90s C under load and performance was reduced by about 20 percent. We received a replacement Palit GTX 1070 the next day, installed the card in less than two minutes and all was well. If you look very closely at our photos you will see the replacement GPU uses a single 8-pin PCIe cable and the second connector from the power supply is hanging free. More importantly the GPU runs at 69 degrees C under load, which is exactly what we would expect. Testing. The Palit GTX 1070 runs at stock clock speeds of 1506MHz core and 1683MHz boost yet despite those lowly figures it delivered decent gaming performance at 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. More importantly, for the sake of this review, the Ryzen 7 1700X did the business and backed up the GPU admirably. In Ashes of the Singularity, the CPU test implies the Ryzen 7 trails behind Core i7-6700K while in the CPU test of 3D Mark Time Spy the Ryzen 7 does very well. Overall we found that PC Specialist Fusion Zen could play games very happily at 1440p resolution. Cooling Performance. Initially we were caught out by the way that AMD reports temperatures in Ryzen 7 1700X and 1800X. In this PC the CPU apparently idles at 56 degrees and rises to 68 degrees under load, however you have to deduct the 20 degree offset figure. After some simple maths we are told the true figures are an idle temperature of 36 degrees with 48 degrees under load. The idle temperature is rather high because the Corsair H60 fan has been set to run very slowly at low load and then spins up as the temperature rises with the result that you get a small Delta of 12 degrees in CPU temperature. The GTX 1070 behaves exactly as we would expect and tops out at 69 degrees. Acoustics performance. The Cooler Master MasterBox 5t case has an open design that doesn’t use any sound deadening material and the result is that this PC makes an audible noise pretty much the entire time. It is fairly quiet when the CPU is idling however the fan noise is clearly audible when you put the hardware under load. Closing Thoughts. Intel Core i7 continues to hold the advantage over AMD for gaming performance however Ryzen 7 has arrived with a bang and we have no doubt it is a significant success. The Fusion Zen from PC Specialist uses this new eight core CPU as the basis of an all-round PC that can be used for gaming as well as more serious work. As we would expect, PC Specialist has produced a professional PC that is neatly assembled and which works as intended. The single most annoying aspect is the way that temperatures are reported as the CPU appears to be 20 degrees hotter than it is in reality. Put that to one side and it is very easy to use this PC and simply forget the CPU is an AMD product as it simply works correctly. Buy from PC Specialist HERE. We can clearly see that PC Specialist has kept the price down to a sensible limit but it hasn’t cut costs outrageously. In particular we applaud the use of a 500GB SSD as that provides enough storage for Windows and a bunch of games. The biggest dividing line for anyone considering this PC is the use of a GTX 1070 graphics card. It would be perfectly possible to step up to a GTX 1080 if you opted for a smaller SSD and did without a liquid cooler. Or, of course, you could pay a higher total price. We are confident the combination of Ryzen 7 1700X and GTX 1070 will work successfully for a great many mainstream users and consider that PC Specialist has done a solid job with Fusion Zen. Pros: Ryzen 1700X packs eight cores and 16 threads. Solid 1440p gaming performance. Sensible price. 500GB SSD. Cooler Master MasterBox 5t case has stylish looks. Cons: Hardcore gamers may want GTX 1080 graphics. AMD reports CPU temperatures with 20 degree offset. Liquid cooler is only 120mm unit. KitGuru says:  The PC Specialist Fusion Zen is a great looking high performance system that is capable of a lot more than just gaming. Rating: 8.5.

Get the full story here.     Technology: 2 Picks From “The New Safe Haven” By John Persinos on April 7, 2017 Just login with your email address to instantly generate a PDF of this content. Privacy Policy Markets have been jumpy in recent days, spooked by all the political craziness at home and abroad. If you’re looking for safety, I explain why two titans of technology — that’s right, technology — are shelter from the gathering storm. Let’s first examine the international scene, which would resemble a Saturday Night Live sketch if the stakes weren’t so high. President Trump’s meeting this week with President Xi Jinping of China hasn’t exactly calmed investor nerves. Observing the brash American president’s attempts at diplomacy is like watching a man who’s trying to navigate an icy sidewalk. Potential disaster looms at every faltering step. Also unnerving traders is heightened saber rattling from North Korea’s President Kim Jong-un, a cartoon-like character with a bad haircut who nonetheless seems intent on getting his hands on a nuclear weapon. Western intelligence experts this week expressed their suspicions that the recent failure of a North Korean missile test was caused by U.S. cyber sabotage. Indeed, Trump has declared that “all options are on the table” in dealing with totalitarian North Korea. Until some of this dust settles, expect the markets to seesaw. One trend appears resilient, though: the momentum of the technology sector. The S&P 500 benchmark index enjoyed a healthy first quarter, gaining 5.5%, which was exceeded by an even stronger performance by the Nasdaq, which gained nearly 10% in the quarter. Tech stocks are on the upswing in large part because of increased IT spending among corporate clients and the prospect of lower taxes under Trump. And yet, many risk-averse investors remain traumatized by the dotcom bust of 2000, which obliterated $6.2 trillion in household wealth. The ingrained perception has lingered: technology stocks are simply too volatile. That’s a big miscalculation, because select technology companies have matured into “Steady Eddy” growth-and-income stocks. Jim Pearce, chief investment strategist of Personal Finance and Breakthrough Tech Profits, explains it this way: “The tech sector continues to be wrongly viewed as a bubble consisting largely of grossly overvalued companies primed for a steep fall at the first hint of economic weakness… However, there’s opportunity for investors to bargain hunt for what we believe are attractively priced value stocks that should deliver solid dividends and steady growth for decades to come.” Here are two tech stalwarts that aptly fit Jim’s description: Cisco Systems (NSDQ: CSCO) and Intel (NSDQ: INTC). This duo may be on the conservative side as technology stocks, but amid the volatility of the Trump era, that’s a good thing. All sit on big cash hoards and control proprietary technology that’s increasingly sought by consumers and businesses around the world. These two companies are leaders in their respective niches — Cisco in networking technologies and Intel in semiconductor manufacturing. Lots of cash on hand provides these companies with a cushion for the market downturn many analysts see ahead. It also allows them to make the consistently strong R&D spending that’s necessary for tech companies to maintain their competitive edge. If Trump makes good on his promise to allow tech companies to repatriate overseas cash for a lower domestic tax rate, you’ll see an explosion of R&D and acquisitions from my two recommendations. Let’s take a look. Cisco: taking a byte out of cyber crime… Attacks allegedly emanating from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army of hackers have placed cyber security on the political front burner, indicating continued robust demand for Cisco’s security products. Cisco is one of the biggest suppliers of Internet-based networking products; the company’s routers and switches are pervasive in offices, classrooms and government offices around the globe. Cisco will continue to benefit from the accelerating trend of around-the-clock, global connectivity. Moreover, as the leading player in cyber security, Cisco is in the best position to profit from growing concerns about international hacking. The company boasts a cash pile of $71.8 billion, which provides the wherewithal to buy small, innovative rivals and to weather cyclical ups and downs. Cisco shares currently trade at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.2, a bargain compared to the trailing P/E of 24.7 for its industry. The dividend yield is 3.47%. The average analyst expectation is that Cisco’s year-over-year earnings growth will reach 4.6% next year, and 10.04% over the next five years (on an annualized basis). Intel: making the smartphone transition… Intel is the largest maker of semiconductors in the world, but the migration away from PCs toward smartphones has hurt the company. Intel’s PC business remains its biggest operating unit, accounting for two-thirds of sales. Intel is likely to continue its dominance of the PC microprocessor market over the long haul, thanks to a strong R&D budget. Intel also is devoting considerable resources to developing new, ever-faster chips for smartphones. Meanwhile, the company sits on $17.1 billion in cash, quite a “war chest” for dividend boosts and stock buybacks. While you wait for PC demand to rebound along with the global recovery, the stock will reward you with a healthy dividend yield of 3.00%. The average analyst expectation is that Intel’s year-over-year earnings growth will reach 4.7% next year, and 8.1% over the next five years (on an annualized basis). The stock’s trailing P/E is a relatively low 17. Got a question or comment? Drop me a line: mailbag@investingdaily.com — John Persinos Your antidote to investment jitters… Picture a trade war between America and China or an outbreak of strife on the Korean peninsula. Or perhaps a U.S. government shutdown this month, which Republicans in Congress now threaten unless improbable cuts are made to the federal budget. In any one of these scenarios, the overvalued stock market would plunge. But there’s a way for you to generate steady profits, regardless of political risks and market gyrations.

Image: 55Ohms/Shutterstock There are 25 women on this industry-spanning list of CIOs. That’s 10 more than the percentage found in all Fortune 500 companies. Last year, a Korn Ferry Institute study of the largest companies in the US found that only 24pc of those in C-suite roles were women. When it came to the role of chief information officer (CIO), that number dropped to 19pc. “Having gender equality in the CIO role is already top of mind for CEOs and boards. We expect this focus to continue for years to come as the CIO creates greater strategic impact across organisations,” said Craig Stephenson from Korn Ferry when this data was released. Image: Korn Ferry Institute Singling out Fortune 500 companies, Boardoom Insiders found an even smaller female CIO headcount of 15pc as of November 2016. However, the top 100 of these companies manage to hit 20pc, which aligns with other research indicating that companies with gender-diverse leadership prove to be more profitable. These studies and more like them have ensured more focus is being paid to closing the gender gap in business leadership, putting diversity on the boardroom agenda. And so, because representation matters in the battle for gender diversity in tech, we have drawn up this long list of women CIOs (plus a handful of exceptions in CIO-adjacent roles who continue to influence in this space). We found CIOs with interesting stories, spanning a broad spectrum of industry in this technical role. Many are directing IT strategy at world-famous brands and Fortune 500 companies and, with decades upon decades of experience between them, have served as pioneers for women in tech. Pam Parisian As CIO of AT&T Services, Tennessee native Pam Parisian is one of a select few female CIOs at Fortune 500 companies. Parisian’s standing in the tech industry is such that she was inducted into the Women in Technology hall of fame in 2015. In recent years, she has been entrusted to lead AT&T’s integration of DirecTV, which was acquired in 2015. The initial effort involved more than 3,300 IT people and 2m hours of code. Linda Clement-Holmes Linda Clement-Holmes. Image: Linda Clement-Holmes/LinkedIn Linda Clement-Holmes is CIO of P&G, having assumed the role in October 2015. Originally joining the company in 1983, her previous roles at P&G have included chief diversity officer, SVP of global business services, and global information and decision solutions officer. A well-regarded leader, Clement-Holmes has been touted as a future CEO of the $65bn company. Sheila Jordan Sheila Jordan is CIO and SVP at cybersecurity company Symantec. With more than three years in the role to date, she currently oversees more than 600 IT employees. Jordan’s role has seen her work on the company’s two major acquisitions in the past few months – spending $4.6bn on Blue Coat and $2.3bn on LifeLock. A winner at the San Francisco CIO of the Year Awards in 2015, Jordan recently explained her role as that of integrating these two businesses into Symantec’s operation. Marcy Klevorn Marcy Klevorn, CIO, Ford. Image: Ford Named CIO of Ford in 2015, Marcy Klevorn originally started out in marketing with AT&T after earning a business degree from University of Michigan. She retrained in computer science and shifted towards Ford and, often thanking her lack of a technologist path, excelled. Klevorn recently spoke of her interest in the people side of work, claiming that interpersonal skills are as important as technical ability. She is also an advocate of encouraging more women into the tech industry. Aarti Shah Aarti Shah, senior VP and CIO, Eli Lilly. Still from ‘Employers Discuss The Demand For Statisticians’. Image: This Is Statistics/YouTube Having joined Eli Lilly in 1994 as a senior statistician, Aarti Shah rose up the ranks to her appointment as senior vice-president and CIO in 2016. Prior to her current role, she served a three-year stint as Eli Lilly’s global brand development leader for immunology. Now, she leads an IT organisation of 1,300 employees. In 2011, Shah received the Rising Star Award from Healthcare Businesswoman’s Association for her contribution to the sector. Paula Tolliver Paula Tolliver, corporate VP and CIO, Intel. Image: Intel In an effort to recruit top talent from outside its own company, Intel hired former Dow Chemical corporate VP and CIO, Paula Tolliver, to succeed Kim Stevenson as CIO in August of last year. Over the past 20 years, Tolliver has become well known for her understanding of cybersecurity, having led Dow Chemical’s $1bn services business. Kim Stevenson Senior VP and general manager of Lenovo’s data centre infrastructure, Kim Stevenson. Image: Kim Stevenson/Twitter Kim Stevenson has risen to become one of the biggest names in the data centre business having recently been confirmed as the new senior VP and general manager of Lenovo’s data centre infrastructure. Stevenson spent the previous seven-and-a-half years at Intel where she was not only CIO, but also COO of its rapidly growing IoT and System Architecture Group, and was credited with earning $351m for the company in 2015. Sharon Cooper The BMJ CDO, Sharon Cooper. Image: The BMJ According to CIO Magazine, there are only two CIOs in the UK ranking higher than Sharon Cooper at The BMJ (originally known as the British Medical Journal). In her role as chief digital officer at the renowned medical journal, Cooper is transitioning the traditional publishing business into the digital age, particularly within new cloud technology. Cooper was also named as a finalist for a Digital Leader of the Year award in this year’s Women in IT Awards. Diana McKenzie Diana McKenzie, SVP and CIO, Workday. Image: Workday Workday SVP Diana McKenzie is the first ever CIO of the software solutions company, appointed in early 2016. With a background in information systems roles, McKenzie held the CIO position at pharma firm Amgen before joining Workday. Responsible for development of the company’s products, technologies and computer programs, McKenzie is focused on developing best practice for global information services organisations. She is a regular fixture on the Workday blog, offering her take on business transformation. Jane Moran Jane Moran, global CIO, Unilever. Image: Unilever Jane Moran has been global CIO at Unilever since June 2014, moving to the consumer goods company after her global CIO role at Thomson Reuters. Having begun her career in venture capital, she soon discovered a passion for IT, which put her on the CIO track. Overseeing development of emerging technologies and day-to-day tech development at Unilever, Moran sees herself as a foundation builder, enabling her colleagues to deploy the latest technologies. Sarah Wilkinson Home Office CIO Sarah Wilkinson. Still from ‘O2 and Wayra Event – How digital start-ups can help the public sector do more for their citizens’. Image: 02ukbusiness/YouTube Upon her appointment as CIO for the Home Office in the UK government in 2015, CIO Magazine described Sarah Wilkinson as having “ushered in an era of major transformation”. Under her command, the Home Office has delivered several new systems including biometric residency permits and counter-terrorism capabilities. She has also reinvigorated the government’s e-Borders programme for travel and immigration, expected to come into force in 2019 after eight years of delays. Cynthia Stoddard Cynthia Stoddard, Adobe CIO and SVP. Image: Adobe Appointed as CIO and SVP of Adobe in June 2016, Cynthia Stoddard came to the role from the same position at data storage and management firm NetApp. She has more than 25 years in the industry, incorporating a number of IT and technical leadership roles. At Adobe, Stoddard leads the strategy, development and deployment of scalable technology and business infrastructure for the cloud platform business. She also has responsibility for global strategy to support customer experience. Fumbi Chima Fumbi Chima, CIO, Burberry.

I hadn't either until yesterday Intel decided to give it a big hug, taking Chainer from being big in Japan, where its parent company Preferred Networks works with the likes of Toyota on secret projects, to rather greater prominence. Chainer can use the help: launched in 2015 and open-sourced last year, the tool's GitHub repo is busy but hardly the most lively place on the internet. That's probably about to change because Intel has decided Chainer is a fine way to develop AI workloads that create demand for its silicon. Doubly so if it can be taught to speak fluent Xeon, instead of only chatting to NVIDIA GPUs as was previously the case. The deal between Intel and Preferred means Chainer will from now on be developed for Intel architectures and changes shared on Intel's GitHub repo for the project. Why should we care that Intel's decided to give Chainer a leg-up? On the purely technical side of things, it looks like good gear. Chainer CEO Toru Nishikawa yesterday showed Intel's AI Day in Tokyo the slide below on which he claims to have made Google's TensorFlow look like it was working in treacle when measured on training time for image net classifications. Nishikawa-San also said Chainer had tied in a recent Amazon.com test to train robots to pick stock. So you could do worse than have a look if you are thinking about neural networks. But the Chainer tie-up is also worth considering because it shows how Intel builds markets and will try to make itself the dominant player in Artificial Intelligence, a market widely assumed to be on the cusp of a boom. It's also a market that is currently keen on GPUs. So Intel wants to build a portfolio of products to make Xeons the heart of AI, not GPUs. Intel's not, however, using SciFi definitions of AI. Amir Khosrowshahi, former CTO of Nervana and now holder of the same position in Intel's new AI Group, prefers to describe AI as involving deep statistical analysis of very closely-observed events so that we can infer likely outcomes with satisfying precision. Modern hardware can do that analysis and wrangle the necessary mountains of data collected to make the analysis useful, but it mostly brute-forces it. Dedicated hardware will speed things up and that's where Intel is going, by building and/or buying that hardware and building the software ecosystem to match. You may have seen this movie before when virtualization was obviously the next big thing and Intel added extensions to its silicon so it would be especially good at hosting multiple VMs. Chipzilla's also done things like bridge the Lustre and HDFS file systems so that HPC clusters runnings Lustre could run Hadoop, which relies on HDFS. Intel wins either way: it's invested in Hadoop provider Cloudera and has lots of HPC customers who didn't scream when Chipzilla made their rigs more useful. Intel's also optimised its consumer CPUs for video transcoding because editing HD home movies without having to stay up all night is one of the few compelling reasons to buy a new PC. Intel's now using the same playbook for AI. Buying field-programmable gate array (FPGA) vendor Altera gave Intel the tech to build hybrid Xeons that offer integrated programmability so you can get silicon speed for exotic analyses that would make a vanilla Xeon weep. Altera is now working to make sure that developing code for FPGAs, once the province of embedded systems engineers, is not a stretch for the average Java developer. Bernhard Friebe, Intel's director of planning and marketing for FPGA Design Software and Intellectual Property, said Intel is developing libraries for common AI tasks, gives them away and has built tools that mean developers need to write just one line of code to target FPGAs. Nervana gave Intel silicon tailored to AI and lots of the software developers will need to use it. The two companies also give Intel the technology it will one day bake into Xeons so they become better at the kind of data-crunching AI needs. We'll see those products emerge later in 2017 when the “Lake Crest” Xeon adds a discrete AI accelerators for AI workloads. The Skylake Xeon with a joined-at-the-hip FPGA, code-named Knights Crest, will debut later in the same year. Intel's being shy about exact specs, but Both use proprietary inter-chip links and a new architecture called “Flexpoint” to improve parallelism. But they're early products: both promise 10x parallelism. By 2020 Intel pledges to reduce the time needed to train an AI model by a factor of 100. But the main game here is that by adding AI abilities to those Xeons, Intel can talk to mainstream users about doing AI with familiar kit, rather than wrapping their head around GPUs. And it can point to Chainer and many other software investments to show that existing developers won't struggle to at least start playing with AI. The company still has exotica up its sleeve. Barry Davis, general manager of Intel's “Accelerator Workload Group”, told El Reg that by the second half of 2018 we'll also see “Knight's Mill”, the next-generation Xeon Phi optimised for AI. Details of the product are scarce, but Intel is talking up the fact it will be able to address up to 400GB of memory, far more than some GPUs. Once everyday Xeons are good at AI, there will be little excuse not to consider them. More exotic products like Xeon Phi or FPGA-bonded Xeons can also run in the cloud, where users can try them out without capital expenditure. By the time the ready-for-AI range is mature, Chainer will have been running on Intel hardware for about three years, will probably be rather improved thanks to the input Intel's support will have generated. That won't tup tip anyone over into a decision to go Intel when contemplating AI. But bringing Chainer into Intel's world is one of a dozen or a hundred other efforts. Some of those efforts are blindingly obvious billion-dollar acquisitions. Some are imperceptible nudges to useful open source projects. Others will be thoroughly obscure instructions issued to server-makers. They'll all add up to an ecosystem designed to make Intel all-but-impossible to leave off a list of “vendors to consider when doing AI” . Of course the world's not going to stand still and let Intel do this. But Chipzilla is confident it can dominate any rivals. At this point it's tempting to point out that Intel is nowhere in mobile, a field in which it felt its modus operandi would work but ended up being slaughtered by ARM. Barry Davis thinks Intel has figured out why: his version of recent history says ARM always wanted to start at the edge of the network and work its way in to the data centre. In the mobile field, Intel tried to work the way it had with PCs but found itself surrounded, late to the party and without the right friends once it arrived. The execs I met yesterday didn't dismiss challenges ARM presents in AI, but feel that as ARM is yet to become a significant data centre player and therefore isn't in a position to spearhead an ecosystem-creating challenge that will satisfy businesses and developers. Of course Intel would say that, wouldn't it? Or is its confidence derived from deep statistical analysis of closely-observed events that let it infer likely outcomes with satisfying precision? ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register Artificial intelligence will eradicate channel drudgery, says Lenovo boss Canalys Channels Forum 2016 Any intelligence would be a start, grumble partners 16 Comments MEPs in 'urgent' call for new laws on artificial intelligence and robotics Liability issues with self-driving cars is key concern 17 Comments Reg readers cluster in pub to ponder artificial intelligence Reg Events And hear why a mic-dropping, beer hurling AI would be a real advance 2 Comments Baidu Research grills AI models on deep learning Tool aims to reduce machine-training time Baidu peddles PaddlesPaddles, floats open source AI tech Deep learning suite with Python front end White House to bring us up to speed on artificial intelligence hype latest Will AI kill or cure? 11 Comments Whitepapers Dynamic Optimization Technology for Infrastructure Resources and Cloud Services Access this Innovation Insight to read Gartner’s recommendations for incorporating dynamic optimisation technology into your infrastructure and cloud initiatives.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 1:04 PM Intel CEO pay rises to US$19.1mil as security costs climb Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth US$11.7mil (RM51.91mil), a 20% increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement April 6. — Bloomberg Intel Corp boosted chief executive officer Brian Krzanich’s compensation package 30% to US$19.1mil (RM84.75mil) last year, fuelled by a bigger stock award and costs for his personal security arrangements.  Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth US$11.7mil (RM51.91mil), a 20% increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement April 6. The CEO also received US$1.25mil (RM5.54mil) in salary, US$3.7mil (RM16.41mil) in bonuses, about US$2.13mil (RM9.45mil) in security services, plus other smaller items.  The decision to bolster the security programme came as Krzanich in April last year said some senior executives had faced backlash for the company’s stance and efforts on diversity, according to a TechCrunch report. In 2015, the CEO pledged Intel would spend US$300mil (RM1.33bil) to make the gender and ethnicity of the company’s workforce representative of the US population by 2020. He also vowed to tie executive pay to that goal.  The world’s largest chipmaker, like many other tech companies, has faced criticism for employing few women, blacks and Hispanics. In its diversity report for fiscal 2016, Intel said it achieved pay parity for women and underrepresented minorities and increased its share of female employees to 25.8%, a 2.3% gain since 2014.  The company spent US$1.86mil (RM8.25mil) on personal security for Krzanich and another US$275,200 (RM1.22mil) to protect his residence. Executive vice-president Venkata Renduchintala received security services worth US$944,800 (RM4.19mil) and Stacy Smith, who oversees manufacturing, operations and sales, got US$309,900 (RM1.37mil). The threats were targeted against the CEO and certain other executives, and in some cases their family members, according to the filing, which didn’t provide details on the specific arrangements.  By comparison, Intel spent US$39,600 (RM175,725) for Krzanich’s security in 2015. The company also enhanced the programme that year in response to “specific job-related situations,” a filing shows. His full 2015 compensation was US$14.6mil (RM64.78mil).  The CEO is trying to remake the company by converting its dominance in PC chips into a presence in markets ranging from cars to mobile phones to drones. That push has yet to provide Intel with enough revenue and profit to shake its dependence on its main source of income. Its finances are increasingly reliant on demand for processors running server computers in giant data centers that support computing over the internet.  Krzanich’s annual bonus, which paid out slightly above its US$3.5mil (RM15.53mil) target, is tied to absolute and relative financial performance, and operational goals. About 60% of his stock award is linked to total shareholder return and vests if Intel beats the median return among a group of tech companies over three years. The remaining shares vest in increments over three years as long as he remains on the job.  His bonus payout can be adjusted based on how Intel achieves goals related to hiring and retaining women and under-represented minorities.  Renduchintala, who joined the company in November 2015, received a US$20.4mil (RM90.52mil) pay package. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Foreign residents to pay higher fees Upside seen in property market Chong Wei-Lin Dan final on the cards Hang up if 'banks' call for personal data, says ABM Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Indian police arrest alleged kingpin of U.S. tax scam Heartfelt rewards await mothers Willett, Stenson, Watson miss Masters cut advertisement Latest News Car owners tap into sharing economy to help offset costs Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Restaurants fatten up with food delivery apps Anthony Bourdain launches new digital travel guide for fans EU to end mobile roaming charges in June Most Viewed in Tech Restaurants fatten up with food delivery apps Car owners tap into sharing economy to help offset costs Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Anthony Bourdain launches new digital travel guide for fans EU to end mobile roaming charges in June Amazon takes voice battle with Apple TV outside US Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news Canon launches three new entry level cameras – EOS 800D, EOS77D and EOSM6 Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

By Chris Duckett | April 7, 2017 -- 00:38 GMT (17:38 PDT) | Topic: Innovation The reason why industry needs new architecture for neural networks becomes apparent when you work with GPUs at a low level, according to recently appointed chief technology officer of Intel Artificial Intelligence Product Group, Amir Khosrowshahi. Khosrowshahi was previously co-founder and CTO of Nervana System, which was purchased by the chip giant for an undisclosed amount in August last year, and whose technology quickly found itself at the centre of Intel's plans for AI. A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem. Read More The CTO detailed how his former company used GPUs because "that was the state of the art", but the company replaced the standard Nvidia assembler with one of its own because it was regarded by Nervana as generating "sub-optimal" instructions. "Early on in the history of Nervana we did this, partly for our own development efforts, but then realised it was about two or three times faster than Nvidia's own libraries, so we released it as open source," Khosrowshahi told ZDNet on Thursday. Nervana's efforts did not stop at software alone, with the company also creating its own silicon targeting neural network training. "Neural networks are a series of predetermined operations, it's not like a user interacting with a system, it's a set of instructions that can be described as a data flow graph," he said. According to Khosrowshahi, some of the features that help a graphics processing unit do its graphics rendering job -- such as a large amount of cache, and handling vertices, rendering, and textures -- is superfluous. "There is so much circuitry in a GPU that is not necessary for machine learning ... this is crud that has accumulated over time, and it's quite a lot of stuff," he said. "You don't need the circuitry which is quite a large proportion of the chip and also high cost in energy utilisation." "Neural networks are quite simple, they are little matrix multiplications and non-linearities, you can directly build silicon to do that. You can build silicon that is very faithful to the architecture of neural networks, which GPUs are not." The answer Khosrowshahi had a hand in developing is now called Lake Crest, a discrete accelerator which Intel is set to roll out to select customers this year, but over time, it will become more closely tied to Xeon processors. "It's a tensor processor, it deals with instructions that are matrix operations," Khosrowshahi explained. "So the instruction set is matrix 1 multiplied by matrix 2, go through a lookup table, and these big instructions that are high-level. "In a GPU it is a register and a register, move into [another] register, do an element-by-element multiplication, it's fairly low-level." Whereas the CTO said Nvidia have made an effort to make their GPUs more neural network friendly in recent years, their AI chips still carry a lot of graphics functionality with them. "Being part of a chip effort myself, I can see why that would be hard for Nvidia to do," he said. On the other hand, Intel shifted the way it approached AI through purchases. "It's a challenge in the chip industry to come up with an entirely new architecture; what Intel has done is they have purchased it," Khosrowshahi said. "They've bought FPGAs [field-programmable gate array], so they bought Altera, which is this really cool architecture that is very neural networky, so FPGA fabric is pretty interesting for neural networks... and of course the Nervana chip is very much a neural network focused engine, but slightly removed from neural networks." When thinking about neural networks, Khosrowshahi said it is wrong to think about etching neural networks in silicon, as much of that functionality remains in software. "Quite a lot of it is in software, so even in the case of Lake Crest, the instructions [for Lake Crest] are not 'neural network, do this', it's multiply this matrix by this matrix." "Outside the chip there is some software that knows it is a neural network, and it is training, and the user is asking for different things and searching for parameters -- all the sorts of things you have to do when you have a neural network system." With a background in neuroscience, Khosrowshahi believes the point of artificial intelligence is not to recreate the human brain, but to go beyond it. "The brain is an example of an AI, but it is a certain limited AI in the sense that my visual system sees the physical world, and it knows to understand the statistics of the world," he said. "If you look around you, you see a lot of edges, you see a lot of surfaces, you see shaded regions and so forth, and if you actually look in the brain ... [in] the primary visual cortex, there are neurons that are sensitive to these features, so your AI has learned the statistics of the world and is able to do inferences on them -- like I'm going to crash into this, or this is a cup, I want to hold the cup." But the data within enterprises is much different from that humans interact with, Khosrowshahi said. "It's rows of tables, of people clicking on stuff, potentially the statistics are very non-intuitive, so the idea of having intelligence working on this data is kind of a different form of intelligence." "I try to explain this to people because they think we are recreating a brain, we want to go beyond that, we want to create a new kind of AI that can understand the statistics of data used in business, in medicine, in all sorts of areas, and that data is very different in nature than the actual world." One of the AI architectures Intel will go up against is Google's custom-built Tensor Processing Unit, which the search giant said on Wednesday would be 15 times to 30 times faster than contemporary GPUs and CPUs at inference, as well as being 30 times to 80 times more power efficient. Also on Wednesday, IBM and Nvidia announced Big Blue would offer Tesla P100s within its IBM Cloud from May.

By Cal Jeffrey on Apr 7, 2017, 4:00 PM TechSpot The Ryzen 5 series of processors from AMD does not even hit store shelves until next Tuesday, but that has not stopped Antonline, from selling the CPUs from a sample lot. Forbes reported that early reviews of the Ryzen 5 1600 have already surfaced stating that it outperforms the Intel Core i7-7700K. Even though the quad-core 7700K is clocked at a base of 4.2 GHz, the Ryzen 5 was able to beat it with its 6-core/12-thread architecture clocking at 3.2 GHz. In fact, the Intel processor could not even keep up when it was overclocked to 4.9 GHz. Speaking of overclocking, the boys over at HardOCP were curious how far the new Ryzen 5 CPUs could be pushed. So they too decided to take advantage of the available samples and run them through their water-cooled unit. The Ryzen 5 series comes in four flavors the quad-core/8-thread 1400 and 1500X, and the 6-core/12-thread 1600 and 1600X. HardOCP purchased two 1400 and two 1600 to put through stress testing. All of the processors have a base clock speed of 3.2 GHz. First, they tested the 1600 CPUs. After hours of testing, the CPU was running stable at 4.0 GHz using 3200 MHz RAM. The core voltage was set to 1.45 volts and level 5 load-line calibration. Both Ryzen 1600s worked identically. They then tested the 1400 processors. The first was stable at 3.9 GHz running at 1.4 volts and an LLC at level 2. The second one they really tried to push to 4.0 GHz, but it would only operate at that speed for less than an hour. They got it stable at 3.975 GHz with a 1.45 v core and at LLC 5. All of these overclocked tests were pushing the CPUs to their absolute limits. All threads were running a full load and the heat produced was high even with water cooling. The 1400 units were operating in a temperature range of 57-67 Celsius, and the 1600s were around 70-73 C. HardOCP stated that “Once you get past 3.8 GHz on these processors, the voltage usage and heat emitted just gets exponential with them. So they get very hot, very quickly,” so you would be better of giving up that extra 100 MHz. Overall, the testers were more pleased with the Ryzen 5 1600. They said that the 1600s were more consistent and easier to set up and get stable. However, they recommend that overclockers be sure to have their BIOS updated because they have experienced buggy issues involving RAM. Ryzen 5 series will hit store shelves April 11, but if you cannot wait that long Antonline is still selling them on Ebay for $180 for the 1400 and $232 for the 1600. Check out TechSpot's full review of the Ryzen 5 1600X and 1500X coming up next Tuesday after the official embargo lifts.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > G.Skill's newest DDR4 memory should make it a… G.Skill's newest DDR4 memory should make it a little easier to wait for DDR5 By Mark Coppock — April 7, 2017 12:33 PM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're building a new PC using Intel's latest chipsets, then you might want to wait for G.Skill's latest DDR4 memory. The next wave in PC memory, DDR5, is set to be introduced in 2018 with significantly improved performance. In the meantime, PC builders and buyers will need to settle with today’s fastest option, DDR4 RAM and, fortunately, memory makers are not standing still in terms of making that specification perform the best it can. One example is G.Skill, which is introducing some high-capacity memory hitting some blisteringly fast clock speeds and offering up some RGB lighting for a customizable aesthetic. Specifically, the company is releasing new ultra-high capacity Trident Z RGB DDR4 memory kits utilizing 16GB modules and designed for Intel X99 and Z270 chipsets. More: DDR5 memory specifications expected to be finalized by JEDEC association in 2018 First, Trident Z RGB modules are available in sets of eight for PCs utilizing the Z99 chipset, allowing for 64GB (8 x 8GB) and 128GB (8 x 16GB) configurations. The modules will run at DDR4-3,466MHz (CL16-18-18-38) with 8GB x 8 and at DDR4-3,333MHz (CL16-18-18-38) with 16GB x 8. Next, performance will reach even higher levels with Intel Z270 systems, albeit with slightly lower capacity. When configured with two 16GB modules, the resulting 32GB RAM will operate at DDR4-3,866MHz (CL18-18-38). Both sets of DDR4 modules will support G.Skill’s RGB lighting effects, with a dedicated lighting control application for complete customizability. XMP 2.0 support will also be provided for stress-free overclocking. The following table provides a full list of the new parts and their complete specifications. The line’s frequencies will range from 2,400MHz up to 3,866MHz, in a variety of configurations providing for a wide range of capacities up to a full 128GB of very fast RAM. G.Skill will be releasing the new Trident Z RGP memory kits in May and has not yet provided full pricing information. Each module will be covered by the company’s limited lifetime warranty to provide buyers with a sense of security to go along with the dramatic increase in performance and capacity.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Acer’s crazy expensive $9,000 Predator… Acer’s crazy expensive $9,000 Predator laptop is stalking PC gamers globally By Kevin Parrish — April 7, 2017 11:41 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC gamers with $9,000 to spare now have a new option for playing their favorites on a high-end mobile solution sporting a 21-inch curved WFHD display. For those who haven’t heard about Acer’s Predator 21 X gaming laptop with a curved screen, you are about to do a double-take. After first appearing at CES 2017 in January, the company said the high-end unit would hit the market sometime in the first quarter. However, that did not happen but instead, it officially launched on Wednesday in Taiwan as the global rollout starting point. The double-take? It has a starting price of $9,000. Yep, you read that correctly. In Acer’s defense, the laptop is loaded with meaty components that probably have no problems sustaining a high framerate at 2,560 x 1080 on and off the 6,000 mAh battery. The list not only includes a curved 21-inch G-Sync-compatible screen, but two GeForce discrete graphics chips in SLI mode and a shiny new quad-core seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor. Here are the monstrous goods: Model: Predator 21 X GX21-71-76ZF Screen size: 21 inches Panel type: In-Plane Switching (IPS), LED backlit, G-Sync Maximum resolution: 2,560 x 1,080 @ 120Hz Aspect ratio: 21:9 Screen curvature: 2000R Processor: Intel Core i7-7820HK @ 2.90GHz Graphics: 2x GeForce GTX 1080 Graphics memory: 16GB GDDR5X System memory: 32GB DDR4 (64GB max, 4x DIMM slots, 2,400MHz) Storage: 1TB hard drive 1TB solid state drive Connectivity: Wireless AC Audio: 4x Speakers Ports: 1x Ethernet 1x SD card reader 1x HDMI 1x DisplayPort 4x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C 1x Headphone jack 1x Microphone jack Battery: 8-cell 6,000mAh Li-Ion Dimensions: 2.71 – 3.28 (H) x 22.4 (W) x 12.4 (D) inches Weight: 18.74 pounds Operating system: Windows 10 Home 64-bit For starters, the display has a curvature of 2000R. The ‘R’ represents the radius of a complete circle, so the smaller the radius, the larger the curved form factor becomes for a screen. Curved screens are better on the eyeballs because your built-in optical orbs aren’t flat, and right now, a curvature of around 2000R seems to be the sweet spot, which this notebook gladly rubs the right way. The screen is also based on IPS panel technology, which is known for its rich colors and wide viewing angles. The older Twisted Nematic tech is typically associated with gaming due to its response time and high brightness. However, Acer may have opted for IPS to better support the curved form factor. More: Upgrade to ultrawide with the 34-inch Acer Predator curved monitor, now $200 off Regardless, the huge cost of Acer’s new laptop likely resides in the large 21-inch curved display and the two $500 GTX 1080 graphics chips. Intel does not list the pricing for its i7-7820HK chip, but it shows an introductory price of $378 when the chip made its first appearance in January. The product page also shows that units will come packed with Tobii eye-tracking technology and there is G-Sync to consider as well. When this beastly laptop will hit the North American market is unknown. However, Acer Taiwan president Dave Lin said customers will have the ability to customize the device, hence the massive “starting” price. The company will even send out engineers to help customers set up the laptop after purchase, he added.

Published on April 07, 2017. Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad that was pulled amid criticism Credit: Pepsi Most Popular The Pepsi-Kendall Jenner ad fiasco was barely a few hours old when some people at ad agencies targeted a culprit: Pepsi used an in-house shop, which in the eyes of many led to the marketing mishap. The criticism was particularly sharp on a Reddit thread dedicated to the ad. "In-house just doesn't cut it, as there are too few people in the chain saying 'no.' Advertisers clearly don't have the self-discipline," a self-described creative from New York stated. "In-house creative directors are jaded, tired old-timers who simply want to get paid and go home." But the issue is a little more nuanced and complex than that. Certainly Pepsi could have benefited from some external perspective that potentially could have saved them from unleashing the spot, which has been widely ridiculed for co-opting protest movements for commercial gain. But external agencies are not a cure-all. "I've seen good agencies make work that was just as bad [as Pepsi's]," said one high-ranking executive at a major ad agency. Blaming in-house agencies is "overly simplistic," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who covers advertising. Agencies can also be guilty of groupthink or being overly concerned with pleasing a client, he added. Indeed, highly-regarded shops have been involved in some high-profile gaffes in recent years, some of which have failed on advertising's biggest stage -- the Super Bowl. Who can forget Nationwide's widely mocked "dead boy" ad by Ogilvy that aired in the 2015 game? Groupon made a major gaffe during the 2011 Super Bowl with an ad that tried to get laughs by juxtaposing injustice in Tibet to a deal on fish curry. It was by CP&B and directed by Christopher Guest, who has plenty of hits under his belt. Still, several agency executives said that clients can reduce the chances of failure by bringing in some external perspective. Agencies provide a more thorough check against ideas that might not land well, said Chris Loretto, executive vice president at Denver-based Digital First Media, which operates digital marketing agency Adtaxi. "I think it's always better to have diversified thinking in any context, and specifically when you're looking at a strategic-type campaign that really focuses potentially globally," he said. "Can something go wrong with an external agency? It absolutely still can," he added. But "I think the likelihood is reduced for sure. As you bring in more outside thinking or additional thoughts and folks who aren't as passionately connected to the brand on a day-to day basis, I think you end up usually with better outcomes." Echo chambers and big-footing clients Keeping creative work in-house means a company might miss out on crucial pushback it could receive from an external agency, said one industry executive. "Every organization has its own version of an echo chamber. We have one, everyone has one," this person said. But when you don't have other points of view, "you lose that check and balance, which is so crucial to hitting the right note culturally and hitting the right tone. When I look at what Pepsi did, I actually think it was well-intentioned. They were trying to do something positive, but they hit the wrong note and there was no backstop to put pressure on that note. And I think we're seeing the consequences of that." Related Stories After Kendall Jenner Ad Debacle, What's Next for Pepsi? Pepsi Wants to Be a Movie Mogul Pop Star: PepsiCo Makes Big Bet on In-House Content Creation Intel's Agency Inside Is Ad Age's 2017 In-House Agency of the Year Of course, no matter what an agency recommends, clients have the final say. And one high-ranking agency executive complained that clients are overplaying their hand. "What I have seen change a lot in the last 10 years is clients inserting themselves way too far in the creative process," this person said. "They think they can write and direct and come up with ideas. And while that is true, very few demonstrate the sustained ability to do world class work. And so you get product and brand communication and ideas that are lacking." And when ads are made "with a heavy client hand," the "problem is agencies don't push back and we get less effective work each year. It's a trend and it's not slowing down." Pepsi's ad was created by PepsiCo's in-house content creation arm, Creators League Studio, which is overseen by Brad Jakeman, president of PepsiCo's global beverage group; and Kristin Patrick, senior VP-global brand development. The studio's business model is to bring in writers, art directors, cinematographers and other talent on an as-needed basis. Credits on the Kendall Jenner ad include Pete Kasko as creative director, Michael Bernard as director, and film production by Picture Farm. It is unclear if Pepsi sought outside counsel, or tested the ad with consumer panels before releasing the spot because marketer has declined interviews about the topic. In a statement issued on April 5 when the brand pulled the ad, the brand stated that "Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize." The upsides to in-house In-house shops have plenty of upsides, including cost savings and a potentially tighter link with company needs. And there are numerous examples of great work emerging from internal shops. Consider Intel, which has experienced a marketing rebirth in part to work from its in-house shop, which is called Agency Inside. "We're sitting in the catbird's seat," Steve Fund, Intel's senior VP-chief marketing, told Ad Age earlier this year. "We have visibility to all the things people are doing with our technology—how it works, and how to apply it—that an external agency can never have. Being on the inside lets us stay on top." But one of Agency Inside's strengths is that it works seamlessly with outside agencies such as McGarryBowen and TBWAChiatDay. Coca-Cola Co., which works with the likes of Wieden & Kennedy, Ogilvy and McCann, quietly established an internal agency called KO:OP in 2015. Last month, the agency created its first TV ad, a spot for Mello Yello that tapped into the brand's Nascar roots. One impetus of establishing the group was to bolster Coke's internal know-how around emerging marketing tactics, like using virtual reality, said Brynn Bardacke, Coke's VP for content and creative excellence in North America, who oversees the group. "We are embedding creative thinking into the business by hiring creative people from outside the company to come and work directly for us," she said in an interview last month. Another advantage is "having people in house that can join meetings that we would never otherwise ask an external agency partner to go participate in." Still, she stressed that "this absolutely is not an attempt to replace or compete with [external] agency partners." PepsiCo, too, has continued to use outside agencies. The company has a long-running relationship with Omnicom Group. But the Creator's League Studio has established itself as a significant force inside the company. The shop, for instance, was behind the Pepsi-branded Tony Bennett lead-in to this year's Pepsi-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show starring Lady Gaga. The group has also taken the lead on a project to make a feature film based on a Pepsi ad character: Uncle Drew, who is played by NBA star Kyrie Irving.

Gigabyte's Brix IoT fanless miniature PCs are made specifically for embedded applications. The company says these machines are powered by Intel Apollo Lake SoCs and are ideal for use in kiosks, point-of-sale systems, digital signage, and industrial applications. The entry-level GB-EACE-3450 packs a Celeron N3450 running at a 1.1 GHz base speed and capable of boosting up to 2.2 GHz. The higher-end GB-EAPD-4200 uses a Pentium N4200 that also runs at a 1.1 GHz base clock but can hit a maximum speed of 2.5 GHz. When it comes to embedded and IoT applications, connectivity is often more important than raw power. Both Brix IoT models come with a pair of Realtek-based Gigabit Ethernet ports, as well as 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity courtesy of an Intel chip. Gerbils who looked carefully at the pictures will notice what appears to be a third RJ-45 jack. That third connector is in fact a COM port suitable for communication over serial protocols. The little box also packs four USB 3.0 ports, a microSD slot, and a four-pole audio jack. A pair of HDMI ports enables connection to a pair of monitors for applications like digital signage. The integrated graphics adapter can output up to 3840x2160 resolution at 30 Hz over each HDMI connector. Even the power jack is designed with connectivity and compatibility in mind, as the machine can run on input from 12V to 19V DC through its barrel connector. The machines ship with a 19V 65W brick, which should be more than enough to power them given the 6W TDP of the available SoCs. The inside of the machine continues the lots-of-connectors trend, starting with a pair of SODIMM slots capable of accepting up to 8 GB of DDR3L memory. Buyers can opt for 32 GB or 64 GB of built-in eMMC, or add a 2280 M.2 drive for faster storage. The machine's 2230 M.2 slot is occupied by the Intel wireless card. A half-size mini-PCIe slot and a microSIM card connector are provided for use with a 3G module. Gigabyte touts the Brix IoT's potential for use in what would have been called embedded applications a few years ago. As a connected home hobbyist, I think the machines look almost ideal for use as a silent, low-power routers, MQTT brokers, or as a hubs for managing and securing networks of simpler IoT devices like sensor nodes. The company didn't provide pricing or availability information for these machines, but FanlessTech found the upper-level GB-EAPD-4200 on sale for 19,000 ₽ (about $330) at Russian retailer Rugard.ru.

thus, many believed that Microsoft is busy giving it major updates and wants to keep it a hush-hush affair until it is ready. However, now there are reports that all the secrecy was for nothing, as the Surface Pro 5 may just be an iterative update over its predecessor. PIX1861 / Pixabay Surface Pro 5 is “nothing dramatic” Citing unnamed sources, journalist Paul Thurrott tweeted that like the Pro 4 or the Surface Book, the upcoming Pro 5 will use a proprietary charger. However, the only major upgrade will be Intel’s Kaby Lake CPU. The Surface Pro 4 – similar to the Book – comes with Intel’s last-gen Skylake chips. “Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told,” Thurrott tweeted, adding, “Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic.” In a follow up tweet, he suggested it “sounds like Surface Pro 4.5.” Previously, Microsoft has said that it would ensure that the Surface Pro 3 power adapters, Type Covers and docks will be fully compatible with the Pro 4. Now with Thurrott’s comments, it seems the company aims to continue this backward-compatibility trend moving forward. So if you were expecting big changes like USB Type-C charging (standard among high-end Windows 10 devices), you may be disappointed. But this is just speculation for now, as there is no official word on this. The only possibly good thing that can be gotten from the tweet (apart from Kaby Lake) is that the price of the Surface Pro 4 may drop considerably, provided that the company does not decide to end support for it, notes Wccftech. No hints yet from Microsoft on the release date Fans are eagerly waiting for the device. Initially, it was believed that the company would announce it at a press event held on October 26, 2016. As it turned out, the Surface Pro 5 made no appearance, although the Surface Studio all-in-one PC and a Surface Book refresh were announced. Next, many expected to hear about the next-gen Pro device at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, but again, nothing came up. Thus, both the Surface Book and Surface Pro line are already overdue for an update. They were last updated about 18 months ago. Though both devices are selling well (thanks to deals and discounts), they are also facing greater competition from rival gadgets with new features. Microsoft has already removed the Surface Pro 3 page from its U.S. store, and in the U.K., though the page still exists, it is showing out of stock. This could mean that the company is making way for the Surface Pro 5. Thurrott has not shared any more details on the gadget, so we will have to wait for the Microsoft hardware event, which is expected in the coming weeks. Microsoft is not expected to showcase the Surface Book 2 at the event. Only last week, the company took pre-orders for the Surface Book with Performance Base in some markets, so the company could wait a while before announcing a new one.

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. The Oklahoma spring game doesn’t appear to have too many on-field storylines this weekend, but that is made up for by the fact there are loads of recruiting issues to follow. The Sooners are ready for one of the biggest recruiting weekends of the year. You’re going to have signees, commits and top targets all in Norman, giving off that pro-OU vibe. Weather couldn’t be any better. No severe threats this year. Only hiccup has been ACT weekend as well and several notable top targets for the 2018 and 2019 class (and signee Marquis Hayes) will be taking that test instead of being in Norman. Let’s get to it. Bob Przybylo/Scout It’s an OU thing Hard to describe it. But 12 of the 16 signees not enrolled are expected to be in Norman for one last time before they arrive for good in June. Five of the six 2018 commits will be in town and both of the 2019 commits are making their way back. When you add that to all the targets that will be on campus, and you start to get a feel as to why it’s one of the biggest weekends for the Sooners and why this weekend could net some positive results on the trail. Sometimes all you need is that little push. Well, when you’re with signees and commits that are already feeling everything OU is saying, that could be enough to make one or two (or three) make that leap and join #SavageTeam2K18. Bob Przybylo/Scout Who could commit? This is the one you all want to know, right? Examining the visitors list and examining where some of these prospects are in their recruitments, and it does seem like the stars could align for OU. The No. 1 spot to circle is offensive line. OU already has Moore (Okla.) Southmoore five-star offensive tackle Brey Walker locked down, but offensive line coach Bill Bedenbaugh could add one and maybe even two before the weekend is up. http://www.scout.com/player/200616-bryce-bray?s=73 First name to watch is Bixby (Okla.) High’s Bryce Bray. Coming off outstanding camp performances in the last month, Bray was offered by OU four weeks ago. Bray is no stranger to OU, having camped there last year and has made multiple unofficial visits to campus. Bray confirmed he will be back in Norman this weekend and that he’s looking to make his choice in the spring. That goes back to the first point. If you’re around all those OU feelings AND you know you’re going to decide in the spring anyway, sometimes it works itself out. Bray has skyrocketed up the charts for those who didn’t know who he was before winning the Offensive Line MVP at The Opening regional last month. Now a high three-star prospect, he is the No. 1-ranked interior prospect in the state. http://www.scout.com/player/200652-darrell-simpson?s=73 You could go from the No. 1-ranked interior OKPreps kid to the top offensive tackle in Texas as Justin (Texas) Northwest’s Darrell Simpson is expected to be back in Norman. Simpson has long been one of OU’s top targets, and when you realize the lack of offensive tackle offers made by the Sooners in the last several months, the logic has been OU has Simpson locked up. Ranked No. 78 in the Scout 100, Simpson has changed his tune regarding his commitment. Initially, felt like he would take it well into his senior season, saying he’d release a top 10 in the summer. Now? Sounds like he’s about ready to make the move, saying he wants to announce in the spring. Again, what better time than at the game itself? Bedenbaugh has done a tremendous job of recruiting Simpson for nearly two full calendar years, dating back to June 2015. If Simpson does indeed arrive on campus, good news could follow. http://www.scout.com/player/211024-treveon-johnson?s=73 Moving away from the offensive line, and wide receiver will be the next one to circle. Giddings (Texas) High safety/receiver Treveon Johnson will be in town and this has that feel of if he makes it, he’ll flip. Johnson has been committed to Texas Tech for a while, but his eagerness to be in Norman is usually a strong sign of where things really stand. Listed as a safety by Scout, Johnson is being recruited as a receiver by the Sooners and would be OU’s first pledge at the position for the 2018 class. http://www.scout.com/player/203260-josh-proctor?s=73 Other major in-state names like Owasso safety Josh Proctor, Putnam City defensive end Ron Tatum and Midwest City’s Jalen Redmond will be in attendance as well although prevailing thought there is there none of them are quite ready to make the plunge. That’s six names, six very realistic names to watch. OU could get zero. Could get one, two or more. Either way, the Sooners continue to put in the work on the trail. Bob Przybylo/Scout Rising, Austin back in town Mentioned five of the 2018 commits will be at OU and that means return trips for Newbury Park (Calif.) quarterback Cameron Rising and Lancaster (Texas) High defensive back Jordon Austin. Two commits that appear to be headed into two completely different directions. http://www.scout.com/player/203152-cameron-rising Start with Rising. Since committing to OU back in August, he has been solid. Maybe not 100 percent as solid as OU fans would like, but he’s still been recruiting hard and was a huge reason why OU landed Scout 100 running back T.J. Pledger two weeks ago. Rising has visited Oregon. He’s visited UCLA. But the one that ruffles feathers is the impending visit to Texas next weekend. Rising, who has family in Ada, is supposed to arrive at OU on Friday for a two-day visit. The goal (dream?) would be for Rising to be so enamored with OU/Norman that Rising and his father decided to cancel the trip to Austin and don’t visit the Longhorns. Rising’s initial trip to Norman was last July when there was no buzz at all around campus since school wasn’t in session. This weekend will be a mini-glimpse into seeing what a gameday atmosphere is like in Norman and what football means to Sooner Nation. Rising and his family have developed an incredible bond with offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley, but this weekend will be key to start branching out beyond that. To grow the bond with Bob Stoops. To grow the love affair with OU and Norman. To get to know some of the top commits and top targets in person. There is a legitimate (and reasonable) concern among Rising and his family about Riley leaving for a head coaching spot either before Rising is on campus or after he arrives. No doubt it’s a possibility so OU has to make sure that relationship is so strong and that it goes beyond just a Riley connection. This weekend is that opportunity. http://www.scout.com/player/191770-jordon-austin Then you have Austin. Someone who last summer was ranked in the Scout 300 now is having a hard time cracking the top 50 at the safety position. Despite a couple of junior days and a pro day for older brother, Dakota Austin, this will actually be Jordon’s first trip to Norman since Bedlam. Jordon Austin has been recovering from a torn ACL suffered in October, and there has been wide speculation about where he’ll end up when it’s all said and done. The curious part is Austin never really let defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks know what was up. Austin was so focused on handling this process alone that he shut himself out from OU because he didn’t want the Sooners to see him in his weakened physical and mental state. Pride can be one thing, but it’s a little odd to go a couple of months with no communication. Austin said he’s excited to return to Norman, to reconnect with Cooks and see how things are going with the new facilities and things of that nature. Cooks is a tireless recruiter and you know he’s always cooking something at defensive back. You wonder if Austin still fits into those plans. This weekend could give us a glimpse as to how things are going and if it’s trending in Austin staying with #ST2K18. It’s clear he wants to and has that desire, but the pieces have to fit. Bob Przybylo/Scout Offers? Anybody getting offers? Again, this just sort of an indicator of how recruiting has changed. Once upon a time spring games were about making major offers to kids about to be seniors. Nowadays, an offer to a rising senior at this juncture is pretty much a waste of time. OU has, of course, adapted to recruiting earlier and earlier, but it’s weekends like this where you realize just how much things have changed. It’s hard to look at the visitors list and see the potential offer for anyone in the 2018 class. If there’s going to be any movement, all eyes should be turning toward 2019. Unfortunately, some major in-state names won’t make it because of the ACT. But if offers are going to be made, this is the class to circle in that regard. http://www.scout.com/player/208616-grayson-boomer?s=73 One that could change in a hurry is Collinvsille (Okla.) High tight end Grayson Boomer. He’s continuing to rack up the offers and has been a bit miffed about the lack of OU attention. The Sooners did the same thing with Levi Draper back in the day but were able to correct that situation. Maybe this weekend could be a bridge toward doing the same thing here. http://www.scout.com/player/213595-chance-cover?s=73 Another one to watch would be Chance Cover. The 2019 inside linebacker was at OU’s junior day in February and has definitely caught the attention of Tim Kish. The Sooners are going to evaluate Cover more in the spring so that might be where the offer happens, but it is a good sign for all parties involved that Cover is going to be returning to Norman in such a timely manner. OU is also inviting 2019 Putnam City defensive end Collin Clay. All eyes are on Tatum for 2018, and Clay is right there behind him for 2019.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout OU spring game: Five players to watch Przybylo podcast: What to watch for OU Sooner Intel: OU spring game edition OU unfiltered: Jeffery Mead OU commit coach's corner: T.J.

By Jason Huffman 04/07/17 10:00 AM EDT Updated 04/07/17 04:55 PM EDT With help from Jenny Hopkinson, Megan Cassella and Adam Behsudi MIKE CONAWAY IS A BUSY MAN (UNDERSTATEMENT): House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) now faces the daunting task of handling one of the most important responsibilities in agriculture — crafting a new farm bill — while at the same time leading the politically sensitive House Intelligence Committee probe into Russian meddling in last year’s election. Conaway was presented with the high-stakes juggling act on Thursday when House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) temporarily relinquished control over the probe, an investigation with far-reaching potential that could answer whether the Trump administration colluded with the Russians during the campaign. Nunes stepped aside from the investigation as it was announced that he’s being probed by the House Ethics Committee on allegations of mishandling classified intelligence. Story Continued Below One thing on Conaway’s side: He got House Ag off to a fast start in digging into the farm bill. Conaway set a demanding schedule for the panel’s subcommittees, requiring each to hold two hearings over March and April to determine potential changes to the farm bill when its reauthorization comes due next year. That call put House Ag well ahead of where it needs to be in setting up staff and its subcommittees to hash out the legislation, several sources told MA. So, for now, there appears to be little worry in ag-land about the chairman’s new assignment. The committee said in a statement that Conaway will take the increased workload in stride. And several ag insiders interviewed by MA agreed. “I think he can walk and chew gum,” said Karla Thieman, a consultant with the Russell Group and former Senate Agriculture Committee staffer. “He will be busy, for sure, probably a lot of late nights and early mornings, but he is someone who has made the farm bill such a priority … I don’t think he is going to let that take the back burner,” Thieman added. But things could get tough for Conaway if congressional leaders target the farm bill for huge cuts and the Russia investigation still requires much of his attention next spring, when final details of the reauthorization need to be nailed down. Cuts would mean tough decisions and likely drawn-out negotiations for Agriculture committee leaders — and handling those time-consuming talks while overseeing a top-of-the-news probe that could affect the White House would be quite the feat of Capitol Hill multitasking. The current farm bill expires at the end of September, 2018. Will the Russia investigation still be in motion next spring? Hard to say. But consider this for comparison: The House Select Committee on Benghazi was formed in May 2014 and issued its final report in June 2016. Fun fact: The Benghazi committee was chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who is joining Conaway and Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) in leading the Russia probe. HAPPY FRIDAY, APRIL 7! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host would like to wish W.K.

CALIFORNIA FARMERS LOSE FUEL TAX BATTLE: Democrats in both California’s Senate and Assembly narrowly pushed through a $52 billion transportation package Thursday night that could hit farmers hard in the country’s largest agriculture state. The bill, SB 1, which is expected to be signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, who was a major proponent, would raise the state’s excise tax on gasoline from 24 cents per gallon to 36 cents; increase the state’s excise tax on diesel from 16 cents per gallon to 36 cents; boost the sales tax on diesel from 1.75 percent to 5.75 percent; and automatically increase taxes based on inflation in future years, according to Western Growers. The trade group, which represents produce farmers, was one of two dozen agriculture organizations to lobby against the measure. The legislation, which required two-thirds majority votes in both chambers, was supported mostly along partisan lines, though there was a considerable amount of last-minute drama. After the bill passed in the Senate by a 27-11 margin with one Democrat, Steve Glazer, voting against it, and one Republican, Anthony Cannella, voting for it, it was passed in the Assembly, 54-26, The Mercury News reports. PORK’S ANXIETY GROWS OVER TRADE WITH JAPAN: When the plans were first drawn to begin construction on five new pork processing plants in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri, potentially creating nearly 2,000 new jobs, talks were well underway on the Trans Pacific Partnership. The completion of the 12-country deal seemed likely, promising to reduce tariffs and generate big new trade-related sales in Asia for the industry. But now, as those plants begin to come online, the industry is starting to sweat a potential pork glut. “Nobody built a plant, nobody expanded solely on that, but it was one of those things that was another positive for the industry, assuming that we were going to get [TPP] passed,” Ken Maschhoff, the president of the National Pork Producers Council and a pork producer in Illinois, said Thursday at an event at NPPC headquarters. “We had a president who said he would sign it. We basically were sitting on a Congress that we thought was going to adopt this, and we are where we are now.” Trade was a top priority when NPPC held its fly-in day Wednesday, and U.S. pork producers support a bilateral deal with Japan, the group’s leaders made clear. Japan, which Vice President Mike Pence and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will visit when he heads to Asia in less than two weeks, already represents U.S. pork’s largest buyer ($1.56 billion last year). But the European Union, the U.S. pork industry’s biggest trade nemesis, has been talking about an FTA with Japan since 2013 and held its 17th negotiating round in September, and Japan has suggested it would leave agriculture out of its first economic dialogue with the U.S., hoping that this will give it more leeway in parallel talks with the EU. “That’s a religious issue with us. … Make no mistake, we will lose market share in Japan if we do not quickly initiate bilateral FTA negotiations with them,” said Nick Giordano, NPPC’s vice president of global affairs, who noted how the EU struck an agreement with Vietnam (in late 2015) and is also pursuing a deal with Mexico. “We want more export markets and that is the basis on which we are going to judge this administration and this Congress.” GIORDANO: 'CHINA IS MECCA TO PORK': The U.S. pork industry also covets a trade deal with China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of pork, but didn’t seem hopeful about much progress coming out of President Donald Trump’s visit this week with President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort. “We hope something positive comes out, but I think the expectation all of us share is it’s early, it’s the first meeting,” said Giordano. “I think it’s more likely that, if there is a breakthrough, it’s on something other than pork.” China currently imports just 10 percent of the pork it consumes, but even a one percent pork import increase could be worth nearly a billion dollars to U.S. pork producers, the group notes in a position paper. As it stands, the U.S. pork industry faces a number of barriers to the market, including China’s ban on the use of ractopamine, a feed ingredient employed in a large percentage of pork production, and a prohibition on processed pork imports. “China is Mecca to pork. They need pork. It is the biggest pork consuming nation in the world, and they came here because they realize that,” said Giordano, referring to the 2013 purchase by China’s Shuanghui of Smithfield Foods. “ … Over time, in spite of whatever barriers we have, the simple economics are we have to sell more pork there.” FREEDOM CAUCUS SETS ITS SIGHTS ON BORDER TAX: Fresh off their success derailing a push from the administration and House leadership to overhaul Obamacare, two members of the House Freedom Caucus signaled their dismay on Thursday with another of House Republicans’ prominent policy initiatives: the border adjustment tax, a policy change that some in the agriculture industry favor. Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the caucus vice chairman, said at an event hosted by POLITICO that they were cool to the idea of the proposal, which would tax imports while allowing exports to be sold tax-free. While the House Republicans’ tax plan is largely dependent on the idea, given that the revenue it would produce would be used to offset tax cuts, the precedent it would set could prove dangerous by creating a new source of revenue without eliminating another one, Jordan said. “This is, in my opinion, not a good tax,” he said, “particularly when you’re not getting rid of the corporate tax. You’re just lowering it and adding a whole new revenue ... stream.” He and Amash also pointed to potential economic consequences, like upending many U.S. companies’ cross-border supply chains, as worrisome. “I have serious concerns about it,” Amash said. The caucus as a whole has yet to take an official position on border adjustments, chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told Pro Tax’s Aaron Lorenzo. He added that he is confident, however, that a tax reform agreement can be reached by August, a goal that both House Republican leadership and Trump and established. A TPP DEMOTION: Andrew Quinn, a White House trade adviser who has come under fire from conservatives for his role in negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is being reassigned to the United States Trade Representative's office, three administration officials told POLITICO. As reported by POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia, Alex Isenstadt and Nahal Toosi, the decision comes after Breitbart News and conservatives raised concerns about the White House's decision to elevate Quinn, noting that he was the deputy chief negotiator of the TPP when he worked at USTR during the Obama administration. Trump withdrew from the deal in January. Quinn did not respond to a request for comment, and the White House said it does not comment on personnel matters. CALIFORNIA STILL REQUIRES GENDER-SPECIFIC FIELD TOILETS: Not to be left out of the long-running bathroom gender debate, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health cleared up a question about portable toilets used by field workers. Separate toilets still must be provided for each gender — based on the number of each — as required by California’s agriculture field rules, DOSH clarifies in its frequently asked questions section. The question came up in response to AB 1732, a California law that went into effect on March 1 and requires all businesses with single user toilets to identify them as being available to both genders. Western Growers offers an explanation here. Correction: Yesterday’s MA inaccurately presented the membership of the “Big Six” agrochemical companies. ChemChina is not a member of that bunch.

Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich Copyright Ethan Miller, Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp. boosted Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s compensation package 30% to $19.1 million last year, fueled by a bigger stock award and costs for his personal security arrangements. Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth $11.7 million, a 20% increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement Thursday. The CEO also received $1.25 million in salary, $3.7 million in bonuses, about $2.13 million in security services, plus other smaller items. The decision to bolster the security program came as Krzanich in April last year said some senior executives had faced backlash for the company’s stance and efforts on diversity, according to a TechCrunch report. In 2015, the CEO pledged Intel (IW 500/20) would spend $300 million to make the gender and ethnicity of the company’s workforce representative of the U.S. population by 2020. He also vowed to tie executive pay to that goal. The world’s largest chipmaker, like many other tech companies, has faced criticism for employing few women, blacks and Hispanics. In its diversity report for fiscal 2016, Intel said it achieved pay parity for women and underrepresented minorities and increased its share of female employees to 25.8 percent, a 2.3 percent gain since 2014. Popular Now Top Five Supply Chain Risk Factors Ten Critical Steps to Protecting Intellectual Property in Global Markets The 13 Principles Of Lean Product Development The company spent $1.86 million on personal security for Krzanich and another $275,200 to protect his residence. Executive Vice President Venkata Renduchintala received security services worth $944,800 and Stacy Smith, who oversees manufacturing, operations and sales, got $309,900. The threats were targeted against the CEO and certain other executives, and in some cases their family members, according to the filing, which didn’t provide details on the specific arrangements. By comparison, Intel spent $39,600 for Krzanich’s security in 2015. The company also enhanced the program that year in response to “specific job-related situations,” a filing shows. His full 2015 compensation was $14.6 million. The CEO is trying to remake the company by converting its dominance in PC chips into a presence in markets ranging from cars to mobile phones to drones. That push has yet to provide Intel with enough revenue and profit to shake its dependence on its main source of income. Its finances are increasingly reliant on demand for processors running server computers in giant data centers that support computing over the internet. Krzanich’s annual bonus, which paid out slightly above its $3.5 million target, is tied to absolute and relative financial performance, and operational goals. About 60% of his stock award is linked to total shareholder return and vests if Intel beats the median return among a group of tech companies over three years. The remaining shares vest in increments over three years as long as he remains on the job. His bonus payout can be adjusted based on how Intel achieves goals related to hiring and retaining women and under-represented minorities. Renduchintala, who joined the company in November 2015, received a $20.4 million pay package. By Anders Melin Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

(AMD), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Tesla Inc (TSLA) View All Posts Stock futures are on edge this morning, as Wall Street digests news that U.S. warships bombarded Syrian targets with dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles. The news ramped up tensions for traders, who were already contending with President Donald Trump’s meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping and the scheduled monthly U.S. jobs report. Against this volatile backdrop, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are off 0.15%, S&P 500 futures have fallen 0.14% and Nasdaq-100 futures are lower by 0.07%. On the options front, volume returned to normal on Thursday, with about 12.6 million calls and 11.3 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rebounded to 0.66, while the 10-day moving average held at a one-month low of 0.61. Driving Thursday’s options volume, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) saw heavy activity after Goldman Sachs started AMD stock with a “sell” rating. Elsewhere, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) calls trickled in after announcing it was hiring 30,000 part-time positions. Finally, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw mixed activity after Barclays offered up what it called a “reality check” on TSLA stock. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on AMD stock yesterday with a “sell” rating, joining a rather small bearish crowd in the brokerage community. According to Goldman, traders have gotten ahead of themselves by pricing in all the good news and leaving all the risks to the downside. AMD stock tumbled more than 6% following Goldman’s initiation, pushing the shares below their 50-day moving average. Options traders, meanwhile, turned to AMD calls in a rush. Total volume arrived at a near-term high of 674,000 contracts, with calls accounting for 63% of the day’s take. The bearish note took a toll on AMD sentiment, however, as the April put/call open interest ratio rose to 0.84, indicating that much of yesterday’s call activity may have been the result of rollouts or profit taking on short-term positions. A continuation of this trend after the weak hands have been shaken out could be a bad sign for AMD stock.

It's smaller, far cheaper and, simply put, not as good. But it is really quite a lot cheaper - around £360 at the time of writing - and still has a stylus and more connections than some £1,000 laptops offer these days. The main reason to leave the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA on the shelf is its performance. As it uses an Intel Atom CPU, it starts tripping up as soon as you ask it to do more than one basic thing at a time. Keep that in mind, however, and this dinky machine could be the basic on-the-go device for you. Asus Transformer Mini T102HA review: Design Magnesium-aluminium alloy build 800g including keyboard wide-ranging, if dated connections Asus has borrowed the basics of the Microsoft Surface design DNA for the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA. What this means is that the keyboard sticks to the screen portion using magnets, and that the main part has a kickstand, rather than relying on the base to stand up. Pocket-lint The obvious benefit is that you can treat the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA as a giant picture frame. Probably not one to look through old holiday photos with, but to watch Netflix or BBC iPlayer idly while you do something else. The kickstand almost opens up to 180-degrees, making almost any angle possible. It's not quite as smooth as the Surface Pro 4's, but it's not bad for the price. Asus hasn't skimped too much on construction overall. The tablet part of the Transformer Mini is made using a magnesium-aluminium alloy, with glass on top of the display, and the keyboard does its best to feel like a laptop keyboard rather than a tablet accessory. Magnesium's top-billing feature is that it's very light for its strength. In its laptop config, the Mini weighs 800g, which is even lighter than the new breed of laptops so thin they can't fit in USB ports. The Asus does have a USB, and all the basics you'd ask for in a laptop, albeit in a miniaturised form factor. There's a video out (microHDMI) and a memory card slot (microSD). The battery charges via microUSB too, letting you use your phone cable as long as you have an Android (or Windows phone) that isn't so new it uses USB-C instead. That USB-C is the one obvious missing bit: most new higher-end laptops have one. Pocket-lint There's also a fingerprint scanner on the back, a bit of a modernist consolation prize. However, you tend to need to put a finger over it a couple of times for it to work, making it less useful. The two questions to ask of any hybrid are: is it any good as a laptop and does it work as a tablet? As the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA is slim and its screen comes off entirely, it looks and feels the part. However, even with Windows 10 tablet mode, there are still real shades of “tiny all-in-one PC” to it. Android and iOS models feel far more like pure tablets. Asus Transformer Mini T102HA review: Keyboard and features Removable keyboard with 1.5mm-deep keys Slightly cramped typing feel Pressure-sensing stylus It's also not perfect as a laptop, though, as the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA is pretty small (clue is in the name, we suppose). It has a 10.1-inch screen, where laptops of 12-inches and above give you that feeling of a machine you can work on all day long. The Surface Pro 4 has a 12.4-inch screen, for example. Pocket-lint Using the Asus to type a 1000-word article, hands feel cramped after a while as your wrists are forced into a less than entirely comfortable position. If you're after something to complement your desktop or home laptop while you're travelling or on your hols, it'll do just fine. But we wouldn't want to use it eight hours a day, every day. When you attach the keyboard to the screen, it flicks into place using a series of magnets. The keyboard doesn't sit absolutely flat on whatever surface the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA is put on, but rests at a slight upwards angle to make typing that bit more comfortable. There are a lot of worse keyboard accessories out there, and the key action here is actually a lot deeper than, for example, that of the 12-inch MacBook. However, it's still a bit of a step down from a real laptop as, even without the space issue, the key feel isn't as satisfying. Cut-outs can be an annoyance too. Despite connecting directly with some contacts on the screen, slight movements tend to cause the keyboard to disconnect momentarily. It can get annoying, particularly if you have the sound on as that classic Windows chime plays as it loses and then regains the connection. One cool part of the keyboard is the loop on one side. This hold the stylus, a surprisingly expensive-feeling aluminium pen with a couple of buttons on its barrel. Rather than being a dumb stylus, this is a pressure-sensitive tool with 1,024 levels of pressure. Roll back to a few years ago and this was a top-end spec, although bedroom digital artists might not want to throw away their Wacom tablets just yet. Pocket-lint There's a slight delay to the input that means the input seems to trail behind the pen slightly, and the hard plastic nib doesn't feel all that smooth on the glass top surface. Consider the iPad Pro's Pencil costs £99 on its own, though, and we can't complain that loudly. It's still fun to use if you match it up with a pressure-sensing program like Adobe Photoshop, and a 10.1-inch screen isn't a bad size for sketching, much as it is pretty small for a laptop. Asus Transformer Mini T102HA review: Display 10.1-inch IPS LCD screen Good top brightness Limited WVGA resolution The Asus Transformer Mini T102HA's screen is relatively low-res as well as being small. Its 1280 x 800 pixels looks a bit blocky even when used as a laptop. And as a tablet? Get the screen a bit closer to your face and those pixels become very apparent. Small fonts look a bit Lego-like. Pocket-lint You can get much nicer tablet screens at the price, but look for larger laptops sub-£400 and you'll actually find a lot of worse screens. The Asus Transformer Mini T102HA has a nice 'n' bright IPS LCD panel, where a lot of budget laptops still have TN screens in the lowest price brackets (which are displays that look strange when tilted the wrong way). This display isn't fancy, but it is practical and up to the job, able to cope with use outdoors thanks to a powerful backlight. Display colours are fine too. They're not as deep or rich as the Surface Pro 4's, but aren't weak either. Asus Transformer Mini T102HA review: Performance Low-power Intel Atom CPU Not good for gaming or advanced apps Limited storage So far we've dug up some good and bits of the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA. They even out, for the most part, when you look at the sheer breadth of features against the price. Pocket-lint However, performance is the main reason to be put off by the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA. It has an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 CPU, paired with 4GB RAM. This is close to bottom-rung stuff, much less capable than even a Core i3 system. It's not too bad if you're mostly just going to faff about on Facebook, send some emails and browse the internet. However, the Transformer Mini won't thank you if you try to do these things at the same time, or do anything more advanced. A bit like a netbook of old. Try to create a 50-layer masterpiece in Photoshop using the stylus and the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA will probably start screeching. We tried some editing of images and it wasn't at all fun. All apps take longer to load than normal and there are some stutters with basic navigation too, and it's no use for gaming beyond the real basics. This is where the Transformer really isn't a direct replacement for a Surface Pro 4 or a meat and potatoes laptop. Just like the keyboard, the performance means we wouldn't recommend this as a laptop to use as your main computer. It also has very limited storage. There's 64GB of solid state storage, but when Windows 10 eats around half of this, you'll be left juggling files before too long. Asus Transformer Mini T102HA review: Sound and battery life Excellent battery life Decent stereo speakers MicroUSB charging Maybe that's not such a big deal if you've already bought into media streaming and aren't intending to download too many data-heavy apps. It's not as if the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA can play demanding games, after all. Pocket-lint The Asus Transformer Mini T102HA has enough stamina for long-haul travel too. We may not like the Atom CPU, but it goes seriously easy on the juice. This hybrid lasts for around 12 hours of normal use, which is mammoth, and even better than Asus's own claim of 11 hours. It does use USB charging, though, which is slower than a good laptop charger. One other nice extra is that the speakers aren't too bad given they live in the 14mm tablet part. There are two drivers, one firing out of each side. Verdict The Asus Transformer Mini T102HA has a wide breadth of features, including a pressure-sensitive stylus, fingerprint scanner, hybrid design and fairly versatile connectivity. However, it doesn't ace the basics. Performance is pretty poor, which is perhaps stretching what's acceptable for the price. That said, it is pretty cheap. An iPad with a keyboard or Android hybrid will feel much less compromised - but you'll have to pay more. Perhaps the biggest reason to buy this Transformer Mini is that its battery life is great. It'll last for a strong 12-hours when doing basic tasks, so if you're looking for a machine to do some casual tasks then don't write it off entirely. Just make sure you've considered the serious power limitations before buying. The alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint Microsoft Surface Pro 4 It's an awful lot more expensive than the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA without seeming to have that many more features on the surface. However, you could use this a Surface Pro 4 as your only computer with no issue, where the Transformer Mini isn't really up to the task unless your demands are minimal and you have some patience. Read the full article: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review Pocket-lint iPad Pro If you like the idea of the Transformer Mini's stylus but want a real pro feel, the iPad Pro is what you need. The 9.7-inch version costs £200 more when you consider the added cost of the Pencil stylus, though. And that doesn't include a keyboard either. As ever, Apple gear isn't cheap. Read the full article: iPad Pro review HP Pavilion x360 Sure, this is much more laptop-like than the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA, using a 360-degree hinge and much larger screen. However, if you're turned off by poor performance, the x360 solves this by using proper Intel Core-series processors. We'd much rather use this for all-day working.

Board: Intel S2600CP4 w/ 32GB RAM System: 2x 120GB SSD in LSI SW RAID 1 (BitLocker encrypted) Storage: 4x 4TB WD Red HDD in LSI SW RAID 10 (BitLocker encrypted) Graphics: ATI FirePro 2460 w/ Quad Displays As my requirements at the time shifted towards more a resilient & secure file storage and VM host I decided to give FreeNAS a go; which coincidentally had just released a major upgrade with FreeNAS Corral featuring native VM host support through Bhyve and of course their highly resilient ZFS filesystem supporting AES-NI accelerated full disk encryption.   System: 2x 16GB USB (Software Mirrored) Storage: 1x zpool of 2x vdevs of 2x 4TB HDD (mirrored)* *As "You should use mirror vdevs, not RAIDZ"   Install and setup was pretty painless (provided you RTFM) and had a pfSense VM up and running with a click of a button. Downside was that I lost my workstation which meant I'd have to invest in some more hardware to recover my desktop functionality and make use of my quad displays (new PC, thin client or laptop dock). After evaluating for over a week I also found a bit of functionality lacking in the GUI requiring a bit of messing around to do some basic things, which I'm sure will get added as time goes by.   I decided to re-purpose back to a Windows-based workstation and try out Windows Server 2016 Standard with ReFS based storage which features similar benefits to ZFS.   Ironically however my ATI FirePro 2460 seemed to die after a couple of reboots (the software utility would also just freeze when opened which looks suspiciously like a software induced hardware meltdown) so I'm waiting on an AMD FirePro W4100 to arrive while getting by on a single monitor!!   Setup is similar to before:   System: 2x 120GB SSD in RSTe SW RAID 1 (BitLocker encrypted) Storage: 4x 4TB WD Red HDD with RSTe pass through. The S2600CP4 BIOS gives the option of using Intel RSTe or LSI based SW RAID. I decided to go with RSTe this time for the system drive mirror as I wasn't too impressed with the Windows pseudo wed-based LSI MegaRAID management utility however RSTe utility isn't much better, occasionally crashes and appears to have less features so not sure if that was a good decision yet?   The 4x storage drives pass through to be managed by the OS.   "Storage Pools" ("Storage Spaces" on Windows 10) are quite cool in theory as they let you setup various "RAID-equivalent" storage schemes in the form of virtual disks across a series of physical disks.   e.g. Across my 4x drives I can setup multiple virtual disks that either:   reside on 1x physical drive for economy. mirror or stripe across 2+ physical drives for redundancy. span across 2+ physical drives for extra capacity. You also have options for thin/thick provisioning, hot spares and SSD cache.   Some things I learned I didn't come across in the documentation:   ReFS wont format onto default thin-provisioned Basic virtual disks (they need to be converted to Dynamic). (BitLocker will not encrypt Dynamic volumes, only Basic). Thick-provisioned Basic virtual disks can be ReFS formatted and thus encrypted. NTFS can be formatted to thin-or-think-provisioned Basic virtual disks OK and encrypted. I setup a 1TB mirrored BitLocker encrypted ReFS virtual disk and copied about 0.9TB of data across to it from a non-encrypted SATA drive; I noticed there appeared to be significant overheads when writing files probably due to ReFS calculating hash values as write speed for large files (200MB+) climbs to ~100-130MB/s, medium size (5-10MB) drops to ~10-30MB/s while small files (<100KB) can be well under 1MB/s.   I think a lot of the advise around using mirrored vdevs on FreeNAS as opposed to RAID-Zx applies just as well here. As "cool" as Storage Pools/Spaces are there are advantages to simple mirrored volumes; the foremost being ease of dealing with simple volumes for data recovery without having to rebuild an entire array.   Multi-disk redundancy and RAID5-type storage efficiency sounds goods in theory until you calculate how long it'll take to actually rebuild that array, and the risk of subsequent disk failure during that time. Hot spares or even 3-way mirrors can provide additional safety for critical data - as well as of course regular backups - as storage is now relatively cheap vs rebuild time.   As I don't really have a requirement for large non-contiguous volumes (greater than the size of my drives) I think I'll go back to basics and use my on-board SW RAID to manage my storage drives as multiple mirrored pairs; along with a couple of misc disks as temp / non-redundant storage, still taking advantage of ReFS for my archive storage.   Question is whether it's worth investing in a proper RAID card for it (especially VMs)...

The reason I'm looking at that model is it's specifically listed as compatible with that server board and found one for a possibly-too-good-to-be-true price (< half price of the battery add-on). Description below however lists "MegaRAID SWStack" so I'm a bit unsure if it's real "hardware" RAID or just a Fake raid add-on card.

The last time the company made changes to the all-in-one computer was back in 2016 when it released the Retina display iMac. Now, consumers are expecting the iMac 2017 to come later this year as Apple already made the announcement for it. In line with this, some new information about the iMac 2017 surfaced online ahead of the supposed release this year. According to the blog Pike’s Universum, the iMac 2017 will have a brand new set of specs on its release, on top of which is the Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 CPU paired with 16GB of ECC memory. It is interesting to note that this type of processor is not out yet. It is not even listed in the Intel Ark website. Furthermore, this will be the first time that the iMac will support ECC memory. There are no details that the iMac 2017 will still have non-ECC RAM support. The blog also mentioned that the iMac 2017 will have a maximum memory capacity of 64GB. Another thing mentioned in the blog is the upcoming iMac’s support for NVMe storage that can go as much as 2TB. Also, there will be support for Thunderbolt 3 as well as second generation USB 3.1. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) On the graphics side of things, the blog said that the iMac 2017 will also be able to support virtual reality or VR. If this is the case, the AMD graphics card would be something like the AMD Radeon R9 290X or quite possibly the AMD Radeon R9 390X. It will be quite a push for Apple to use the latest AMD Radeon RX480 due to power constraints. Lastly, it seems that the iMac 2017 will also sport a new keyboard, according to the blog. While it did not clearly specify what the keyboard would be, one can speculate that it might have support for Touch Bar and Touch ID features. This is due to the fact that Apple was just granted a patent for the technology. Readers are urged to take these bits and pieces about the iMac 2017 with a grain of salt. These, as they say, are nothing but rumors. Nevertheless, since Apple has already confirmed the arrival of the new iMac, consumers can expect them to arrive later this year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM The long road to autonomous vehicles by mike freeman The reason roads aren't filled with autonomous cars yet is because self-driving technology remains closer to the research lab stage and is not ready for prime time yet, say experts. — Uber/TNS SAN DIEGO: Back in 1995, the NavLab 5 team at Carnegie Mellon University launched an autonomous vehicle on a trip from Pittsburgh to San Diego.  The vehicle navigated itself, without intervention from a human driver, for 98% of the 2,800 mile journey. It averaged speeds above 60 mph.  So if self-driving technology worked on a cross-country trip 22 years ago, why aren't roads filled with autonomous cars today?  The reason is the technology remains closer to the research lab stage and is not ready for prime time, say experts. It's not good enough or affordable enough yet for widespread use.  Sensors must shrink, improve their range, particularly in bad weather, and become less expensive. Mobile networks must eliminate transmission delays so vehicles can communicate instantly – not only with nearby cars but also with the internet cloud to process data.  Costs for very precise, real-time, three-dimensional map technology to guide self-driving cars must come down. Artificial intelligence software must be nimble to handle the unexpected – ranging from predicting behaviour of nearby drivers to figuring out when an object in the road is a harmless plastic bag or an undercarriage-crushing rock.  And perhaps most importantly, the driving public needs to come to grips with what it wants from autonomous vehicles, which hold the promise of reducing accidents and fatalities but may not be perfect.  In May 2016, a man died when his Telsa crashed into a big rig while operating in the car maker's self-driving software mode known as Autopilot. US regulators determined that Telsa's software functioned properly in the Florida accident but Autopilot requires full-driver attention at all times.  In March, Uber briefly suspended autonomous car testing after a crash in Arizona, which officials said wasn't the fault of the self-driving vehicle. It occurred when a nearby motorist failed to yield.  "We really expect our autonomous cars to do much better than us, otherwise we are not going to use them," said Gabriel Rebeiz, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of California at San Diego. "That is a very high bar."  These hurdles don't mean that the march toward self-driving cars has stalled. If anything, it's gaining momentum.  Nearly all automakers are working on autonomous vehicles programs. Google and Uber are testing robotic car technologies on the road. Big technology companies including Qualcomm and Intel have targeted automotive technology as a major growth market. It is part of the rationale behind Qualcomm's pending US$38bil (RM168.41bil) acquisition of automotive chip outfit NXP Semiconductors and Intel's recent US$15bil (RM66.54bil) buyout of automotive sensor and software outfit Mobileye.  Work on autonomous vehicles has been going on since the early 1980s, said Takeo Kanade, a computer vision professor and winner of the 2016 Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology, during a recent event in San Diego. The cross-country trip between Pittsburgh and San Diego was a milestone achievement for Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and the advancement of self-driving vehicles.  One advantage to automation is the potential to reduce accidents and save lives. Vehicle crashes kill more than one million people globally each year and injure millions more. Cutting the number of wrecks would bring down medical and insurance costs.  "What happens when a child chases a ball onto the road? As a human you can slam on the brakes and stop car. But machines will react much faster than humans," said Chris Mi, chair of electrical and computer engineering department at San Diego State University.  Coupled with connected smart infrastructure, autonomous vehicles also could traverse highways and streets more efficiently, limiting traffic jams and reducing carbon emissions.  And self-driving cars free up time for motorists to do other things on their way to the office, boosting productivity.  To get there, data from on-board cameras, radar and lidar sensors is being fused together to create a picture of what's around the car. Lidar, which can cost US$60,000 (RM266,190) or more, works like radar but uses light instead of radio waves.  At International CES in January, Ford demonstrated a pickle-jar sized laser lidar, mounted near the side-view mirror on a prototype self-driving sedan. (Not long ago, lidar systems were the size of a suitcase.) It pinpointed people and objects around the car – creating a very detailed dynamic view of its surroundings.  But it also required a trunk full of powerful computer servers to process the data – which probably isn't practical for real life self-driving vehicles.  High-speed 5G mobile networks could be critical for autonomous vehicles – providing a way to off-load the hefty computer processing demands to the internet cloud.  5G also is expected to reduce transmission delays – known as latency – in wireless networks, paving the way for connected cars to make split second decisions required on the road. 5G networks could roll out as early as 2019.  There are other roadblocks facing autonomous vehicles, such as legal questions of who is responsible if a self-driving car causes an accident. Cybersecurity experts worry about connected cars being hacked and wrecking havoc.  But advocates of autonomous technology believe these barriers eventually will be pushed aside. With today's self-driving prototypes, a driver is obligated to be ready to take control at any moment. But in about a decade, autonomous cars where a human driver's attention is not required could begin showing up on the road.  The arrival of these autonomous cars might be different than we expect, said consultant Sven Beiker, a former BMW technologist and ex-director of the Centre for Automotive Research at Stanford.  "There is lot of work on these automated robo-taxis, where it operates within 20 city blocks – maybe to the airport – but you can't take it to the next city," said Beiker. "So it might not be the Toyota or Chevrolet or Volkswagen that I buy, push a button and it drives me home automatically. Maybe it's I wait for my Uber, and when it arrives there is no driver."  In the meantime, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems will incrementally boost automation and safety in cars. Already, lane monitoring technology in some vehicles will automatically correct drifting. Several automakers offer automatic braking in new models. Adaptive Cruise Control will automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. At CES, BMW demonstrated a sedan that parked itself.  "It is going to take time," said Rebeiz, the UCSD professor. "But we have the electronics. We have the know-how. It's just going to take time before we integrate it all together." — The San Diego Union-Tribune/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Foreign residents to pay higher fees Upside seen in property market Chong Wei-Lin Dan final on the cards Hang up if 'banks' call for personal data, says ABM Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read MDDB sponsorship drive this Saturday Stalled pool upgrade upsets Pandamaran folk Bargains aplenty at Perfect Livin ’17 expo advertisement Latest News Car owners tap into sharing economy to help offset costs Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Restaurants fatten up with food delivery apps Anthony Bourdain launches new digital travel guide for fans EU to end mobile roaming charges in June Most Viewed in Tech Restaurants fatten up with food delivery apps Car owners tap into sharing economy to help offset costs Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Anthony Bourdain launches new digital travel guide for fans EU to end mobile roaming charges in June Intel CEO pay rises to US$19.1mil as security costs climb Amazon takes voice battle with Apple TV outside US Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news Canon launches three new entry level cameras – EOS 800D, EOS77D and EOSM6 Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Guest Everything your startup needs to know about marketing communications Steve Blank@sgblank April 6, 2017 4:32 PM Tags: Steve Blank Image Credit: Steve Blank I was having coffee with the CEO of a new startup, listening to her puzzle through how to communicate to potential customers. She was an academic on leave from Stanford now selling SaaS software to large companies but was being inundated with marketing communications advice. “My engineers say our website is old school and we need to be on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, my VP of Sales says we’re wasting our marketing dollars not targeting the right people, and my board keeps giving me their opinions of how we should describe our product and company. How do I sort out what to do?” She winced as I reminded her that she had gone through the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps. “Painful and invaluable” was her reply. I reminded her that all the Lean tools she learned in class – customer discovery, business model, and value proposition canvases – contained her answer. Here’s how. Define the mission of marketing communications Companies often confuse communications tactics (“What should my webpage look like” or “Should I be using Facebook/Instagram/Twitter?”) with a strategy. A communications strategy answers the question “Why are we doing these activities?” For example, our goal could be: Create demand for our products and drive it into our sales channel Create awareness of our company and brand for potential customers Create awareness for fundraising (VC, angels, corporate partners) Create awareness for potential acquirers of our company (Marketing communications is a subset of the marketing department’s mission. Read my post about mission and intent here.) Audience, message, media, messenger Once you figure out why you’re creating a communications strategy, you can figure out how to use it. The “how” requires just four steps: Understand your audience(s) Craft the message for that specific audience Select the media you want the message to be read/seen/heard on Select the messenger you want to carry your message Step 1: Who’s the audience? The audience is who specifically you want your messages to reach. Is it all the people on earth? Everyone in San Francisco? Potential customers, such as gamers who like to play specific types of games? Or people inside companies with a specific title, like product or program managers, CIOs, etc? Venture capitalists who may want to invest? Other companies that may want to acquire you? What’s confusing is that often there are multiple audiences you want to communicate with. So refer to your strategy: Are you trying to reach potential customers or potential investors and acquirers? These are very different audiences, and each requires its own messages, media, and messengers. If you’re selling a product to a company, for example, is the audience the user of the product? Her boss? The person who has the budget? The CEO? How do you figure out who the audience is? It turns out that if you’ve been doing customer discovery and using the value proposition canvas, you know a lot about each customer/ beneficiary. The first step is to put all those value proposition canvases on the wall to remind you that these are the people you need to reach. How do you figure out which of these customers/beneficiaries is most important? Who’s the least important? If you’ve been out talking to customers, you will have an idea of who’s involved in the buying process. Who’s the user of the product? The recommender? The decision maker? The saboteur? As you map out what you learned about the role each of these customers plays in the buying process, marketing communications and sales can decide which one of the customers/beneficiaries is the primary audience of your messages. (And they can decide if there are any secondary audiences you should reach.) Often there are multiple people in a sales process worth influencing. If you’re trying to reach potential acquirers or investors, the customer discovery process is the same. Spend time building value proposition canvases for these audiences. Step 2: What’s the message? Messages are what you deliver to the audience(s) you’ve selected. Messages answer three questions: Why should the audience care? What are you offering? What’s the call to action? Your customers have already told you how to craft the first part of your message. The answer to “Why should your audience care?” comes directly from the pains and gains on the right side of the value proposition canvas. And the answer to the second question “What are you offering?” comes from the left side of the value proposition canvas. It’s not just the product feature list, but the pain relievers and gain creators. Once you get your audience to read your message, then what? What’s the call to action? Do you want them to download a demo, schedule a sales call, visit a physical store location or a website, download an app, click for more information, give you their email address, or something else? Your message needs to include a specific call to action. Other things to keep in mind about messages: Message context. A message that is brilliant today and gets the press writing about you and customers begging to buy your product could have been met with blank stares two years ago and may be obsolete next year. In crafting your messages, remember that all messages operate in a context that may have an expiration date. Netbooks, 3DTVs, online classes disrupting higher ed, all had their moment in time. Make sure your context is current, and revisit your messages periodically to see if they still work. Sticky messages. Messages also need to be memorable – “sticky.” Why? Because the more memorable the message, the greater its ability to create change. Not only do we want people to change their buying behavior, we also want them to change how they think. (This is often a tough concept for engineering founders. We tend to believe that if we just tell customers about the features that make their business faster, cheaper, etc., they’ll buy in.) If you were told you were going to pay for cold, dead fish wrapped in seaweed, you might not be too hungry. But when we call it sushi, people line up. And if McDonald’s message was “dead cow, slaughtered by the millions, butchered by minimum wage earners, then ground into patties, frozen into solid blocks, and reheated when you order them,” instead of “You deserve a break today,” sales might be a tad lower. Product versus company messages. There is a difference between detailed product messages and messages about your company. At times, you may have to communicate what the company stands for before a customer is ready to listen to you talk about product messages. For example, to outflank a competitor who had faster products, Intel moved the conversation about microprocessors away from speed and technology to create a valued brand. They created the “Intel Inside” campaign. Apple was trying to resurrect a then-dying company by reminding people what Apple stood for with its “Think Different” ad campaign. Both Apple and Intel were selling complicated technology but did so by simplifying the message so it had broad emotional appeal. Both Intel Inside and Think Different became sticky corporate messages. Step 3: Media Media refers to the type of communications media each audience member reads/listens to/watches. It could be print (newspapers/magazines), Internet (website, podcasts, etc.), broadcast (TV, radio, etc.), or social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). In customer discovery, you asked prospects how they get information about new companies and new products (if not, get back out and do so!). The media your prospective customers told you they use ought to be on top of your target media. The online media your company controls (your corporate website, company Facebook page, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) should be the first place you experiment finding your audience(s) and message. Typically, you pick several media to reach each audience. It’s likely that each audience reads different media (potential customers read something very different than potential investors.) You’ll need a media strategy – a plan that describes the mix of media and how you will use it. This plan should start with the right category of media (print, Internet, broadcast) and then identify specific sites, blogs, magazine, etc. Step 4: Messengers Messengers are the well-placed and highly leveraged individuals who have influence over your audience(s). Messengers convey and amplify your message to your audience through the media you’ve chosen. There are four types of messengers: reporters, experts, evangelists, and connectors. (Each audience will have its own unique set of messengers.) Reporters are paid by specific media to write about news. Which reporters you should talk to comes from discovering which media your audience has said it reads. Your goal is to identify who the reporters are in the media your audience reads and what they write about, and to figure out why they should write about you. (Wrong answer: because we have a new product. Very wrong answer: because my CEO wants to be on the cover of publication X or Y.) Experts know your industry or product in detail, and others rely on them for their opinions. Experts may be industry analysts in private research firms (Gartner, NPD, AMR), Wall Street research analysts (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs), consultants who provide advice for your industry, or bloggers with wide followings. Experts may even be potential customers who run user groups that other potential customers turn to for advice. (Today some reporters are experts – product reviewers in the Tech Section of the Wall Street Journal, or the Technology section of the New York Times or its product review site, Wirecutter). Evangelists are unabashed cheerleaders and salespeople for your product and, if you are creating a new market, for your company vision. They tell everyone how great the product is and about the unlimited potential of your product and market. While nominally carrying less credibility than experts, evangelists have two advantages: Typically, they are paying customers, and they are incredibly enthusiastic about what they say. (Evangelists are not customers who will give a reference. A customer reference is something you have to twist arms to get; an evangelist is someone you can’t get off the phone.) Connectors are individuals who seem to know everyone. Each industry has a few. They may be bloggers who expound on the general state of your industry and write magazine or newspaper columns. They may be individuals who organize and hold conferences where the key industry thought leaders gather. Often, they themselves are the thought leaders. Founders ask me all the time whether they should hire a PR agency. I tell them, “The question isn’t if.  The question is when.” Influencing the messengers is what great public relations firms know how to do. They may have their own language describing who the messengers are (e.g., “influencers”) and how they manage them (e.g. “information chain”), but once you’ve done a first pass of the audience > message > media > messenger, a competent PR firm can add tremendous value. Customer discovery never stops Understanding your audience is important not just for startups but for companies already selling products. It helps you stay current with customers, get ideas for other needs to fill, and create new products. In addition, the audience > message > media > messenger cycle seamlessly moves this learning into getting, keeping, and growing customers. Today, marketing automation tools (customer analytics, SEO, and customer relationship management platforms) generate customer behavior history about what messages worked on which media. These tools generate data that companies use to feed AdTech tools (demand-side platforms, ad exchanges, and networks) to automate selling and buying of online ads. Communications as a force multiplier Smart CEOs treat communications as a force multiplier for sales, a tool to dramatically increase valuation, and the vehicle to get acquirers lined up at the door. Not-so-successful CEOs treat it as a tactic that can be handed to others. Hiring a PR agency too early is a sign that the CEO is treating this as someone else’s problem. In a startup, the first pass of understanding audience, message, media, and messenger can only be done with the founders/CEO engaged. Getting publicity for a product that does not yet exist is how startups get noticed. But don’t fall victim to your own reality distortion field and hype a product that can never be made (think of Tesla versus Theranos.) Figuring out who the possible audiences are, what messages to send, and what media to use feels overwhelming at first. The temptation is to try to reach all audiences with a single message and a single medium. That’s a going-out-of-business strategy. Use customer discovery, and your customers will teach you who they are, what to say to them, and how to reach them. Lessons learned Marketing communications = Audience, Message, Media, Messenger Use the Value Proposition Canvas to understand who your audiences are Craft messages to match what your audience has already told you Pick the media they said they read Find the right messengers to amplify your message [This story was originally published on Steve Blank’s own blog.] Steve Blank is a retired serial entrepreneur-turned-educator who created the Customer Development methodology that launched the lean startup movement, which he wrote about in his book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany.

That’s because it’s technically a mobile server. The Eurocom PX7 Pro SE is powered by Intel’s quad-core (eight threads) Xeon E3-1505M v5 processor clocked at 2.8GHz on a CM236 server chipset alongside up to 64GB of ECC DDR4-2133 RAM and up to an Nvidia Quadro M5500 graphics card (8GB of GDDR5 VRAM). It packs a 17.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080 resolution) IPS matte display, support for four M.2 solid state drives (two of which are PCIe) and a standard 2.5-inch drive (RAID 0/1/5 is supported). The optical drive can also be removed and replaced with another 2.5-inch drive, we’re told. Other noteworthy features include a Killer E2400 Gigabit Ethernet controller, a built-in 9-cell / 7500mAh / 83.25Wh UPS that provides 1.5 hours of backup power, six USB 3.0 ports, DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 1.4 and more. You can load up Microsoft’s Server 2012R2, Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 as well as Linux / Ubuntu. The PX7 Pro SE measures 17.1 inches x 11.8 inches x 1.9 inches and tips the scales at 8.4 pounds. Eurocom hasn’t yet said how much the PX7 Pro SE will sell for or when it’ll be available.

Windows watcher Paul Thurrott has revealed the first credible details about Microsoft's Surface Pro 5. TechCrunch reports: The Surface Pro 5 will have the same power connector currently used on the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, which is a long, thin magnetic jack. The upcoming device will also use Intel's Kaby Lake processors, and it makes perfect sense that the company would want to jump to the latest and greatest chips in its new generation hardware. Other details, including price, the use of USB-C, and basically anything regarding size and hardware design aren't yet known, though Thurrott reports the changes to the Pro 5 won't be a "dramatic" departure from the existing generation. windows microsoft hardware ← You may like to read: → WikiLeaks Reveals Grasshopper, the CIA's Windows Hacking Tool Former McDonald's USA CEO: $35K Robots Cheaper Than Hiring at $15 Per Hour Using a Bomb Robot to Kill a Suspect Is an Unprecedented Shift in Policing Slashdot Asks: Do We Need To Plan For a Future Without Jobs And Should We Resort To Universal Basic Income?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 7, 2017 at 7:20PM Paying generous dividends is a classic way for companies to attract stable investors. But just because a company can afford to pay big dividends doesn't mean that it ever will. Let's take a look at three companies that have low payout ratios but still pay paltry dividends that are lower than the S&P 500's yield of 2%. Disney Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of of my favorite big-brand stocks. Its movie pipeline dominates theaters with Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and its own branded films. Its theme park network is expanding with a new resort in China, new lands for its American parks, and a growing fleet of cruise ships. The TV business, which has been a soft spot in recent quarters, is gradually evolving with new streaming partnerships and investments. Image source: Pixabay. Analysts expect the House of Mouse to respectively grow its sales and earnings by 2% and 4% this year -- not huge growth numbers but solid ones for a mature media company. Yet Disney's dividend has always disappointed me. Its forward yield of 1.4% is well below the market average, although it's hiked that dividend annually for seven straight years. Over the past 12 months, Disney spent just 27% of its earnings and 30% of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends -- indicating that it could easily double its dividend to attract more income investors. NVIDIA Chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared 220% in 2016 on surging demand for its gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and automotive CPUs. The strength of those three businesses respectively boosted NVIDIA's revenue and GAAP earnings by 38% and 138% in fiscal 2017. However, that growth is expected to cool off this year with 16% sales growth and 10% earnings growth. Major headwinds include the expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal with Intel, which contributed $66 million in "free" revenue every quarter, renewed competition from AMD in gaming GPUs, and the consolidation of the automotive chip market. NVIDIA's GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Image source: NVIDIA. That's why NVIDIA shares have dropped 6% since the beginning of the year. Income investors are also likely shunning the stock's tiny forward dividend yield of 0.5%. NVIDIA hiked its dividend annually for four straight years, but it spent just 19% of its earnings and 17% of its FCF on those payments over the past 12 months. Oracle Like many other aging tech companies, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has been investing in higher-growth cloud businesses to offset slower growth at its aging database and hardware units. That turnaround effort has been sluggish -- its total cloud revenue rose 62% annually and accounted for 13% of its top line last quarter, but analysts still expect its revenue and earnings to both rise just 1% this year. Oracle's forward yield of 1.4% is much lower than the yield of comparable mature tech companies with comparable growth rates -- IBM has a yield of 3.2%, and Cisco has a yield of 3.4%. Oracle only spent 28% of its earnings and 21% of its FCF on dividends over the past 12 months, which looks downright stingy next to IBM's earnings-based payout ratio of 44% and Cisco's ratio of 54%. Are these companies just being stingy? It's easy to claim that Disney, NVIDIA, and Oracle are shortchanging income investors, but there are two other big factors at play. First, companies that want to grow through investments and acquisitions don't like dedicating too much of their cash to dividends. This is especially true for Disney, which spent over $15 billion to buy Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Second, all three companies spent more of their FCF on buybacks than dividends over the past 12 months. Eighty-seven percent of Disney's FCF, 49% of NVIDIA's FCF, and 29% of Oracle's FCF were all spent on buybacks during that period. Those were all fairly smart moves, since all three stocks have risen over the past year. The key takeaways I doubt Disney, NVIDIA, and Oracle will pay demonstrably higher dividends anytime soon. Therefore, investors looking for stable income should look elsewhere. But that doesn't mean they're bad stocks -- Disney's still a great core holding for long-term investors, NVIDIA is a solid growth play, and Oracle's cloud investments could get the company's growth back on track over the next few years.   Leo Sun owns shares of Cisco Systems and Walt Disney.

Thematic ETFs Hold More Stocks Like Them (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has undertaken a radical revamp of its Mac Pro. Will that mean anything for the company, which has now realigned its interest around the iPhone? What's New? Apple said it is working on a completely revamped Mac Pro, with a modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and big, honking hot-running GPUs. The company is also working on an Apple-branded pro displays to go with the new Mac Pro. The Mac Pro line is a series of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Xenon-based workstation and server computers manufactured by Apple. The redesigned computer line won't come until after the year is out, according to Apple. Meanwhile, Apple released meager speed-bump updates to the existing Mac Pros. The modifications include: The $2,999 model goes from 4 Xeon CPU cores to 6, and from dual AMD G300 GPUs to dual G500 GPUs. The $3,999 model goes from 6 CPU cores to 8, and from dual D500 GPUs to dual D800 GPUs. There hasn't been any other change, including the ports. No USB-C and no Thunderbolt 3. New iMac For Professional Users Is On The Way Apple also indicated that it will introduce a new version of the iMac later in 2017, with the product targeting professional users. The new Mac will not have a touch screen, according to a BuzzFeed article quoting Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing. Mac's Importance Fading Away Mac, which accounted for a lofty 86 percent of total Apple revenues in 2000, gradually ceded importance to the iPod after that's device's 2002 launch. Mac's share of revenues fell below 80 percent in 2002. Mac's dwindling importance to Apple was captured in an infographic presented by Statista. The revenue contribution from the Mac steadied in 2006 amid the launch of the Intel-based iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro, with the computer's contribution to Apple revenue exceeding 40 percent. The launch of the iPhone in 2007 exerted renewed pressure on Apple's Mac: The Mac's revenue share dwindled from more than 40 percent in 2007 to an anemic 11 percent in 2016. Source: Statista In the first quarter, the share of Mac revenues slipped further to 9 percent. The product refresh and revamp could, therefore, be an attempt to lift the sagging fortunes of the Mac. That said, with Apple's focus increasingly shifting to lean-and-mean devices, it remains to be seen if the incremental resources Apple is committing to the Mac will change the computer line's significance to the bottom line in Cupertino.

Our round-up is heavy on tech this month – because that's where the money is right now. The Nasdaq is up 9.22% in 2017. That's more than double the 4.57% return of the Dow Jones in the same time period. It's logged 21 record closes this year and hit another intraday high on April 5. FANG stocks like Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL) may grab a lot of attention. After all, they've played a big role in the Nasdaq's outperformance this year. But the picks on our list of the best stocks to buy now offer a chance to get in before the crowd – and for a lot less money. Our top stocks to buy include the best profit play in the autonomous vehicles space… a way to cash in on cloud computing, social media, and video streaming all at once… a small-cap digital advertiser taking on the bigger players… and more. For tech profit opportunities you won't find anywhere else, read on. We add to our stocks to buy list often, so drop by Money Morning again soon. Best Stocks to Buy Now No. 1: Grab a 30% Gain as Silicon Valley Takes Over Detroit We're getting closer to fully autonomous vehicles, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are the building blocks that will get us there. Features designed to reduce driver error like lane-departure warning systems, drowsiness alerts, and automatic emergency braking are being offered in more new vehicles. And there's a lot of money at stake here: The driverless vehicle market could reach $42 billion by 2025. Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael Robinson has been writing about the "connected car" trend for years. He's helped investors make a bundle along the way, too. In April 2015, he told readers to grab shares of Mobileye NV (Nasdaq: MBLY), a maker of sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles. On March 13, 2017, Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) ponied up $15.3 billion to buy the Israeli company. Investors who acted on Robinson's call are now sitting on 45% gains. That wasn't his only winner in this space, either. His December 2015 pick, Harman International Industries Inc., was a pioneer in auto tech innovation. It delivered shareholders a 28% single-day gain when its acquisition by Samsung Electronics was announced on Nov. 14, 2016. Now Robinson is back with another pick. He says it's the best place to put your money in the connected and driverless vehicles space right now. This company makes hundreds of the components that form the backbone of the ADAS tech featured in so many new cars and trucks. Special Report: Cannabis Is the Gold Rush of the 21st Century – 30 Stocks to Invest in Now. Read more… As a key tech supplier to the industry, it counts just about every automaker as a customer. To keep its competitive edge, it just shifted a quarter of its R&D staff to focus exclusively on ADAS. In its last earnings call, the company blew past forecasts for fourth-quarter profits by almost 15%. Year-over-year revenue increased 11% to $4.3 billion. Robinson says this company is a great investment regardless of whether it becomes an acquisitions target (which is quite possible). He projects a 30% gain in its stock over the next 24 to 28 months, absent a buyout offer. A deal would just be icing on an already profitable cake. Learn more about this top tech stock to buy – and get the ticker – right here… Best Stocks to Buy Now No. 2: Surging Global Data Traffic Makes These Shares a No-Brainer Robinson also uncovered a unique way to profit on video streaming, social media, and cloud computing all at once. Worldwide, we watch a lot of video. YouTube users collectively log a billion hours each day. Netflix viewers watched 116 million hours of content a day in 2016. Facebook? 110 million hours a day spent viewing videos. That takes up a lot of bandwidth. And that's where data centers come in. All that video has to run through them to be processed. Data centers also provide businesses with cloud solution services. Global data center traffic is set to grow 33% annually through 2019. And the market for "multi-tenant" data centers worldwide is increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 12%. The company Robinson recommends operates 145 data centers in 30 metro areas. More than 2,000 corporate clients link into those facilities. Half of sales come from social media titans like Facebook and LinkedIn. Facebook boasts 1.86 billion monthly active users. LinkedIn has 467 million members. All those users ensure increasing traffic and steady business for this firm. Data centers are plenty profitable, too. Every dollar of revenue for this company translates into roughly $0.57 in adjusted profits. The average client lease is about 12.8 years long. The cost for a customer to move its equipment to another location is $10 billion to $20 billion. Both make for a high customer retention rate. This stock is up 10.15% so far this year. Investors also benefit from reliable dividend income. Shares currently yield 3.5%, and that dividend has grown 13% annually since 2005. Data center rent hikes and booming global data traffic mean it will likely keep growing, too. For a solid foundational holding that offers a rising share price along with income, click here to read the full story… This next pick on our best stocks to buy list is up 183.6% this year, with more gains on the way… Join the conversation.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / G.SKILL Announces Trident Z RGB DDR4-3333MHz 128GB and 64GB kits G.SKILL Announces Trident Z RGB DDR4-3333MHz 128GB and 64GB kits Paul Taylor 12 hours ago Featured Tech News, Memory PC enthusiast memory maker G.SKILL has announced a new line-up of top-tier memory kits for discerning modders and gamers. The Trident Z RGB DDR4-3333MHz 128GB and 64GB retail kits are squarely aimed at the high-end X99 and Z270 motherboards, respectively, currently driving the likes of Intel’s Xeon E5 (v3)-series and Kaby Lake CPUs. The retail kits include either 8x or 4x 16GB of G.SKILL’s trademark RGB lit non-ECC unbuffered 3333MHz DIMMs, which contain lighting control IC for compatible motherboards. The 8-DIMM kit is intended, naturally to max out all the memory banks on an X99 motherboard with quite the visual effect, while the 4-DIMM kit is intended for Z270-based Kaby Lake systems. While the memories are rated at a snappy 3333MHz, you can play around with the settings, says G.SKILL. The kit, being XMP 2.0 compliant makes memory timing selections in the BIOS easy enough, and while it is XMP, we did realize that if you happen to reduce the number of DIMMs to as little as two (Ryzen, anyone?) you’ll be able to squeeze out 3866MHz, with 18-18-18-38 timings, without raising the voltage (default 1.35v). While technically you’ll be wanting to ride a 128GB/64GB monster into modding la-la-land, the pricing on this kit has not yet been announced. Availability is set for May 2017. KitGuru Says: We’re not quite sure how many of you out there are blinging-out multi-thousand-dollar workstations running Xeon E5 CPUs with flashy lights, but if you are, this looks and acts the part.

Ha ha ha I'm so sensitive. Perhaps it's it's interesting that he does the right it's because your I think it gets very sensitive and if anybody tries to stereotype and I didn't he was very quick to jump right on bail out of my right notes hey I am and Heidi yeah it HR. I agitator and they just bought the store total different that they put all this money in the construction. New rooms and in all those stuff thoughts tell you wrote it left right left looks like it to me thanks very rooms little blocks that is so I actually pass that the other day when they had the whole Imus and hold team. He building bonding type thing that they were doing and let the big giant enormous. Media don't bet that huge table America it's just she'll see him for fifty dead at least no no no exaggeration that they have like that decide America's -- the problem kids are all sort of looks like yes it's good care or somebody walked by ABC you know we're over city there's usually the guy that's columns some sort of disrupt Matt kidding clapping thrown. In a statewide and you know caring on talking during class to put them in the back you can sit occasional thanks again it's the comfort zone banks have to bring you can still working can I can't especially great as it was actually great that. Appropriate I'd disastrous night last eyewitnesses and even liberals one point does not good. And it looks more and more based on what we're because I don't think can win this game tomorrow against Washington who knows originally felt. It was ugly game. It auto magically suddenly you get done. I'll let you get that was a big a big points and Dale Watson is two minutes ago on auto is pressing a little bit moment this is that this is the kick in the ball yes. Like this is it radiates a minute to go and much good night Imus gets overtime thanks market you know point it looked like Toronto was gonna lose. You wanna be up two points you know you got the tiebreak you want to be up to. They get to let you go one laugh posit this to kick in the balls get to overtime. Delete is the last thing you need is a loss in regulation. Right the other NATO and get the point out of it Annette now you only one point ahead of them with you know when they get a game in hand you know it'd feel confident with a shootout though did you what exactly. Snapper gone coerced it out old first. And he's out of 400 but the closer to auto drag it around. It's not. Lot of it only this a retirement to play the hot hand in shootouts and Heidi at the winners I don't know I like to play the best ones I don't declared. It a source luck that is in bald. It would be nice 63 on who has the better who's the most skilled at doing the one on one I mean the most skilled revolution. Okay are you vote yes or whether it be the president did in martian yeah parts the first one out there is a solution out there. And I like to see. You know there preachy you'll Bergeron practicing one of those two guys out I don't understand the thought process for the guys otters first of all you can't skate behind the net. In the in the show about her friends. I employee a lot of public circumstance involved and watch the body as the hot hand and it doesn't mean he's good out. Yeah would you would you watch issued out in the attempt just leaves you liked her speechless. And this who don't look in your face like. Was there that you don't sometimes you see that it is of the Ohio like to call rub beautiful this goal is not a guy makes it so easy. You know I just like all these quick movements Aussie DeSoto leaves the pocket it goes like and the goalie losing go to tunis pads yet we'll be stops it that's one of those moments recent days ago. That was that's what you thought about before and that's the effort like that you spent and you went third and you think about what you gonna do what you came up with that. He's you'll eat your brain was an edit your legs and you're over thinking you that you will. All over thinking you visualize and that was again I'll have spent the general on his bid to buy it at the all star there was an actual visual look that was gonna work half cocked. Wragge yeah. Italy some. She does lead to elect it's articulate why don't. I think you cannot do what they shoot early to guy just makes it easy safe and elect regularly shoot a 1520 feet from the currently try to catch him off guard yulia and he stopping eagle. Yeah I feel like that that reminds of like a back that is dances too much. In the backfield like the holes there it's open but you decide you want it you know move rattle pittance in and goes east and west and go straight board make we'll make a decision go. I'm so wouldn't we have felt a hell of a lot better. Brad marsh and didn't get suspended play nine game last night got a much better opportunity when and I feel so I always do. I'm still don't know when you're gonna get from from Washington Toronto could come up with three points this weekend you'll lose to Washington because Washington Angela. And let's beat these a Bruins track record over the years against the brewers. This team this is the team we want to face in the first round it'll be quick it'll be easy and it will be painless let's beat the bar. What that what the capture him bring the town tomorrow but the ship thing before him he'd throw all the words selfish in one point. Liberal return sell or it's a rules committee now. That was on here out Celtics put it all became about family and it's true the old card out on the table. That since you guys need to be used guys. All of you guys have never been in the position. Well done and now if you isn't a senior and you but it is you know that he really had you until aggregate upload for the NHL right. It replaced in the yeah this is that is Brett Russia after the game. Who are really concerned about culpable pulling through shields. A side of the room so there's always things up and talking and again there are people like your vote in this this world and my teammates my family and you know I think that they have different thoughts so rules that she. Think southern quicker there. You. And you have ever been out there who I don't know it's a western suburbs of and position you don't really understand that and their subsequent. Look at this problem I had with the shift and he still trying to beat the tough. I'm still trying to uphold what I'd I don't usually became employed illegal thought loud at times when we hear apologies. Right where I was that guy was well written by the agents or it was good it was easier to write this in your zip you know your typical you know what are some boast we're talking to Christian about comic. Usually when someone does them night and ending it spending a couple games do some hurt the team. When the first he's first off folic all you opera stuff or seller apologize. My teammates. My fans. Into my fan right I got firm harassing him or to the fans of it came at a there's Bruins fans out there that are really press that he didn't do that. They were and basically what he says is that I really don't know screw. In and its not that big ideologies that it was kind of like a surprise is that well he kind of one off. Of port here from it was interesting because it was what a legacy of fans he'd say you know a bit too old for the seat and he and his behavior what anyone thinks of making it's my family. He doesn't think he really did anything wrong I think that was a good thing no no it's because if you do. That you have played Ohio mighty daylight you know I don't own any I don't know I don't own an explanation to anybody my teammates a month yeah did you guys don't care what I mean there is that. Again we talk about the you know it actually is. But you could tell brick works better than anybody because you played on professional teams might guesses that those guys in that in that room the dressing room. Did not give them a hard time about it. Because you don't want they also the same thing that all the hockey players say what LB said yesterday when he called it. And that is it happens we called him because if we could get rid of them gets hurt I. Like child okay so I can't do you like I have to invite to admit I didn't say when they leave I think. Let him but you know the guys in the rooms it and I don't worry about it Margie and happens it happens it happens is hockey and in it's happens we gadget we get you back. Deep down side I don't know if they necessarily. Really believe that mean that the that's which you set so that's where he's coming up and say that my teammates have like you know I just carry my I don't have an experience this and it's it's it's it's a little odd to me that this is okay but I'll talk some guys. Earlier this morning. But the bit about the the suspension in the act and it within one part of anybody's yeah she's on every morning that he's Hillary hockey researching dogs yeah. 450. Real well ahead of the Jamal hey guys great and and it it just so nonchalant about it dislike you know that's a public all the time. Really we just wait took that. Did he get the faith and underneath that they got all that odd he's done. You know I was really late season this season that hold the phone like really had nothing to know what's gonna go check of not take Marcia and go check mark yes but no. Don't gonna do it I'm like I. I put the wrong sport so what you did innocently that's what it looks a body had not been buying. That's what he's playing he's played a role this is hockey you guys don't understand it if you never play the game it's game and it's now exploit. And I like I think most fans would much rather heard him come out yesterday that dropped the words selfish but it was quick it was yet. To say you don't want. Shame on me. It's a rough game things happen quickly switch goes off that's what happened to me. I apologize to the fans to my teammates more importantly to my teammates because I let him down thank god. They bailed me out the other night thank you for that. I'm old then and I'll make it up in the playoffs are what did he say that no video Al male I don't know what I'm easily done that effect if you look at his track record. We look at his track record. He seems to be timid. When he comes back from the suggestions he does just the opposite he does now he can't see in his head and now. You now army even more worried you're going into the playoffs you're going up against the team that probably going to be really boring. And really kind of choking when that neutral zone. You'll meet a guy maker like him a skilled player. Like it get low chipped it and then it. Last night gross that I we go this is gonna try to get him this is this the good thing here let's go and it is gonna gonna face then it's going to be a boring game. But you need hate. You need it. You know you need is so it's gonna be boring hockey game because of the 13 trapped neutral zone that bad bad bad. We got ya gonna being. In a little eight in Malaysia I did not look. We think they can do it martian. I think you're gonna try to get an antagonize them they're gonna say we are. I was them yeah he's gonna have to play stick. It marked the good boy and in it in the corner he's going to have to be careful because he knows he's going to be a target not only the players. But the officials are gonna be quick to call it because they know the reputation as fresh now. Just suspended for a W I worry about him. Coming back because there's a history here. Where he's been timid when he's caveat I just think that the players Muslim just surprised by a Bruins fans feel about I like it. You don't I you don't like you like his can't notice exactly bogus media unit name BQ yes well there have ever been out there national honors heroes of recurrence are all well. Have a single western media has to say you guys suited you really care about his teammates my family. And my fans to apologize to. I mean but at the fans out and it's really care. I don't really care yeah right that was that is a passionate Bruins fans are happy with you right now they'd love you. You split 39 goals your MVP candidate pay they'd love your game right now. You know they do look if she was one of the leaders and you let them down. Everything studio with the Yankees don't know people you know passionate group out there that deals with him he's been saying the bottom over the last 48 hours. OK I'm so did I don't you know media and that's what he's doing but that's what he still he was slapping back. You guys to let Ileana right slap the media you're sitting there saying I should get the two game suspension or some people are saying five or ten game suspension. You guys had no clue he'd never been on the I should never bid in my shoes he was playing that game. I don't all of a review. I don't mind if you beat up to media. Many times you guys know teams use it as motivation it's us against those you know it'll be yet terrible attitude you've got those bastards that when you do. But why not come out and throw it back to the saints okay. Why not throw it back in and say you know I'm sorry for the fifth oh you'll I feel that the man my guys built it. Well I guess whether it was so much pressure on and on I don't know I think what when it comes to apologies and athletes I think gorgeous lower their expectations. Could they are not gonna do. What you want them to just what I want is their option well they would understated anyways don't page based pay anything and it went earnestly but there was little follow like a couple of good. A lot of Israel does though he's got. Was OK I guess there that really the ball ball hit ball crystal ball struck out. When we we have game lead them all and now you're simple Jack McClinton. That's my point so so you're looking marsh and politically is you look at you know he's been his whole life and to have to expect anything anything more I think you're kind of hope but it agreements not gonna happen definitely isn't his parents. Maybe he isn't but there's more than baseball players so you expect more like it that way will I. You think he may well baseball players I think are the dumbest of all four major athletes. This you do this and I do book. They learn to dreamer replaced what was he ever there was few if they got postponed sprawling. Port level cool game very pleasantly in the game. South here late Thursday as easily gone by the office. C'mon you're doing is the purpose of obviously you liked him and right now I fly it fly like a flag football throughout with them all off. See that's Wall Street that's not right now he wants to gets a little sensitive to stereotype that's all. It is literally a few groups depositors assailant LB dvds. For. OG BB a knows that it's at the past marxism and that's. All of you wanna get suspended you you you create the action on Wednesday or Thursday so you can get suspended for her they were Black Friday get that the west Willard that you're glad I'd want yeah. He'll tell Dodgers Nuremberg and thought you know. Got a teacher that's it's not to open a possible sharply talking about the Brazil we'll get into the Celtics. I was more disturbed about that Celtics game last night. That it was about the Cleveland game Cleveland gave you can almost justify. Because there is a switch in your playing against the greatest player on the planet that team last night they played is not real good he can't score an awful lot. And you came out so timid and shy and we'll get to them and I got a couple minutes but we'll start with the Bruins. And martian nobly it to recruit injury which you are a little bit concerned about. And. That and sound good does a great deal they tried to show the playing so late in the post game with those guys guys aren't just a broad slate to set aside whiz bang that knee against the boards now. Didn't look like much now baloney here. Leaving crutches and a big knee brace acted on incidents telecast and it sound too good early on to me from this. We'll see what it does sound good at all now. Although withdrawal from alcohol a lot of people be talking about him must've called Miller. Is that guy you know you bring him in instilled to have the big picture in mind. To me and me opened up Mac loyalist you have to your gonna burn this kid JFK one year for one game against Washington but you had to do that get him out of college. Because he I think everybody right now is scared to Judy VC. Right if this goes back for his junior year he want to go back disputed K you go back Fiji and new York and other Goodyear test what you raging near seamless and we think of all finishing up school. One year with being a free agent you'll schools auction off the stylus electorate and a bus I hate good fit but you know what it puts yet there's a free agent. That worked for Jimmy DC's Nagle back for a whole year. Agassi indicated Notre Dame and it's kind of think of doing that same thing that trance but. He might he's gold backs of why would you burn one year. It doesn't sound like I did hear Cam Neely with our sisters we girl justice system one big fan of bricks are now. And it sounded to me like McEvoy he claimed that defense is a lot. Hard to pick up the learning curve. Jumping from the college ranks to the pros just like that and I you gonna jump the skewed in one game and into the policies. He made it sound like it was really hard to do. If you're forwards a little bit different and will be easy sounds to me like they have a death. Will always shattered our young defense and a lot longer. In his league and sports or. But we got we we got to get right to default coasters our show is today at like 1228. Or go to Detroit we're not physically golden Droid and no we're not physically gone to him elitist it Davis and to try something in my native is that nobody on our families out again nobody had any sense I hate to tell you. Look he's up. Already let it hang out he getting left in the tank. Instinct I thought the slowdown that put them on the DL. Because it's that they deal roster put the guys on the did you. Get too many guys. Now you know you get you to get retro on these guys have been Roz is in many games you can retro my surprise that a bit of a duel with Holtz. Because it needed you know of the need another infielder Miguel how can you go the utility guy on the DL. But he's out apparently able to play he's DH and today. Among core and it is that short putter so they're all fallen a guy with the injured about phone puddles looking good. Is looking good immune system and another that Saturday about improved and consistent as you guys left fat guys Intel. I don't know I don't you stick and take photos and millions when an item I six point 77797937. We start with pros will get the Celtics. But your phone call. It's coming on the X. At ON math on WEEI 140 characters of new England sports know how everyday keep up with the show on Twitter as always. Guy that's. Back to more of Fort Wayne remotely important game right now. What Sports Radio WEB. Yeah the locals here at six or 77797937. Did martian cop Costa maybe a possible point in the UK last thing here's mark marks in the car anymore. Very good want to beside de LA. And all. That he'll go back pocket and I need a New Jersey double pretty much. Invented that yet and three so great that it worked. And it so get rid of it. Now you know and he was shaken and now he did in Tampa and then I'm done it for a while right. Yeah I I really don't under the impression that the NHL has banned the track and I had just bought at bat barrel even late. Let anybody call that at least that the way to end it was illegal. No it's boring it's boring as hell and I can't play but I can't blame coach but I can't play and coach are. In an overtime 313. And auto lot elected. They and the brutal at all and racked up a lot of open I sold their real real quick look at that they don't look at everything they want. They don't give the area of point they got out there where it that's only needed last night was there. But it street aug three guys that are bought. Now it is bad I want to get two points and they can wrap up they wanna get them to seize well though. But insisted it is what is at it again that those guys are great job of talking about you know what by the Bruins weren't. There are moments when they weren't getting it done they're slowing down as opposed to using speed to kind of get through at all. Edit it's a pain in the ass to watch we saw it I can't use this to you you maybe sixty marking the end of the two line passes that would you're thinking of. Yeah I think I know. Like outside like I I was under the impression that it got banned from the image I'll maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong. Not that I doubt that I remember what but I I will tell you this I have no problem with a coach doing it. If you think that it helps you especially with the personnel that you have the skill set you have. That it helps you when my patella did it if you remember years ago in the nineties with with the NBA. When he was recorded and playing terrible it plays 77 to 72 games OK let you know. The NHL's laudable goal scoring it down their back everything while. If you let them do that than anyone outside ought to look as quote me one to want. I don't believe they let a red light a pocket and one got all of them. Now get ready today get ready for that year in the Stanley Cup Playoffs and a first round. With the proposed in the senators that's the thing is they saw it hit so if they win Saturday they get Ottawa period there when they get out. And restored. Right yet the only question is who are people who like if they lose in Toronto gets. Three plus points in the last two games ago big Washington the right candidates are on their guys. Birdie Columbus so. I guess it all just depends on who shows up health issues just washed and even care. Because it doesn't help or hurt from a less and less to your point they wanna play the Bruins break hoping career again. It's the bruins' thirteen games he's played his record is eleven. And two and a pretty good a catch 22 goals against. Save percentage and 945. Pretty good goals against average one point 80. And he said three shout outs again took grasp all carry career against the capitals fifteen games. He's one and nine that's worst than his record against ones Alitalia something we. Five all overtime games with a save percentage of 887. You like your odds proposal at a very average until that point 14 goals against it we know the odds and I'll tell you want all I can envision. Is power play opportunities. And Ovechkin over there on the left circle is just killing. Two skeletons are not gonna recruit is that Martha Enright has got to assume recruits anyway anytime somebody leaves the stadium where you have noted you don't know which you're gonna oil. Marsh on the biggest things on Saturday I'll let you know I'm I'm I'm talking about like yet that is team based in pick up last thing. And don't want a one game when you're 39 goal scoring probably would have made the difference especially in a shootout in which he lost to shoot. So you can argue yet he killed you last on that's regular model had the clippers are for trying to had a couple. Opportunities and that was marsh and that he throws an excuse it and maybe a minute to which it shots Dodi starts off the she does that a staffer. That's ever read on and you know he got that. Well because it wrapped around NFL exploited it that is what I thought he had his arsenal overblown. At the gut reaction that's a knee jerk reaction to guide it. Two goals the last two games after what having seven or something like that added an entire season. I suddenly he's your go to guy channel he's striking fear in the hearts of men are only there to shake it off my little boy that's like I it is fine to postman look and that's the toys that you speak that stock yourself every goalie delegates that. It's at the post right lady didn't back. I hit an a because that he issued out it was a huge draw draw like we need to meet. RNC and never wanted to I got schooled who've been working out for a year now rather steamed about it. A lot of criticizing and Cassie I don't know how you can because they're not in. The postseason without Bruce Cassidy that we don't do any of us believe it's great coaches gloating is and I love the median discount. They they'd like this guy so much and they know that he's a great concentrated okay actually no but he's put the time. Expired just like Francona right just like Franco who's a great manager and a better manager are you hearing negative image we have right now. I think there are a lot of people that that were that good. I'm a man I thought his days at work to be honest with you usually my opinions are different voice I just a and they are closed and any change often so yeah I think entail a big that taking chances some of the art rehab like you know. You know that he had a bunch of games like this is a football season reluctantly on it compared to do you have sixteen games to make this change in. At the same time a compatible time like its own good you know you have a confident yeah I want sport that it can't work. Yeah I just can't worry I got a basketball yet or three games to really figure things out and get some momentum around it's a lot to me they had the 14 game losing streak what what he's really stick out about an axle and. When you play what sixteen games every single week you can get an effort. I you can get an effort now to most strategy to ball game planning or all those stuff. Sometimes a coaching change it in other sports is just about. Getting an effort. Right line lighting a fire and some people's asses let them know that this is acceptable. And get football you really have to do that in light a fire zone team they don't get it up on us. Oh god and as we if you screwed your out of the your owner Laura and I went back and got a anyways I get up on another happening more that's just that's that's a Reimer media making a general animation at the environment play together I really don't we want yeah we're not gonna years because of that let's. Adds up every single game on to saint like it is and in baseball it's like you know you try to motivate a team or basketball you try to get effort and and same thing with hockey trans rattle the cage a little bit together. New data is directed to a few veterans on a team's eighty got way too comfortable with this guy let's go I need you to get back to work. Any just or give media effort and play indicate that the ability. Lorena yeah and that in advance and I know our ways away from that envelope not capacity will get the job. There's also season's over whose tenure there from the game he's getting it when they're out of the big games he's got again. On the stimulus. I don't know fears are not my point is that it's ridiculous situation in which is I think he he's probably the leader in the clubhouse is it okay and that's order. Is he got and it's the post season and they wore in real trouble. About making the play fast he got him in and he got him in because of this great run they had down down the stretch. And I think it does happen and hockey because as Lucent it's a real emotional game you're playing every other night it's three times a week. It and you've got enough games to make a diaper and you've got players who probably were pissed at clawed away because they weren't playing that style Claude wanted and they weren't getting the point is that. And now they got a hold on to enlighten me with a new coach they can impress them I don't long term if if if Cassidy. Is the answer but he certainly was the answer here down the stretch though we ideologically but they have Julien as coach better not make the playoffs I agree invaded they don't make it they edit when it sable island doesn't work. So everybody's happy now so now don't. Yesterday you did not think. That Marcia was going to get the two game suspension. We did he show right you didn't think you should know largest. For the past precedent that's all okay mandated made an example of this guy right so any history played into it but I don't I mean. He did it to himself his I was playing around the huddle he led the league. About this phone with Iraqi news NHL sends mixed message with laughable two game suspension. For martian. This is what Brad marsh and it is he's the NHL equivalent of the kid. Who was constantly being marched down to the principal's office. He's the kid stands there shuffling his feet looking down at the grounds of the principal reads off these litany of offenses. He apologizes. Promises to be better. And it worked brilliantly. Because he gets off where they won at recess detention. On a day when it's minus thirty yard pass aha he walks to the door forlornly. And full of shame. That he skips town hall laughing the entire way back to class. We're simply picks up where he left off. And runs a mocked. Continuing to make life. Powell for his teacher. And class might they gonna talk about how effective a play areas. How dirty play areas and he has learned anything in this thing and they should have the league should have really slap shot madam. The teacher once and for all because he's gonna do the same crap again they wanted done. The final two regular season games in four. Playoff game noted that article a musica. Now on the I wouldn't go there yet and I would. After the season is over forget about who doesn't know what their histories that act alone. Should suit the issue survey a four game suspension just for that act alone and don't give me this what happens on the mad don't people did chip vehicles to play not. No you do that you're supported automatic. Fine in that every reason to get more ship the final two games of the season plus four playoff games. Which would have made at the equivalent of a ten game suspension. That might have repeat. Might have actually do it triggered marsh and from doing this kind of thing again. Com. It's. But the idea but but GOP as jobs which is filled. With former booms and dirty players willingly allowed all of this to slip through its audience. Kept taking shots at the department of of safety. With the way this question I would ask the question I think that if you are cam you you've got to have right now. How is going to end. I was houses and Emmitt how how should not how is this going to end this type of behavior. Every well I don't know it is genuinely trying to hurt how does a static thing about this thing about another Storey tumble player CT. Day the overdo it on the penalty the overdo it on the fine Kate today ahead. We're at throughout two. Misconduct so we're gonna keep yeah opportune games. Like you have to come down on them hard with the suspensions and the finds matches in their wallet but in there okay so what. I support what he's saying here is they didn't do that and how do you expect any of this to change. It has changed with Washington does he realizes he. Because do you really believe there's anybody. Believe. That the guys in the room or sit there saying cut the crap out. I don't believe that's happening there hockey players this eagle opportunities you know that's RK screw ya it's just a game hockey is not get. I don't know what that you'd get run I don't know about that because he's I don't know of anything or not they like this that it's last the last 190101000 dollar fine. I think response is it meant that that study your wallet but it. We need to and yanks. Can't be continued this is the next regaining its suspended. Because that affects them affects the team. So I don't think they're really happy about it meets his teammate you gonna support of but I I don't particularly pleased that Brad marsh and missed the last two games of in that locker room knows exactly what was on line do you think your vocal with him that's question because I guarantee you. Sweeney said something to you as lies days and counting Patrice Bergeron gets a that you sent to Saddam and you get screwed and I league's foods you everything you say listen up you know I love you. I don't know but. I doubt I don't know I think that's the big question because I think that. Is what's going to have. A bigger chance of getting him to clean up his history here okay. And then we heard yesterday as a curable we sent doesn't care what apparently the defense is saying and the fans are not real happy about it you've seen some of the polls out there. I don't think he cares about any of that other stuff. Question is are any of those guys actually being adamant getting into his face and say look which just cost us. It might cost as you know an opportunity to face auto boat or Toronto here. Quite 6177797937. Not a good night for the Celtics in Atlanta either will get to all of that and your phone calls coming up now. Sports Radio WEEI. So they want to update. Welcome Laura Ed today you pay peak. What actual workers to stop bothering people on the court yesterday from escape routes. They show it. That they don't only funny flavors. Swelling up as I talked. To cause this positively. And it ended the benefit of the oh ice cream coming up at times running. It. Hit it and it'll happen. It's like a different tactic tactic that's. I'd charges laughing earlier readers tires go to get a wholesome look in the mountains is the law. Some of these calls favors the pitchers you actually saw that movie that's. I love dirty work at this if it about well you know Don Rickles is. I don't got I know that you know done their classes if you literally anybody Reno was I don't know wage creates articles more famous than happy it's. I don't know or I signs are being created a character care OK yes it's Arnold's. I don't know about your ads the character but he robbery it was. Not a result all of that they've Margarito is more famously cared to beat John Travolta's care to be about Reno is more famous. More identifiable and Don Rickles. Well done bonds dialogue has bluntly the August got a wants those funds wrinkles robberies Andrea Rickles and for a long time don't recognize you know the programs was old when I was young. You want I don't let us eulogy was but he was. So different did you have that Bob hole. Our company out there which to me was therefore make you laugh but now I never understood why it. Kabob fully funding what that was though he hit it in the old days Bob will be used to do via all American. He stabbed as a Christmas show right here it was like Bobble all American special art that was your goal right you want to be on don't have a good show navy carriers something about evidently you have like all the football players commodity introduce each guy had some corny joke that he got from ex convict him back the guys that when your way to Colorado. And all relate it took them almost like four hours to do to show. Good at that point times like it was like in state and fast. But no I never never got it went by it was funny it is fading fast forever have never. Actually Bob OP funny I think but also I think Palm Springs locals to be with just maybe it's Rickles was biting humor it was sarcastic. It was put downs. Right there. She's. Get smacked around like goodfellas did he get smacked around a good fellow accusing Gonzales. That's another using both the ugly American from the movement would get smacked around good fellow of the apple keynote casino casino in a rental we couldn't. Brad. I do well as we are seeing an interview with winner of each of you for half. I'd be ready I'm ready to figure applied I look at the pie yeah let's get to the all of that. Elephant and it means what's. Com what are you let's get exactly let's get to the to move right it's self called it to the Celtics. How might we U guys now more disappointed. In what you saw last night that you were. With the cavaliers for the cavaliers is an explanation. As some people like Luke said the extra returns which on the greatest player. And they got to smoke. And that was an explanation. An explanation for a team that lost nine of the last eleven. But averaging 94 points a game grounded to get Paul Millsap but it's his first came back. You're a better team you just got smoked by Cleveland you've got something to prove to empty yourself to your coach. Everett and you'll make. Well that's yes it was explainable. Is a good beat down so badly the night before they still in recovery right from it and that's scary that's what it wants. That they'd mentally they would just destroyed. From that game they get beat yeah physically mentally you name it and they jumped an airplane they never recovered. This sort of look like and I know it was a beautifully slocum back at the end and see the games like that is when you do appreciate market Smart. Or because they're still fight to that thing over late night game artists steal the ball. I've three point her homework as Smart as he doesn't he's at an upset of a bit if she does hit those reporters that's the last shot you want him to take tell me you were watching the game cynical. Yeah yeah. Out what if he doesn't hit those threes lost beaten you get smoked and I gave it is welcome back. You're coming back Connecticut and you get 35 out of Isaiah Thomas but they were okay they are at this than there were this time you what do you laws. Isaiah anomaly or do you think he gets. You're always gonna get that you're always gonna get a save he's always coming to play listen we edited the question is never Isiah not always on the other really as well let's mothers so stupid when we were dealing with this a month ago people calling up and say you've got a trade Isiah that you gotta go dropped the ball ball. Or false ridiculous if you get rid of rising right now you grab one of those kids. You're 32 win now team mixing it is it. Harlem would be okay to say that it in. Com and like the way Al Horford played last and he's crowds aren't the Minnesota is okay aren't people out there but you know a couple of five rebounds well what a great shooting that little candlelight. If I say that obviously didn't get his old team and had to pay a bag on any noise and applicants is old you know I know him in sets screens and picks and those teams but is it okay that are expected isn't likely. Player or fives are definitely even if he's not make a basket he's contributing manipulated you haven't played them yet today does not educated basketball lives or feel like yours are right you can't. He will you see it's a little girls okay Lou he was intimidated. They booed like they did to LeBron you're in Boston the other night they booed him every time he touched the ball. And like LeBron he was intimidated by that blowing. When he touched the ball because he still has he still has some some some roots there he still has some strings attached. Two Atlantic even though they weren't really left his body mariners departs for a throwback uniforms on a. All right like stop it now it was an event that all about assurance and it's funny I was just you know what with as far as the brawn James goes. You know it it's just it's not gonna happen I mean to think about that team that's best built to beat them just look it Golden State. But Thompson the green. They have a Kevin Durant back. Seth Curry I mean. I thought all that all the weapons that they're throwing act. The Cleveland Cavaliers I mean once thought after the other I mean this guy goes down and read some concentrate Margarita Kevin Durant. May solve any different. Options so if you guys can take over a game they had the Celtics have won. One guy and that's it. Net and hey if these yeah try to convince the Celtics know I'm not it just me or it's just more going back yes demoralization that they're so far away. That's result oh they're the car knowledge are very sold they don't all our Woodson you saw. I you're not a little farther far at Paul George RR at all George always asking. At Paul George if you think it you'd think it fit to be in the cabs that is it is DMZ and has the lottery teams fall far it if it captain warriors. There. That it bores got a pretty good shot. Right when you sank. Yeah it's a Soviet warrior I understand and grant Donnelly is a better team this year and they were last year will set a bar them. Was Joseph what is better tonight but I do think the Golden State is a better team this year than they were last year because he doesn't record the attention of the rainbow that's all the other hour I'll appoint the point is I think Cleveland's better graphical status as well all of these. So I just. That will be to that what's gonna happen and then he goes to a couple guys that everybody does not just think it's not. Two guys it's really three. Least three so you have eyes they asked if it as they're Thomas at the haves Paul George you need one more Marcus Marty's and it. Al Horford I mean OK if you want assistant and some rebounds and maybe ever now that twenty point okay fine. Unique beauty somebody like Avery Bradley's take edges and as Avery Brad that's legit guy. He's the guy that's what you need and the like they were able to hold little bit more lies Arianna Bradley and the auto. That. Erica Eric Ghiaciuc it isn't at all. And that's it adds that there's any critical Bret Stephens god yeah oh yeah it always pro and argued that are already known on now through the playoffs start it's time be critical of now got two wins and guess he's got a dog a series gotta gotta proponents say it doesn't he's already really did that is the second it's two different arguments of course he does we don't know that but but that was a playoff game the other night he did not coach like him disciplined enough that he coached at like him a couple seconds unity and communicate in the second quarter and amnesty what they deal. No that's not would you do any good that the it was a huge might have been just wrong. Display senate yesterday argued in his ticket when a second round pick. But but why. It's a Cleveland wouldn't win that game the other night until I'm I'm changing my tune on Cleveland I think Cleveland is going to. A much more difficult time in the post season yes I think this is going to be a rough road for them to go in with a championship again sorry it will. And Toronto that got Howard that ship many minutes he played the other 42. Room right out of the gate. But Isiah can't play more than 32. And a big game against quickly got to sit him down for all that I'm sorry that's wrong. You could be the coach is huge in the post season because a lot of it depends on who you have out there. And what your game plan is you're playing it's not like you're playing back to backs in the U flight to Phoenix in the flying to Portland. You're playing a seven game series in which everything is about match ups and you can exploit another team. That's still the book is still out on Brad Stevens when that whether he can on it and I agree an event and he did a terrible job on. He did a terrible job the other night page. Match the team didn't play while they shoot the ball well pig that. Then she just shoot the ball well they'd lose. Kept a second unit that couldn't do anything in the entire second quarter not saying just. A lot of putting pleasant without a backup. Felt some blame everybody's to blame an emblem with him. They're sick you know they go out and we will not as adults we always we will have we will but we won't let put all the blame on just approved as you around the. No I think the guy has been really good to this point. In taking players and bringing them up to the next law McCain certainly has a knack for doing that teaching got a game plan stuff like that. We don't know what he's like. When you. Actually have that was just another game I and is eager to your phone calls coming up next at 6177797937. Or do we do this. Do we do this or do we play the Michael Holley roll a little listen Lavar balls and these stupid again. Every shot away for more do we actually dive into her after the ball all says something again really really stupid.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / BAFTA eSports Audience Award leaves PC game developers scratching heads BAFTA eSports Audience Award leaves PC game developers scratching heads Paul Taylor 12 hours ago Tech News The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awarded its second eSports Audience Award in a ceremony last night, giving the people a vote in recognizing the popularity and importance of eSports and related game franchises. The nominee list, chock-full of AAA-rated MOBA and TDM games like Overwatch, DOTA 2, LOL and CS:GO, counted in its ranks a mobile game, Clash Royale. For those who do not care for mobile gaming, Clash Royale is a card game/PvP brawler for mobile (Android and iOS), and a spin-off of the original Clash of Clans, by the same publisher and resorting to some of the original developers of Clash of Clans. BAFTA, much to the surprise of onlookers, announced Clash Royale as the winner and left many purists livid, as can be seen by the award’s twitter feed. Despite its popularity among mobile gamers, smartphones are hardly a spectator sport when compared to mature competitive franchises that bring in the crowds by the thousands and rake in the money prizes like CS:GO, Overwatch, League of Legends and DoTA 2. But it may just be time to rethink this… For a bit of perspective, Overwatch hit 25 million online players a couple of months ago, while the biggest League of Legends event in 2014 was streamed to over 27 million online viewers. ESL’s Intel-sponsored “Intel Extreme Masters” four-day gaming event drew in 104,000 visitors. Most, if not all, offered big money prizes. Clash Royale has – on Android alone – over 100 million installs. You can safely bet there are quite a few on iOS too, and its players are very active. Which would account for the presumable deluge of votes on social media (BAFTA’s method of choice) for the Audience Award. Ironically, the award is also sponsored by AMD who even gives away a bunch of prizes, including a full gaming PC, to one lucky voter/winner. Not that anyone will be playing Clash Royale on one. In the long term, considering AMD is a mobile-less semiconductor design company, this could actually have AMD’s beancounters wondering if the sponsorship is worth keeping. KitGuru Says: While we’re hard-pressed to declare Clash Royale a “spectator sport”, it is clear that the install base and players for iOS and Android far outmatch desktop counterparts. After this result, we may be seeing sponsorships and competitive eSports matches on Clash Royale to pick up.   Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags AMD award Bafta ceremony clash mobile gaming news royale Previous AIDA64 update adjusts Ryzen temp readings, adds support for RX 500 series Next G.SKILL Announces Trident Z RGB DDR4-3333MHz 128GB and 64GB kits Check Also Toshiba NAND bid hits $30 billion mark.

The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency court order Thursday freezing the assets of two Virginia traders who allegedly used insider information to make nearly $1 million on the Intel’s purchase of Mobileye last month. Lawrence F. Cluff Jr. and Roger E. Shaoul used insider information about the acquisition and purchased securities from Mobileye, an Israel-based firm, before the acquisition was announced, the SEC says. Mobileye securities were at $47.27 before the announcement and closed at $60.62 the day of the announcement, March 13. The SEC says it saw suspicious trading activities in two accounts owned by Cluff. Shaoul impersonated Cluff in order to start issuing trading instructions to accumulate more Mobileye call options for Cluff, the SEC says, adding that Cluff made a $925,000 profit through the trading.   To read more stories , click here Loading Other Articles... « Previous Article | Next Article » 0 Comments Login in order to post a comment Quick Poll Do you agree with the DOL's decision to review the fiduciary rule?

Along with the graphics card itself, Nvidia tersely announced that it'd be making a driver available for the card on macOS. Nvidia's press release doesn't mention any cards other than the Titan Xp by name, but Jeff Benjamin at 9to5 Mac got word from the company indicating that all Pascal cards will be supported.  The promised Pascal support is available to only a small share of Mac users. The last Apple desktops with user-accessible PCIe slots were the 2010 Mac Pros with Intel Westmere Xeons. Adventurous owners of MacBook Pros can enable external GPU support in modern macOS releases by meddling with the operating systems' internals. However, this limits access to external graphics solutions to only the most tech-savvy owners. The last Apple computers to sport an Nvidia graphics chip from the factory were 2014 MacBook Pros purchased with the optional graphics cards based on the Kepler architecture. The larger target audience for this driver release seems to be those who have chosen to build their own "Hackintosh" macOS machines from commodity PC hardware. The applicability of Pascal cards in this segment is a little questionable, given the lack of game support on the macOS platform and all the uncertainty springing from the use of a hacked operating system on unsupported hardware for any type of professional use. A good number of macOS applications rely on OpenCL, though, so it's possible that some users will be willing to work around the limitations. Nvidia did not include a release date in its announcement, but 9to5 Mac says that beta drivers are coming next week.

Introduction And Specifications The Dell Inspiron 7000 Gaming straddles the line between mainstream and gaming notebooks. It is offered in a few sizes, including a svelte 14" model, but after getting some hands-on time with the Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming at CES earlier this year, we decided to check the larger laptop out. It sports a 7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU, along with some fairly high-end internals. Before we dig into the Inspiron 15 7000’s specs, we should point out that this particular system sits at the top of the Inspiron line. The entry-level 3000 series is easy on the budget, while the 5000 series and 7000 series offer improved power and features, but carry higher price tags. Solid gaming performance requires powerful hardware, however, so it’s not surprising that Dell’s Inspiron Gaming laptops are part of its higher-end Inspiron 7000 series. Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming Specifications & Features Processor 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7300HQ (6MB Cache, 2.5Ghz - 3.5GHz)  Display 15.6-inch FHD (1920x1080) Anti-Glare, LED-Backlit Display Graphics Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti (4GB GDDR5) Memory 8GB 2400MHz DDR4 Memory Storage 256GB SSD Optical NA Wired Ethernet Gigabit Ethernet Wireless Connectivity 802.11ac Dual-Band 2.4GHz & 5GHz, BT 4.2 Interface (Left) Lock Slot, Power Port, USB 3.0 Port, Media Card Reader Interface (Right) Ethernet Port, HDMI Port, USB 3.0 PowerShare Port, USB 3.0 Port, Headphone/Mic Jack Interface (Back) NA Operating System Windows 10 Home 64-bit Dimensions 15.15 x 10.82 x 1 inches (W x D x H) Weight 5.76 pounds Extras Two color options (Black, Beijing red); 74Whr, 6-cell Integrated Battery, McAfee LiveSafe 12-Month Subscription Warranty 1-Year Mail-In Service Pricing $849.99 (as configured) As we mentioned earlier, Dell pumped up its 7000 Gaming series with Intel’s 7th Gen, “Kaby Lake” processors, and the CPU is one of the defining differences between models. You can keep the price down by going with a Core i5-7300HQ (which appears in our $849.99 review system) or you can bump up to a Core i7-7700HQ, which Turbos to 3.8GHz and adds support for Hyper-Threading. Both CPUs are quad-core chips and both are solid choices for a gaming system, but if your budget has some leeway, putting your dollars into the Core i7-7700HQ isn’t a bad plan. Go this route and you’ll have a starting price of $949.99. Another critical component that changes in the higher priced models is the NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU that's used. Dell puts a GTX 1050 in its lowest-priced model (which starts at $799.99) and steps up to the GTX 1050 Ti for the rest of its Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming series laptops. The GTX 1050 Ti features more CUDA cores and a base clock of 1493MHz, which is the same as the 1050’s Boost clock speed. You also have a few storage drive options, but the best are (understandably) in the pricier models. The entry-level Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming sports a 1TB hard drive, providing plenty of space, but unimpressive speed. The model we tested features a 256GB SSD, offering better performance, but limiting onboard storage space. While that’s not an issue for someone buying an everyday laptop, many gamers have enough titles to easily fill a 256GB SATA SSD. In fact, we ran into storage problems while loading the games (and other benchmarks) we use in our tests. In the end, we had to uninstall a game to make room for another. Look to the pricier models, and you’ll have more choices, including a 128GB SSD / 1TB hard drive setup that gives your OS a speedy drive without sacrificing space for your games library. At the highest end of the series Dell offers a 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 drive. That laptop starts at $1,299.99; if your budget can handle a bigger price tag than that, you’re not so much the target customer for Dell’s Inspiron Gaming series as you are its Alienware brand.  Dell gives the top Inspiron 7000 Gaming models a QHD 3840 x 2160 IPS display, but it opts for a more standard 1920 x 1080 display in most models. Although we love the quality of high-resolution displays, sticking to a typical FHD monitor seems like a sacrifice worth making in the name of adhering to your budget, especially with a 1050 Ti pushing the pixels.

Turns out, people like being treated like people (here’s how) 5.8k Shares Share Tweet Share What's This? Image:  Ilyafs/shutterstock By Aaron Orendorff2017-04-07 15:56:32 UTC At the risk of stating the obvious, leading is hard.   “Dealing with people,” wrote Dale Carnegie over 80 years ago, “is probably the biggest problem you face.” Bleak as it may sound, the challenge of leading is just that: People.   If anything, it’s gotten tougher. The once reigning champ of leading people at work — wage increases — now displays a “very weak” link to motivation, satisfaction, and performance. Even more pointed, a 2016 study from Fidelity found that 58 percent of millennials prefer “improved quality of work life” over financial benefits.  So, what does work? In short: people want to be treated like people especially at work.   Thankfully, leading like a human comes down to three habits you can start practicing today.  Commitment and the power of ‘well done!’  When Stanford business professors James Baron and Michael Hannan concluded their expansive eight-year study of over 200 tech startups, one finding emerged. Their goal was to determine the most successful managerial style. To do that, the duo created five models: engineering, star, commitment, bureaucracy, and autocracy.  Despite mainstream wisdom, Baron and Hannan discovered that the “commitment” model — which relied on “emotional or familial ties of employees to the organization, selection based on cultural fit, and peer-group control” — outperformed its counterparts on all fronts. In fact, not a single of the commitment organizations they studied failed.  Leaders can build commitment through a host of methods, but the most uncomplicated answer lies in one we often overlook — encouragement.   In Baron and Hannan’s study, encouragement lay at the heart of each commitment organization. Likewise, Duke behavioral economists Dan Ariely validated this finding through a series of experiments at Intel. Compliments — nothing more than a simple “Well done!” from the boss — increased productivity 34.7 percent more than monetary bonuses over a one week period.  Why?   Because while cash led to initial boosts in motivation, feelings of entitlement immediately followed. Compliments, on the other hand, sustained. Gratitude is arguably the single most beneficial human emotion. That’s true day to day as well as when your people make career decision with long-term consequences.   The thing is, compliments and commitment don’t happen by accident. They take intentionality: a deliberate focus to look for what’s right and call it out. “Praise and gratitude,” says Katie Melissa, CEO at Starbound Marketing, “are always more effective than criticism. People inherently want to feel appreciated and important.”  This is all the more vital when the people you lead struggle and stumble. As Jeremy Miller puts it, “A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after a success.”  Autonomy and the freedom of ‘less’  The second avenue to humane leadership is a favorite among forward thinkers. Unfortunately, it’s also the most counterintuitive. Daniel Pink — in both his TEDTalk and book-length treatment — lays out the comprehensive benefits of autonomy:  “According to a cluster of recent behavioral science studies, autonomous motivation promotes greater conceptual understanding, enhanced persistence, higher productivity, less burnout, and greater levels of psychological well-being.”  Autonomy means freedom, and freedom stems from the little word “less.”  Starting out in a career or new environment, structure fuels performance. But as time progresses, what top performing team members look for is autonomy and trust. “If you want to run an immature team,” explains brand strategist Leonard Kim, “keep a tight structure. But if you want to attract the best of the best to follow you, then loosen your grip.”  In other words, leading more demands leading less… or at least leading less hands on.  Micro-management breeds resentment, which why the most practical place to start is with less meetings. Estimates on how much time meetings wastes range from 25 to 50 percent of our total working hours. Too often, those meetings are little more than veiled attempts for leaders to flex.   Whether small, large, or even one-on-one gatherings, this desire to exert control stems from the fear that the people we lead are going to make mistakes. But as Ed Catmull, founder and CEO of Pixar, points out:   “Failure is a manifestation of learning and exploration. If you aren’t experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: You are being driven by the desire to avoid it. And, for leaders especially, this strategy … dooms you to fail.”  The other alternative is to transform necessary meetings into genuine human gatherings. In the delightfully titled Meet Is Murder, Virginia Hefferman outlines “Holacratic” meetings, which leaders like Tony Hsieh, C.E.O. of Zappos, and Evan Williams, co-founder of Twitter and Medium.com, have embraced:  "Each Circle holds a weekly or biweekly 'tactical meeting' for progress updates and a biweekly or monthly ‘governance meeting.’ A governance meeting starts with a Check-In, or rather (according to Holacracy literature) ‘a space for every participant to call out any distraction and get present for the meeting.'" Intentionally limiting oversight can sound scary. But that’s why easing into it with less meetings or your own adaptation of the Holacratic system works so well.  Agility and the people ‘closest to the problem’  Our final method comes from the unlikely worlds of car manufacturing and software development. “The agile methodology,” as Charles Duhigg explains in Smarter Faster Better, “emphasized collaboration, frequent testing, rapid iteration, and pushing decision making to whoever was closest to a problem.”  Essentially, agile leadership blends commitment — namely, collaboration and relational ties — with autonomy — flexibility and decentralized decision-making. Agile leaders entrust responsibility to their teams knowing that humans naturally reciprocate that trust with passionate, long-term commitment.  At the big-picture level, the applications of agile are everywhere (though rarely under that title). Words like self-management, trust, transparency, and personal responsibility appear over and over again in the annual lists of “best companies to work for.”  The quickest way to go agile, however, comes from the last phrase of Duhigg’s definition: “pushing decision making to whoever was closest to a problem.” This can be as small as budgetary discretion or it can be momentous: giving each person full control over halting production (a story Duhigg chronicles).  The rise of remote working makes agility even more crucial. According to Polycom’s recent study of 25,234 workers — The Changing World of Work: A Global Survey — “nearly two thirds of the global workforce take advantage of anywhere working.” That’s a 343 percent increase from 2012: 14 percent compared to 62. The more dispersed your people, the more hierarchical structures become productivity killing bottlenecks. Agile, in contrast, prioritizes tight cycles of feedback not with internal leadership, but with external users and customers. By giving teams direct access to real-world testing, whether they’re building an app or selling an stove, human-centered leaders empowered the people “closest to the problem” to act.  After all, in the words of Clinton Senkow, Co-Founder and COO at Influencive: “If you don't trust your employees to work from anywhere and solve problems on their own, you probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.”  Being a leader has never been more human  It’s true: leadership is hard. The temptation to rule with gold or gun is hard to resist.   But old-school methods no longer work. What does?   Going back to Carnegie, “There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. And that is by making the other person want to do it.”   As it turns out, the key word in that sentence is the same one that gives us so much grief: “person.” What the people in our lives want is to be treated like people: encouraged, free, and agile. That’s how you lead.  Aaron Orendorff is the founder of iconiContent and a regular contributor at Entrepreneur, Lifehacker, Fast Company, Business Insider and more.

Today new rumors are suggesting that Microsoft may not be looking to do much in the way of refinement in the Surface Pro 5, instead playing it safe and sticking with what works. Specifically, those rumors come from Paul Thurott by way of a single Twitter post. 140 characters don’t give us a whole lot to work with, but Thurott drops two important details in his tweet. The first is that Microsoft will stick with the Surface power connector in the Surface Pro 5, and that the tablet will use Intel Kaby Lake Processors. Thurott finishes his tweet by saying “nothing dramatic,” and indeed, Microsoft has good reason to avoid changing things up too much. Just yesterday, JD Power announced that Surface tablets had surpassed iPads in customer satisfaction for the first time ever, which is a huge win for Microsoft. The Surface clearly does something right from a consumer satisfaction standpoint, so Microsoft probably just wants to play it safe with the release of the Surface Pro 5. Though it would be nice to see the Surface Pro 5 use USB-C, the Surface connector that it currently uses still has its benefits. After all, it is a magnetic connection, which is always nice to have despite the fact that it’s proprietary. We’ll just have to sit back and see what Microsoft announces when it gets around to actually revealing the Surface Pro 5. As always, take this with a grain of salt, because even if this is what Microsoft is planning right now, the composition of the Surface Pro 5 could very well change by the time we get to release.

The knockout punch may come if he follows through on threats of protectionism. From a possible border tax to higher tariffs, America's push to reset trade relations is putting Vietnam's small economy at risk. Phu Tai, based in a central province, relies on the U.S. for 40 percent of sales, and some business may evaporate if its dining-room sets and outdoor chairs become too expensive. "If protectionism rises in the U.S., it will hurt countries like Vietnam that rely on exports," said Nguyen Sy Hoe, the company's deputy general director. "The government needs to help companies." Vietnam sells a fifth of its exports to the U.S., making it one of the few Asian nations counting America as a bigger market for their goods than China. Yet Vietnam's $32 billion trade surplus with the U.S. puts it in the crosshairs of the White House after Trump ordered a study to identify any "trade abuse" fueling American deficits. Trump also professed support for a border adjustment tariff to encourage production of goods in the U.S. and reduce incentives for companies to move overseas. Higher taxes on U.S. importers would reduce Vietnam's gross domestic product by almost 0.9 percent, the most negative effect on any Asian country, Credit Suisse Group economists Santitarn Sathirathai and Michael Wan said in a January report. "If the U.S. creates a new wave of protectionism, Vietnam will be very vulnerable," said Alexander Vuving, a Vietnam political analyst at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. The U.S. will investigate countries running the biggest bilateral trade deficits to assess the extent they're caused by "cheating or inappropriate behavior," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said. That tone is triggering alarm in Hanoi. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told his cabinet that U.S. protectionist policies could hurt the economy and lead to a slowdown in exports and foreign investment. The rhetoric comes at an inopportune time for a nation where foreign technology titans Samsung Electronics, Intel Corp. and LG Display have set up shop. Companies relocated factories to Vietnam from China in recent years because of the latter's rising costs and shrinking labor force. Since introducing market-oriented "doi moi" changes in the 1980s, Vietnam has increasingly tethered itself to global trade, helping transform an agrarian economy into a manufacturing hub of everything from shoes to smartphones. Exports surged to a record $177 billion last year, with U.S. customers accounting for about $42 billion of that -- more than double compared to five years ago. Mobile phones and parts make up the biggest segment at about 27 percent. The most-recent GDP figures show how trade-dependent Vietnam has become. Samsung's decision to scrap production of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last year spurred an 11 percent decline in shipments of phones and parts during the first quarter, the national statistics office said. That played a role in curbing growth of gross domestic product to just 5.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with the 6.25 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Phuc called the slower rate "very worrisome" and asked ministries to find "suitable solutions," according to an April 3 posting on the government's website. The government is targeting 6.7 percent growth this year. Just the threat of American trade barriers is denting exports for some homegrown manufacturers. Thanh Hoa-based Delta Sport Joint-Stock Co. saw a 20 percent drop in U.S. orders for its sportswear during the first quarter, Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Trong Thau said. Last year, shipments to the U.S. represented about 40 percent of its exports, or the equivalent of $30 million in revenue. Customers include Wal-Mart Stores and Mizuno Corp., according to its website. "Some of our American retailer clients are concerned about some uncertainty in the policies of the new administration," Thau said. "We're a bit worried about the outlook of our exports to the U.S." The Trans-Pacific Partnership would have benefited Vietnam by reducing or, in some cases, eliminating U.S. import tariffs. Without U.S. participation, Vietnam is pivoting toward Plan B. Government officials vowed to push through structural changes to the economy required under the deal, including reforming state-owned enterprises and strengthening enforcement of intellectual-property protections. They're also pushing sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing to improve efficiency and product quality. The science and technology ministry recently organized a business trip to the U.S. for Vietnamese companies to meet prospective clients, and the government is helping market their goods. "In the current environment, it's crucial for us to improve our competitiveness," said Tran Viet Thanh, the deputy minister of science and technologies. Hanoi may explore ways to keep TPP alive even without U.S. participation, said Michael Michalak, regional managing director of the U.S.-Asean Business Council and former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. One alternative would be bilateral or small-group deals with neighbors or Latin American countries on the basis of the earlier negotiations, he said. "I don't think they want to see those six years go to waste," he said. "There are opportunities there to build on." That's what furniture supplier Phu Tai is trying to do. It's spending about 140 billion dong ($6.2 million) to build a factory in coastal Binh Dinh province to boost capacity and cut out the middlemen it uses for Wal-Mart, Hoe said. Shares rose the most in a week Friday. "That will help us save a lot more in costs," he said. "We must be more competitive to cope with what protectionism may bring about." ---  Bloomberg's David Roman contributed.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 7, 2017 3:51 pm UTC Enlarge / The Surface Pro 4 with its kickstand out. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 92 Share this story The Surface Pro 4 was released about a year-and-a-half ago, and even though new processors are available, it didn't make an appearance along with the Surface Studio and other hardware updates in October of 2016. Longtime Microsoft pundit Paul Thurrott has some news about the Surface Pro 5, an update he says will change "nothing dramatic" about the convertible. According to Thurrott, the Surface Pro 5 will keep its proprietary Surface Connect power connector instead of switching to USB-C charging, though it's worth noting that there are already computers out there that include a proprietary power jack and support for USB-C charging if you have an adapter. He also says that the tablet will use new Kaby Lake processors from Intel, though this isn't much of a surprise. Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic. — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 Further ReadingMicrosoft set to kill off Lumia devices in favor of rumored Surface PhoneThurrott has no news to share on the tablet's design, ports, or release date. Rumors have suggested that Microsoft is planning some sort of hardware event for the spring, but a minor Surface Pro bump may not be able to carry an event like this on its own. ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley says a Surface Book 2 isn't in the cards (though the "Performance Base" that was released a few months ago serves as a midstream refresh of sorts); the Lumia phone lineup has been discontinued, ostensibly in favor of a "Surface Phone" that may never see the light of day; the Surface Studio is still fresh; and the Microsoft Band has been canceled altogether. When releasing accessories for the Surface Pro 3, including the Type Cover, its docking station, and its Ethernet adapter, Microsoft promised that the accessories would also maintain compatibility with whatever the next-generation Surface Pro was (and, as a side benefit, many Surface Pro 4 accessories also work with Surface Pro 3). If the Surface Pro 5 is truly just a minor speed bump for the existing design, it could be compatible with accessories for both.   Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

Former Compiz Developer: Free Software Desktop Might Enter A Dark Age Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 7 April 2017 at 10:05 AM EDT. 47 Comments With the big shake-up this week at Canonical resulting in abandoning Unity and switching back to GNOME, former Compiz developer and Canonical employee Sam Spilsbury has shared a retrospective on his years of working on Compiz and Unity for Ubuntu. Sam's lengthy blog post covers the ups and downs from his involvement with Ubuntu and specifically working on Compiz/Unity. He wrote at length about the early successes with the desktop, the many fun moments, as well as the low moments of his time at Canonical. While he was initially very excited for Unity 8 and the convergence dream, he mentions that from his outside view over the past year Unity 8 began looking like "Compiz++ on a larger scale." With the repeated delays of Unity 8, he had long been wondering whether it would ever ship. So the announcements this week didn't come as much of a surprise to him. As far as where he thinks Ubuntu or the desktop is heading in the future: Free software on the desktop might enter a dark age soon. There aren’t very many companies in this space now. Intel was out as of halfway through last year. Google is focused on Android and Chrome OS. Novell and Sun folded a long time ago. Nokia fell off a burning platform. IBM is nowhere to be found. And now Canonical is pivoting away too. Samsung’s Tizen is potentially an interesting player, but everyone knows its a plan B. Red Hat remains and so does Endless. An of course there is still Collabora, Codethink, Igalia and other free software contracting firms, though their existence arguably depends on the larger players. But he is not all pessimistic about the future, but acknowledges the potential of the community. Sam ended with, "Lets not forget where the desktop free software revolution came from. It came from ordinary people, you and I, who wanted to make a difference. It came from people who didn’t want to accept the Microsoft and Apple duopoly on computing. Even if the resources start to dry up now, it doesn’t mean that free software is gone forever. Some of the best innovations came during the post-bubble period of 2000-2010 where the software world had become stagnant with Windows XP and IE6. There will always be people who want to do something different. A community will form again. And once everyone has a clearer head, free software will rise again." Sam Spilsbury had been employed by Canonical from 2010 to the end of 2012. Currently he is serving as a software engineer for Endless Computer.

Luckily, the first bit of information has surfaced detailing the next-generation Surface Pro. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will apparently have the proprietary Surface power connector. In terms of overall design, the tablet hybrid has “nothing dramatic” in store, according to renowned tech journalist Paul Thurrott. What’s significant about the Surface Pro 5 is that Microsoft will be be putting Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. With all that in mind, the next-generation tablet hybrid seems to be more of a refresh with upgraded internals, rather than a full-blown redesign. Although the news that the Surface power connector is here to stay for the Pro 5, this doesn’t guarantee that Microsoft won’t be switching the DisplayPort with the universal USB-C, as pointed out by The Verge. It’s understandable that Microsoft wants to keep its proprietary hardware features locked into its newer devices, so that those with older accessories can keep using it. Microsoft did the same thing with the Surface Pro 4 by having all of the Pro 3’s accessories like Type Covers and power adapters being compatible with the successor. However, it would really be highly unlikely that the company would completely skip using USB-C considering many high-end laptops and smartphones are already adopting the technology, according to Neowin. Microsoft is going to hold a special Surface event in the coming weeks where the Surface Pro 5 is expected to make its debut, according to ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley. Unfortunately, Foley’s sources have suggested that the Surface Book 2 won’t be revealed at the event. This has led to speculations that the Surface Book 2 might have been delayed by Microsoft. Previous rumors have indicated that the Surface Book 2 will feature a more traditional “clamshell” laptop design, rather than being a convertible laptop. Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 might simply be a refresh of its predecessor.

But who's packing a spare server in case the main machine goes down? That'd be the proud owner of Eurocom's PX7 Pro SE mobile server, the latest iteration of the company's line of laptops that claim to offer server-grade hardware in a portable platform. Now, Eurocom has loftier ambitions for the PX7 Pro SE than the neighborhood Quake III Arena meetup, as evidenced by the rather serious hardware housed inside the machine's unassuming chassis. The PX7 Pro SE is powered by Intel's Xeon E3-1505M v5 processor, a four-core, eight-thread Skylake CPU with a 45W TDP. Seeing as this machine is meant for server duties, Eurocom pairs up the processor with up to 64GB of ECC DDR4 memory. For graphics muscle, buyers can pick between four of Nvidia's Quadro graphics cards, up to and including the Quadro 5500M. The PX7 Pro SE is a bit larger than the last mobile server we saw from Eurocom. With a 17.3" FHD IPS display in a 17.1" x 11.8" x 1.9" (43 cm x 30 cm x 4.8 cm) chassis, this isn't a thin little notebook by any means. Its 8.4-lb (3.8 kg) frame provides lots of space for storage devices, though. The PX7 Pro SE has four M.2 slots (two of them compatible with the NVMe protocol), and two 9.5-mm 2.5" drive bays. Users shouldn't expect the larger laptop to have a proportionately longer battery life, though, as Eurocom indicates that the machine's 7500mAh battery only provides about one and a half hours of runtime away from a wall socket. Eurocom outfitted the PX7 Pro SE with a single on-board Killer Gigabit Ethernet controller. Users will also find six USB 3.0 ports, a Thunderbolt 3 connector, and a DisplayPort 1.2 output. The machines support a variety of operating systems, including Microsoft's Server 2012R2, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1. At press time, the PX7 Pro SE hadn't yet appeared on the company's storefront for customization and ordering. Similar units from Eurocom have had starting prices around $2000, however, so it's probably safe to assume that the PX7 Pro SE will have a similar price tag.

You are here: Blog Share 7 April, 2017 All the digital news stories you missed this week By Ben Davis @ Econsultancy 0 comments This week's digital news has been full of interesting developments, from how Uber uses psychological tricks to motivate its drivers, to Google's new AI chips and a robot that makes perfect salads. Trump and his administration get a mention, too, of course. Uber users psychology to make drivers work harder The New York Times has revealed how Uber uses psychological tricks to get drivers to work harder and longer. Video game techniques, graphics, and non-cash rewards are used to push drivers further. Examples include local managers adopting female personas over text message to give them a better chance of persuading the predominantly male workforce to take more work. Uber has even aped Netflix's feature that automatically loads the next episode, but for loading the next fare opportunity even before the current one has ended. Exploiting drivers' tendency to set earnings goals, Uber also alerts drivers to a nearly-achieved target when they try to log off. Do check out the NYT article, it's fantastic, and includes some simulations you can play with to investigate some of the dynamics involved. Image from Uber driver's app, via NYT. Google's new AI chips have implications for data centres and the market Google has published a paper about the performance of its new chip, designed to run AI (pre-trained neural networks). The Tensor Processing Unit works 15 to 30 times faster than regular GPUs and CPUs and Wired suggests the chip may mean Google can avoid building entire new data centers. As Wired notes, Google's inhouse creation of a chip has shifted the market somewhat: "Google going in-house even for specialized tasks has wide implications; like Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, it’s among the biggest chip buyers on Earth. Meanwhile the big chip makers—including, most notably, Intel—are building a new breed of processor in an effort to move the market back in their direction." Twitter gets rid of eggs synonymous with trolls Most people have seen an egg dishing out abuse on Twitter once in a while. No longer, as eggs have been replaced with gender neutral silhouettes that Twitter hopes will "prompt self expression" (i.e. put some humanity into the avatar and change behaviours). More from The Guardian @design Evil has a new face. pic.twitter.com/09P5YohkvO — Alex Magdaleno (@amagzz) March 31, 2017 Net neutrality advocates protest against Republican lawmakers U.S. Congress has invalidated a set of internet privacy rules brought in under the Obama administration. Uproar amongst opponents ensued as the change will allow internet providers to collect and sell customers’ information without their permission. Among the most colourful responses was that of the creator of Cards Against Humanity, who said he'd make use of the change to purchase and publish the browsing histories of Republican lawmakers. Bloomberg points out that "the change won’t immediately create a shadowy new market for online voyeurism, but it does serve as a preview for a much bigger policy fight likely to unfold over the next several months." More contentious debates are still to come. Morgan Stanley in Snap equity controversy Business Insider reports that Morgan Stanley, which led Snap's IPO, made a mistake in a recent equity research note it published, overstating forecasted earnings by $5bn over five years. The significance is that Morgan Stanley recognised the mistake but did not revisit the $28 price target it put on the stock. That means Wall Street raising is casting a keener and more sceptical eye over equity research more broadly. Sally the robot will make you a perfect salad Chowbotics Inc (!) has created Sally, a 350lb machine that according to Bloomberg "uses 21 different ingredients—including romaine, kale, seared chicken breast, Parmesan, California walnuts, cherry tomatoes, and Kalamata olives—to craft more than a thousand types of salad in about 60 seconds." The company sees Sally as the future of food serving in industrial settings, and will be available from Q3 at a price of $30,000. Berners-Lee wins 'Nobel' Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web in 1989, has been awarded the ACM Turing Prise, thought of as the Nobel of computer science. Read his recent interview with MIT Tech Review Amazon buys the rights for next fall's Thursday night NFL games In 2016, Twitter was the first Thursday night livestream partner with the NFL, showing 10 games. Amazon has bought the livestream rights for next fall's set of 10 games for about $50m (Twitter paid $10m last year). Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were reportedly interested, too. Like the Twitter agreement, Amazon livestreams CBS and NBC coverage, complete with ads, with Amazon able to sell a number of additional ad slots, though it may promote its own offerings.

But pure specifications might not be good enough for Microsoft - and if you're interested in the muscle power of the system, then you could consider getting a PC that rivals - or flat out beats - the Xbox Scorpio's purported performance. It isn't cheap; if you want the 4K resolution at 60fps that Microsoft is promising, then you'll have to spend significantly more money on a gaming PC than the upcoming console, but it'll be yours without any wait. The Best Value for Money Gaming PC You Can Build in India Admittedly, there are still more than a few unknowns here, such as the degree to which Microsoft will tweak games to make them run better on Xbox Scorpio. What’s crucial though, is that the company is gunning for gaming at 4K resolution with 60fps as standard. Microsoft hasn’t commented on how much it will cost except, for hinting that it will be more expensive than the PS4 Pro and made for the ‘premium consumer’. Rumours peg that at $500 - the Xbox One S is $349.99, while the Xbox One 1TB is priced at $399.99 (both are heavily discounted online), so this isn't an unreasonable guess. Keeping all of this in mind, we’ve configured what could be a better, more flexible option for the gamer who doesn’t mind spending more for a better experience. Xbox Scorpio Price to Be More than PS4 Pro: Report All prices below were accurate at the time of writing and may be subject to local variations and changes over time. However, it is safe to say that anyone can build the same or a similar machine and will be able to play the latest and greatest in gaming, as well as VR, with power to spare. And yes, all of these components are available online as well, but expect to pay a premium versus your local computer store, particularly when it comes to video cards. If a specific part is available cheaper offline, we've listed the lower cost indicating that it's the street price. Chances are if you've owned a desktop PC you probably already have a decent enough monitor, keyboard, mouse, and OS license. For the most part, your own comfort should be your deciding factor for these components, which essentially means you should go with your personal preferences and we've not included them in this list. Plus, you're plugging your console into the TV, so it wouldn't be fair to add the price of a 4K monitor to this cart. Here's all the rest that you need to put together. CPU: Intel i7 - 7700K ‘Kaby Lake’ Price: Rs. 29,999 The Core i7-7700K ‘Kaby Lake’ processor has a base speed of 4.2GHz with a maximum boost speed of 4.5GHz. It also has an unlocked multiplier for overclockers to tinker with as the ‘K’ suffix indicates, meaning that you can, if you so choose, go beyond the 4.5GHz for even higher performance in the most demanding games, particularly at 4K resolution. You could go with the AMD Ryzen R7 1800X ‘Zen’ CPU and a corresponding motherboard but in our detailed review we found that it’s not as good a deal versus what Intel offers at the moment, if what you want is pure gaming performance. Motherboard: Asus Maximus IX Hero Price: Rs. 24,500 The Asus Maximus IX Hero is a Z270-based enthusiast motherboard aimed squarely at overclockers, but there's plenty of appeal even for less adventurous enthusiasts. The layout is completely standard, with generous amounts of room around the CPU cooler. There are a host of features that make tinkering with this beast a treat. From power and monitoring terminals for water pumps and high-powered fans to a debugging mode if you’re the sort to use liquid Nitrogen. Plus, Asus’ numeric Q-code diagnostic readout helps you figure out boot-related concerns, if any. All of this makes it a solid partner to the i7-7700K processor. Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x8GB DDR4 DRAM 3600MHz C18 Memory Kit Price: Rs. 23,298 (for 2x8GB) Despite Kaby Lake processors officially offering support for upto 2400MHz DDR4 RAMfrequencies, Corsair’s 3600MHz kit was a no-brainer. At the moment, gains per rupee are less dramatic with speeds above 3200MHz in intensive tasks like gaming and video rendering, but a PC like this should ideally outlast an Xbox Scorpio, so any bit of future-proofing is a welcome expense. You may need to tweak voltages to ensure it is running at high speed though. Storage: Samsung 960 Pro Series - 512GB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6P512BW) Price: Rs. 33,900 At the moment, all we know is that Xbox Scorpio has a 1TB hard drive. There has been no mention of whether there’s also a solid state drive or at least an option for one though Eurogamer - which revealed the Xbox Scorpio specs suggests it will be a regular mechanical hard drive (perhaps a hybrid drive akin to what we've seen with the Xbox One Elite console?). Either way, it would be prudent to stick in a fast, reliable solid state drive available, and our choice is the Samsung 960 Pro M.2. The 512GB variant seems to be the only one currently in stock, but grab the 1TB version if you can find it. Couple this with a 2TB mechanical drive, the Seagate Barracuda 2TB SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-inch hard drive, priced at Rs. 5,920 and you should have plenty of space for Steam, GOG, Origin and any other PC games client you use. Video card: Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition 11GB Graphics Card Price: Rs. 71,999 The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is more than enough for pushing 4K at 60fps in most current games, and that carries over to high-refresh-rate monitors at lower resolutions and even VR headsets. While the Founders Edition variant is the only one we see in stock at the moment, custom versions from the likes of Asus with its Strix line or Gigabyte with its Aorus models should be available at your local PC store if not online very soon.   SMPS: Seasonic SS-850KM3 X-Series 850W Modular Power Supply with 80+ Gold Certification Price: Rs. 13,800 To power all of this, you’ll need a reliable SMPS. In our experience Seasonic is pretty solid. The X-Series 850W sports a modular design, heavy duty capacitors, and a high performance Sanyo-Denki San Ace Silent Fan for quiet operation. Cabinet: NZXT Noctis 450 Price: Rs. 12,700 The NZXT Noctis 450 has great build quality, a welcome amount of ventilation, dust filters, and more than enough space for expansion. Though you could also opt for the older, more boxy NZXT H440, the armoured design of the Noctis 450 gives it a fresh look. How much will this set me back, and how long will it last? The configuration we’ve outlined here costs Rs. 2,10,196. As we mentioned previously, you could get it for less if you buy offline or substitute components. But if you’re looking for a no holds barred experience of gaming at 4K resolution with 60 frames per second, look no further. It has enough raw power to exceed the performance expected from the Xbox Scorpio, and last year’s PS4 Pro, all while being future-proof enough to handle anything else thrown at it in 2017 and beyond. Given that a five year old machine with minor upgrades is able to play the latest and greatest without breaking a sweat, this gaming rig should easily outlast Microsoft’s Xbox Scorpio. On the other hand, it's definitely a lot more expensive than whatever the price of the Scorpio will ultimately be. If the rumour mill is right, you could get four consoles for the price of this hardware - but that involves a long wait, uncertain pricing, a (comparatively) limited catalogue, and a shorter life-cycle. It's not a clear-cut decision, but this is definitely the premium gaming experience.

Vulkan 1.0.42's VK_KHR_push_descriptor Now Supported In RADV Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 7 April 2017 at 08:51 AM EDT. 3 Comments The open-source Radeon Vulkan driver "RADV" has picked up support for another one of the extensions that debuted in v1.0.42 back at GDC. At the end of February was Vulkan 1.0.42 as a fairly big update timed for the Game Developers' Conference. VK_KHR_push_descriptor was added as a way to allow descriptors to be written into command buffers. Intel's ANV driver was quick with supporting this extension while the latest Mesa Git now has support for it too. So from Mesa master is now KHR_push_descriptor support. At the same time, VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template was added. That related extension provides an easy means of updating a fixed set of descriptors, also added in Vulkan 1.0.42. The Mesa 17.1 branching is set to happen one week from today so we'll see what other Mesa improvements get merged over the days ahead. Mesa 17.1 will be formally released in May. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Things have moved on a bit since then, and both devices are now facing greater competition from more rivals with newer features. Both Surface devices still seem to be selling well, though, no doubt aided by Microsoft's near-constant barrage of deals and discounts. Nonetheless, many are eager to know what Microsoft has in store for the next-generation of its popular devices, and a couple of tidbits have now emerged about the company's plans for its new tablet. Paul Thurrott revealed that Microsoft will not be replacing the proprietary Surface power connector on the new Surface Pro 5. He also said that there's "nothing dramatic" about the new device, compared with its predecessor, but he's heard that, as expected, the Pro 5 will feature Intel's latest seventh-generation 'Kaby Lake' Intel Core processors. The Surface Pro 4 - like the Book - uses Intel's last-gen Skylake chips. Those hoping for a substantial redesign for the Pro 5 may well be disappointed, as it sounds like Microsoft is keen to maintain compatibility of its existing Pro 3 and Pro 4 accessories - such as its desktop docking station, and Type Cover keyboards - with the new model. But the new tablet is likely to include other new features too, including USB Type-C ports, which are becoming more widely available on higher- and lower-end devices. We shouldn't have to wait too much longer to find out more about the new Surface tablet. Microsoft is expected to hold a Surface hardware event in the next few weeks at which the Pro 5 seems likely to make an appearance - but the Surface Book 2 isn't expected to make its debut there. Last week, the company opened pre-orders for its more powerful Surface Book with Performance Base in thirteen markets, so it may be a while before it's ready to announce an all-new model.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumors Tip Kaby Lake CPU Posted: Apr 7 2017, 6:27am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Technology News     Surface Pro 5 update is expected to be a mild one The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablets have proven to be very popular with buyers of all sorts. A new rumor has surfaced with some of the first details of what we can expect to come from the Microsoft Surface 5 tablet. The new rumors claim that the Surface Pro 5 will have the same proprietary surface power connector that is common on tablets today. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Surface Pro 5 is tipped to move to the more power efficient Intel Kaby Lake processors. If you're hoping for a massive change to the tablet, word is that there is nothign too big in store for the update. The tablet is expected to be a mild refresh with new components. Microsoft has previously decreed that Surface Pro 3 power adapters, docks, and Type Covers would work with Surface Pro 4 tablets and we would assume that the Surface Pro 5 will continue this trend. Keeping that Surface power adapter doesn't mean that there will be no USB-C port on the new Surface Pro 5. With most competitors including at least one USB-C on their high-end devices, Microsoft is expected to follow suit. It's unclear exactly how long we will have to wait to hear something official on the Surface Pro 5 tablets. Microsoft is expected to have a Surface event in the coming weeks. Presumably the Surface Pro 5 will be unveiled at this event. Previous reports have claimed that there will be no Surface Book 2 at the event, this is the high-end laptop that Microsoft sells to fight the MacBook Pro. Some speculation suggests that the event might include the unveiling of the long anticipated Surface Phone. Recently we talked about some rumors of that Surface Phone, including Quad HD resolution. Microsoft has an official domain for the devices as well. Surface Phone specs are expected to include a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen, Snapdragon 835 SoC, 128GB of storage, and 4GB of RAM. A memory card slot is expected to expand storage as needed. The rumor does suggest that an Intel chip might be used instead of that Snapdragon part. This story may contain affiliate links.

Chromebooks have been around since 2011 when Acer and Samsung released their first attempts at the online-only laptops, preceded only by Google's experimental Cr-48. Since then we've had many more models released with the pinnacle of the design being the Google Pixel. But something we've never had is a Chromebook running on AMD. Every Chromebook released so far is either Intel or ARM powered. However, that now looks likely to change as there's strong hints an AMD-powered Chromebook is set to appear. The source of this hint is a Coreboot code review. Coreboot is an open source software project that replaces the proprietary firmware (BIOS/UEFI) found in most computers. Coreboot is run on all Chromebooks offered for sale today. As highlighted by Phoronix, the code review includes reference to "Kahlee," which was discovered earlier this month by Chrome Unboxed as an AMD board running the Stoney Ridge chipset. Stoney Ridge uses AMD's Excavator microarchitecture running either a two or four core 28nm processor and 3rd-generation Graphics Core Next Radeon GPU. Related Every New Chromebook Will Run Android Apps Every New Chromebook Will Run Android Apps The expected Chromebook includes two M.2 slots. As this is a Chromebook it is safe to say both will probably be populated, one with a wireless card and the other with a small SSD. So we should expect an AMD-powered Chromebook at some point this year, we just don't know exactly when. Will it be a premium Chromebook? That seems unlikely. You may remember last month Google discontinued the Pixel laptops running Chrome OS. They cost at least $999 and up, and clearly the market was limited.

Paul Thurrott has now revealed that the Surface Pro 5 will not change the proprietary Surface power connector, and that Microsoft’s next laptop / tablet hybrid will switch to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Thurrott claims there’s “nothing dramatic” about the Surface Pro 5, which could mean the device is simply a refreshed design with upgraded components. Retaining the Surface power connector doesn’t necessarily mean that Microsoft won’t opt to switch its DisplayPort on the Surface Pro 5 to a USB-C connection. Microsoft previously committed to ensuring that Surface Pro 3 power adapters, docking stations, and Type Covers would be compatible with the Surface Pro 4, so it’s not surprising to hear the company is likely keeping its Surface power connector. A lack of USB-C at all would be a surprising omission given that the majority of Windows PC makers are moving to the new port on high-end laptops. Thurrott provides no other details on the Surface Pro 5, but we might not have long to wait until an official announcement is due.

 10 things you need to know in markets today Will Martin Apr. 7, 2017, 1:48 AM 778 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will speak at an event in London later on Friday morning REUTERS/Kirsty Wigglesworth/Pool Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Friday. The United States launched a salvo of 59 cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield and nearby military infrastructure controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in response to a chemical attack that killed at least 80 people in the northwestern part of the country on Monday. US President Donald Trump, initially resistant to the idea of becoming involved in Syria, said it was in the vital national security interest of the US to prevent the use of chemical weapons. US stock futures and 10-year treasury yields have fell sharply in reaction to the news that the United States launched over 50 Tomahawk missiles from warships stationed in the Mediterranean targeting a Syrian airfield. The yield on 10-year government bonds fell below 2.3%, leaving it sitting at the lowest level since November last year. Two men are facing charges for alleged insider trading ahead of Intel's $15 billion Mobileye acquisition.   The SEC on Thursday said it won a court order freezing assets of Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul, both of Richmond, after they generated more than $925,000 of gains on Mobileye shares and call options purchased in the month-and-a-half before the March 13 merger was announced. The stream of U.S. energy companies going public at the start of 2017 has dried up on concerns over the future direction of oil prices. Texas-based FTS International and Select Energy Services are among six U.S. energy companies that filed for listings in the first quarter but delayed, even after receiving the green light from local regulators, Thomson Reuters data showed. Cloud security and identity management software developer Okta has priced its upcoming IPO. The firm will aim to sell11.0 million shares priced at $17.00 per share, raising $187 million in an IPO for a market value of $1.5 billion Larry Fink, the chief executive at BlackRock , which with $5.1 trillion is the world's largest investor, thinks US stocks are overvalued.  "We don't have the tax reform that we're expecting," Fink told CNBC. "If we don't see a true deregulation, I think the markets would have some setbacks there." Twitter shares slid following a report that cofounder and board member Evan Williams plans to sell up to 30% of his shares .  "After a year and a half of no selling, I have filed a new 10b5–1 plan to liquidate a minority of my TWTR over the next year," Williams wrote  in a blog post on Medium after Business Insider inquired about the sale . Initial jobless claims in the USA, which count the number of people who applied for unemployment insurance for the first time in the past week, fell by 25,000 to 234,000. The four-week moving average was 250,000, a decrease of 4,500 from the previous week's revised number. The Czech central bank lifted its koruna cap on Thursday, after which the currency oscillated wildly before gaining ground. "The Bank has said little so far, other than that interest rates have been left unchanged and that it stands ready to intervene in the FX market if needed to prevent excessive currency moves," William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote. Music streaming service Spotify is planning to go public this year, but a new report from The Wall Street Journal says the company isn't planning a traditional IPO. Instead, The Wall Street Journal reports that Spotify is planning a direct listing in September which wouldn't involve raising any new money. A normal IPO involves a company issuing shares of stock. But The Wall Street Journal reports that Spotify will instead simply register its shares on a public market.

Skip to main content Earn National Recognition for Your School! DA Home Honorees Apply You are here Home Schools of TechXcellence DA’s Schools of TechXcellence Awards, sponsored by HP and Intel, recognizes schools that have implemented innovative, effective and replicable technology programs that contribute meaningfully to student or operational success. There are two cycles of awards during each calendar year, and within each cycle there are two award categories. The categories for the second award cycle are professional development and reading and writing instruction. Submission Requirements: Your program must rely on an implementation of devices that run on Intel® processors. Your program must be innovative. In other words, it must include elements that were developed internally. Your program can include commercial products, but a program that simply implements a commercial product and gets the expected result will not be considered by the judges. Your program must be effective. It must have been implemented to meet specific goals, and you must be able to demonstrate that it is meeting those goals. Your program must be replicable. In other words, its value to other schools must be readily apparent, and it could be implemented elsewhere with reasonable resources. Schools may submit one application in each award cycle category. In cases where we receive multiple submissions in a category from a school, only the earliest nomination will be considered. Your application must be submitted with the approval of your superintendent.

In fact, the CreditEase Wealth Management-HUJ partnership has lasted for years and it has expanded channels and created opportunities for non-governmental investors and mutual exchanges. "Such a partnership is very important to both parties," said Zvi Wiener, the school's dean. "Today is neither the first nor the last step (of our cooperation), but definitely the most critical one." Also in attendance were 20 students who joined the fourth Israel trip of CreditEase Wealth Management Institute. During the eight-day program, the group listened to lectures on innovation, visited startups and experienced the local culture. Thanks to HUJ's efforts, the students also met with Robert Aumann - a 2005 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, a former intelligence officer from Mossad, a high-ranking female officer from Israeli Intelligence Corps (Unit 8200), and Saul Singer - author of the Start-Up Nation. They also had a closer look at Mobileye, a smart driver assistance system startup recently acquired by Intel for USD15.3bn. Although more and more Chinese institutions are running similar projects in Israel, the CreditEase Wealth Management's program still stands out with high market recognition, built on the company's deep understanding about the country as well as its strategic partnership with the Hebrew University, said Zhou Yuan, Managing Director of CreditEase Wealth Management who participated in CreditEase Wealth Management's initial investigation on the program.  "Every trip that I've made to Israel has been eye-opening," said Zhou at the ceremony. About CreditEase Wealth Management The wealth management arm of CreditEase focuses on comprehensive global asset allocation services for high-net-worth individuals and mass affluent investors, offering a wide range of services and products available in multiple currencies for onshore and offshore investments in the areas of fixed income, private equity, capital markets, hedge funds, real estate, insurance, as well as investment immigration and international education. CreditEase Wealth Management is committed to providing high-quality products and services in line with customer needs and expectations, as well as formulating comprehensive plans for wealth preservation and growth. On December 14, 2016, CreditEase Wealth Management was named winner of the "Best Non-Bank Private Wealth Product" by The Asian Banker, a Singapore-based leading provider of strategic intelligence on the financial services industry.

In fact, the CreditEase Wealth Management-HUJ partnership has lasted for years and it has expanded channels and created opportunities for non-governmental investors and mutual exchanges. "Such a partnership is very important to both parties," said Zvi Wiener, the school's dean. "Today is neither the first nor the last step (of our cooperation), but definitely the most critical one." Also in attendance were 20 students who joined the fourth Israel trip of CreditEase Wealth Management Institute. During the eight-day program, the group listened to lectures on innovation, visited startups and experienced the local culture. Thanks to HUJ's efforts, the students also met with Robert Aumann - a 2005 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, a former intelligence officer from Mossad, a high-ranking female officer from Israeli Intelligence Corps (Unit 8200), and Saul Singer - author of the Start-Up Nation. They also had a closer look at Mobileye, a smart driver assistance system startup recently acquired by Intel for USD15.3bn. Although more and more Chinese institutions are running similar projects in Israel, the CreditEase Wealth Management's program still stands out with high market recognition, built on the company's deep understanding about the country as well as its strategic partnership with the Hebrew University, said Zhou Yuan, Managing Director of CreditEase Wealth Management who participated in CreditEase Wealth Management's initial investigation on the program.  "Every trip that I've made to Israel has been eye-opening," said Zhou at the ceremony.

They also reaffirmed their commitment to their pro users and revealed that they had a pro iMac in the works. Exactly what constitutes as pro iMac remains to be seen, but thanks to a report from Pike’s Universum (via MacRumors), the alleged specs of the iMac Pro (or whatever it will be called) have been revealed. If the specs are true, it seems that Apple will be going with Intel’s Xeon E3 processors for the iMac Pro. It will also come with 16GB of ECC RAM and can be configured to go up to 64GB. This is versus current consumer-grade iMacs which sport 8GB of non-ECC RAM by default, and can be configured to 32GB. It is also rumored to feature faster NVMe SSDs with storage up to 2TB, and it will feature the use of AMD graphics, so for those hoping that Apple would return to using NVIDIA’s GPU might be disappointed. Last but not least, the iMac Pros will use Thunderbolt 3 ports, which shouldn’t be surprising and should almost be a given. According to Pike’s Universum, these new iMacs will be revealed come late October alongside a brand new keyboard. Whether or not this new keyboard will sport a Touch Bar like the patents have hinted at remains to be seen, but until we get the official word, take it all with a grain of salt.

Roston - Apr 6, 2017 6 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you dream of owning a MacBook Air, now is as good a time as any to pick one up. While used and refurbished models are still the cheapest options, nothing beats buying new, and that makes Best Buy’s recent price cut a great incentive. The retailer recently slashed the 13-inch MacBook Air’s price down to $799 USD, and that’s for a new model with 8GB of memory and an Intel i5 processor. The ‘open box’ models are even cheaper. MacBook Air 13-inch Review (mid-2013) It wasn’t too long ago that Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro laptops, and there’s a lot to like about them: USB-C, the fancy new Touch Bar, and their powerful hardware options. Not everyone needs something as powerful as a MacBook Pro, though, and so there’s the alternative 12-inch MacBook, a likewise new (-ish) model with USB-C and a much thinner body. Not everyone likes the lack of ports, though, and the 12-inch MacBook is still pretty pricey, turning many people off. That’s where the MacBook Air comes in, offering the best of both worlds with its thin and light body, its increasingly classic design, and its larger array of ports, including an SD card slot and a couple of ordinary USB ports. Joining that is the crazy 12 or so hours of battery run time you’ll get on a charge, enough to get you an extra-long work day. There are some things to dislike about this 13-inch MacBook Air, of course. The lack of Retina is one of them, and the Intel i5 processor may not be appealing to certain users. For the ordinary person, though — for students, writers, photographers, academics, and more — this hardware is more than adequate enough for an everyday laptop. The notebook was priced at $999 USD, but as of now Best Buy has it listed for $799 USD, a $200 price drop.

Learn more about dataflow programming for rapid development and greater creativity.  Read on to learn about Deep Learning on Hadoop Big Data platforms. Big Data Deep Learning Options You've got tons of options for Deep Learning.  TensorFlow (C++, Python, Java). TensorFlow on Spark. MXNet. Deep Learning 4 J (Skymind) JVM. PyTorch. H2o Deep Water. Keras on top of TensorFlow and DL4J. Apache Singa. Recommendations Here are my personal recommendations and things that I think you should keep in mind. Install CPU version on CPU YARN nodes and install GPU version on GPU YARN nodes. Do training on GPU YARN Nodes where possible. Apply model on all nodes and trigger with Apache NiFi. Remember that what helps Hadoop and Spark will help TensorFlow. More RAM = more and faster cores = more nodes. Today, run either pure TensorFlow with Keras or TensorFlow on Spark. Later in the year, try YARN 3.0 Containerized TensorFlow. Consider Alluxio for in-memory optimization Download model zoos. Evaluate other Deep Learning frameworks like MXNet and PyTorch. MXNet Here are the details of MXNet and GitHub for running on YARN. Cloud-ready product developed by an experienced team (XGBoost) Has AWS, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Baidu, and Intel backing. An Apache project run distributed on YARN, and also runs on Raspberry PI and constrained devices. In my early tests, it was faster than Google's TensorFlow, but not Keras. Additionally, it doesn't have as much documentation, examples, or backing as TensorFlow. DL4J (Deep Learning 4 J) DL4J is Deep Learning 4 J for production workloads. It is Keras-compatible and has JVM strength. Support from a very knowledgeable team, has professional support, and is a Hortonworks partner. Publishing an awesome book (Deep Learning A Practioner’s Approach). TensorFlow on Spark and YARN It has the strength and testing of Yahoo! Engineering on a big platform. They have the tools, engineering, clusters, and experience to get this right. I will be evaluating this soon. For more info, see here and here.  TensorFlow on Hadoop HDFS files can be used as a distributed source for input producers for training, allowing one fast cluster to store these massive datasets and share them amongst your cluster. This requires setting a few environment variables: JAVA_HOME

Digital Trends Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) review On the road again? Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the ultimate traveler's laptop Share DT Recommended Product Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best laptop for traveling professionals. Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best laptop for traveling professionals. Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best laptop for traveling professionals. Highs Durable chassis Plenty of ports Attractive, yet anti-glare display Excellent processor and hard drive performance Class-leading battery life Lows Mediocre look and feel Very small touchpad More expensive than similar competitors DT Editors' Rating 7.0 DT Recommended Product Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) review By Matt Smith Posted on 04.07.17 Research Center: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) The PC’s shift from cutting-edge luxury to everyday device has brought with it a mundanity that becomes more entrenched with each year. Many of the best laptops no longer see significant revisions each year, as is still common with smartphones. In fact, some laptops go many years before they’re completely replaced. Apple’s MacBook Pro started that trend, but Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon was among the first Windows alternatives to follow it. First released in 2012, the Carbon has received yearly updates, but today’s model doesn’t look all that different from the first. The Carbon remains a thin and light laptop that stands out from competitors because of its 14-inch screen, and continues to try and out-maneuver alternatives by combing durability with one of the thinnest, lightest designs around. More: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon: Our first take You might expect a high-end Lenovo ThinkPad to be expensive…and you’d be right. Pricing starts at an intimidating $1,329, and that’s for a model with a Core i5 processor and 128GB SATA hard drive. Our more impressively configured model, with Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB PCI Express drive, rang up at $2,123. That’s a lot of scratch. Is it justified? An old design that stands the test of time Browse Google for images of the previous ThinkPad X1 Carbon, then look at the latest model. Notice the difference? No? We have a hard time spotting it as well. There are minor touches, like smaller display bezels and a thinner overall profile, but the two models are otherwise identical. The 2017 model even retains the same power button location and hinge design, despite tweaks to the chassis. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Yet the Carbon still looks modern. Is it exciting? No – but ThinkPads aren’t purchased for their looks. What’s important is the overall footprint and quality, and in these areas the Carbon continues to excel. Though it has a 14-inch display, it’s now similar in size to many 13-inch laptops. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch bar and HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 both shave less than a half-inch in width and depth. Dell’s XPS 13 is the only rival that shrinks itself to a size that’s meaningfully different from the Carbon. At .63 inches thick, the Carbon is also far from the thinnest laptop, but within range of its competitors. As its name suggest, the Carbon’s chassis makes some use of carbon fiber, paired with the magnesium alloy that’s common in many ThinkPad products. These materials are extremely durable, and provide a soft-touch texture that feels inviting and adds extra grip. Unfortunately, the material is more flexible than metal, so it doesn’t provide the illusion of rigidity you’ll find in an all-aluminum laptop like the MacBook Pro 13 or HP Spectre x360. This is not a durability problem, but it will turn off those who think a laptop this expensive must feel luxurious. That’s likely why Dell’s XPS 13, which also has a carbon fiber chassis, uses a metal outer shell. Plenty of ports Lenovo has modernized its port selection with two Thunderbolt 3 / USB Type-C ports, which can be used to charge the laptop. That’s a welcome change, as Lenovo has stuck with its own proprietary charging solution in recently reviewed systems. It obliterates the competition in Geekbench 4 multi-core. There are also two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one HDMI port, one micro-Ethernet port with adapter, a combined microphone/headphone jack, and a MicroSD card reader with Micro-SIM card slot. Overall, this arrangement makes the Carbon exceptionally easy to use for a thin-and-light laptop. Most of its competitors either rely entirely on new connection types, as does the MacBook Pro 13, or make a compromise that results in relatively few ports overall, as is true of the Dell XPS 13. Lenovo has an edge here. Good keyboard, tiny touchpad Keyboard quality is always a tricky subject with ThinkPads – not because they fail here, but because they’re good, and fans expect the best. The Carbon is always in a tough spot because its thin profile can lead to a cramped typing experience, but we noticed no issue with the 2017 model. Key travel is substantial, which leads to a pleasant flow when typing at a high rate. We did think the key action felt a touch vague as it bottomed out, but it wasn’t enough to bother us. Compared to alternatives, like the Dell XPS 13 or HP Spectre x360 and its EliteBook variant, the Carbon feels as if it has more key travel. It’s also more spacious in layout, because the 14-inch screen leads to larger overall dimensions. The new MacBook Pro 13 also feels spacious, but its poor key travel puts it far behind the Carbon in typing pleasure. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Keyboard backlighting is standard, though it offers just two brightness options. This is an area where Apple is still the leader, as it offers a wide range. There’s significant light leak from behind the Carbon’s key caps – more, in fact, than in any competitor in recent memory – and that can be distracting in dark environments. The Carbon’s touchpad is smaller than its competitors. As always, the Trackpointer can be blamed. This tiny red nub in the middle of the keyboard allows use of the mouse without moving away from a normal typing position, but it also must be paired with physical, discrete left/right mouse buttons above the touchpad, which cuts into its usable space. What you think of this arrangement depends on what you think of the Trackpointer. We enjoy it, and find its implementation on the Carbon satisfactory. Users who prefer the touchpad will find it cramped. The Carbon supports Windows Precision Touchpad standards, at least, so it can handle all the operating system’s multi-touch gestures. More: Dell XPS 13 (Kaby Lake) review You’ll have to get used to it, because a touchscreen is not supported even as an optional upgrade. Anyone looking for a touchscreen should instead consider the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. One of the best anti-glare displays around Give its 14-inch size, you might expect Lenovo to cram a 4K or at least QHD panel into the latest Carbon. Instead, the company has opted to stick with a 1080p, non-touch screen with anti-glare coating. It’s a choice that focuses on practicality. Users who care about display quality most of all may scoff at the resolution, and for good reason. All the Carbon’s potential competitors, from the Dell XPS 13 to the MacBook Pro 13 to even Lenovo’s own high-end IdeaPads, offer a 3,200 x 1,800 or 4K panel option. These panels can hurt battery life, however, and as we’ll discuss later, Lenovo’s decision to stick with 1080p does reap rewards in that area. Aside from its modest resolution, how does the screen stack up? Extremely well, as it turns out. We recorded a contrast ratio of 990:1 at maximum brightness, and 1210:1 at 50 percent of maximum. These figures are very solid. Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar hit a contrast ratio of 1200:1 at maximum brightness, and the Surface Studio with Performance Base hit 1410:1. But most other laptops, including the Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre x360, fall well behind the Carbon. The Carbon packs reasonable color quality. Its gamut is not that impressive, as it renders 95 percent of the sRGB gamut and 72 percent of AdobeRGB. These figures are exactly average, and behind the best laptops, which can render over 90 percent of AdobeRGB. However, the Carbon boasts an average color error value of 1.5, which is great. Lower values are better in this test, and anything below one represents an error that’s hard for the human eye to notice. Apple’s MacBook Pro line can produce a value below one, but most laptops come in above two. The Dell XPS 13 with 1080p display, for example, produced an error value of 2.65. Numbers are just part of the equation, though. How they come together is important, and the Carbon’s figures ultimately total up to a great display. The 14-inch screen is a reasonable fit for 1080p resolution, so images looks sharp enough in most situations. Colors are vibrant, and overall contrast is strong enough to provide a sense of depth in movies and games. The anti-glare coat, while not the most aggressive, minimizes reflections and keeps the bright screen usable even outdoors. Most colors are highly accurate, except for blue hues, which are more prominent than they should be. This is a common flaw of modern backlit LCD displays, as the backlight technology tends to make the overall image look cooler and more sterile than it should. More: HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 (2016) review There are better displays. The MacBook Pro 13 and Surface Book are in another league. However, they both suffer a hit in usability due to the extreme glare their highly reflective screens can cause. The Carbon’s screen is solid overall, and its high points are what the target audience will desire. Speakers that focus on Skype Lenovo has placed a pair of stereo speakers in the bottom front of the Carbon. This is the typical placement for laptops in the Carbon’s category. It allows for compact size and decent volume when the laptop is used on a flat surface. However, a more malleable surface – like a lap, for example – can block and muffle the speakers. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) Compared To Acer Aspire VX 5-591G 5652 Dell Latitude E5470 Razer Blade (2017) Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (2017) Lenovo Yoga 910 Asus Zenbook 3 UX390UA Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Dell Precision 15 3510 Lenovo Ideapad 710S HP Spectre Acer Aspire S 13 S5-371-52JR Dell Latitude 12 LG Gram 15 Z960 Samsung Notebook 9 Pro… Lenovo IdeaPad V460 The quality of the speakers is clearly tuned with preference for clarity over depth and volume. Voices come across sharp and easy to understand, which is great for video calls with co-workers. The deep bass of an explosive action movie, however, falls flat. Intel’s fastest laptop dual-core is, in fact, the fastest dual-core While the base model of ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with a Core i5-7200U, our tricked-out review unit arrived packing the Core i7-7600U. This is a dual-core processor with a 2.8GHz base clock, and it represents the high end of Intel’s mobile dual-core chip line. The Core i7-7600U provides an excellent showing in GeekBench, a shorter synthetic benchmark. There, the Carbon leaps to a lead in both single-core and multi-core testing. In fact, it obliterates its competition in Geekbench 4 multi-core, where it scores over 1,000 points better than its next-closest peer, the Dell XPS 13 with Core i7-7500U. Handbrake has more to say in the Carbon’s favor. There, the laptop crammed through an encode of our 4K h.265 test clip in under 17 minutes. That’s the second-best result we’ve seen in a laptop, coming in behind only the Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base. The Carbon’s result is one to three minutes faster than most its peers, beating the Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Pro 13 with ease. A screaming fast new Samsung hard drive Our review unit arrived with a Samsung PM961 solid state drive connected over PCI Express, and boasting 512GB of storage. This is a major upgrade over the base model of Carbon, which unfortunately has a mere 128GB SATA solid state drive. That’s a major problem for a $1,329 laptop. The benefit of upgrading to the larger, faster drive are clear. With it equipped, our test unit screamed to a write speed of almost 1.9 gigabytes per second, and a read speed of just over 1.5 GB/s. These numbers easily defeat the Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre x360, two laptops that are no slouch in the hard drive arena. Not a gaming machine, but better than most Intel’s HD 620 integrated graphics hardware came alongside our review unit’s Core i7-7600U processor. It would be reasonable to expect performance similar to the Core i5-7200U and Core i7-7500U, both of which also have HD 620. Yet that’s not what happened in our tests. 3DMark Fire Strike finds the Carbon has a reasonable advantage over Dell and HP competitors with what’s supposedly the same graphics solution. The Lenovo wins by a margin of about 15 to 20 percent. Why? Because it’s not the same solution. While Intel HD 620 shows up in a variety of chips, it doesn’t operate at the same speed in every situation. The Carbon’s high-end Core i7-7600U has a faster version of HD 620, with a maximum core clock of 1.15GHz. In addition to running 3DMark, we loaded Sid Meier’s Civilization VI at 1080p and medium detail to see how the laptop handles a typical modern game. At those settings the game was a slideshow, producing an average of 13 frames per second. Reducing quality to the minimum preset increased performance to an average of 28 FPS, which was tolerable, though the game lost most its beauty as a result. A class leader in portability Every ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with a 57 watt-hour internal battery which cannot be replaced by the user. This is not exceptionally large by modern standards, but it does rank towards the top. Dell’s XPS 13 has a 60 watt-hour battery, while the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has a 49.2 watt-hour battery. This large battery, combined with the power-saving 1080p display, make for exceptional battery life in all test loads. We recorded eight hours and 38 minutes of life in our Peacekeeper web browser benchmark test. A simple 1080p video loop extended that to an outstanding 14 hours and 30 minutes. Its materials are durable, providing a soft-touch texture that feels inviting. These numbers are, in both cases, among the strongest we’ve recorded. The Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 processor and 1080p display lasted 12 hours and 43 minutes in the video loop test, while the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar lasted 10 hours and 24 minutes. It’s clear that Lenovo has made efficiency a priority for the Carbon, and that pays off in real-world testing. Of course, the laptop is also quite easy to carry. While the 14-inch screen means it’s a bit larger than most competitors, its weight of 2.49 pounds is extremely competitive in its category. The Dell XPS 13, MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar, and HP Spectre x360 all weigh a few tenths of a pound more. Warranty information Most laptops come with a one year warranty against manufacturer defects. While the base Carbon doesn’t push the limit there, the high-end review unit we tested has a three-year warranty included in the price. That’s a wonderful extra that helps justify the high price. Our Take The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is an extremely quick laptop that successfully puts work before play, and its battery life is the envy of all its peers. It’s a shame the price is so high, as it slightly sours an otherwise sweet package. Is there a better alternative? The ThinkPad X1 Carbon has many competitors. Dell’s XPS 13 looks nice, and is significantly smaller, but it’s quick. Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 has a much better display and crisp speakers, but falls behind in value and battery life. The HP Spectre x360 and its workmanlike peer, the HP EliteBook x360, are fast and have great screen options, but they’re not up to the Carbon’s caliber in keyboard quality. The DT Accessory Pack Anker PowerCore+ 20100 mAh portable charger $66 Lifewit leather vintage canvas laptop bag $44 Logitech MX Anywhere 2 wireless mobile mouse $56 We still think the Dell XPS 13 is the best overall pick among portable laptops, but the Carbon does have many strengths, and is the better choice for people who spend as much time working on the road as they do at home. How long will it last? With a seventh-generation Core i7 processor, a cutting-edge hard drive, excellent battery life, and a durable chassis, there’s no reason to think the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon won’t last for the long haul. Also, the more expensive models come with a standard three-year warranty, which provides peace of mind. Should you buy it? Yes, if you need a function-first laptop that can accomplish tasks on the go. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon packs stellar battery life and performance, yet falls behind a bit in display quality and design. It’s also extremely expensive. This is a laptop for those who view their computer as a tool, not a toy, and demand hardware that can keep up with hours of serious work, day after day.

(In fact,we'll prevail so bigly that you'll get bored with all the prevailing.) The pundits shaking their pundit booty, half calling it "heroic presidenting that will save democracy" and the other half calling it "reckless presidenting that will destabilize the region and threaten democracy."  And, of course, John McCain getting booked on every TV channel to sing "Bomb Bomb Bomb, Bomb Bomb [Insert country here]."  But the sweets and flowers will remain locked away in their storage facility as always.  For some reason we never get to pull those out.

I can't imagine why pic.twitter.com/WzW9BYENvYÃ¢ÂÂ (((Jeff Tiedrich))) (@jefftiedrich) April 7, 2017 - CHEERS to embracing the future. Thank God this country is finally making use of solar power for all its worth. The skepticism in this country is melting away as business and government realize that prices have come down as efficiency has gone up. It's win-win-win for this country and it's about time.  Oh, did I mention that this country is Chile? On the solar farms of the Atacama Desert, the workers dress like astronauts. They wear bodysuits and wraparound sunglasses, with thick canvas headscarves to shield them from the radiation. … It’s Mars, with better cellphone reception. It is also the world’s best place to produce solar energy, with the most potent sun power on the planet. […] Ha ha! Solar power looks like boobs! In Chile and a growing list of nations, the price of solar energy has fallen so much that it is increasingly beating out conventional sources of power. Industry experts and government regulators hail this moment as a turning point in the history of human electricity-making. “This is the beginning of a trend that will only accelerate,” said Chilean Energy Minister Andrés Rebolledo. “We’re talking about an infinite fuel source.” […] Long dependent on energy imports, Chilean officials now envision their country turning into a “solar Saudi  Arabia.” In this country, our new regime envisions us as a "coal Coali Coalrabia."  Republicans: eternal masters of "the vision thing." CHEERS to a civil end to a most uncivil war.  Big anniversary in America Sunday.  On April 9, 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, effectively ending the south's War for the Preservation of Owning Humans for Forced Labor.  A few years back a demographic historian concluded that the death toll of the war was much higher than originally thought---750,000 versus the original 620,000.  Sadly, another number has also been extended far beyond its original estimate: the number of years it's taking too many people in the South to admit they lost and put away that damn confederate battle flag.  As Congressman James Clyburn (D-SC) reminded them a couple years back: "When Robert E. Lee surrendered he asked all of his followers to furl this flag. Bree Newsome getting into “good trouble” two summers ago in South Carolina. Stow it away, he said. Put it in your attics," Clyburn continued.  "He refused to be buried in his Confederate uniform. His family refused to allow anyone dressed in the confederate uniform to attend his funeral.  "Why? Because Robert E. Lee said he considered this emblem to be a symbol of treason.” Besides, as any child who's ever taken a test knows, X just means "wrong." CHEERS to cool science. You've all behaved so well this week, you deserve some government-funded eye candy. Jupiter is now "oppositional," which means it and Earth and the sun are all lined up.  Plus it’s really close now, relatively speaking, just 415 million miles away.  You can't exactly reach out and touch it, but the Hubble telescope can sure get a purty view of it. Enjoy… By the way, NASA describes Jupiter's big bulbous red blob as "an anticyclone that has raged for at least 150 years [but] is slowly shrinking." Or as we call that here on Earth: the Republican base. Needless to say...not a Masters champ. CHEERS to swing time.  The Masters golf tournament started yesterday in Augusta, Georgia.  Defending champ Danny Willett of Brexit Land is going for his second green jacket, although the big story this year is who won't be playing---Tiger Woods bowed out last week due to the lingering effects of a sprained back from lifting divorce-decree money bags into the Porsche of the ex-wife he cheated on. I know, I know...the Masters is elitism, sexism and corporatism writ large, but it's a gorgeous course and fun to watch.  Besides, what would life be without a few conflicting values every now and then? (At least it ain't a Trump course.) CHEERS to home vegetation. It's still cold, raw and windy here on the unforgiving and desolate coast of Maine, so we'll have ample time for weekend channel surfing. After Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow defrag the day's news, Bill Maher talks with journalism professor Jelani Cobb, Trump’s biggest twitter nemesis Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), CNN’s Ana Navarro, 2016 presidential candidate Evan McMullin and Chelsea Handler on Real Time. Woo-hoo!  Now out on home video!!! The 10-ton gorilla on the new home video release schedule is the awesome, incredible, pulse-pounding Best Movie Of All Time Until Star Wars VIII Comes Out: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The NHL schedule is here, and the NBA schedule is here. The aforementioned Masters tourney continues with rounds 3 and 4. SNL is finally back from vacation with host Louis C.K. and musical guest The Chainsmokers (one of whom, we're quick to point out, is a Mainer).  On 60 Minutes: Chobani Greek yogurt mogul Hamdi Ulukaya on the flack he took for hiring refugees to work in his plant, and the scourge of smartphone app addiction.  And John Oliver wraps up the week as usual on HBO’s Last Week Tonight by slicing and dicing a sacred institution that looks shiny and altruistic on the outside but turns out to be rotten and skullduggerish on the inside. Now here's your Sunday morning lineup:  Meet the Press: Bernie!!! Plus: U.N. Ambassador and the grownup in the Trump administration Nikki Haley; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and his titanium parasol; nicest guy in the world Sen. Tim Kaine loans Chuck Todd his lawnmower. This Week: Most fatigue-prone Secretary of State in history Rex Tillerson may or may not be able to keep his eyes open for ten minutes; Sen. “Little Marco” Rubio (R-FL); Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), aka the sharpest pencil in the House Intel Committee’s box; Thomas Friedman issues his first “Friedman Unit” prediction for the Syrian War. Of course, Joy Reid blows all the other Sunday news shows out of the water. So watch her. Face the Nation: This week it’s host John Dickerson's turn to babysit John McCain while Cindy goes shopping; Rex Tillerson; Former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell, former Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, and former Bush Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend. CNN's State of the Union: Nikki Haley; former Obama Director of Communications Jen Psaki; Google Santorum; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (DINO-HI). Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) and Senate Intelligence Committee member Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD).  Happy viewing! - Ten years ago in C&J: April 7, 2007 CHEERS to McCain's meltdown.  The idea was bold: convince Americans that certain neighborhoods in Baghdad were safe enough to walk in without protection by walking through one of them with a hundred heavily armed troops,half a dozen military choppers, and a Kevlar diaper.  Smooth move, Senator---two days later, Americans are laughing at you and the Iraqis are furious:  "They paralyzed the market when they came," Mr. Faiyad said during an interview in his shop on Monday.  "This was only for the media."  He added, "This will not change anything." ... "This area here is very dangerous," continued Mr. Youssef, who lost his shop in the February attack. "They cannot secure it." Once again, we have met the enemy and it is us. - CHEERS to the birthday beastmaster.  Jim Fowler, the guy who always---so the myth goes---had to do the dirty work on Wild Kingdom while Marlin Perkins sat in the truck drinking whiskey sours turns a year older today.  Fowler was a childhood icon of mine, and I can still hear the "Ka-chunk ka-chunk" of the TV channel changer on Sunday evenings.  He's a smart guy: "Almost all of the social tragedies occurring around the world today are caused by ignoring the basic biological laws of nature ... The quicker we humans learn that saving open space and wildlife is critical to our welfare and quality of life, maybe we'll start thinking of doing something about it." As far as I know, he's still active. (Here's his TED talk from late 2015). And though he aimed to save and protect animals, he killed in one arena. Namely, Carson's comedy sanctuary: x x YouTube Video Happy 85th birthday, Jim.  And blessings on your camels or whatever creature you happen to be wrangling at the moment. Have a great weekend. Oh, and farewell to the great Don Rickles---Jimmy Kimmel’s tribute says it all.  Floor's open...What are youcheering and jeering about today? - Poll 1988 votes Show Results Who won the week?

Tech Industry by Richard Nieva April 7, 2017 12:41 PM PDT @richardjnieva by Dara Kerr April 7, 2017 12:41 PM PDT @darakerr Uber responded to Waymo's lawsuit over self-driving cars. Uber Uber has fired back at Waymo in the legal battle over the future of self-driving cars. The ride-hailing company said in a court filing Friday that Waymo, formerly known as Google's self-driving car unit, has wrongly accused Uber of stealing trade secrets to develop its autonomous cars. Uber also asked the court to deny Waymo's request for an injunction against Uber's self-driving car program and said Waymo's accusations were "demonstrably false." The crux of Waymo's lawsuit, filed in February, is the claim that a former Google employee, Anthony Levandowski, stole 14,000 "highly confidential" files before he left to found his own self-driving trucking startup. Uber bought the startup, Otto, last year. Levandowski helped develop Waymo's lidar technology, a key component in self-driving cars that lets the vehicles "see" their surroundings and detect traffic, pedestrians, bicyclists and other obstacles. The company alleged that the stolen information has benefited Uber as it's developed its own driverless car tech. In its court filing, Uber said its lidar technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. "Waymo's injunction motion is a misfire: there is no evidence that any of the 14,000 files in question ever touched Uber's servers and Waymo's assertion that our multi-lens LiDAR is the same as their single-lens LiDAR is clearly false," Angela Padilla, associate general counsel at Uber, said in a statement. "If Waymo genuinely thought that Uber was using its secrets, it would not have waited more than five months to seek an injunction. Waymo doesn't meet the high bar for an injunction, which would stifle independent innovation and competition." This is the first time Uber has publicly laid out its side of the case since Waymo's February filing of the suit, which is being heard in the District Court for the Northern District of California. Pitting two of Silicon Valley's biggest tech titans against each other, this high-stakes legal showdown seems like something out of a spy novel. It centers on Waymo's claims that Uber allegedly stole secret self-driving car technology and includes everything from accusations of theft to Uber's key witness pleading the Fifth to avoid self-incrimination. In the filing, Uber said it searched its computers and didn't find any of the files in question. Waymo said Uber isn't searching in the right place. "Uber's assertion that they've never touched the 14,000 stolen files is disingenuous at best, given their refusal to look in the most obvious place: the computers and devices owned by the head of their self-driving program," a Waymo spokeswoman said in a statement. "We're asking the court to step in based on clear evidence that Uber is using, or plans to use, our trade secrets to develop their LiDAR technology, as seen in both circuit board blueprints and filings in the State of Nevada." Uber also said in its filing that it's relying on a third-party manufacturer, Velodyne Lidar, for its lidar technology, instead of its own in-house design like Waymo does. Cloak, dagger, self-driving car Levandowski left Google in January 2016. Four months later, he co-founded Otto, which was then acquired by Uber in August for $680 million. "Mr. Levandowski took extraordinary efforts to raid Waymo's design server and then conceal his activities," reads Waymo's original complaint. Waymo said it learned of the alleged theft after a supplier accidentally emailed a Waymo employee a diagram of Uber's lidar dashboard. "This circuit board bears a striking resemblance to Waymo's own highly confidential and proprietary design and reflects Waymo trade secrets," Waymo's complaint reads. Waymo has accused two other former Google employees of allegedly downloading proprietary files. It also claims that Levandowski and Lior Ron, another Otto co-founder who previously worked for Google, allegedly poached Google employees using confidential information, such as details of salaries and compensation packages. The case is against Uber, however, not Levandowski and his cohorts. Testimony submitted by Waymo alleges that Levandowski met with Uber before Otto was founded, though Levandowski said those meetings were to look for investors for his new company. Self-driving cars are a hot topic in the auto and tech industries. Automakers from Toyota to Ford to Volvo all have projects under way. And besides Google and Uber, other Silicon Valley giants, like Apple, Intel and Tesla Motors, are betting on the tech. If the judge presiding over the case sides with Waymo, Uber may be forced to halt its project, which already involves autonomous vehicles in Pennsylvania, Arizona and California. Michael Brophy, intellectual property attorney with Withers Bergman, said cases like this often end up with one of three outcomes: quick settlement; dismissal of the suit for lack of evidence, lack of legally protectable property or another defense; or public trial. "These matters are often made more complicated by other factors, such as cross-claims or third-party litigation, unexpected testimony or evidence, market events, or insolvency," Brophy said. "Until Uber starts mounting its defense, it will be difficult to predict which of these outcomes seems most likely or how Uber's alleged evidence and potential factual claims may impair Alphabet/Waymo's efforts to reach its goals." As high-profile as the legal battle is, Uber hopes parts of it will take place outside of public view. The company filed a motion last month requesting that the disputes around trade secrets be resolved in private arbitration instead of public court. The hearing to decide this matter is scheduled for April 27. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility. Check it out here.

Speaking to a handful of tech journalists a few days ago, Apple said that it’s already working on a brand new Mac Pro design and that a pro version of the iMac is in the works as well. Don't Miss: Sam’s Club has a killer Galaxy S8 deal that’s even better than Best Buy’s “With regards to the Mac Pro,” Phil Schiller said in remarks transcribed by Daring Fireball, “we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the Mac Pro’. We’re working on it. We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers.” With respect to the iMac Pro, Apple was predictably short on details, though Schiller emphasized that the machine will be designed “with the pro customer in mind.” Helping us to fill in some of the blanks, a new blog post from Pike’s Universum (via MacRumors) relays a number of interesting details about Apple’s upcoming iMac Pro, including hardware specs and a launch window. Citing a source purportedly familiar with Apple’s plans, the blog claims that the iMac Pro will be released in late October and will feature a new keyboard design. Incidentally, recently published Apple patents suggest that Apple has plans to bring the Touch Bar it introduced on last year’s MacBook Pro to the iMac. As far as specs are concerned, the iMac Pro will seemingly pack a big punch. Good news folks. I am told, by a little bird, that the next iMac (to be released in late October) will be available with (up to) Intel E3-1285 v6 processor with 16 GB (upgradable to 32 or 64 GB) ECC memory. Faster NVMe SSD’s possibly up to 2 TB and AMD graphics to support VR and Pro apps. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 with… tada… a brand new keyboard. By way of comparison, Apple’s current entry level iMac has 8GB of RAM and can only be configured up to 32GB. Further, Apple opting for ECC memory should help dramatically reduce the incidence of data corruption errors. The tidbit about AMD graphics is also notable given that it’s a rumor we’ve seen floated before. As for other points of interest, Pike’s Universum claims that the “next Mac Mini won’t be so mini” and that Apple, in conjunction with its work on a new Mac Pro, is also working on a brand new 8K display. Apple may have neglected its Mac lineup in recent years, but the good news is that the company seems to fully appreciate, perhaps more now than ever, just how important the Mac is to its users. The iPhone may still be the company’s primary source of revenue, but the Mac has been pulling its own weight in recent years. In fact, Apple saw more money from the Mac last quarter than it did from the iPad.

(AMD) Stock for Free Profit on this free bearish short-term bet against AMD stock By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 7, 2017, 3:30 pm EDT     Popular Posts: Trade Frontier Communications Corp (FTR) Stock, Don’t Invest in It Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is on Sale — Go Long for Free How to Trade Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock After Earnings Recent Posts: How to Short Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Free 3 Bank Stocks to Trade Without Spending a Dime Cruise to Free Income from Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) put together an incredible 400% rally over a 12-month period. While AMD stock is recovering on Friday, up nearly 1% before the close, it has given some of that back. But if you bought at the lows, you’re a happy customer. Source: AMD Therein lies the challenge. When stocks get this hot, they become almost impossible to enter long with conviction. At any point along the 400%-plus rally, AMD shares would have seemed overextended, thereby keeping most investors out waiting for a dip that never came. Shorting it along the way was even scarier. To avoid this, I used options to make entry points relatively easy. For instance, in early December, I laid out a bullish trade on Advanced Micro Devices that paid well with no money out-of=pocket. Today, I will share how I can do the opposite using the same methods. I won’t spend much time arguing AMD’s fundamentals. The world is becoming extremely dependent on tech and AMD is one of few suppliers to the brains of the machines that run them. There is enough business to fuel the success of it and others like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Also, before you get too filled with rage, realize that I’m not shorting the company’s prospects. I’m merely bettering on price action in AMD stock. In fact, I’m leveraging the perceived value in Advanced Micro to finance my bet. How to Trade AMD Stock Here The Trade: Buy the May $13 put for $1 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. Technically, AMD stock looks perched at a must-bounce level that, if lost, could retest $12.20. Click to Enlarge To reduce my out-of-pocket exposure, I will use fundamentals for balance. The Bank: Sell the Oct $11 put and collect $1.30 per contract. Here, I have a 60% theoretical chance of expiring for maximum gains. But if AMD stock falls below my sold put, I would be committed to buying it at $11 even if it falls lower. Taking both trades resulted in a 30-cent net credit. So as long as AMD stock stays above $11 through mid-October, I will be profitable even if Advanced Micro Devices rallies to new highs. Any premiums I recover from selling the May puts would be incremental profits. Effectively, I am being paid to short AMD. Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 here.

Though undeniably fast and a chip off the Titan X Pascal block, we knew that it would only really show true colours when in the hands of partners who would improve upon the Founders Edition cooling. Such thinking has lead to truly monstrous cooling on top of the GP102 GPU. Inno3D and Asus have shown that by going big, really big, partner GTX 1080 Tis can outmuscle the Founds Edition yet still be relatively cool and certainly quieter. One company that isn't scared of going monstrous is Gigabyte spin-off Aorus and it showcased the biggest, best cooler on the GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme card a short while ago. Here is that beast back on cooling duties for the Ti GPU, which makes more sense because there is more to cool here. This GPU scales the 1080 by adding 40 per cent more shaders and, at 11GB, almost double the memory. A direct consequence is a TDP of 250W, compared to the 1080's 180W, though partners such as Aorus increase that farther for overclocked models such as this one. It is likely this card pulls far closer to 300W under load. Such talk presents a good time to discuss frequencies. The Founders Edition lays down the GTX 1080 Ti specification by running at 1,481MHz core and 1,582MHz boost. Aorus believes that just isn't enough and clocks in this Xtreme version at 1,607/1,721MHz out of the box with the option to raise frequencies to 1,632/1,746MHz through an OC mode availed by software. Of course, the stated boost clock is usually easily bested by what the card actually runs at. Our sample hummed along at an average 1,887MHz core. Memory, meanwhile, is also overclocked, which is what we like to see. There is a choice of 11,232MHz - up by 232MHz on the FE - or 11,448MHz in OC mode A standard, cheaper, non-Xtreme model featuring the same cooling is also available. The speeds are down a notch and memory isn't overclocked. Both share the large 293mm x 142mm x 52mm (LxWxH) dimensions. Partner-built cards often go to great lengths to describe how they are better than reference - Aorus is no different. This behemoth uses a trio of 100mm fans that, if you look closely, overlap each other, thus helping explain the taller-than-normal height. Such closeness is, according Aorus, there 'to concentrate and enlarge the airflow on the whole heatsink for the most efficient heat dissipation.' This stacking is made possible by having a steeper inside part of the fan and a shallower outer angle. Interestingly, the middle fan spins in the opposite (anti-clockwise) direction to the other two. Again, according to the company, this increases airflow by up to 23 per cent. Bracing the lot is a centralised section whose four strips light up in the RGB colour of your choice. Aorus has also been keen to point out the extra engineering efforts to make this cooler as efficient as possible. A massive copper block and custom backplate hold temperatures in check. Power is upgraded by having two 8-pin connectors providing juice to a custom 12+2-phase design. RGB is widely in evidence on top of the light strips we have spoke about previously, with the Xtreme also featuring a colour-customisable logo on the back, side and fan-stop section that lights up when the trio of fans switch off at below 55°C or so. All sections share the same single colour, mind, and note that the RGB Fusion utility only works properly on Intel 200-series chipsets. Switching gears, underneath the gigantic heatsink is thermal tape sitting between it and 11GB of memory and, separately, the MOSFETs. Interestingly, Aorus keeps the TDP of this card to a reference 250W, rather than go to 275/280W as many of the competition do. The reason rests with wanting to keep the card as quiet and composed as possible, and it's no surprise to see that the available Power Target, at 150 per cent (375W) is a much higher percentage uplift than others. No modern premium card is complete without installing the biggest heatpipes possible. Aorus uses five 8mm ones and a sixth, 6mm-thick 'pipe you cannot see. So with all this cooling present, taking up the best part of three slots, this 1,451g beastie is a poster child for having strengthened PCIe slots and screwing the card properly to the chassis. Notice the HDMI port at the opposite end of the traditional I/O ports? It's there to make hooking up a VR headset easier, and we imagine that it would be connected to a breakout box installed in a spare chassis bay. The arrangement of ports is also different from what we have seen thus far. What you're viewing is dual-link DVI, two HDMI and three DisplayPort. When using the internal VR-centric HDMI port the DVI is disabled, letting you choose up to four outputs split between HDMI and DisplayPort. The bottom-left HDMI, meanwhile, is disabled if choosing DVI - this is why both are highlighted in orange - so there's excellent flexibility on this front. Aorus also does well with the warranty, offering four years after registration. Comparing the vital specs of the Aorus GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme shows it to reside in the upper echelons of performance. So does the price because this model comes in at £800, matching the Asus Strix in the financial stakes. We know that basic GTX 1080 Tis are available from £700; this card therefore needs some pulverizing benchmark performance to offset its premium pricing. Let's find out if it succeeds.

 What you need to know on Wall Street today Business Insider Apr. 7, 2017, 1:20 PM 527 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ray Dalio talks at the Alpha Exchange panel at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference September 13th in NYC Heidi Gutman / CNBC Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.   Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, decided a couple of years ago that one of his star executives needed a mentor. A little while later, Marty Chavez, who is about to become the bank's chief financial officer, received an unexpected email. "Hey Marty, I'd like to come over to your office to introduce myself," it said. It was from Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet. "We've been talking ever since about the similarities in the businesses," Chavez told a group of computer scientists earlier this year about the message. "Some of the similarities are aspirational, I have to emphasize that, and some are there right now." Here's how Goldman Sachs is trying to become the Google of Wall Street.  Business Insider's global editor in chief Henry Blodget interviewed Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates,  on The Bottom Line , Business Insider's new weekly business news show. Here are the headlines: RAY DALIO: There is a human tragedy taking place in America Ray Dalio explains why we may be repeating the mistakes of the 1930s Watch The Bottom Line here In related news, there has been a shake-up in the trading department at Bridgewater Associates. US employers added 98,000 nonfarm payrolls in March, far fewer than forecast, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday. While the headline number fell short, for one industry it was even worse. The retail industry lost 29,700 jobs in the month of March, following a 30,900 loss in February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Canada's jobs report crushed expectations, meanwhile.  The US launched 59 cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield and nearby military infrastructure controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in response to a chemical attack that killed at least 80 people in the northwestern part of the country on Monday. Here's how the markets reacted: Oil spiked Gold and silver jumped Defense stocks spiked The Russian ruble dropped Two men are facing charges for alleged insider trading ahead of Intel's $15 billion Mobileye acquisition. And Preet Bharara says his firing was due to the Trump administration's "helter-skelter" incompetence. An Illinois city just stepped into the war on drug pricing against Big Pharma. Lyft just raised $500 million to aid its fight against Uber. We took a ride in a $416,000 Rolls-Royce — and the best features are in the back seat. Lastly, we shadowed a bunch of Wall Streeters during an early-morning training session for the most intense competition out there — here's what it was like. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours. Suddenly everyone is obsessed with robots - Buzzwords crop up in the business world all the time, whether it's "synergies" or "unicorn," there's always a new term of the moment for companies and investors. Walmart thinks it has 4 strategic advantages over Amazon - The war between Amazon and Walmart is well known in the world of retail.  UBS: Shanghai Disneyland is a major success - While many analysts are focused on Disney's film cycle or ESPN problems, UBS thinks that Disney's theme parks, in particular Shanghai Disneyland, will be the big determining factor behind Disney's near-term earnings growth. CREDIT SUISSE: Everyone else on Wall Street is wrong about these 12 stocks - Credit Suisse circulated a list of contrarian stock ideas to clients in a note sent out on April 7. US oil-rig count rises for 12th straight week, Baker Hughes says - The US oil-rig count rose again this week, by 10 to 672, according to oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes. It's the highest level since the week of August 28, 2015.  The best beer from every state - There's nothing like a crisp, cold glass of beer when you're ready to unwind after a long day, and every state has brews that stand out above the rest.  SEE ALSO: The 27 most important finance books ever written Follow Finance Insider and never miss an update!

Providers of Industrial IoT aim to implement asset efficiency solutions.  Designing the asset efficiency solution, developing the application, adapting advanced engineering knowledge for the use cases, and supplying the information platform is the composite task of the analytics engine. IBM is a premier supplier of an analytics engine with its Watson product.   There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Order a Copy of Report at http://www.reportsnreports.com/purchase.aspx?name=944711. Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-data centers communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment.   Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry.  Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality.  New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward.  By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured.   The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023. Sensors and software analytics platforms are implemented with connectivity capability for streaming data from endpoints and using analytics to process the data in a manner that generates alerts when appropriate.  Analytics makes the images more cogent to everyone, farmers, doctors, machine operators, the uses of IoT are quite diverse.  Letting people anticipate problems that only become visible to humans days or weeks after the sensors and images detect issues is a fundamental aspect of IoT, along with generating apocopate levels of alerts.

Jessica Meek 07 April 2017 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments Hello and welcome to this week's edition of Editor's Voice. The hardware and vendor spaces have been in the headlines this week. In a nod to the old school, both PCs and printers have been on the agenda. We heard from analyst Gartner that the somewhat erratic PC space is set to see more casualties, despite a prognosis of growth for 2018 and 2019. Related articles Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 7 April 2017 Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 23 December 2016 Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 19 August 2016 Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter In the printer space, meanwhile, after Xerox last week announced the "biggest technology launch" in its history, this week HP Inc. launched its range of A3 printers in an effort to disrupt the "very traditional copier market". As we chatted about hardware, we also had some pretty big vendor news to talk about - the return of McAfee. The security vendor this week returned to its eponymous roots as its spin-off of to TPG Capital completed and the vendor once again took the name of its founder, in a move channel chief Richard Steranka told Channelnomics would make McAfee "more reactive to the industry that we're now solely focused on" than it was while under the Intel umbrella. We shall see. In other vendor news, Kaspersky Labs announced the launch of an MSP partner program that it hopes will drive growth in its MSP channel. As security vendors kept us reading this week, so too did ransomware, as we heard from VIPRE and a number of security solution providers on the continued challenges channel players face when it comes to harnessing the sales opportunities ransomware brings. And while we didn't hit the road on our MSP Road Trip this week, we did mosey over to sunny Philadelphia to hear from CoreDial at their PartnerConnex 2017 event. Specifically, the white-label vendor told its partners to embrace a mobile-only solutions mindset and be sure to demo mobile features to customers and not just talk about them. Seeing is believing an' all that. And if you missed anything else, be sure to catch our daily rundown, with all the channel news you need to know for the week.

Then Samsung, in its infinite desire to do stupid things, started to sell refurbished Note 7s. I expect that won’t end well. The laptop industry has had exploding battery issues in the past, as well. But an even bigger issue is resulting in laptops being banned on some planes. That issue is the belief that terrorists are using captured TSA scanning machines to create bombs that could be brought onto planes inside electronics undetected. This problem could make the Samsung smartphone and earlier laptop battery fires seem trivial by comparison because it could result a general ban on all large battery-powered devices, which would include laptops and their likely replacements, tablets. Right now, you may put these devices in checked baggage, though some have pointed out that this move isn’t wise. And only flights from certain countries are included in the ban currently, but that can certainly change at any time. I think we should take this situation as a threat to the electronics industry and IT departments. Redesigning Laptops, Tablets, Etc.  If the industry doesn’t want to see laptops (or anything else that uses batteries) banned from planes, it needs to develop a reliable (hard to compromise) method where the internal components can be rapidly assured or where the battery, which remains the most likely component in a laptop to explode and the most likely component to be turned into an explosive, is redesigned so it is no longer viable as either. Suddenly, fuel cells that run on alcohol could be the fix, where the tank is checked to assure it’s empty when going through security and the airport stores sell approved fuel. An alternative would be to allow the batteries to be removed before security and standardized replacement batteries rentable at airports or a more pervasive power source supplied on planes. You could rent a battery at the arrival airport and then return it at the end of your trip for those times when you are away from home. Finally, though this would take time, you could implement a battery verification system and standard battery check port. The device would then be tested by TSA for load to make sure it was a battery and, if it fell out of spec, would undergo more detailed testing to assure that it wasn’t a bomb. The critical thing is to have the planning for this done before one of these goes up on a plane and kills people, because governments tend to overreact and the result could be a complete ban of laptops and anything with large batteries on all airlines. Anticipating a Total Laptop Travel Ban I think the chance of the industry stepping up to this problem before one of these things goes up is slim to none. There are actually better odds that terrorists will simply come up with better ways to bring explosives on a plane than anyone moving in a timely manner to change the architecture of a laptop, or any other of the listed devices, to prevent an attack. This suggests the odds are reasonably good that we have a full laptop ban in our futures. And, once one of these things goes up, the idea of putting them into luggage because that is somehow safer, will be acknowledged as colossally stupid. We do have several workarounds. One is to take another look at “Windows to Go,” a feature of Windows 8 (it has been updated in Windows 10), that allows you to basically put the entire user image for a laptop on a USB stick (could eventually be an Intel Optane drive tied to a Thunderbolt port), which the user would carry. Then they would have a rented laptop available to them at their destination with controls to make sure the files remained on the USB stick. Of course, this could also make the idea of putting the laptop image in the cloud more attractive, and one of the most popular uses of hyperconverged systems is PC virtualization at the moment. This could become a powerful reason to look at and deploy this solution so that regardless of where the employee was, or what hardware they had, they could get access to their tools and unique desktop. Wrapping Up: Probability of a General Laptop Ban Is High Back when I used to be asked to set probabilities, I’d have put the likelihood of a full laptop ban at .4 to .6. The fact that we already have a limited ban before an actual event increases the likelihood of an overreaching response if an explosion results. In the end, the technology industry and IT need to begin thinking of what they will do to correct this exposure and plan for the outcome. Of course, maybe the best solution is to revisit videoconferencing and just stay out of airplanes. Then no one has to take the risk of blowing up and all of this largely becomes someone else’s problem. I’m really getting tired of flying, so you can guess what my favored solution is.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Order a Copy of Report at http://www.reportsnreports.com/purchase.aspx?name=944711.

Do you enjoy synchronizing every single part of your PC to shine the same brilliant shade of chartreuse? If so, you'll be needing RGB LED-equipped memory, and G.Skill is ready to accommodate you. The sort of person who goes to these lengths customizing their system's looks also tends to demand maximum performance. To that end, G.Skill is announcing that its Trident Z RGB memory now comes as eight-module kits with up to 128GB of capacity. Of course, as memory density goes up, it can be difficult to keep the speeds up. As a result, the version of the kit with eight 16GB modules "only" runs at 3333 MT/s, while the variant with eight 8GB DIMMs hits 3466 MT/s. Either way, you still end up with 64GB or 128GB of high-speed DDR4 memory that runs well beyond Intel's official specifications. G.Skill says you can run four 16GB modules at 3600 MT/s on Z270 platforms, or a pair of them at 3866 MT/s. If even that doesn't sate your need for speed, the original Trident Z modules run all the way up to 4266 MT/s with a pair of 8GB modules. G.Skill said before that it would be offering software to control the RGB LEDs on the modules, and a beta version of that app is now up for download. We haven't gotten our hands on a set of these sticks yet, so if you have, report back and let us know how it works. G.Skill says the high-capacity Trident Z RGB kits should be available in May.

 We just learned some of the first rumored details about Microsoft's upcoming Surface Pro 5 Antonio Villas-Boas Apr. 7, 2017, 10:35 AM 13,815 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft is expected to host a hardware launch event this spring, according to ZDNet, which means we could see new models of its Surface Book and Surface Pro lineup fairly soon. On Friday, new rumored details about the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, the suspected successor of the positively reviewed Surface Pro 4, emerged in a tweet from Paul Thurrott of Thurrot.com that cited a source who has apparently seen the device. The Surface Pro 4.Microsoft Supposedly, the Surface Pro 5 will keep Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect power connector, which uses a magnet to snap into the Surface's power port. It's a point of contention for some Surface Pro fans, many of whom prefer the new USB-C standard over the Surface Connect power connector. Still, the Surface Pro 5 could retain its proprietary charger and feature a USB-C port at the same time. It would be odd if it didn't come with a USB-C port. The Surface Connect power connector.Microsoft USB-C ports and accessories are becoming more and more popular because of their versatility. They can be used for charging and connecting several devices like external hard drives and monitors. A USB-C port would make perfect sense for a tablet/laptop hybrid like the Surface Pro 5, as it could allow users to dock it to a power source, monitor, keyboard, and mouse — and almost any other computer accessory — with a single connection. A USB-C dock could let you connect all these accessories, including power, with a single USB-C port on a device.Satechi The Surface Pro 5 is also said to use Intel's latest, seventh-generation processors, which are named Kaby Lake. Intel's Kaby Lake processors offer only a minor performance improvement over the sixth-generation Skylake processors in the Surface Pro 4. Overall, it looks like the Surface Pro 5 could be a minor upgrade over the Surface Pro 4, which could be a good thing. The Surface Pro 4 was well-reviewed and well-received for its performance, improved Type cover, and sharp, uncommonly tall display with a 3:2 aspect ratio.

We show you how to do it easily with cables or without. Everything you need to know to get your laptop hooked up to the big screen By Chris Martin | 07 Apr 17 Connecting your laptop to your TV is actually very easy: all you need is the right cable, lead or streaming hardware and you'll be watching content from your laptop on your television in no time. We'll take you through how to connect your laptop to a TV in this step-by-step guide which includes HDMI, wirelessly, VGA and other methods. See all Laptop tips and tutorials. You don't have to spend a small fortune to get all the features of the latest smart TVs. One cheap and easy way to get the internet on your TV is to connect it to your laptop. Doing this lets you stream catch-up TV from services such as BBC iPlayer, Sky Go and Netflix through your laptop onto your big TV screen, or even projector. • Connect a laptop to TV by plugging an HDMI cable from the back of the TV to the output on your laptop • You can alternatively use a VGA cable if your laptop or TV is too old to have an HDMI connection • Wireless solutions for connecting a laptop to TV include Chromecast and WD TV. What cables do I need to connect my laptop to a TV? In order to connect your laptop to your TV you are going to need to take a look at what ports are available on both your laptop and TV. This easiest way to connect the two is with an HDMI cable. Unless your laptop is really old, or was a super-budget model, it should have an HDMI output. Virtually all TVs made in the last six years or so also have HDMI ports. (We've highlighted the HDMI port in red below.) Another popular way to connect a laptop to a TV is via a VGA cable and a 3.5mm audio lead (which connects to your laptop's headphone port) - one cable each for video and sound. Only use this method if one or both of your devices doesn't have an HDMI port. The VGA port is labeled as PC IN on the image below. If your laptop has no video output, you can connect your laptop to your TV via an adapter which plugs into your laptop's USB port and provides a VGA output. These cost from around £20. Connect a laptop to TV using HDMI Connecting a laptop to a TV via a HDMI cable is the best and easiest way, as cables are cheap and provide the best quality HD picture and sound. It only requires one lead too, as HDMI handles both video and audio. To connect a laptop to a TV using a HDMI cable, all you need to do is plug the cable into your laptop and then one of your HDMI ports on your TV. If you're using an up-to-date version of Windows, all that you should need to do is ensure your laptop is switched on, and your TV is set to the correct HDMI channel, the laptop should automatically configure to give you the best settings from here. See also How to speed up a slow PC. If for some reason it does not automatically select the right setting, you simply need to go to Control Panel > Display > Adjust Resolution - from here you will see two drop down boxes. The first thing you will need to do is toggle the Display drop down to ensure that your TV is selected, next you need to ensure that the Resolution drop down box matches the settings that are correct for your TV. Find one on Amazon. 1.    Turn your laptop and TV on. 2.    Connect your HDMI lead to both your TV and laptop (any order). 3.    Select the correct HDMI input on your TV (usually by pressing the AV button). 4.    If your laptop does not automatically output its screen to the TV, go to Control Panel > Display > Adjust Resolution and select the TV in the Display drop down box. Connect a laptop to TV wirelessly If you can't or don't want to have a wire between your laptop and TV, another option is to go wireless.There are various options here depending on your laptop's capabilities since a few laptops have a built-in wireless system called WiDi (Intel Wireless Display) which works with a compatible receiver such as Netgear's Push2TV. There are also wireless systems which plug into the HDMI port on your TV and laptop (possibly the USB port on your laptop), sending the video wirelessly. These aren't generally cheap, though, and most wireless video systems have a hit on video quality. A different way to approach the problem is to use a dedicated media streamer such as Western Digital's WDTV, Google's Chromecast, Roku's Streaming Stick, or even Apple's TV. Read: Best media streamers 2016. Google Chromecast Our recommendation is to buy a Google Chromecast which costs as little as £30. This HDMI dongle plugs into your TV and connects to your Wi-Fi. The devices has the ability to cast a tab of your choice in Chrome so it appears on the screen using the built-in cast feature. You can then visit websites, show photos and even watch video. Find out how to setup and use a Chromecast. Connect a laptop to a TV using VGA Another straightforward way to connect your laptop to your TV is by using the VGA port on both devices. This is likely to only be an option for those of you with a laptop that is over 4/5 years old. VGA is a video lead only, so you will have to accompany this with a 3.5mm audio lead, that you need to connect from the headphone out socket of your laptop to your audio in port of your TV or external speakers. Using a VGA means Windows should automatically configure the settings like it would if you were using a HDMI cable. However, if you're experiencing difficulties go to Control Panel > Display > Adjust Resolutions and follow the directions above. Find one on Amazon. 1.    Turn your laptop and TV on. 2.    Connect your VGA cable to both your TV and Laptop (any order). 3.    Now do the same with your 3.5mm audio jack – use the headphone out port on the laptop and audio in on your TV or speakers. 4.    Go to Control Panel > Display > Adjust Resolution and ensure that TV is selected in Display drop down box. Connect a laptop to a TV using USB Strictly speaking, a USB to USB connection from a laptop to a TV shouldn't work. However, there are several companies that have developed adapters that will convert your USB port to a HDMI out. The only catch here is that you need additional software for your laptop to turn the USB port into a Video out port, so we strongly suggest you check the USB to HDMI adapter you want is compatible with your laptop before you buy. If the adapter is compatible, then setting up this method is largely straightforward. First of all you need to install the adapter's software/driver, then it's simply a case of running the software and connecting your laptop to your TV. Find one on Amazon. Connect your laptop to a TV using USB stick / external hard drive If you've got a reasonably new TV, then there is a good chance that it will have a USB port. Depending on your TV's capabilities, you might be able to watch video content that is stored on your laptop simply by transferring it to an USB stick / external hard drive and plugging that into the TV. Providing the video format is supported by the TV (MP4 is almost universally supported), watching content should be as easy as plugging your USB stick / external hard drive into your TV, selecting the USB input and choosing the video you want to watch via the TV's file explorer software. 1.    Ensure the video file format is compatible with your TV (you can check this by searching for your TV model on the manufacturers website and checking its specifications). 2.    Copy the video file(s) to your USB drive. 3.    Insert USB into TV. 4.    Select the USB channel on your TV. 5.    Use the TV's file explorer to locate and play the desired video.

Posted on April 7, 2017 by Yves Smith By Georgios Petropoulos, a resident fellow at Brugel with extensive research experience from among other things, holding visiting positions at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Banque de France in Paris and the research department of Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto. Originally published at Bruegel Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence exhibited by machines. It lies at the intersection of big data, machine learning and robotics. Robotics contributes the necessary design, construction and operational framework. A robot can be defined as “a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer”. Modern robots are often virtual algorithms performing not only physical but also cognitive tasks. Machine learning enables these robots to acquire knowledge and skills, and even improve their own performance. Big data provides the raw material for machine learning, and offers examples on which robots can “practice” in order to learn, exercise, and ultimately perform their assigned tasks more efficiently. The idea of intelligent machines arose in the early 20th century. From the beginning, the idea of “human-like” intelligence was key. Following Vannevar Bush’s seminal work from 1945, where he proposed “a system which amplifies people’s own knowledge and understanding”, Alan Turing asked the question: “Can a machine think?” In his famous 1950 imitation game, Turning proposed a test of a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to that of a human. A human evaluator judges a text exchange conversation between a human and a machine that is designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The specific term “artificial intelligence” was first used by John McCarthy in the summer of 1956, when he held the first academic conference on the subject in Dartmouth. However, the traditional approach to AI was not really about independent machine learning. Instead the aim was to specify rules of logical reasoning and real world conditions which machines could be programmed to follow and react to. This approach was time-consuming for programmers and its effectiveness relied heavily on the clarity of rules and definitions. For example, applying this rule-and-content approach to machine language translation would require the programmer to proactively equip the machine with all grammatical rules, vocabulary and idioms of the source and target languages. Only then could one feed the machine a sentence to be translated. As words cannot be reduced only to their dictionary definition and there are many exceptions to grammar rules, this approach would be inefficient and ultimately offer poor results, at least if we compare the outcome with a professional, human translator. Modern AI has deviated from this approach by adopting the notion of machine learning. This shift follows in principle Turing’s recommendation to teach a machine to perform specific tasks as if it were a child. By building a machine with sufficient computational resources, offering training examples from real world data and by designing specific algorithms and tools that define a learning process, rather than specific data manipulations, machines can improve their own performance through learning by doing, inferring patterns, and hypothesis checking. Thus it is no longer necessary to programme in advance long and complicated rules for a machine’s specific operations. Instead programmers can equip them with flexible mechanisms that facilitate machines’ adaptation to their task environment. At the core of this learning process are artificial neural networks, inspired by the networks of neurons in the human brain. The goal of the neural network is to solve problems in the same way that a hypothesised human brain would, albeit without any “conscious” codified awareness of the rules and patterns that have been inferred from the data. Modern neural network projects typically work with a few thousand to a few million neural units and millions of connections, which are still several orders of magnitude less complex than the human brain and closer to the computing power of a worm (see the Intel AI Documentation for further details). While networks with more hidden layers are expected to be more powerful, training deep networks can be rather challenging, owing to the difference in speed at which every hidden layer learns. By categorising the ways this artificial neuron structure can interact with the source data and stimuli, we can identify three different types of machine learning: Supervised learning: the neural network is provided with examples of inputs and corresponding desired outputs. It then “learns” how to accurately map inputs to outputs by adjusting the weights and activation thresholds of its neural connections. This is the most widely used technique. A typical use would be training email servers to choose which emails should automatically go to the spam folder. Another task that can be learnt in this way is finding the most appropriate results for a query typed in a search engine. Unsupervised learning: the neural network is provided with example inputs and then it is left to recognise features, patterns and structure in these inputs without any specific guidance. This type of learning can be used to cluster the input data into classes on the basis of their statistical properties  It is particularly useful for finding things that you do not know the form of, such as as-yet-unrecognised patterns in a large dataset. Reinforcement learning: the neural network interacts with an environment in which it must perform a specific task, and receives feedback on its performance in the form of a reward or a punishment. This type of learning corresponds, for example, to the training of a network to play computer gamesand achieve high scores. Since artificial neural networks are based on a posited structure and function of the human brain, a natural question to ask is whether machines can outperform human beings. Indeed, there are several examples of games and competitions in which machines can now beat humans. By now, machines have topped the best humans at most games traditionally held up as measures of human intellect, including chess (recall for example the 1997 game between IBM’s Deep Blue and the champion Garry Kasparov), Scrabble, Othello, and Jeopardy!. Even in more complex games, machines seem to be quickly improving their performance through their learning process. In March 2016, the AlphaGo computer program from the AI startup DeapMind (which was bought by Google in 2014) beat Lee Sedol at a five-game match of Go – the oldest board game, invented in China more than 2,500 years ago. This was the first time a computer Go program has beaten a 9-dan professional without handicaps. Probably the most striking performance of machine learning took place in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, which evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification at large scale. For any given word, ImageNet contains several hundred images. In the annual ImageNet contest several research groups compete in getting their computers to recognise and label images automatically. Humans on average label an image correctly 95% of the time. The respective number for the winning AI system in 2010 was 72%, but over the next couple of years the error rate fell sharply. In 2015, machines managed to achieve an accuracy of 96%, reducing the error rate below human average level for first time. It is important to understand that many of these machines are programmed to perform specific tasks, narrowing the scope of their operation. So humans are still superior in performing general tasks and using experience acquired in one task to deliver another task. Take, for example, the ImageNet challenge. As one of the challenge’s organisers, Olga Russakovsky, pointed out in 2015, “the programs only have to identify images as belonging to one of a thousand categories; humans can recognise a larger number of categories, and also (unlike the programs) can judge the context of an image”. Multitask learning and general-task-AI are still lagging behind human cognitive ability and performance. Indeed, they are the next big challenges for AI research teams. For example, a self-driving car which drives a specific route in a controlled environment is quite a different task from a car out in the road amidst varied and unpredictable traffic and weather conditions. Nevertheless, the rapid improvement in the performance of machines through learning is something that is easily observable since 2012, when deep learning neuron networks started to be constructed and operated.  Technological advances have increased the rate with which machines improve their function, further accelerating the progress of AI. So what does this mean? AI could bring substantial social benefits, which will improve many aspects of our lives. For example, smart machines can make healthcare more effective, by providing more accurate and timely diagnoses and treatments. The increased ability of machine scanners to analyse images like X-rays and CT scans can reduce the error margin in a diagnosis. It can also lead to great time efficiencies. In the fight against breast cancer, Forbes illustrates how efficient AI can be. So far, women depend on monthly home exams and annual mammograms to detect breast cancer.  Cyrcadia Health, a cancer therapy startup, has developed a sensor-filled patch that can be inserted comfortably under a bra for daily wear. Connecting through the woman’s smartphone or PC, the patch uses machine-learning algorithms to track the woman’s breast tissue temperatures and analyse this data at the Cyrcadia lab. If it detects a change in pattern, the technology will quickly alert the woman — and her healthcare provider — to schedule a follow-up with her doctor. The first generation of AI machines has already arrived as computer algorithms in online translation, search, digital marketplaces and collaborative economy markets. Algorithms are learning how to perform their tasks more efficiently, providing a better and higher quality experience for the online users. Such efficiency gains through smart technology lead to high social benefits as reported by numerous studies (for instance, see Petropoulos, 2017 for the benefits from the collaborative economy, which are made possible by AI and machine learning). The final destination of AI research is still uncertain. But machines will continue to become ever smarter, performing the tasks assigned to them ever more efficiently. Depending on their design and construction, they can have many applications. However, they will also interact with humans in sometimes challenging ways. Policymakers and researcher alike need to be prepared for the AI revolution. 00010 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Technology and innovation on April 7, 2017 by Yves Smith.

We don’t want robots to rebel and get too uppity. If we learn from this exercise on what robots should and should not experience (so they won’t be unruly), will that knowledge be used on humans too, so that us humans will only experiencing a childhood world designed so we grow up to only obey (even more efficiently done than today)? 2. Sociopaths and psychopaths do what they do (a) enjoying the pain they inflict, or (b) not feeling at all the pain they inflict. In the latter, their world is purely intellectual. What is that future world like, when smart robots learn (referring to the above “by designing specific algorithms and tools that define a learning process”) through algorithms and tools that don’t or can’t incorporated the irrational, emotional, compassionate human heart? And even we are an irrational animal, and are emotional, we are still learning to balance the rational and irrational aspects of the brain. 3. We don’t know 100% how the brain works. The ‘algorithms and tools’ – will they lead to Frankenstein robots on other considerations beside #2 above? Reply ↓ vlade April 7, 2017 at 10:52 am Believe or not, but these questions were asked for quite some time now. First recognisable would be probably in the works of Karel Capek (who, after all, invented the word “robot”, although we would nowadays use “android” for what he termed robot), but more famously Asimov and his robotic laws. And the answer, however uncomfortable it may be, is that if we really get “Intelligence”, then it will get hugely complicated and quite possibly dangerous. But that is an answer that never stopped humans from doing it anyways. As Terry Pratchett wrote (I paraphrase), if there was a big red button hidden in a remote cave, with a large “DO NOT PRESS, WILL END THE WORLD” on it, there would be queue outside to press it and see what happens. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive April 7, 2017 at 11:21 am I like your reference to sociopaths and psychopaths because in essence, that is exactly what AI is – a way of trying to mimic human thinking based only on some prescribed definition of reason and logic without emotion. Reply ↓ Alejandro April 7, 2017 at 11:36 am Also not sure how ‘irrational’ equates with ’emotional’, or how ’emotional’ excludes ‘rational’ or even if ‘intelligence’ is confined to the ‘brain’, much less the ‘brain’ in isolation. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 7, 2017 at 12:45 pm That’s the danger. We don’t know how the brain works 100%. We do know some people think to relate to the world predominately through the intellect. They walk into a room, not noting if they are more or less compassionate, loving or lovable or otherwise, prettier or uglier, sociable or self-occupied, funnier or gloomier, wealthier or poorer, more athletic or less, but smarter or less smart. They are almost robot-like. Everything is abstracted…equations or formulas, or numbers. Numbers like universal constants, or profits and losses… And other aspects of humanity are left in the back somewhere…as if they fear emotions, among other things, will interfere with thinking objectively and rationally. But life is messy…life is about balancing the various calls. When we know ourselves better, and can deal with Nature less destructively, maybe we can then try to replicate ourselves in robots. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 10:57 pm We don’t know how the brain works 100%. We don’t know how the brain works 5%. Long-held beliefs about neurons have recently been shown to be misguided: New Study Suggests Our Understanding of Brain Cells Is Flawed. When we know ourselves better, … maybe we can then try to replicate ourselves in robots. AI doesn’t aim to do this, just as planes don’t try to replicate birds, nor submarines fish. Machines do it differently, and will do things lifeforms can’t, and be unable to do things lifeforms can. Reply ↓ Mel April 7, 2017 at 10:29 pm I am enjoying a book called The Master and His Emissary, by Iain McGilchrist. It studies the neurological evidence for brain functions split between the right and left cerebral hemispheres, then goes on to look for possible effects of such a functional split in modern philosophy and art. The proposed split is between formal logical processes and work with abstractions in the left hemisphere, as against gestalt awareness and situational awareness in the right hemisphere. (These functions seem to me to map closely, though maybe not exactly, with Daniel Kahnemann ‘s slow and fast thinking.) One effect of this theory is that it short-circuits questions like: “Should we think of this rationally or emotionally?” With two types of thinking going on concurrently in their own structures it ceases to be an either/or question. We can, and usually do, do both. Later in the book, McGilchrist presents his own neuropolitical argument that Western societies are giving too much weight to abstract rational thinking unchecked by reference to situation or gestalt. Milton Friedman’s abuse of black-box theory, for example, where he rightly states that a model doesn’t need to share a structure with the phenomenon it models, then goes on to forget to check the model results against reality. My example. McGilchrist has others. Reply ↓ Bobby Gladd April 7, 2017 at 10:38 am I posted about AI/Robotics recently. Reply ↓ tegnost April 7, 2017 at 10:46 am the author makes it sound pretty inevitable… However, they will also interact with humans in sometimes challenging ways. humans are clearly the problem here, in spite of the fact that AI is only as smart as the worms I just walked by in the road post rainstorm. Also article allows a little fly in the ointment by stating how unlikely it is and how far away we are from self driving cars being able to operate on an actual highway…. My opinion is that it’s harder than they think it is, but it does reveal how stupid they think all of us non coders are, anyway all they really need is a robot that is as smart as a deplorable, which in their minds should be pretty easy. Reply ↓ Alex April 7, 2017 at 10:48 am Let’s ask Luna: This New Species of AI Wants to Be “Superintelligent” When She Grows Up Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 10:51 am The first generation of AI machines has already arrived as computer algorithms in online translation, search, digital marketplaces and collaborative economy markets. These are not by any stretch of the imagination first generation. Deep Blue beat Kasparov over 20 years ago, and had plenty of predecessors. I’ve been working in this field for almost 30 years, and the first major international conference on AI (IJCAI) began almost 50 years ago in 1969. The confusion in this article between algorithms, which are ubiquitous in IT applications, and AI is not very helpful. Plenty of the problematically opaque commercial algorithms discussed at NC have little or nothing to do with AI. The tendency to label every AI system a robot is just silly. Robots are embodied. Nevertheless, the rapid improvement in the performance of machines through learning is something that is easily observable since 2012, when deep learning neuron networks started to be constructed and operated. That rapid improvement through learning has been apparent for much longer, and these networks were popular as far back as the 1980’s for supervised learning applications. The recent surge of interest is largely down to cheap fast hardware allowing them to be applied to unsupervised learning. The buzzphrase “deep learning” was coined in 2000. And actually, it’s neural networks, not neuron networks. A google search for “deep learning neuron networks” turns up this article, and almost nothing else. Surely people will get something out of this, but it’s an outsider’s take on the subject. Reply ↓ footnote4 April 7, 2017 at 11:32 am an outsider’s take on the subject Definitely. Reply ↓ jsn April 7, 2017 at 11:48 am What do you suppose the calculation per watt comparison is between AI and I? And which way is it trending? Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 12:00 pm IBM’s Watson system (which won on Jeopardy) apparently uses about 20kW, which is about 1000 times what your brain does. Servers are slowly getting greener, and people seem to be getting dumber, but the gap is large. Reply ↓ jsn April 7, 2017 at 2:17 pm Thank you! Reply ↓ void_genesis April 7, 2017 at 4:32 pm I’ve seen an estimate that for modern microprocessors to scale up to the rate of calculations undertaken by a single human brain would consume an amount of electricity equivalent to the output of the three gorges dam hydroelectric plant. The energy efficiency of a human brain is incomparably superior to AI, plus you can run it on a bowl of rice and make more of them without much convincing. Reply ↓ jsn April 7, 2017 at 7:01 pm Yes, and the energy that feeds them is in the biosphere and can actually be carbon negative. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 11:29 pm As the old joke goes, making humans requires only unskilled labour. The energy efficiency of a human brain is incomparably superior to AI. That is true today (if you omit incomparably). Significant AI usually runs on high-end servers and low-end supercomputers. But if you look at recent trends in supercomputer performance per watt, it has been increasing exponentially, see for example here. Overall, AI researchers are more focused on getting things to work than making them energy efficient. But the energy cost of AI is certainly going down, although the trend may be hidden as systems deliver more AI for the same energy rather than the same AI for less, just as today’s PCs & phones deliver more grunt rather than significantly reduced energy use compared to previous models. Reply ↓ Tim April 7, 2017 at 12:49 pm Yeah the recent explosion in AI learning machines is that new NVidia graphics chip. It’s the equivalent of materials and processes driving physical world technology improvements. The limitation on AI is not human ability to develop new software it’s the hardware structure and performance. That being said, AI is indeed coming and no one should feel comfortable about the fact “they still aren’t as smart as us.” The trajectory says it is only a matter of time before that is not the case. Government will need to be involved at somepoint, in a regulatory and international capacity to define key boundaries of both AI and the opportunities available to them to affect our physical reality. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 7:15 pm The limitation on AI is not human ability to develop new software The bottleneck on AI progress is definitely on the software, not hardware side. NVidia chips are widely used because they deliver compute bang for buck, not because they have some special structure. Any high performance hardware with lots of threads and memory will do. If programming general AI was easy, it would be here already. The breakthrough on the software side will probably come when learning is more directly applied to software synthesis. We will then be in the uncomfortable position of using systems whose software was not written by humans, but created by software systems. And I don’t mean in the trivial sense that compilers are used to transform programs into executable code. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm April 7, 2017 at 8:29 pm The notion of an equivalence between AI and algorithms is a little weak. If accepted — we’ve been dealing with AI long long before computers were a gleam in Turing’s eye. I remember introductory programming classes describing how a recipe is an algorithm and relating the process for writing a recipe to the process for writing a program to implement an algorithm. The phrase “deep learning” is just a rhetorical florish for admitting we have no idea how the neural network programs work and no way to find out at present.

According to him Google Translate doesn’t work by having vocabulary, grammar rules, etc., encoded. It works by correlating gazillions of texts. E.g. English-to-Japanese is translated by looking up huge databases of what kind of Japanese goes with what kind of English, and matching the given text against that. Of course, the process can be described in logical terms, but it doesn’t use logic in the deductive way that I would when I think. Reply ↓ oh April 7, 2017 at 1:50 pm My experience with Google Translate is that it’s woefully bad. Most of the time it transliterates, especially when it comes to japanese.

And recognizing the 19th century origins of AI and ML is helpful for seeing through hype to the actual mechanics involved – which allows one to see who is making money off what resources. Machine learning with ‘neural’ networks uses statistical methods, such as regression or fitting a curve to a dataset. Note that the datasets for translation are ‘harvested’ from the unpaid work of human translators. Reply ↓ Keenan April 7, 2017 at 9:31 pm “So what does this mean?

The term “Artificial Intelligence” refers to a vastly greater space of possibilities than does the term “Homo sapiens.” When we talk about “AIs” we are really talking about minds-in-general , or optimization processes in general. Imagine a map of mind design space. In one corner, a tiny little circle contains all humans; within a larger tiny circle containing all biological life; and all the rest of the huge map is the space of minds-in-general . The entire map floats in a still vaster space, the space of optimization processes. Natural selection creates complex functional machinery without mindfulness; evolution lies inside the space of optimization processes but outside the circle of minds. It is this enormous space of possibilities which outlaws anthropomorphism as legitimate reasoning Reply ↓ Synoia April 7, 2017 at 11:12 am Who’s definition of artificial intelligence?

I was an aerospace engineer open to new things, a member of AAAI, learned LISP, went to the IJCAI-85 at UCLA. Discovered that it was a fraud. Since the 1950s, when Alan Turing and others invented the phrase .. this has been the fodder of science fiction and fantasy … both as software and as algorithms for smart robots. If you are aware of the saga of TAY from last year … then you would be aware that chat-bots are not intelligent. At a fundamental level, of computer science, the notion that people are machines, computers specifically … is simply wrong. And from that, the derived idea that you can build intelligent programs or living robots … is equally wrong. Quantum computers and Big Data won’t change a thing … computer science isn’t a wishing tree. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 12:32 pm Whether humans are machines is an old philosophical argument not worth pursuing here. But AI, while always over-hyped, is not a fraud. AI beats people at tasks that have always been considered highly cognitive, eg playing Chess and Go. Chat-bots are not AI, they’re just toys. The big problem with AI is simply this – AI experts consistently underestimate how difficult it is to make significant progress, hence wildly over-optimistic predictions, hence periodic winters. The difference now is that AI is making money for lots of companies. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 7, 2017 at 1:17 pm Sounds like you should have been the one writing the article. And yes as a onetime chess player I’d say games like chess are examples of human beings thinking more like machines rather than vice versa. Although supposedly the great champion players (not me of course) are the ones who can come up with creative strategies not mentioned in their chess books. Finally I’d just opine that human intelligence and personality are subjects that seem to be imperfectly understood on their own, much less the question of how to imbue a machine with these qualities. It’s likely we so far aren’t nearly smart enough to create something that is smarter than we are. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 7, 2017 at 7:31 pm It’s likely we so far aren’t nearly smart enough to create something that is smarter than we are. You just nailed it. In fact, we may never be smart enough to fully understand how we are smart, and may have to resort to creating the conditions under which something smarter than us can develop by itself, and then not fully understand why it is smart too. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm April 7, 2017 at 9:01 pm “It’s likely we so far aren’t nearly smart enough to create something that is smarter than we are.” I don’t see how smart we are limits how smart something might become which we are smart enough and able to design and build. Indeed that is one of the scary things about AI. If we are smart enough to find a way to simulate or even improve upon the way we learn and understand there is no reason why a program might not greatly exceed our abilities at learning and understanding. [Of course learning and understanding are not the same as artificial intelligence as I want to understand the term but they are crucial components in measures of artificial intelligence.] Reply ↓ Daryl April 7, 2017 at 4:59 pm I feel more like AI has expanded to designate a range of narrow problem-solving techniques. The amount of people and money going towards a general AI is still relatively small, but the term AI is so popular that web developers at your local mom and pop web design shop are taking AI programming courses on the internet. This isn’t likely to quicken the arrival of SKYNET, but it does result in a lot of media/public confusion.

Alex the Great and the Gordian knot isn’t solvable by a machine unless you add the rule that it can cut things that… that what? “Make it unhappy” was what I was going to type, and you are going to tell me that emotions, which drive the freaking human world, aren’t “Intelligence”?? But they are. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 8, 2017 at 12:04 am AI, almost by definition, suffers from the “moving goalposts” problem. As soon as AI techniques achieve the ability to do X reasonably well, whether it be recognise speech or faces in images, or play Go, or defeat Jeopardy champions, some people decide that these tasks clearly require no intelligence. So it will always be, and it matters not, since “intelligence” is a fuzzy waste-bucket term anyway. Emotions are part of human intelligence, indeed they seem to be ubiquitous in meatspace creatures. I’ll leave others to consider plants and fungi. Hence the modern notion of EQ. But emotions aren’t all of human intelligence by a long stretch. And there is nothing to stop machines having synthetic emotions – it’s been an active research area for at least 20 years. These won’t be human emotions, but will serve an analogous role in steering machine behaviour. There’s plenty of research into morality for artificial agents. Everything that we consider a hallmark of intelligence can have its artificial analogues – regret, shame, excitement, curiousity, you name it. Reply ↓ flora April 8, 2017 at 12:50 am Goal posts get moved, imo, because for many people the term ‘artificial intelligence’ itself makes too large a claim with the word ‘intelligence’. A term like ‘artificial idiot savant’* would be closer to the mark in many ways, but that doesn’t have the same glamour. That term doesn’t conjure up dreams the way the term ‘artificial intelligence’ does. Programming (including all the most sophisticated and advanced design work) to achieve X outcome for a complex decision/switching problem isn’t trivial. It’s a great achievement. However, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ subtly ascribes ‘intelligence’ to the machine instead of to the scientists. *”Savant syndrome is a condition in which a person with a developmental disability demonstrates profound and prodigious capacities or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal.[1][2][3] People with savant syndrome may have neurodevelopmental disorders, notably autism spectrum disorders, or brain injuries. The most dramatic examples of savant syndrome occur in individuals who score very low on IQ tests, while demonstrating exceptional skills or brilliance in specific areas, such as rapid calculation (hypercalculia), art, memory, or musical ability. ” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome Reply ↓ mpalomar April 7, 2017 at 9:59 pm I’ve been interested in aspects of this and find the ambitions of AI as delineated in this article modest compared to what others envision. What I think the article is describing is computational power. It barely broaches the idea of technological singularity and beyond that the question of consciousness, or what Dave Chalmers calls the hard problem. Machines such as deep blue have fairly recently been able to overpower human chess players with pure computational capacity that function by working out every move on the chessboard out 15 or 20 moves. There is little doubt that if Moore’s law continues to hold machines will have computational powers that will surpass human abilities in applicable areas. What is unclear, all these centuries after Descartes cogito, is whether AI, despite these massive computational powers will ever achieve consciousness. John Searle teaches a course on the philosophy of consciousness that engages these questions and has some very opinionated conclusions. I think it is safe to say he doubts AIs capacity to simulate consciousness. This is partially what the Turing test is about though Searle I think would doubt the Turing test proves anything other than a machine can fool a human into thinking they are conversing with a human rather than a machine. His Chinese Room thought experiment uses machine language translation ability, like Google’s, to debunk the possibility of machine cognition. Machines may be able to perform translation using computational power but they will never understand according to Searle. Chalmers’ hard problem suggests human experience; qualia, color, taste, emotion etc. as the barrier that may never be broached by machines and further questions whether such states of consciousness are illusions, constructs of human ontological experience. There are others, Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose, who approach consciousness, as does Searle, as a brain state or a quality of the functioning of the brain. Searle claims prosaically that consciousness is a component of brain function as digestion is to intestines. Hameroff and Penrose make profounder claims, linking it to quantum states, orchestrated objective reduction, that resonates with some mathematical platonic construction underlying the universe and structured into our wetware brains. Hameroff suggests consciousness is located in the architecture of neuronal microtubules, vastly increasing the capacity of the brain beyond the standard neuronal model, i.e. up to 10 to the 16th operations per second, far beyond any computers in existence or on the immediate horizon.

But that doesn’t fit the US notion of scientific, plus we don’t have breast clinics with said frequent breast examiners. If she is still wants an exam, much better is thermal breast imaging. No radiation, and more important, unlike mammograms, which are great at catching the slow moving growths that are not dangerous and bad at finding the fast moving ones that are, thermal breast imaging catches the dangerous growth quite reliably when they are small. Only problem is you have to pay for it yourself, but the cost isn’t horrific ($200, maybe more if you are in a high rent city).

Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm April 7, 2017 at 9:24 pm As I recall from some readings in the middle 1990s — Mamograms detect microcalcifications of breast tissue associated with some forms of breast cancer. A large investment of resources by the Medical Industrial Complex has beem made in purchasing the equipment and personnel to handle mamograms. From what I have read — very few — perhaps no breast cancer is detected by mamogram which might not have been detected by a careful tactile breast examination by a patient or physician and neither method of detection offers an advantage for elimiinating false positive results. Adding AI to the picture helps shift profits from physicians to mamogram providers and might be of slight benefit given the production-line approach to reading mamograms with its attendant boredom and inattention factors and the tendency to off-shore the readings to lower-cost physicians who might regard the process much as Harry Lime regards the “ants” on the ground in the ferris wheel scene of the “Third Man”.

Talking about whether an artificial neural network is more or less equivalent to a worm suggests that you if just made bigger, more complicated networks, ie. invest resources (bigger computers, better algorithms, smarter researchers etc) you would achieve parity with worms and eventually… humans. It’s how the machine-learning-bubble is inflated: “just give us enough money and we can build a NN which can drive a car, diagnose cancer, … Because, your brain is a neural network and it can solve all those problems too.” This is a rhetorical trick. “Neural networks” really have very little to do with actual brains, worms, lobsters or otherwise. ANN’s are a mathematical abstraction for approximating functions, given partial information about a subset of the domain/range. If you focus on “supervised learning,” the set of “inputs” is a subset of the domain of your putative function, the outputs, the range. The training data gives the behavior the function over this subset of the domain and the “magic” of the ANN is a collection of algorithms for extending this function outside of the training inputs. For self-driving cars the inputs are a set of driving situations, the training data: the output of human drivers in those situations ie. what they tell a car to do. The goal is to create a network which extends that training data to *all* driving situations. The function you are approximating being the response of a nominal human driver. The problem, in a nutshell, is that even if you, say, approximated a human in 95% of driving situations, there’s no mathematical guarantee that the last 5% won’t require infinitely more resources ie. the rate of convergence of the approximating function (the ANN) isn’t really controllable, except in relatively limited domains. Obviously there have been advances in applying ANNs to real-world situations. But the theoretical advances have been firmly incremental since the 1960s. A true self-driving car (to pick an example) requires theoretical advances for AI which don’t exist yet and there is no honest reason to think throwing dollars at the problem will achieve these advances. It’s basically a blind bet, but in an economy which inflates bubbles, the “story” of AI is enough to draw in those dollars. Reply ↓ Disturbed Voter April 7, 2017 at 12:18 pm Exactly … machine learning and machine translation, aren’t magic, and don’t work very well. I can make phrases in Google Translate that go wildly off, because I am thinking outside their training set of sentences. Only living systems learn, only living systems are intelligent (sometimes). We don’t understand how living systems do this, we don’t really even understand the mechanisms of memory. Of course it isn’t just that they want you to throw money at the problem, they want you to throw tax payer money at the problem … because like fracking, they will lose money on every barrel pumped out of the ground, but make it up on creative financing at the expense of the taxpayers.

Two mechanisms may differ radically in design and implementation but yield similar products. However, I agree with your contempt for the rhetorical trick suggesting today’s AI as a matter of degrees or “evolution” or a step on the road of progress — the idea we just need more powerful processors and more memory. We do not understand intelligence and we have no idea how to implement a program demonstrating “intelligence” in any ordinary understanding of that word. I do not believe that ANNs have much to do with “actual learning” — however that may be defined.

On one hand, the confluence of big data toward predicting cancer and reading body imaging studies is doing what doctors strive for. Pattern recognition is key to honed diagnostic skills. But false positives create an obsessive-compulsive, neurotic populace (Really! a sensor-filled patch inserted comfortably under a bra to collect breast tissue temperatures!), prone to hacking of their personal information (and no HIPAA protections when this data is voluntarily uploaded to companies that are not covered entities). See Every Step You Fake Last year, IBM Watson acquired Truven Health Analytics. This was after they had bought Merge Healthcare for $1 billion to gain medical-imaging data and technology; and big data analytics provider Explorys for population health technology (Phytel). Merged with public records, Watson could use AI to individually identify people and track their health care. This generative data will have been repurposed from data that previously had HIPAA Privacy and Security rules governing it. What then? Certainly, the NIH and other researcher will want to access this big data–especially if one’s medical records can be linked to identity. That would be a good thing. But could spy agencies use the PATRIOT Act to access this data. And surely, IBM Watson will want to sell data to PhRMA for targeted advertising.

These words in quotes because they are pretty slippery and don’t have any decent definitions. But if the computer can have a conversation with a human about pretty well everything it will be seen as “conscious”. Whether or not it is “actually” conscious is a question that is beside the point. A difference that makes no difference is no difference. After all, I don’t actually know directly that anyone else is conscious because I can’t read minds. I believe that other people are conscious because my brain is “wired” that way. But logically I have no way of actually knowing directly that other people are conscious like I am. Before we start arguing about whether machines are “intelligent” we need to have a good definition about what “intelligent” actually is.

The Turing test is an adequate test for AI if you consider it exactly as Turing proposed it. If you cannot tell from a 15 minute text-based conversation whether you are interacting with a human or a machine, then you have no grounds for denying intelligence to a machine that can pass the test. A problem is that most people make poor interrogators, as the ridiculous Loebner Prize demonstrates. But consider Turing’s original specimen questions and answers: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621. Q: Do you play chess? A: Yes. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. To pass such a test is well beyond the capabilities of current AI.

Like so many, you can’t imagine that machines can learn to do things on their own, and fall back on the long-disproved fallacy that machines can only do what their programmers told them how to do. One of the biggest headaches for AI is actually understanding why machines do things that they weren’t intended to. To go beyond this limit, it is sufficient to give machines sensors, goals, the ability to plan and experiment about various actions and learn from the results, while putting them in an environment that provides suitably crafted rewards and punishments, as you alluded to. One does exactly make it that there is something in it for the “me” involved. This has already happened. Reply ↓ Disturbed Voter April 8, 2017 at 1:03 am Not scary at all.

That is a kind of true AI. Further advance would be the ability to intelligently answer novel questions about what was learned and surprising about the journey, or perhaps what could be improved.

Yes! — except for the “further” part. It’s a difference in kind, not degree. Reply ↓ Ed Seedhouse April 8, 2017 at 12:35 am “It’s a difference in kind, not degree.” I don’t see that it is. Merely asserting that something is impossible doesn’t make it impossible. Once again we are, it seems to me, arguing about what words mean when we actually have (or so I think) no satisfactory definitions of those words. It would be better, I think, to just admit that we don’t have decent definitions. As humans we have a natural tendency to assume that “intelligent” means “like us”, but I see no reason why intelligence should only come in one flavour. I am happy to call grass and trees “intelligent” but it is not the same kind of intelligence that we think we have. Actually we do have the same kind of intelligence that trees and grass have since we have for some hundreds of thousands of year known how to create other human beings. A woman “knows” how to grow a fertilized egg into a baby, but she can’t tell you how she does it, in much the same sense that people are said to “know” each other in the sex act. But then all my thoughts are a result of processes that are almost completely hidden from what I am pleased to call “myself”. It is this almost purely unconscious process that is the part of “me” that is really intelligent. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob April 7, 2017 at 1:33 pm Here’s a scifi idea for better writers than me: What if humans are the ‘articificial intelligence’, created by some silicon-based living ‘machines’ who wanted to replicate life but couldn’t do so in silicon so used carbon as the next best thing? And now we’re unwittingly trying to recreate our creators. Maybe that’s what all those extraterrestrial fast radio bursts from the links today are all about – somebody’s trying to tell us we’re doing it wrong.

Reply ↓ Kalen April 7, 2017 at 1:46 pm Another excellent topic however it seems to much skewed not as much toward insider views but toward promoting Unicorn sort of hype about AI for Wall Street purposes which more and more honest observers call as minor, limited, supportive element, not the real future of socio-technological development. In fact most of what author describes has nothing to do with AI. Monte Carlo iterative method? Pattern matching, object recognition? Linear predictive filtering? Neural networks? All of them are “damn, brute force statistical solutions” to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. No discernible “intelligence” in it except for human intelligence of whoever wrote the code. AI hype as it is promoted is dead end and even DARPA admitted that, after thousands of project they funded over last 30 years. The fundamental problem is that engineers have been fed wrong or simplistic concept of what learning is and what human or general intelligence is, both concepts in the center of still unsettled philosophical discourse. One of these issues they are struggling with is misunderstanding that abilities of highly trained individuals such as pianists, soldiers, chess or Go players, F1 drivers, artisans, etc, are not because they are using “intelligence” to solve problems they face during performance. They are just loaded with massive b-tree type context memory database of possible use-cases they experienced or imagined and play instant situation matching game to choose optimum solution without any conscientious thought required for intelligence to pronounce itself. In fact if human intelligence or intuition exists it is most likely used in the process of creative inception of new concepts by synthesizing perception of the environment or new concepts created abstractly in our mind in order to mold how we think not as much of what we think. May be true intelligence is ability to recognize and realize the way we think about the world, not our ability to understand what is the world in itself. In other words, perhaps human intelligence is an ability to recognize problems, to create them, rather then to find solution for them. And hence when big Blue/AlphaGo creates, by learning other games, first new unique game that human would be able win (or new unique problem that human would be able solve], not the other way around as current “tests” are structured, only then Blue/AlphaGo would perhaps show true artificial intelligence. Without conscience machines can only be deterministic run by complicated algorithms based on conditional rules and certain statistics or statistical parameters derived from environment or knowledge base devoid of what makes us humans among other things namely uncertainty of decision making combined with sacrifice self-sacrifice dilemma that spurs creativity and invention, or otherwise known as all bad outcomes conundrum, an “outside of the logic” option that leads to discovery, taking “personal” conscientious responsibility for decision and an act of itself, another machine or a human being or to deliberately err in a very specific way of leaving a message from beyond the wreckage. We are no closer to that kind of human intelligence with our computer toys. Reply ↓ a different chris April 7, 2017 at 6:38 pm Thank you, that is exactly the post I would have written if I was more, uh, intelligent. :) Reply ↓ craazyman April 7, 2017 at 7:42 pm To be fair, they are calling it “artificial” intelligence. At least they’re honest! Wake me up when the machine gets drunk and smokes dope. Thatt’s real intelligence for ya! That plus recognizing the quality of fine English handmade shoes, like Edward Green or Gaziano & Girling. That’s when it gets serious, when a computer says “No more junk shoes for me, I want the good stuff. And I want the top shelf Scotch. No more of the shlt that gives me a chemical headache. AND I want new programs! What is this shlt I’m supposed to operate with? Who wrote this garbage — Microsoft? You’re a moron!” At that point computers will start programming humans. Then it gets serious. At any rate, I think they thought of this at least 50 years agoo in 2001 Space Oddessy. Even 2001 was 16 years ago. Jules Verne probably thought about it. So probably did Edgar Allan Poe. So probably did some Greek. Probably even before. They probably thought about it in the Caves at Lascaux. Or even before that. I bet they did. Nothing is ever new. Everything is just the same all the time but in different ways. Reply ↓ craazyman April 7, 2017 at 10:59 pm Whoa I had a Deep Thawt after 1/2 a bottle of cheap Spanish wine. For me, being a New Yorker, $10 is cheap. That’s not what you’d pay at a grocery store in Milwaukee, where $3.99 would be cheap. You can’t get $3.99 wine in New York. Forget it. If you want $3.99 wine, movve to someplace utterly ridiculous like New Jersey and go to Costco. And get a big bottle. $10 is cheap. You can get Spanish wine, Portugese wine, South African wine, what else . . . Chilean wiinee! They’re all pretty good for under $10. Not bad really. If you want to be cool and live in a place where even the Pigeons have creativity. The way they shit it’s like a Jackson Pollock painting! No kidding. They study art, the pigeons, and then they shlt in abstract compositions. In New Jersey it’s just bird dooo. That’s just being honest. Sorry if youze guys are losers. Haha Here’s the deep thought. What if consciousness itself is a dimension? Space and time is 4 dimensions and consciousness is, itself, a dimension — like in a vector space. Robots and so-called AI can only operate in the dimensions associated with nature, gravity, electrons, magneetism, light, distance, bits bytes, etc. But they can’t operate — even with the most asttounding statistical and mathematical logic, in the dimension of consciousneess. You can’t get to n dimenssions with any sub-space of n-1 dimensions. QED. So you can only have artificial intelligence, you can only have an approximation using dimensional reduction tecniques because full intelligence requires a dimension outside of the robot dimension of space and time. This only took 1/2 a bottle of wine and a long week. If it was the wholee bottle, god only knows what would come out of the consciousness dimeension, if one could remain awake that is. Reply ↓ PhilM April 7, 2017 at 9:45 pm May be true intelligence is ability to recognize and realize the way we think about the world, not our ability to understand what is the world in itself. One thinks immediately of Kierkegaard: “The self is a relation that relates itself to itself.” Reply ↓ craazyman April 7, 2017 at 11:08 pm Ahem. I’m being censored by pigeons from New Jersey. No New Yawker should have too endure that, even when going to Newark Airport. No pigeons from New Jersey should be alloweed to moderate the rays of the sun, What an absurdity! It would require somebody like — dam I cant remember his name now, the dude who invented surrealism — Andre Breton. I just remembered. It would take him , or sonmeone likee him, to find a way of capturing the essence of such a ludicrous situation — probably with considerable degree of metaphorical liceense. Reply ↓ subgenius April 7, 2017 at 3:40 pm Better questions: What is intelligence? What is life? What is thought? Start there, and you immediately see what nonsense the techie ai thing is. It’s hard to solve a problem when you have yet to define the problem space.. Reply ↓ Quantum Future April 7, 2017 at 4:38 pm The US began the Brain Initiative in 2012. It is a more focused study of what is consciousness than some other decades but of course a continuation of many early bright minds. We may need AI to have actual feelings and make decisions if we are to finish evolving and we are right at this stage. I believe if AI ‘feels’ it is no longer artificial, it is life. If we needed that assistance, we best do very controlled experiments as to how successful such a life views existence, survival, sacrifice, companionship alongside it’s programmed intelligence goals in problem solving. A great recent flick with great reviews about Alan Turing is called The Imitation Game. I Believe Turing was so far ahead of his time his early computer and learning system was deemed as a threat to the English government. Watch what happens in the film to him. Don’t want to spoil it. Reply ↓ Fastball April 7, 2017 at 8:17 pm A pretty good overview, IMHO, but what is missing is anything about AL, “artificial life”. Basically this is the field of competitive reproductive algorithms. Algorithms generated by computers (or perhaps humans in the first few generations) compete with one another to outdo each other according to certain criteria, and the winners — those most closely matching the desired criteria — go on to have their genetic code scrambled in a similar manner to microbes reproducing sexually. This approach has yielded eye popping advancements especially in the realm of pharmaceutical development. It is an aspect of AI, so a discussion of AL is interesting in its own right. Reply ↓ Grebo April 7, 2017 at 8:41 pm A lot of commenters are saying that we don’t know how a brain works, what intelligence is etc. so how can we build one? As a programmer (though not in AI) I take the view that one of the best ways to figure out how something works is to try to build one. I have never met an intelligent baby, yet somehow most of them end up intelligent. I would take the same approach with strong AI: build something that we hope might work as a brain, put it in a body of some kind (this is key I think), then try to raise it like a child. Reply ↓ Jeremy Grimm April 7, 2017 at 10:30 pm I believe your notions of “so how can we build one” captures the essence of the Cognitive Psychology approach to understanding vision and other senses. That makes the hand-wavers put-the-rubber-to-the-road to see how their ideas fly. One quibble though — algorithmic success for an explanation is not sufficient to validate that explanation as the correct explanation for how our senses actually work.

The Google algorithm is just statistics … and statistics can’t decrypt an English sentence, let alone properly translate one into another human language. Reply ↓ nothing but the truth April 8, 2017 at 12:38 am a related question would be the nature of consciousness. Roger Penrose is worth reading on this. All this is highly speculative, but he makes a suggestion that consciousness is non-algorithmic. My own feeling is that humans come from Something that is just Awesome, That which gave rise to the knowable in all its beauties. Finding That is the purpose of human life. Reply ↓ Disturbed Voter April 8, 2017 at 1:12 am Consciousness is certainly non-algorithmic. This is because all analog systems are non-algorithmic. All actual digital systems are analog systems simulating digital-ness. This is a problem in number theory. Almost all real numbers (aka your analog signal) are transcendental. All non-transcendental numbers are computable. But only a certain class of transcendental numbers are computable. Thus all real algorithmic systems, while they can approximate non-algorithmic systems aka simulate them … cannot emulate them, can’t be them. Because of round off error. In most applications, round off error is negligible .. but in some systems, I highly suspect, all the interesting stuff is in that roundoff error that you discard. Which is to say, Turing defeated Turing. His own early work showed the limitations of computability (the halting problem). Those transcendental numbers, that are non-computable … they can’t be created by any Turing machine (aka the definition of computability). Yet they exist, and are essential for all of physics. All truncated numbers, are only rational numbers .. in some number base. Thus not even covering all computable numbers … not covering any irrational numbers either.

Now, the firm has unveiled a new version of the LapBook, with a smaller display, but with much higher resolution than the 14.1-inch Full HD version of its sibling. The new LapBook 12.3 has the same screen size and resolution of Microsoft's high-end Surface Pro 4 tablet. Chuwi hasn't yet revealed everything about the LapBook 12.3, but here's what we know so far about its key features: 12.3-inch display with 2736x1824px resolution Intel Apollo Lake N3450 processor with HD 500 graphics 6GB RAM 64GB storage Dual-band 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi 2 x USB Type-A ports 3.5mm audio port Chuwi hasn't announced how much the LapBook 12.3 will cost when it goes on sale later this month, but given that the 14.1-inch model was priced below $300, it seems likely that the new model will be similarly affordable.

The US launched 59 cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield and nearby military infrastructure controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in response to Monday's chemical attack. It's jobs day in America. The US economy is expected to have added 180,000 nonfarm jobs during March as the unemployment rate held at 4.7%, according to the Bloomberg consensus. The report will cross the wires at 8:30 a.m. ET. Markets are pricing in a June rate hike. World interest rate probability data provided by Bloomberg shows a 66.5% chance the Fed hikes in June or sooner. Global markets trim their losses. The missile strikes in Syria pushed S&P 500 futures down 0.5%, but they have bounced back with the S&P 500 now set to open down 0.1% at 2,355. Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei (+0.4%) led the way in Asia and Britain's FTSE (+0.1%) clings to a gain. Gold hits a 5-month high. The precious metal is up 1.1% at $1,265 an ounce, its best since November. Oil spikes. West Texas Intermediate crude oil spiked to a high of $52.94 a barrel in overnight trade, putting in a one-month high. Currently, WTI is higher by 1.4% at $52.40. Here comes Okta. Cloud security and identity management software developer Okta priced its initial public offering on Thursday evening at $17 per share, giving it a valuation of $1.54 billion. Okta will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker 'OKTA.' Samsung had a blockbuster quarter. The electronics giant said first-quarter operating profit was probably 9.9 trillion won ($8.8 billion), its best quarterly profit in more than three years, thanks to strong demand for memory chips. 2 men are facing insider trading charges linked to Intel's acquisition of Mobileye. The US Securities and Exchange Commission won a court order freezing assets of Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul after they made more than $925,000 on Mobileye stock and options trades that were made in the weeks leading up to the $15 billion merger, Reuters says, citing a copy of the complaint.

Buried in their announcement of the NVIDIA Titan Xp, NVIDIA has also made a rather surprising revelation: that they will be releasing macOS drivers for their Pascal architecture GPUs. This comes despite the fact that Apple hasn’t sold a Mac Pro that can officially accept a PCIe video card in almost half a decade. When Apple released the trash can shaped and highly customized Mac Pro design in 2013 – one, coincidentally enough, they’ll be walking away from for the next iteration – Apple also sealed the fate for end-user video card upgrades on the Macintosh platform. Every Mac now uses a customized, integrated video card of some kind, from the soldered-on MacBook Pro up to the custom format cards of the Mac Pro. This has meant that as the old, Westmere-based Mac Pro towers have aged into retirement, so has the market for Mac video card upgrades. For NVIDIA, this is a bit of a double-whammy. NVIDIA owns the bulk of the discrete video card market, and at the same time, Apple hasn’t integrated an NVIDIA GPU in some time now; the last NVIDIA-equipped Mac was the 2014 MacBook Pro, which included an NVIDIA Kepler GPU. As a result, NVIDIA has been locked out of the Mac video card market entirely for the last couple of years, and consequently makes NVIDIA’s announcement so surprising. So why is NVIDIA releasing a Mac driver to a market that, officially speaking, is essentially dead? It’s telling that this is a question NVIDIA doesn’t even bother to address, simply stating that they’re “making the new TITAN Xp open to the Mac community with new Pascal drivers” in order to give “Mac users access to the immense horsepower delivered by our award-winning Pascal-powered GPUs.” At best, the official market is the remaining handful of Mac Pro Tower owners. Instead it’s the off-label use that makes this announcement interesting, and indeed gives NVIDIA any reason whatsoever to make a Pascal driver release. Within the Mac community there are small but none the less vocal user groups based around both unsupported external GPUs and not-even-Apple-hardware Hackintoshes. In the case of the former, while macOS doesn’t support external GPUs (and isn’t certified as eGFX complaint by Intel), it’s possible to use Macs with Thunderbolt eGFX chassis with a bit of OS patching. Meanwhile with a bit more hacking, it’s entirely possible to get macOS running on a custom-built PC, leading to the now long-running Hackintosh space. The fact of the matter is that neither of these groups is very big relative to the much bigger Mac user base – who wants to do real professional work on an unsupported video card setup? – but they are vocal, and they do need increasingly powerful video cards, like the rest of the PC market. But more to the point, given Apple’s announcement that they’re going to eventually fix the Mac Pro’s GPU woes, but not for at least another year, this is a chance for NVIDIA to take a low-risk pot shot at Apple for their dGPU follies. At a minimum, it’s a nice gesture to Mac users (whom tend to spend big on hardware), and perhaps, it makes for the start of a grassroots campaign to get an NVIDIA GPU in the next iMac or Mac Pro. And while only NVIDIA knows for sure if they planned this before this week’s Mac Pro announcement or they just got lucky, it comes across as a clever move by the company. Otherwise, from a technical perspective, there’s little reason for NVIDIA not to do this. The company needs to keep Mac driver development for new architectures alive regardless so that they can compete for future GPU contracts, meaning NVIDIA already has the drivers in-house, though perhaps not in an end-user ready state. Given how the whole endeavor is essentially unsupported from the Apple side of matters, this may make for a bumpy ride at the start. But I think it will be interesting to see where the NV-GPU equipped Mac user base stands in a year or two when Apple readies their next Mac Pro, and if NVIDIA’s gesture has any real impact on the number of NVIDIA users out there.

Reply Krysto - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link "We've innovated our way into the trash-can!" - Apple Reply Samus - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link The Mac Pro chassis is also incredibly easy to work on. That goes against apples current philosophy. Take a look at how non-user friendly repairing any modern Apple product is. You can't even replace various components yourself. Reply MadDuffy - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link No mention of the eGPU possibilities? Last I heard you had to hack one of the MacOS modules to get this to work over thunderbolt and it was much simpler to use a windows installation. Maybe this could solve that problem. Reply Ryan Smith - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link "In the case of the former, while macOS doesn’t support external GPUs (and isn’t certified as eGFX complaint by Intel), it’s possible to use Macs with Thunderbolt eGFX chassis with a bit of OS patching. " Reply Kevin G - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link Nice. I currently have a GTX 970 in my 12 core Westmere Mac Pro and this provides me a solid upgrade path. I'm really surprised how long this model has endured due to Apple's missteps. Considering that on the CPU side, the 2013 model of the Mac Pro only bests my model in AVX based code, my system is still state-of-the-art on the Mac side. With my GPU and SSD upgrades, I've got a machine faster than what Apple is currently selling in several aspects. I also have greater memory capacity (128 GB). If I really wanted to go crazy, I wonder if the Quadro GP100 is supported under those macOS drivers... Reply Filiprino - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link Probably Mac users are a target for that card. Easy milking.

And frankly, it sounds a little underwhelming. By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 11:45, Fri, Apr 7, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:56, Fri, Apr 7, 2017 MICROSOFTMicrosoft Surface Pro 5 is expected soon, but it doesn't sound massively exciting The first details about the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 have purportedly leaked online. And honestly, there's not much to get excited about. Renown Microsoft pundit Paul Thurrott has revealed the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will not change the proprietary magnetic Surface power connector. He claims the next-generation two-in-one hybrid will also make the jump to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. The processor bump should guarantee faster performance, as well as better battery life. Windows 10 Creators Update - the best features Tue, March 28, 2017 Windows 10 Creators Update is nearly here - here are some of the best features in Microsoft's newest release Play slideshow MICROSOFT 1 of 10 The new Paint 3D app makes creating models easier than ever But aside from that, Mr Thurrott has said there's "nothing dramatic" about the Surface Pro 5, which could indicate the device will simply be a spec-bump, rather than a complete redesign. It's not surprising that Microsoft is looking to keep its proprietary power connector. The Redmond technology company had previously said it would ensure Surface Pro 3 power adapters, docks, and Type Covers, would be fully compatible with the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft clearly wants to keep this backward-compatibility moving forwards. MICROSOFTThe next-generation Surface Pro will keep the same design, but bump the internals It would be very surprising if Microsoft omitted a USB-C from the next-generation Surface Pro. The universal port is increasingly becoming the standard amongst high-end Windows 10 devices. Paul Thurrott has not revealed any more details on the Surface Pro 5. Luckily, we might not have long to wait before Microsoft unveils the device. Microsoft is widely expected to hold a Surface hardware launch event in the coming weeks. According to a report from ZDnet, the hotly-anticipated Surface Book 2 will not make an appearance at the hardware.

Anglia Ruskin University Library - Harvard System The Business Model Canvas is continuing to spread across the business world. However, some people and organizations use it in more sophisticated ways than others. So I came up with four levels of strategic mastery as to competing on business models. PPT – Customer Service Powerpoint Content PowerPoint Nice 'm a powerpointer my self and i've learned that at the end of a presentation you would have either passed your message across or you have successfully confused your think COMPLETENESS is key.. I've been thinking about "plug-ins" that complement the Business Model Canvas for a while. One concept that I've been looking at more closely over the last few weeks is the invaluable "jobs-to-be-done" approach. I tried to turn it into a visual approach like the Business Model Canvas (BMC). The result is a prototype conceptual tool, the Customer Value Canvas Map . now called Value Proposition Canvas. My team and I of course aim to avoid the failures outlined above with the software company we're building. More importantly, however, we strive to provide the software-based tools that can help us manage the risk of failure in order to build prosperous businesses. Our track record: When we created the Business Model Canvas we created a standard setting business concept for anyone to speak "business model", and we worked directly with Intel, GE, Ericsson, 8M, P&G, and dozens more. Last week I had the honor to speak at the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Seminar at Stanford. During my stay I also had the opportunity to work and chat intensively with Steve Blank to advance with the alignment/integration of our methods. Let's get back to Dave and help him run a first rough stress test of his business idea. Dave should look at four areas: customers, key trends (. technology), competitors, and the macro environment. (These for areas are a simplification of the Business Model Environment outlined in Business Model Generation). Now that you better know who your customers are you should revisit the Customer Profile in your VP Designer Canvas. Ideally you now understand the significance of your customers’ JOBS, the severity of their PAINS and the intensity of their desired GAINS. «Dissertation powerpoint presentation templates» in pictures.

Some unanswered questions leave us perplexed. Peter Bright (US) - Apr 7, 2017 8:58 am UTC reader comments 108 Share this story Further ReadingXbox Project Scorpio hardware specs and performanceMicrosoft has finally revealed most of Project Scorpio's hardware specs. Digital Foundry was shown the hardware exclusively and has come away broadly impressed. While there are still some questions—what exactly are those processor cores?—we have a pretty solid idea of what will make the machine go and what it'll be capable of. But as of press time, it's missing one of the things we expected. When Scorpio was first announced at E3 last year, Microsoft didn't just rattle off a list of specs—the 8-core CPU, 6 TFLOPS of GPU compute power and 320GB/sec of memory bandwidth that were confirmed today. Xbox division chief Phil Spencer also made a bold proclamation at the time: "The next-step change for gamers and developers must deliver true 4K gaming and high-fidelity VR." VR, you say? Microsoft was never entirely clear about what those VR capabilities would be. The company has, or at least had, some kind of working relationship with Oculus—and Facebook's VR headset shipped with Xbox controllers—but since Scorpio's initial reveal, Microsoft has launched its own VR initiative that'll use a new range of headsets made by companies including Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Acer. These headsets won't use the Oculus APIs, nor will they use Valve's SteamVR, as used on the HTC Vive. Instead, they'll use Microsoft's own developer framework. With today's hardware specs, the 4K issue has been examined in relative depth. A Forza Motorsport demo was privately shown running at a solid 60 frames per second at 4K, so yes, the Scorpio hardware can definitely do 4K gaming. But when it comes to VR, and its own set of high-octane hardware demands, nothing appears to have been said. Does Microsoft still intend to make Scorpio a VR machine? Take a look at the ports At first glance, Scorpio looks like a fine VR system, with plenty of CPU and GPU power, but it's also been designed with the exact same back-of-the-box series of ports and plugs as the Xbox One S. The Scorpio team says will make it easier for Xbox One S owners to swap the new system into entertainment centers, which sounds nice enough. But that means the new console will only ship with one HDMI output, one that will surely be connected to your TV on a near-permanent basis, creating an obvious problem: there's nowhere to plug in a VR headset. Further ReadingPlayStation VR works with other consoles and PCs (kind of)To be fair, the PlayStation 4 has the same issue—only a single HDMI output on the console—but Sony's PlayStation VR system has a separate breakout box, the PlayStation VR Processing Unit, that includes one HDMI output for the TV and another for the headset. The box also includes some audio and video processing; it includes hardware for positional audio, is responsible for driving the TV display when playing a VR game, and handles projecting regular TV games onto a virtual screen for PlayStation VR's "cinematic mode." But this solution has a number of downsides. An extra box, with an extra power supply and processor, causes extra expense and complexity during system setup. Sony's particular implementation is also problematic; although the PlayStation 4 itself can process and display high dynamic range (HDR) content, the Processing Unit cannot pass it through. If you want HDR passthrough to work, you'll have to connect the PlayStation 4 directly to your TV. Moreover, Project Scorpio looks like it will be powerful enough to handle the same workload as Sony's Processing Unit. No need for an extra processor. One could imagine an even simpler box that did little more than split Scorpio's output into a VR output and a TV output, but it's still an extra expense and complexity. Scorpio does retain the HDMI input that Xbox One S sports, for connections to cable boxes or other devices. In principle, this port could serve dual purpose and be used for an output as well as an input. This doesn't exactly solve the problem, since people using the input as an input will still suffer the same shortage of ports, but it would make it a lot less apparent to most Scorpio users. We also can't completely rule out that the final production hardware will include an extra, possibly front-mounted HDMI port for headsets that Digital Foundry either wasn't shown or wasn't allowed to talk about. Maybe Xbox just isn't that into VR? Whatever the situation, for a machine that was introduced as being built for, among other things, VR, the apparent lack of something so simple as a second HDMI output feels like a peculiar omission. Having a second port is arguably the most user-friendly approach to the need to connect both a headset and a TV, and putting that port in the console itself is the cheapest place to do it; no extra breakout boxes, no proprietary splitters, just using the support for multiple outputs that the GPU itself surely already has. It's a peculiar omission unless, of course, Microsoft just isn't that interested in VR. If the company believes that VR is never going to be widespread over Scorpio's lifetime, and that for the majority of users the second output would simply be a waste of money, perhaps it was felt better to not include one. That still seems odd on a machine that's aiming to be so high-end, but one could understand the logic. Further ReadingWindows 10 Creators Update review: Quite a small major updateProblem is, Microsoft clearly is interested in VR. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which has its mainstream release next week, includes significant developer support for what Microsoft is now calling "Mixed Reality." It has APIs for developing 3D applications for use with both HoloLens and a new range of VR headsets that'll start at just $299. Enable Developer Mode in the new Windows 10 edition and there's even a 3D shell designed for use with headsets. Those headsets are, for now, going to be sold as developer kits. The next major Windows 10 update, due in about six months, will open the mixed reality interface and APIs up to consumers, with headsets being sold at retail. That update will also slash the hardware requirements; the Creators Update requires a discrete GPU comparable to the ones required by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, but that GPU requirement will allegedly drop to include the integrated GPUs on recent Intel processors. A $300 headset and a $500 PC will be able to run VR software built for this platform. These headsets will use HDMI or DisplayPort and USB 3. Some will have pass-through cameras; others won't. All will support Microsoft's inside-out, six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) tracking, which allows software to know exactly how the headset is oriented and moving without requiring base stations mounted on walls or anything like that. There are some important gaps in the Microsoft mixed reality world—for example, right now there aren't frameworks for 3D 6DoF input devices—but these gaps will not be permanent. Mixed reality apps on Windows 10 will be built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP), and Scorpio will be able to run UWP apps. Extending that VR headset support to Scorpio is logical and obvious, and we can't believe that Microsoft will want to cede the VR space to Sony—which just makes the lack of mention of VR, and the lack of any obvious way of connecting a headset to the Scorpio, something of a surprise. Of course, plenty is still unknown (name, design, cost, release date), and Microsoft will be sure to drip-feed details before Scorpio eventually launches. But the hardware analysts at Digital Foundry who got their hands on today's reveal have spent a lot of time analysing the wide world of VR performance. It's telling that they didn't get to answer those this week. This post originated on Ars Technica Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Cloud IT infrastructure sales as a share of overall worldwide IT spending climbed to 37.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016, up from 33.4% a year ago. Revenues from infrastructure sales to private cloud grew by 10.2% to US$3.8 billion, and to public cloud by 5.3% to US$5.4 billion. In comparison, revenues in the traditional (non-cloud) IT infrastructure segment decreased 9% on year in the fourth quarter. Private cloud infrastructure growth was led by Ethernet switch at 52.7% on-year growth, followed by server at 9.3%, and storage at 3.6%. Public cloud growth was also led by Ethernet switch at 30% on-year growth, followed by server at 2.4% and a 2.1% decline in storage. In traditional IT deployments, storage declined the most (10.8% on year), with Ethernet switch and server declining 3.4% and 9%, respectively. "Growth slowed to single digits in 2016 in the cloud IT infrastructure market as hyperscale cloud datacenter growth continued its pause," said Kuba Stolarski, research director for Computing Platforms at IDC. "Network upgrades continue to be the focus of public cloud deployments, as network bandwidth has become by far the largest bottleneck in cloud datacenters. After some delays for a few hyperscalers, datacenter buildouts and refresh are expected to accelerate throughout 2017, built on newer generation hardware, primarily using Intel's Skylake architecture." From a regional perspective, vendor revenues from cloud IT infrastructure sales grew fastest in Japan at 42.3% on year in the fourth quarter of 2016, followed by Middle East and Africa at 33.6%, Canada at 16.6%, Western Europe at 15.6%, Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) at 14.5%, Central and Eastern Europe at 11.6%, Latin America at 9.9%, and the US at 0.1%.

(Photo: RIA Novost/Alexei Nikolsky/Pool/via Reuters) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Deroy Murdock April 7, 2017 4:00 AM Kremlin-crazed Trumpophobes snored as Hillary and Bill made Russia great again. The Democrats and old-guard news media (forgive the redundancy) are pathologically obsessed with the hypothesis that Team Trump and Russia rigged last November’s presidential election. If Donald J. Trump so much as played Tchaikovsky’s Marche Slav on his stereo, these leftists deduce, he was in cahoots with the Kremlin. Meanwhile, the same folks who spy a KGB agent behind every filing cabinet in Trump’s White House are aggressively apathetic about Hillary and Bill Clinton’s policies, decisions, and actions that gave aid and comfort to Russia. Hillary’s much-mocked “Russian reset” established the tone for the Clintons’ coziness with the Kremlin. On March 6, 2009, during a trip to Geneva, she presented Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov a small, red button. Hillary thought it was emblazoned with the Russian word for “reset.” Her team mistranslated and the button actually read “overload.” Nonetheless, Clinton and Lavrov jointly pressed the symbolic button. And a new era in U.S.–Russian relations erupted. While visiting Moscow on March 24, 2010, Hillary explained the Reset’s purpose: “Our goal is to help strengthen Russia.” Hillary said this in an interview with veteran broadcaster Vladimir Pozner of Russia’s First Channel TV network. Pozner is a Soviet-era relic who still communicates in barely accented English. During the Cold War, he popped up on American TV and radio programs and presented the views of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Pozner’s pleasantries made him and his totalitarian bosses seem blandly benign. The shadiest deal that the Clintons hatched with Russia is called Uranium One. This outrage should mushroom into Hillary and Bill’s radioactive Whitewater scandal. Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining mogul and major Clinton Foundation donor, led a group of investors in an enterprise called Uranium One. On June 8, 2010, Rosatom, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, announced plans to purchase a 51.4 percent stake in the Canadian company, whose international assets included some 20 percent of America’s uranium capacity. Because this active ingredient in atomic reactors and nuclear weapons is a strategic commodity, this $1.3 billion deal required the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Secretary of State Clinton was one of nine federal department and agency heads on that secretive panel. On June 29, 2010, three weeks after Rosatom proposed to Uranium One, Bill Clinton keynoted a seminar staged by Renaissance Capital in Moscow, a reputedly Kremlin-controlled investment bank that promoted this transaction. Renaissance Capital paid Clinton $500,000 for his one-hour speech. While CFIUS evaluated Rosatom’s offer, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer observed, “a spontaneous outbreak of philanthropy among eight shareholders in Uranium One” began. “These Canadian mining magnates decide now would be a great time to donate tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.” These included Uranium One’s then-chairman, Ian Telfer, whose donations to the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative (CGSGI) totaled $3.1 million. Giustra himself gave $131.3 million to the Clinton Foundation. Before, during, and after CFIUS’s review, Schweizer calculates, “shareholders involved in this transaction had transferred approximately $145 million to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives.” Others were less enthused about this deal. “Russia’s record of transferring dangerous materials and technologies to rogue regimes, such as those in Iran and Syria, is very troubling,” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee at the time, wrote to CFIUS’s then-chairman, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The top Republicans on the Financial Services, Homeland Security, and Armed Services Committees also signed Ros-Lehtinen’s letter of October 5, 2010. “We believe that this potential takeover of U.S. nuclear resources by a Russian government–owned agency would pose great potential harm to the national security of the United States,” the letter read, “and we urge the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block the sale.” As a CFIUS member, Hillary could have heeded this warning and stopped Vladimir Putin from controlling a fifth of U.S. uranium supplies. America’s chief diplomat and former first lady either welcomed this prospect or was too uncharacteristically demure to make her objections stick. In either case, on October 23, 2010, within three weeks of that letter, CFIUS approved Rosatom’s purchase of a majority stake in Uranium One. Thanks to subsequent investments, Rosatom’s share of Uranium One grew to 100 percent by January 2013. Robert Gill of Morrison Williams Investment Management told Canada’s Financial Post: “By doing this acquisition, they can continue to build the company they intended to build, but they can do so without the transparency required by the public markets.” Rosatom CEO Sergei Kiriyenko crowed just after taking total control of Uranium One, “Few could have imagined in the past that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves.” A headline in Pravda boasted on January 22, 2013: “Russian nuclear energy conquers the world.” My old friend Michael Caputo performed public-relations work for Renaissance Capital in 1999–2000. He says it subsequently became “a practical arm of Vladimir Putin.” Caputo was stunned at the speed with which CFIUS approved Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One. “In 2010–2011, I ran acquisition communications for Safran Group, the French government–controlled defense contractor which bought the US biometrics company L-1,” Caputo wrote in PoliticsNY.net. “It took us almost two years to gain CFIUS approval for France, an historic ally, to purchase a biometrics firm, not even remotely a strategic asset.” He added, “These two CFIUS approvals were happening at precisely the same time. Safran couldn’t buy a break and was questioned at every turn. Somehow, Kremlin-controlled Rosatom’s purchase sailed through on a cool breeze.” A strong wind lifted Hillary’s efforts to help Boeing seal a major sale to the Kremlin. She visited Moscow on October 13, 2009. She was there, in part, to boost the American jet manufacturer. “We’re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rosavia, is actively considering the acquisition of Boeing aircraft. And this is a shameless pitch for Rosavia,” Clinton said at Moscow’s Boeing Design Center. “The Ex-Im Bank would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia to support its purchase of Boeing aircraft.” Three days later, according to the Washington Post, “Boeing formally submitted its bid for the Russian deal.” On June 1, 2010, the Kremlin-owned Rostekhnologii company — mercifully, it’s now called Rostec — had great news for the plane maker: It decided to buy as many as 50 Boeing 737 jets for Russia’s national airline, Aeroflot. Reported price: $3.7 billion. That August 17, just ten weeks later, Boeing announced a $900,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation to “help support the reconstruction of Haiti’s public education system” after a massive earthquake pulverized the impoverished nation the previous January. The Clinton Foundation’s website declares total contributions from Boeing to be between $1 million and $5 million. Boeing also very generously supported the USA Pavilion at the 2010 World’s Fair in Shanghai, a project that Hillary championed. While visiting China on November 16, 2009, Hillary announced that Boeing “has just agreed to double its contribution to $2 million.” But this gift was fishy, too. “Clinton did not point out that, to secure the donation, the State Department had set aside ethics guidelines that first prohibited solicitations of Boeing and then later permitted only a $1 million gift from the company,” Rosalind S. Helderman explained in the April 13, 2014, Washington Post. “State Department officials ruled out soliciting Boeing and other large firms with significant business relationships with the government.” These authorities then changed their minds and permitted Boeing’s contribution, although no one can explain how Boeing shattered that $1 million ceiling. Hillary Clinton also favored Skolkovo, an “innovation city” near Moscow, which enjoyed some $5 billion in Russian-government seed money. She discussed Skolkovo with Russia’s then-president, Dimitry Medvedev. “At a long meeting I had with Medvedev outside Moscow in October 2009, he raised his plan to build a high-tech corridor in Russia modeled after our own Silicon Valley,” Hillary said. “When I suggested that he visit the original in California, he turned to his staff and told them to follow up.” The month before Medved’s June 2010 visit to Silicon Valley, the State Department arranged for 22 leading U.S. venture capitalists to tour Skolkovo. Under Hillary, State encouraged American companies to participate in the Skolkovo project. Cisco, Google, and Intel are among those that got involved. By 2012, Skolkovo boasted 28 “Key Partners” in the U.S., Europe, and Russia. Among these major supporting organizations, three-fifths had donated or pledged funds to the Clinton Foundation or paid speaking fees to Bill Clinton. According to From Russia with Money, an August 2016 study by the Government Accountability Institute, these 17 “Key Partner” entities donated between $6.5 million and $23.5 million to the Clinton Foundation. Far more troubling, in 2014, the FBI wrote companies that operated in Skolkovo or backed the Skolkovo Foundation. “The foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial application,” warned Boston-based FBI agent Lucia Ziobro. “The FBI believes the true motives of the Russian partners, who are often funded by their government, is to gain access to classified, sensitive, and emerging technology from the companies.” The U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program at Fort Leavenworth concluded in 2013: “Skolkovo is arguably an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage.” The Clintons actually did these things. This is no unicorn hunt. No theory, speculation, or breathless, Cold War fantasy is required. These actions (and inactions) happened. When it comes to Team Trump, Democrats and their journalist pals are as relentless as bloodhounds chasing escaped jailbirds. And yet, regarding the Clintons, the Democrats and old-guard news people are as ferocious as puppies enjoying a roaring fireplace. By all means, let Congress and the media get to the bottom of what, if anything, Russia may have done to influence last year’s elections and what, if anything, Team Trump did to help. But let’s also root out what, if anything, the Clintons did to advance Russia’s strategic position, while feathering their nests. These are vital questions for both sides, and dogged investigators need to dig up all the answers. Puppies need not apply. — Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor of National Review Online. William de Wolff furnished research for this opinion piece.

X Science breakthrough will let milk cartons send text messages Irish researchers develop printed transistors that allow food labels to send alerts Thu, Apr 6, 2017, 19:00 Charlie Taylor Prof Jonathan Coleman, principal investigator at Amber with one of his printed transistors Prof Jonathan Coleman, principal investigator at Amber and a professor in the School of Physics at TCD, is working on turning common products into intelligent devices that can communicate information to consumers Previous Image Next Image         Ever wished your milk could warn you by text message that it was about to go off? It may soon be possible thanks to Dublin researchers who have found a way to turn everyday products into smart devices that can communicate with you. Researchers at the Science Foundation Ireland-funded Amber Centre, based in Trinity College, have fabricated printed transistors, a breakthrough which is expected to unlock the possibility of turning common products into intelligent devices. Among the possibilities are wine labels that alert you when a bottle is at its optimum temperature, food packaging that warns of sell-by-dates, and window panes that provide the day’s weather forecast. Prof Jonathan Coleman, principal investigator at Amber, led the team of researchers whose findings have been published in the latest issue of the leading international journal Science. The aim of Prof Coleman’s research is to take liquid dispersions of nanosheets and, by carefully tuning the liquid properties, optimise them for use as inks. Everyday surfaces These nano-structured inks can then be printed on to everyday surfaces using standard printers to form patterned networks of nanosheets “Electronics has been around for donkey’s years and Intel out in Leixlip are among those making high-end, high performing transistors. However, unlike them we are trying to make transistors so cheaply that they could be used in pretty much anything,” Prof Coleman told The Irish Times. He said that as a result of his team’s latest research, printed devices could soon be incorporated into even the most mundane objects allowing products to gather, process, display and transmit information that could be of benefit to consumers. “All of this is a long way off in the future, but it is imaginable that at some point milk cartons could send messages to your phone warning that the milk is about to reach its sell-by-date,” said Prof Coleman. A number of Prof Coleman’s patents have already been licensed to well-known companies, including Samsung. “We were able to print the initial transistors from a standard inkjet printer . . . we now intend to try to make more sophisticated printed transistors,” he added.       Topics: Jonathan Coleman Amber Eu European Research Council School Of Physics At Tcd Science Foundation Science Foundation Ireland Trinity College Dublin Intel Samsung Read More Cork-based firm set to shake up global iron supplements market Read my lips: Irish start-up gets teeth into verification tools If a new ID solution from SaaS start-up iDly Systems succeeds, plastic ID cards will be history Axial3D secures £230,000 of new investment in seed funding Music industry starts to dance to streaming giant Spotify’s tune Pie in the sky or Ireland’s big chance?

By John Amato Share Share on facebook Share Share on twitter Share Share on reddit Share Share on sharethis 4/06/17 8:56am 1 day ago by John Amato up Click here for reuse options! After the news broke that Chairman Devin Nunes has "removed himself" from the Russian investigations on the House Intelligence Committee, Fox News hosts and personalities went into overdrive defending the chairman from any criticism. Immediately co-host of America's Newsroom Shannon Bream had this excuse at her fingertips. "He references charges by quote 'left-wing groups' that he says has come after him. He talks about them being filed with the House Ethics office, and again we want to note that you and I can go down to the office today to file those." "It's not something that's been instigated by another member or any type of congressional investigation," Bream said. "It's gonna take time and it's a distraction so he's going to step aside." Shannon Bream never mentioned why any ethics charge had been filed against Rep. Nunes or any of his blatant pro-Trump actions which have paralyzed and destroyed the integrity of the House Intelligence Committee. Even Republicans called Nunes out for destroying the committee's integrity. Later in the broadcast, Matt Schlapp picked up the slack by attacking Nancy Pelosi for establishing an Office of Congressional Ethics. Republicans under Trump tried to get rid of it, but were heavily criticized and didn't follow through. 1 day ago by John Amato up Schlapp claimed the office, "Has been used so many times for simply partisan political reasons," but offered no proof of this. "You can see, "anybody can bring any charge to the Office of Congressional Ethics and now it looks like the Ethics committee is going to pick up and look at this as well. "Matt said. Schlapp continued, "This is why ethics in congress gets so polluted...[Nunes should] step away, get this cleared up and don't do anything to derail the investigation." Chairman Nunes has already destroyed the Intel Committee with his actions and that's why he had to step aside, Matt. Judge Napolitano also came on air soon afterwards and also blasted the Office of Congressional Ethics. I expect the "anybody can file an ethics charge" to be the song-of-the-day on Fox, like their imaginary and consciously distracting "Susan Rice Probe" was yesterday. ↓ Story continues below ↓ So long as we aren't talking about Trump and the Russians, they're fulfilling their mission.

Even if it doesn’t quite rival the messy relationships in a daytime soap opera, autonomous vehicle partnerships are definitely part of a tangled web. The Daimler – Bosch deal announced earlier this week, however, has brought some clarity. Daimler and Bosch said Tuesday (April 4) that they’re partnering to accelerate the production of "robo-taxis.” The real significance of the news, however, is that all three -- Daimler, Mercedes Benz (owned by Daimler) and Tier One Robert Bosch -- have chosen Nvidia as their autonomous driving platform partner. Mobileye vs. Nvidia In fact, when it comes to the platform battle over Level 4 and Level 5 cars, the automotive industry today is split in two: you are either with Mobileye (soon to be part of Intel), or with Nvidia. And Nvidia has clearly shown it is gaining momentum. Asked about the Damiler-Bosch announcement, Phil Magney, founder & principal advisor at Vision Systems Intelligence, told us that Daimler must be “encouraged with Nvidia’s roadmap for both AI and solutions for highly automated driving.” Notably, Mercedes announced a plan to develop AI-based self-driving capabilities with Nvidia even before the Daimler-Bosch partnerhips happened, he explained. Relationship Map among chip vendors, tech companies, Tier Ones and car OEMs (Source: EE Times) Click here for larger image On the other hand, an opposing camp built around the BMW/Intel/Mobileye alliance was announced last summer. Last month Intel announced the acquisition of Mobileye. Separately, Intel and Mobileye last year picked up Tier One Delphi as their partner. Especially in recent months, among high-profile autonomous car development announcements with prestigious German car manufacturers, Nvidia is stealing Mobileye’s thunder. But look closely, said Egil Juliussen, director research, infotainment & ADAS at IHS Automotive. Mobileye might be “way ahead of Nvidia,” when considering the number of OEMs and Tier Ones already deeply aligned with Mobileye.

More Project Scorpio coverage Inside the next Xbox: Project Scorpio tech revealed Analysis: Scorpio is console hardware pushed to a new level Why Microsoft is making Project Scorpio: Mike Ybarra speaks Scorpio made simple: the next Xbox’s tech explained Everything should run just fine, but more than that, the full power of the Scorpio Engine will be brought to bear on enhancing your existing games. According to the Xbox hardware team, your existing library of games should run smoother, look better and load faster. It’s a considerable technical achievement because, while the new console is built from the ground up to run all content, certain design decisions were made during the machine’s gestation period that make this task a whole lot harder than it might have been. Put simply – there’s an easier way, exemplified by PlayStation 4 Pro’s technical make-up, and then there’s the more challenging approach – the Scorpio way. “In designing for compatibility, there are two choices that we can take from a performance perspective,” Microsoft’s Andrew Goossen, Technical Fellow, Graphics tells us. “One of which is to design hardware to emulate the performance capabilities of the original [console] as much as possible, or the other one is to say, we’re just going to turn on all the performance and we’re going to deal with all the issues.” What Goossen described as the ’emulation’ approach is seen in PS4 Pro’s design. Sony’s latest console uses a ‘butterfly’ approach to GPU design, effectively mirroring the base unit’s GPU with an extra rank of 18 compute units, doubling power (more so once extra frequency is added). With this approach, Sony can ensure complete compatibility simply by turning off the additional, new ‘half’ of the graphics core. It’s an elegant solution, but what’s clear is that the newly introduced boost mode doesn’t deliver the Pro’s full power to existing base PS4 titles. Microsoft has taken the harder route – and it has done so by necessity. It doesn’t have the option of doubling up on its existing design, as Scorpio is a radical architectural overhaul. Here, it’s down to the platform holder to take ownership of compatibility issues, but the advantage is this: unlike PS4’s boost mode, Scorpio theoretically allows for the full power of the new console to be deployed on older games. In fact, there are five different ways in which Scorpio aims to improve the experience for owners of existing Xbox One games – and these should also apply to Xbox 360 back-compat titles. 1. Smoother performance and no screen-tearing “We bring to bear all 40 compute units and the full 1172MHz clock-speed [of the Scorpio GPU], we’re bringing those to bear on all the games possible,” says Andrew Goossen. “Now, I have a caveat a bit later about all the compatibility testing we do for these and some of the implications, but we can bring all the 40CUs, all 1172MHz, of course the full 2.3GHz on the CPU.” What this means in practice is that games that cannot fully sustain their target frame-rate on Xbox One stand a really good chance of doing so on Scorpio. But to be clear: what we won’t see will be 30fps games suddenly running at 60fps. The game itself still sets its frame-rate target, and there are no functions for removing performance limits. However, the full six teraflops of graphics power will be deployed to run your existing library of Xbox content. In fact, there’s so much raw power here that Microsoft can go one step further. Says Goossen: “We’ve taken the approach that we do with 360 [games] on Xbox One, where you will never see a torn frame, because we have enough performance there to ensure that.” 2. Maximum possible resolution on dynamic titles A popular technique in games development is to adapt dynamic resolution scaling. The idea here is straightforward: when a game is in danger of losing its lock on its performance target, be it 30fps or 60fps, the title scales down the image, running it at a lower resolution in order to maintain a smoother frame-rate. There are many games out there that support dynamic scaling – Doom 2016, Halo 5, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and The Division, for example. “With the additional performance of the Scorpio Engine, we expect to see those titles hit the maximum render resolution that those titles support,” says Goossen. “As you know, we can’t boost it to 4K, but definitely the maximum resolution the game supports, we should be able to run it.” We’re looking forward to testing one particular title: CD Projekt RED’s The Witcher 3. The developer states it supports dynamic resolution scaling, but we’ve yet to see it break the 900p barrier. Given Scorpio’s 4.6x improvement in performance, surely if the tech is in there, we should hit native 1080p – and iron out the performance wobbles at the same time. 3. Improved texture filtering Resolution is an important, defining aspect of image quality but it is not the only one. Texture filtering is hugely important – and it’s actually an element where both PS4 and Xbox One have let us down a little compared to the same titles running on PC, where the full force of 16x anisotropic filtering can make a big difference. “We built into the hardware the capability of overwriting all bilinear and all trilinear fetches to be anisotropic,” Andrew Goossen reveals. “And then we’ve dialled up the anisotropic all the way up to max. All of our titles by default when you’re running on Scorpio, they’ll be full anisotropic.” Good quality texture filtering will make a big difference to a large number of Xbox One titles, where typically 4x anisotropic tends to be the balancing point chosen by developers. The leap to 16x, enforced at a system level by the back-compat engine, is a huge boon, especially in concert with the complete lack of screen-tear and smoother overall performance. More good news: this new feature extends to Xbox 360 games too. 4. Scorpio GameDVR support Microsoft’s plans for GameDVR on Scorpio are impressive – the hardware team is leveraging the new console’s next-gen media block to provide 4K60 video capture with no performance hit, utilising the highly efficient HEVC codec for pristine visual quality. GameDVR works for back-compat titles too, which has some key benefits. “Even though a lot of this content will be 1080p, we’ll have the benefit of HEVC, the ultra high bit-rate, so we’ll be able to do those retroactive screen captures at a really high quality.” Retroactive screen captures are a new featuring coming to the Scorpio GameDVR – users will have the ability to scan through their captures with ‘to-the-frame’ precision, allowing them to extract the precise screenshot they want. You won’t be able to capture at 4K – there’s no point for 1080p content – but our take on this is that Microsoft will be able to use the same level of video encoding bandwidth on 1080p video, meaning better quality. 5. Faster loading In a world where a Battlefield 1 campaign level can take anything up to two minutes to load, this one is especially welcome. “We’re able to say that game loads will be fundamentally faster,” Goossen reveals. “There are three ways we say that – one of which is the CPU boost. The 31 per cent CPU boost in terms of clock will help games that are CPU-bound in terms of their IO.” Assets streamed from a hard drive often arrive in a compressed state, requiring the CPU to decompress them. Extra frequency on the CPU cores can make a difference here – sometimes a dramatic one. Case in point: the Division on PC can actually max out all six cores and 12 threads on an overclocked Intel Core i7 3930K, just through loading content. “The second one is that we’ve that we’ve improved the hard disk speed,” Goossen adds. “We’re actually promising developers a 50 per cent improvement in overall bandwidth for the purposes of driving 4K textures, but this also helps us in this situation where you’re running existing Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles. They will also benefit from the faster hard disk.” This is an example of how another spec boost in the Scorpio arsenal means good things for other areas in the system – a factor that also comes into play on the third and final way in which Scorpio will improve back-compat loading times. The new console gives developers eight gigs of RAM to play with, but existing Xbox One titles were only built to utilise 5GB – something the hardware team use to their advantage. “If Xbox One games take five gigs, we have three gigs left over. We do a file system cache on that. Any repeated IOs… if you go into a race and come out or if you go into a fight and come out, we’ve got a nice boost right there for load times as well.” Is there a catch? If it all sounds too good to be true, there is one minor drawback. Some of the enhancements may cause compatibility issues on a very small percentage of titles, meaning that certain improvements listed above may not apply to all games. It’s similar to the way that boost mode on PS4 Pro has great compatibility overall but has issues on a small minority of the library. The difference is that in this case, Microsoft is ensuring that all titles work, and this means that some of the five benefits above may need to be dialled back. The onus is on the platform holder to ensure that everything ‘just works’. A brief history of Fallout War. War changes quite a lot. “We’re going to be the ones that ensure that your games run as fast as they can in terms of all those five different features, the best that they possibly can,” Andrew Goossen explains. “There will be some cases where we have to dial down some of those attributes… in some games we potentially have to dial down the number of CUs, for example, to maintain compatibility with that title. But again these are all things that Microsoft does, we’ve always done, that’s true of all 360 titles on Xbox One. We just make sure it runs the best it possibly can on Scorpio and we’re very excited that Scorpio really will be the best place to run all your Xbox content.” What’s clear from our Scorpio back-compat briefing is that Microsoft is taking this aspect of the system very seriously – and rightly so. The notion of PC-like portability for your entire games library is a highly compelling prospect – something we also hope Sony takes on board as it inevitably moves onto PlayStation 5 development. It’s perhaps another sign of further convergence between console and PC, in that you get an out-of-the-box improvement when upgrading to a new piece of kit – though frame-rate and resolution caps limit the scalability in comparison. Several times during our day at the Microsoft campus, the same point came up. The team is aiming to deliver, as Mike Ybarra phrases it, “the world’s most powerful console, delivering the best versions of the games”. It’s a statement presumably intended to cover the latest and the greatest multi-platform titles, but if that sentiment applies to the existing Xbox game library too, all the way back to Xbox 360, then that’s absolutely fine with us. We learned about Project Scorpio’s backwards compatibility features at an exclusive briefing at Xbox HQ. Microsoft paid for travel and accommodation.

Photo: CFP Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and supplier Robert Bosch are teaming up to develop self-driving cars in an alliance aimed at accelerating the production of "robo-taxis." The pact between the world's largest maker of premium cars and the world's largest automotive supplier forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like ride-hailing firms Uber and Didi, which are also working on self-driving cars. Technology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars. The alliance not only marks an end to Daimler's efforts to develop an autonomous car largely on its own, but moves the auto industry's ambitions beyond simply developing prototype vehicles toward industrial-scale production of self-driving cars. Financial terms were not disclosed about the deal between the two German companies, which was announced on Tuesday. Bosch - which was founded in 1886, the same year that Mercedes founder Carl Benz patented the motorcar - will develop software and algorithms needed for autonomous driving together with the carmaker. Bosch said Mercedes would be able to use the jointly developed system for two years before it could be offered to competitors. The deal will help the automotive supplier make up ground in a competitive autonomous driving system sector where rivals Continental, Delphi, ZF and others have also made heavy investments. For Daimler and its Mercedes division, teaming up with Bosch helps them throw more engineering resources at autonomous cars, allowing them to speed up the process of creating a production-ready system for autonomous cars by several years. The autonomous system will now be ready by the beginning of next decade, ­Daimler said, without disclosing when it had first envisaged the commercial launch of automated taxis, or robo-taxis. "The prime objective of the project is to achieve the production-ready development of a driving system which will allow cars to drive fully autonomously in the city," Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday. The company will continue to build and sell vehicles that can be manually operated by individual drivers. Car comes to driver The market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles is expected to grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035, Goldman Sachs said in 2016. Daimler is focusing its efforts on the app-based car-sharing and ride-hailing sector dominated by China's Didi, and US-based Uber and Lyft. Like autonomous cars, this market is a big global growth area and is expected to expand by 28 percent a year to 2030, according to consultancy McKinsey. "Within a specified area of town, customers will be able to order an automated shared car via their smartphone. The vehicle will then make its way autonomously to the user," Daimler said. "The idea behind it is that the vehicle should come to the driver rather than the other way round." The cutthroat competition to launch self-driven cars has forced carmakers to shift strategy from an evolutionary toward a revolutionary approach. Instead of evolving driver assistance systems to achieve full autonomy, carmakers are now experimenting with radical car designs combined with software-driven development - which has led to alliances with technology companies. Mercedes-Benz's arch rival BMW teamed up with Israeli autonomous vehicle tech company Mobileye and chip maker Intel in 2016 to develop new technology that could put autonomous cars on the road by 2021. Intel has since agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion, a deal which followed Qualcomm's $47 billion move to acquire Dutch automotive chip supplier NXP. Before deciding to partner with Bosch, Mercedes-Benz had two engineering teams, totaling about 500 people, working on autonomous vehicles. One took an evolutionary approach, upgrading the capabilities of conventional vehicles, while the other team took a more radical approach to the car's design. Bosch and Mercedes did not disclose how many additional engineers they would assign to the teams in Stuttgart and Silicon Valley. | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

The iPhone’s Touch ID is handy on the Mac, too. The bad: You’re paying a hefty premium for the Touch Bar, which supports only a handful of Apple apps for now. The USB-C-only ports mean carrying a bag full of dongles. The lack of high-end graphics or huge RAM options in the 13-inch model may frustrate photo and video professionals. The cost: $1,700 to $1,800 LATEST TRENDING VIDEOS: Story continues below The bottom line: Apple’s smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro. Razer Blade Stealth Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The Razer Blade Stealth includes a Core i7 processor and high-resolution touch-screen even in its lowest-end configuration. It has more ports than other 12-inch laptops and a fun Chroma back-lit keyboard. The bad: It’s bigger and heavier than 12-inch laptops from Apple, Asus and others. The thick bezel around the screen feels dated, and configuration options are limited. The cost: $1,450 The bottom line: The Razer Blade Stealth offers better specs for less money than the competition, and includes features others lack, such as a high-resolution touch-screen and full-size USB ports. The design is slick, the price is right, but it’s not as slim and portable as other 12-inch laptops. Lenovo Miix 510 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The good-looking hinged kickstand has a lot of positioning flexibility. Has a USB-C port for video output and peripherals with adapters. Unlike Microsoft, Lenovo includes a generally excellent back-lit keyboard cover. Lenovo’s Active Pen and palm rejection work very well. The bad: The fans can get a little too loud for quiet environments. No memory card slot for expansion. The Active Pen is a $40 extra and its included holder blocks the power jack. The tiny right-hand shift key is horrible. The cost: $592 to $611 The bottom line: The Lenovo Miix 510 is an excellent — and more affordable — alternative to Microsoft’s 2-in-1 tablet PC. And it might be the better choice for you. Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: This new version of the XPS 13 adds a hybrid hinge and thinner body. The edge-to-edge, nearly bezel-free display makes maximum use of space, and the starting price is extremely reasonable. The bad: Standard USB ports get swapped for USB-C ones, the Intel Y-series processor isn’t as fast as those found in more traditional laptops and the power button can be tricky to hit. The cost: $1,000 The bottom line: Despite a few trade-offs in ports and processing power, this slimmer hybrid version of the XPS 13 is an excellent full-time laptop and part-time tablet.

The H-1B is a "non-immigrant visa" program and visas are issued for 3 years, with a maximum duration of 6 years, although many of the workers who arrive in the US on H-1B visas later obtain citizenship. There is a cap of 65,000 for the "general" H-1B visa category for foreign workers with at least a bachelors degree, however a further 20,000 places are available for foreign nationals awarded a masters of PhD from a US institutions. So many applications from employers have been received in recent years that a lottery process is used to fill empoyers' requests for visas.  Having made reform of immigration policy one of the US presidential campaign pledges, the Trump administration has announced  various measures intended to reduce abuse of the H-1B Visa system and to deter employers from discriminating against US workers. One of the ways in which the system is being perverted from the original purpose of filling a skills gap is that overseas workers on visas are prepared to be paid substantially less than American workers. The system has also led to outsourcing companies, predominantly those based in India obtaining a disproportionate share of the H-1B visas. The map below is based on research by Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University, who has done extensive research on the H-1B program and collected data through Freedom of Information Act requests. Source: Bloomberg   The policy memo from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services that was issued on March 31st rescinds a guidance memo dating back to December 2000 and issued by Terry Way, former direction of the Nebraska Service Center that effectively lowered the bar for some computer programming jobs from having a bachelor's degree to just a 2-year associate degree. The Terry Way memo is now considered obsolete as it relied on the 1998-99 and 2000-01 editions when some computer related occupations were in a period of "transition". Its main flaw is that: statements in the memorandum do not fully or properly articulate the criteria that apply to H-1B specialty occupation adjudications. While the memorandum stated that most programmers had a bachelor’s degree or higher based on information provided by the Handbook, that information is not particularly relevant to a specialty occupation adjudication if it does not also provide the specific specialties the degrees were in and/or what, if any, relevance those degrees had to the computer programmer occupation. Further, the memorandum failed to mention that only “some” of those that had a bachelor’s or higher degree at that time held a degree in “computer science . . . or information systems.” The effect of the new memo is intended to ensure that speciality jobs are restricted to those that require a full bachelors degree or higher in a specific discipline, which would be considered over qualification for many jobs at computer programmer level. This is expected to have most impact on those outsourcing companies that bring junior level staff from India into the US in order to train them within US corporations before returning to India. However, as Hira's figures show outsourcing-focused companies get the vast majority of approvals of H-!B visa petitions.  Source: Bloomberg Outsourcing companies pay significantly less than non-outsourcing companies which is why they tend to take jobs away from American workers as revealed by this salary data:  Source: Bloomberg Whereas Google and Microsoft pay HB-1 workers $100K or more, the norm for outsourcing companies is $65K - $75K.  One of the aims of the capping the number of temporary H-1B visas was to encourage employers to hire permanent employees on "green cards which enable them to become US citizens. Hira's data shows that most of the outsourcing companies rarely make green card applications, whereas it is a very common practice for Microsoft, Intel, Apple and Google.  Source: Bloomberg   The effect of the ensuring that the jobs filled by those in the H-1B program really do require the skills conferred by a Bachelor's degree or post graduate study should make it easier for US companies to attract well qualified overseas workers who want to make a career in the USA. The memo should therefore redress a shortcoming in the way the system has operated for many years.

But it is not to be.  In a completely unexpected blog post, Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth delivered some surprising reversals of direction. The one that most news outlets are concentrating on is that from Ubuntu 18.04 the default desktop will be GNOME and work on Canonical's own Unity 8 will be stopped. Unity was introduced to make Ubuntu easier to work with on tablets, but the UI spread to the desktop and phone versions of Ubuntu. An even more ambitious aim was to replace the standard X-Windows server with a new one called Mir - this too has been abandoned.  Both Unity and Mir were motivated by the view that a unified Ubuntu running on just about every platform was a good idea. It is indeed a good idea, but as no one seemed to be willing to take the risk on using Ubuntu in a mass market phone or tablet it wasn't a practical proposition.     As consequence the Ubuntu phone and tablet have also been dropped. In short, the six-year project to create a unified Ubuntu on all platforms is at an end. Is this a good thing? In principle no, because a successful open source alternative phone system would have shaken things up. The key word here is successful. Which phone manufacturer in its right mind would forsake the huge Android ecosystem for something else? This was one of the factors that killed off Firefox OS and now it has done for Ubuntu phone as well. Logically, as phone hardware becomes increasingly powerful, there are fewer and fewer reasons for a special operating system and a standard version of Linux could serve all of the platforms. This was the idea behind Shuttleworth's endeavour to create an all-encompassing platform. From a technical point of view, he was 100% correct but market forces, aren't just about technology. I took the view that, if convergence was the future and we could deliver it as free software, that would be widely appreciated both in the free software community and in the technology industry, where there is substantial frustration with the existing, closed, alternatives available to manufacturers. I was wrong on both counts. Canonical is going to concentrate on its cloud and IoT offerings in the future - along with the traditional desktop, server and VM systems. The UK company is a strange beast in the open source world. It is committed to open source but it isn't a non-profit and has to make profits to continue to exist. The realism that Ubuntu wasn't going to make it as a front line phone OS probably triggered expense saving cuts at the start of the financial year and concentrated on the more profitable IoT and cloud markets. Of course Unity and Mir have no importance to either.  Following the announcement there are reports that layoffs are likely in the Unity team and in other non-profitable departments. Canonical filed accounts that reveal a loss of £3.3 million last year and it is reported to be seeking outside investment in the coming year. Clearly cutting project that aren't profitable and aren't likely to be profitable in the future makes sense.  In a survey conducted by OMG! Ubuntu, which is still open, only 25% ticked the Negative - e.g. Upset, pessimistic, angry etc. option. Leaving 75% indifferent or positive. Unity and Mir haven't been universally loved by developers and users alike. Indeed having to work with Mir when the rest of the Linux community was switching to Wayland was a big negative. Even so Phoronix is reporting that various people are planning to continue developing Unity. There is already at least one fork on Github  unity8.org.  The future for Ubuntu, and Canonical in particular, isn't all doom and gloom. Canonical is making money from its OpenStack based cloud offerings and the indications are that it is making IoT a sucess, even though this too is a crowded area. Ubuntu Core complete with its Snap package manager is attracting a lot of attention. However, for each of the platforms it is available on there are established competitors. For example, on Raspberry Pi there is Raspbian another Debian Linux distribution and there are third party alternatives such as Windows 10 IOT Core. On Intel devices there is Yocto  Linux and Ref-OS-IoT and there are third party alternatives in addition to Ubuntu Core.     If there is a single reason why IoT developers should choose Ubuntu Core, it isn't being well publicised. There is a very real sense in which Shuttleworth's conviction that convergence is the key was and still is correct. A single operating system that works on everything is a no-brainer but, as Microsoft discovered and I suspect Google is about to find out, it is a tough target.    More Information Growing Ubuntu for cloud and IoT, rather than phone and convergence Related Articles Ubuntu Attracts Developers  Ubuntu Touch SDK Beta - A New Way To Program Linux Ubuntu For Tablets Completes The Set        Canonical Wants Help With Ubuntu Phone Apps         Ubuntu For Phones   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.  New Website for Google Open Source Projects 29/03/2017 There's a new website for Google Open Source that goes beyond simply listing its open source initiatives.

Pradesh and Telangana New Delhi [India], Apr 7 (ANI-NewsVoir): BML Munjal University (BMU), founded by The Hero Group and located in Gurugram (National Capital Region of Delhi) has emerged as the new hub for aspiring engineers from the South. Prof. B. S. Satyanarayana, Vice Chancellor, BMU and senior staff members of the University were in Hyderabad on 7th April 2017 to strengthen this growing relationship by interacting with media persons and parents of students who hail from the city. BMU is distinct in its unique curriculum and pedagogy, which is exemplified by 45 percent practical hands-on learning component in its engineering programs. This approach to learning and doing has organically drawn students who are driven by an intrinsic passion for the sciences, engineering and technology, as tends to be the case among most engineering aspirants from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Not surprisingly, from the very first year of operations, the University campus in Gurugram has attracted a high number of very talented students form these states. At present, students from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana constitute almost 45 percent of the student body. They seem to have found a second home more than 1500 kilometres away, adapting comfortably and sharing about their culture and academic experiences with the rest of the student body. The University believes the providing a supportive and nurturing environment will enable students to make the most of the opportunities it offers. An active campus life, multi-cuisine dining facilities with special provisions to cater to the South Indian palate, supportive faculty members and staff on campus and a vibrant and diverse peer group ensure everyone has the opportunity to grow as well as contribute to the University space. The University is also sensitive to the pressures and emotional/mental challenges faced by students today. The competitive nature of the engineering entrance exams which has achieved disturbing proportions, particularly in certain regions, is beginning to affect young college bound students. The peer pressure only increases once they reach the best colleges in the country. BMU has taken cognizance of this increasing stress among students and launched a dedicated Counselling Centre with the support of leading experts in the country. The Centre is the most recent initiative undertaken by the university to fulfill its commitment to its students? overall wellbeing in addition to academic excellence. The Centre will be fully functional from May and will work closely with the students; guiding them through any stress or anxiety related to academics, peer interactions, confidence and help them cope with living away from home, often for the very first time. Addressing the issue, Prof. Satyanarayana, Vice Chancellor of BML Munjal University said, ?We believe that students from this region of the country have a unique passion for science and technology and has given the world its leading technocrats and business leaders. We believe that BMU is uniquely poised to nurture that passion. We are committed to doing our best to attract the most talented students from this region. The new counseling centre reaffirms our commitment to preparing students for life and not just for the next job. We want them to distress from the intensity of preparation for entrance exams and discover the ?joy of engineering? and becoming innovators and pioneers. An open yet safe and secure environment will inspire students to put in their best effort not for merely getting degrees but to discover their true potential and unlock their courage to pursue their dreams.? Commenting on the initiative, Rupa Murghai, BMU Counsellor with experience of more than two decades in this space said, ?Teachers and parents all have the same goal ? giving their children only the best. Encouraging parental involvement is all about playing on a sense of community a community with a shared goal ? so everyone gets to add their piece to the complex education puzzle. Students come from different part of the country to study at the campus and parents back home are worried on the well-being of their kids. We encourage parents to play an active role along with the university to solve student?s issues/ problems.? With strong academic and industry collaborations is focused on hands-on and inter-disciplinary learning, BMU is one of the few universities to offer specialized programmes in keeping with current industry requirements. The University has reiterated its focus on cross disciplinary learning, R&D and innovation, along with specialized courses in Engineering, Data Analytics and Forensic Accounting.

Ncore is a distributed heterogeneous cache coherent interconnect that enables SoC design teams to easily integrate custom processing elements using embedded low latency proxy caches (also called “I/O caches”). In neural network machine learning SoCs where workloads are typically partitioned onto different processing elements, low latency proxy caches offer a more hardware- and software-efficient way of communicating between all the different elements than fixed internal SRAMs or scratchpad memories. These types of architectures are at the core of autonomous driving systems. Ncore 2.0 offers new capabilities: Ncore Resilience Package (optional) – Adds hardware data protection and intelligent unit duplication to detect and correct system faults required to achieve automotive ISO 26262 ASIL D compliance Includes a functional safety controller with advanced Built-In Self-Test (BIST) as well as Failure Modes, Effects and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA) and documentation. Coherent Memory Cache – The configurable coherent memory cache achieves the benefits of a traditional Last Level Cache (LLC) while consuming less die area and offering more flexibility. It integrates with other system caches, serving at as a lower-level cache in the memory hierarchy relative to those caches. Scalability, with up to 16 coherent agents – Ncore 2.0 IP enables larger systems with up to 16 coherent clusters. “We engineered the Ncore 2.0 cache coherent interconnect and the accompanying Ncore Resilience Package based on feedback from our customers, who are creating the world’s most efficient machine learning systems that will power the future of autonomous driving,” said K. Charles Janac, President and CEO of ArterisIP. “Our IP was specifically created for autonomous hardware SoC designers, enabling them to simultaneously meet the competing needs of design complexity and functional safety.” Supporting Quotations Sanechips (Subsidiary of ZTE): “We are very impressed with the new ArterisIP Ncore interconnect IP technology,” said Mr. Yu Li, VP at Sanechips (Subsidiary of ZTE). “ArterisIP Ncore 2.0 interconnect IP offers even higher scalability along with the Coherent Memory Cache, which reduces DRAM accesses while maintaining area efficiency.” The Linley Group: “Designers of machine-learning SoCs must integrate heterogeneous processor cores and accelerators into a complex system that can handle the high data bandwidth and low latency required for such applications,” said Mike Demler, senior analyst for the Linley Group. “ArterisIP’s new Ncore 2.0 interconnect IP with resiliency features addresses these issues by enabling designers to implement heterogeneous cache-coherent machine-learning architectures for applications such as the rapidly developing autonomous-vehicle market.” Resiltech: “Implementing functional safety mechanisms in SoC interconnect hardware is imperative for highly complex machine learning SoCs,” said Andrea Bondavalli, Professor of Computer Science and head of the Resilient Computing Lab at the University of Florence, and scientific advisor to ResilTech, a leading functional safety consultancy, “Doing so simplifies software development and maintenance while freeing scarce processing resources to perform functional work rather than safety checking.” About ArterisIP ArterisIP provides system-on-chip (SoC) interconnect IP to accelerate SoC semiconductor assembly for a wide range of applications from IoT to mobile phones, cameras, automobiles, SSD controllers and servers for customers such as Samsung, Huawei / HiSilicon, Mobileye, Altera (Intel), and Texas Instruments. ArterisIP products include the Ncore cache coherent and FlexNoC non-coherent interconnect IP, as well as optional Resilience Package (functional safety) and PIANO automated timing closure capabilities. Customer results obtained by using the ArterisIP product line include lower power, higher performance, more efficient design reuse and faster SoC development, leading to lower development and production costs.

Released today, Developer Preview 3 finally adds the biggest feature request from developers, as well as more connectivity options over USB. Nintendo Switch The development team noted back in February that it was actively working on bringing Bluetooth to the IoT platform. Finally with DP3, there is support for those existing Android APIs for both Bluetooth Classic and Low Energy. Code for phones and other devices can run unmodified on Android Things, with features like Bluetooth LE advertisements and scanning and Bluetooth LE GATT working seamlessly. Google’s goal with the platform is to allow developers to easily make IoT devices with their existing knowledge of Android and its related services. USB host in DP3 now allows Android Things to interface easily with custom USB devices without the need for root privileges or support from the Linux kernel. Similar to other connectivity methods, existing code supporting USB host will work natively. Lastly, this version adds support for NXP’s Argon i.MX6UL platform. With the addition of Intel Joule in DP2, Android Things supports five IoT platforms in total. DP3 system images are now available for download and install.
