As usual, you'll find a handful of us running around the Taipei show floors next week, where we'll be getting our hands dirty with the latest PC products and components. Last year was relatively fruitful thanks to the VR explosion. Several PC brands rolled out high-end GPUs or affordable ones capable of running VR. Even Intel surprised its hardcore users with its first-ever 10-core desktop CPU. ASUS topped it all off with Zenbo -- an adorable $600 home robot that went on sale in Taiwan earlier this year.

For one, Microsoft already stole some of Computex's thunder with its own events earlier this month, so we're not expecting anything major from it next week. Intriguingly, HTC Vive has no official presence at Computex this year, which means less VR love for us. Still, based on recent leaks and launches, we've got at least a rough idea of what to expect. There's no doubt that we'll still be seeing new PCs from the likes of ASUS, MSI, Dell, Acer and more at Computex. In fact, Acer simply went ahead and announced its new laptops and tablet earlier this week, which is certainly one way to beat the competition. Since Intel's high-performance 7th gen Core chips are relatively fresh, chances are most of the new mainstream and high-end machines being unveiled next week will still be based on those. The same is true with GPUs, especially with the GTX 1050 Ti featured on the Acer Nitro 5 being pitched as a "premium" entry-level choice for discrete laptop graphics. We'll probably also see some entry-level devices running Windows 10 S. Some were already announced at Build, but this should be our first chance to get serious hands-on time with a few. As for mobile, it's really up to ASUS. It's unclear whether we can expect new ZenFones or a new ZenWatch. Though, if you recall, the depth-sensing ZenFone AR announced back at CES has yet to hit the market, so maybe we'll finally get an update about it on Monday? On a related note: Qualcomm will be doing its own thing outside of Computex this time. And sadly, it doesn't seem like we'll be hearing any announcements. After all, Qualcomm probably needs to save some surprises for MWC Shanghai next month. On the CPU side, there were rumors of an Intel "Core i9" a couple of weeks ago, followed by some new specs popping up in the SiSoft Sandra database. This is likely another 10-core CPU following last year's Core i7 Extreme Edition. But Intel's not alone. AMD will also be hosting a press conference, which will likely shed more light on its upcoming 16-core Threadripper CPU due this summer. And who knows, maybe we'll get some new GPUs too? If you're looking for something that's more suitable for the masses don't worry. Intel will probably tease, if not announce, its 8th generation Core chip (Coffee Lake) that's due in the second half of this year. We're hoping the same goes for NVIDIA's event on the same day: less on supercomputers and more on consumer GPUs. Alright, let's talk robots for bit. It's been a year since the ASUS Zenbo debuted, and so far it's only been available in Taiwan in very limited quantities. There's hope the company will be announcing new markets or at least a larger local rollout for the home robot. Failing that, ASUS is still expected to share some updates and interesting use cases for its home products. And hey, some new accessories for Zenbo would be fun, too. It also wouldn't be a surprise if ASUS wants in on the home assistant market -- just imagine a Zenbo, but much smaller and with no wheels or face. None of these nuggets will distract us from HTC's glaring absence this year at Computex. Then again, there's no stopping other exhibitors from bringing their own VR wares. And ZOTAC is hosting the world's first VR eSports tournament -- featuring ZOTAC's VR GO backpack PC and HTC Vive -- at Computex on June 3rd. That will no doubt get a lot of attention since it'll be open to the public (This editor has already rescheduled his return flight just check it out). We'll also be keeping an eye out for the funkiest PC mods on the show floor, and we may even swing by G.SKILL's overclocking tournament to see what it's all about.

Credit: Brooke Crothers) With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft made a good thing better. At the top, let's point out that it isn’t called the Surface Pro 5 -- it’s just the “new Surface Pro.” And while it looks like the Surface Pro 4, I spent some hands-on time with new device at a Microsoft Store in Los Angeles and it's very different. The most salient change is inside. The new Surface Pro packs Intel’s latest 7th Gen Core processors, besting the 6th Gen Core processors in the Surface Pro 4. Intel’s newest chips deliver better performance – particularly when handling video – and longer battery life. Generally, every new generation of Intel processors boast a host of improvements (albeit, often small improvements) that software developers don’t always take advantage of right away. So some performance improvements are seen later rather than sooner. MICROSOFT ANNOUNCES XBOX GAME PASS STARTING JUNE 1 Microsoft says the new Surface Pro delivers “50% more battery life and 50% more performance than Surface Pro 4,” according to Microsoft's description of the features. The new Surface Pro with Windows 10 Pro, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and an Intel Core m3 processor is $799. With 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a Core i5 chip, it’s $1,299. The Surface Pro Signature Type Cover keyboard/cover is sold separately for $159.99. Keyboard still key The new Surface Pro Type Cover keyboard is still sold separately. I’ve always thought it peculiar that Microsoft doesn’t sell the Surface Pro standard with the detachable keyboard because it’s such an integral part of the device: pull out the Pro’s kickstand and the keyboard turns the Surface tablet into a laptop (after all, the Surface Pro by itself is merely a tablet). And close the keyboard on top of the display and it serves as a protective shield. The new Surface model comes with Alcantara keyboards in different colors: platinum, cobalt blue and burgundy. Alcantara is the material surrounding the keys and the trackpad. It's a soft, suede-like material typically found on luxury cars. It shows up on steering wheels and door panels, among other things. MICROSOFT SCRAMBLES TO FIX WORST WINDOWS ISSUE IN 'RECENT MEMORY' To me, the Alcantara keyboards look like carpeting, which is not a compliment. It's also susceptible to stains, though Microsoft says it’s a “durable, stain-resistant material… designed to last and easily wipe clean.” But it’s still an amazing keyboard to type on -- in fact, it's one of the best keyboards on any laptop today. It's easy on the fingers. But wait, there's more The new Surface Pro has a new hinge that allows you to place the Surface Pro in so-called “Studio Mode” -- almost perfectly flat.  There are additional features, including a new stylus. Sold separately for $99, it has tilt support, 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and requires much less activation force than previous pens.  There is a built-in option for 4G/LTE, coming later this year, which marks a first for the Surface Pro. This is a great option to have and more Windows laptops should offer this. Final thoughts I owned the very first Surface Pro in 2013 and have owned a succession of Surface Pros after that. There’s a reason it’s a popular convertible device: it’s incredibly easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode and Microsoft probably does a better job than anyone at striking a good balance between those two modes. The rated 13.5 hours of battery life will please Surface fans and that alone might be a reason to upgrade (with the better performance, to boot). And you won't lose battery life by opening and closing the device (via the keyboard), a problem on previous iterations of the Surface Pro.  The new Surface Pro is available June 15.     Advertisement Trending in Tech Mother of Uber CEO killed in California boat accident 7 Facebook tips for power users Rocket Lab electron booster falls short in debut test launch How did dinosaurs evolve into birds?

Seán Usher is pictured as Intel celebrates the success of its 2016 Matching Grant programme.View More Images ICONIC Stillorgan GAA Club, Kilmacud Crokes, has scored a major funding boost thanks to the hard-working staff of Intel. The tech giant recently celebrated the success of its 2016 Matching Grant initiative that rewarded 124 community organisations and schools from across Ireland with a total of €502,378. Some 31 organisations from the Dublin area were part of the scheme and will receive funding of more than €130,000. The Intel Involved Matching Grant Programme encourages employees to engage in outreach and volunteerism in their communities by giving their time and talent to qualified non–profit organisations and schools. For every hour that is volunteered by an Intel employee at a school or qualified non–profit organisation, a donation or “match” of $10 (US) is paid from the Intel Foundation. In 2016 Intel employees volunteered just over 54,000 hours that were eligible to be matched through this initiative, resulting in a pay out of €502,378 ($547,215) for 124 recipient organisations spread across 20 different counties in Ireland. Employees were recognised for these efforts at a special event held at the Intel campus in Leixlip which was attended by the Mayor of Kildare Ivan Keatley along with representatives from each of the recipient organisations. Among the 124 organisations that were part of the Matching Grant initiative were charities such as Irish Dogs for the Disabled, the Parkinson’s Association of Ireland and the Society of the Vincent De Paul. A variety of sporting clubs including the Kilmacud Crokes were also in the running for a funding boost. It has been a busy few weeks for the Southside club with recent wins including that of the Intermediate Footballers who beat Round Towers Lusk in their Championship game. It’s also coming up to that time of the year when the club hosts the much-loved Mini All-Ireland tournaments in the month of June. Online entry is now open and available on the club’s website at www.KilmacudCrokes.com. Numbers participating at some age groups will be capped and entries will be accepted on a first come/first served basis. Meanwhile, the Kilmacud Crokes Ladies Football Quiz Night will take place on Friday, May 26 at 8pm in the club house. The quiz will be followed by a few drinks and a bit of music and craic among friends. Teams of four to five adults (over 16 years of age) are €10 a head to attend. There will also be a raffle of superb prizes on the night.     Read 121 Email Print Related Articles 26 May 2017Local councillor welcomes works on Stillorgan’s gritty laneways 25 May 2017GAA club tunes up for big fundraiser 21 May 2017New sports facility to be shared by clubs Latest Gallery Southside Sport Read the digital editions of the Dublin People Northside East, Northside West & Southside here Previous Story Guide dogs exhibition opens at the airport 27 May 2017A SPECIAL photographic exhibition has opened at Dublin Airport celebrating 40 years of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Intel Corp., respectively. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specializes in working with unstructured data. Ford Motor The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co. invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and start-up communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare start-up Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors recommendations. For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies, said Forward CEO Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate. AI companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, CEO of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the firm in 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc. and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” he said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. A company with a specialised mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,” Mr. Gundotra said.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation's Upcoming Low-Cost Chip Looks Great Details of Intel's next-generation low-cost Atom-based PC chips just leaked, and it looks like the company has put together something nice. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 27, 2017 at 10:15AM For a while, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) didn't take the low end of the personal-computer market all that seriously. For years, it offered products for this market in the form of either badly cut-down versions of its Core processor family, or aging Atom processors that simply delivered subpar computing experiences. However, 2013 marked an inflection point for the company's efforts in this space, with the launch of its redesigned Atom-based platforms for low-cost personal computers, known as Bay Trail. Bay Trail delivered a substantial improvement in performance, power consumption, and features relative to the older Atom products. Image source: Intel. The Bay Trail-based chips were also much more power-efficient and cost-effective than the highly cut-down Core-based chips for low-cost notebooks, which enabled more attractive form factors as well as cost reductions. Since the launch of the Bay Trail-based low-cost personal computer parts in 2013, Intel has regularly launched new products for this market, pushing up performance, features, efficiency, and integration. Thanks to a new leak from FanlessTech on social media (via AnandTech Forums), we now have details about the company's next-generation low-cost personal computer platform, code-named Gemini Lake. A better Apollo Lake Intel's latest low-cost personal-computer processor platform is called Apollo Lake. It is manufactured on the company's 14nm technology and utilizes the company's latest Atom processor core (code-named Goldmont) as well as the same graphics, media, and display subsystem found in the company's higher-end sixth-generation Core processor family (though scaled down to fit the power and cost constraints of a platform intended for low-cost computers). Per FanlessTech, Gemini Lake will use the same Gen9 graphics engine used in Apollo Lake, but it will have support for HDMI 2.0 output (Apollo Lake appears to only support the older HDMI 1.4 standard). More interestingly, FanlessTech says that it will include what Intel calls a "Goldmont Plus" CPU core (Apollo Lake has vanilla Goldmont cores), much more level 2 cache memory (four megabytes, twice what Apollo Lake has), and integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity (Apollo Lake has no wireless connectivity integrated). In other words, it looks like Intel is planning a rather meaningful improvement to its low-cost personal-computer products. Business implications Intel's customers -- that is, the personal-computer makers -- want to be able to refresh their product lines each year, so it's important that Intel be ready with new processors to power those new systems. Beyond its customers' desire to refresh their products, Intel generally benefits when it integrates more features and functionality into its chips. Indeed, if FanlessTech is correct that Gemini Lake integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, then this means two things. Firstly, system vendors building computers around the Gemini Lake platform will no longer need to buy separate Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chips. This means fewer components to buy and integrate for the system vendors, leading to lower costs and potential form-factor improvements. Secondly, since Intel is offering a feature of value to its customers, it may be able to boost its asking prices for the chips. In the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip example, if the chip previously cost a system vendor $5, then Intel might raise its chip price by, say, $2.50. That price increase would mean revenue and profit increases for Intel, while at the same time saving its customers money -- a "win-win" proposition for all involved. And, finally, with Microsoft more aggressively pushing Windows on the ARM architecture, Intel rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been rather vocal about trying to push its ARM-based Snapdragon chips into thin-and-light notebook computers. "We have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the data center," Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on an April investor call. "Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter of this year." One of Qualcomm's key advantages is that its chips integrate connectivity technology with the applications processor. The more such technologies that Intel can integrate into its future chips, the better prepared it will be to defend itself against Qualcomm (and other potential ARM-based chip vendors) in the notebook personal-computer market.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Family fight: Microsoft’s Surface Pro… Family fight: Microsoft’s Surface Pro battles the Microsoft Surface Laptop By Mark Coppock — Updated May 27, 2017 8:49 am Subscribe Share Alexander Kalogianni/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Microsoft just released the new Surface Pro, a minor but nifty revision of the popular Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro joins the new Surface Laptop as the youngest member of the Microsoft Surface family, and in some ways, these two machines are as similar as they are different. As a Windows 10 2-in-1, the Surface Pro — which officially drops Microsoft’s numbering scheme — aims to provide additional flexibility, whereas the Surface Laptop wants to be the ultimate notebook for traditionalists. Inside, the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop bear a striking resemblance to one another, especially given both have adopted new color schemes and matching accessories. They’re also similarly equipped in the hardware department, when it comes to processing power, RAM, and storage. It’s as if Microsoft engineered two different species from the same genetic material. But which machine is right for you? Below, we pitted the two directly against one another in an effort to suss out the details. Specifications by-the-numbers Surface Laptop Surface Pro (2017) Dimensions 12.13 x 8.79 x .57 (in) 11.50 x 7.9 x 0.33 (in) Weight 2.76 pounds 1.69 – 1.73 pounds Processor 7th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 7th-generation Intel Core m3, i5, or i7 RAM 4G, 8GB, or 16GB 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB Display 13.5-inch PixelSense display 12.3-in PixelSense display Resolution 2,256 × 1,504 2,736 x 1,824 Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD Networking 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, optional LTE Ports USB Type-A 3.0, mini-DisplayPort, Surface Connect port, 3.5mm headset USB Type-A, mini-DisplayPort, Surface Connect Port, 3.5mm headset jack, microSDXC card reader Webcam 720p HD with infrared camera for Windows Hello support 5.0MP 1080p front-facing camera with infrared camera for Windows Hello support, 8.0MP 1080p rear-facing autofocus camera Operating System Windows 10 S, upgradeable to Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Battery Up to 14.5 hours Up to 13.5 hours Price $999+ $799+ Availability Available June 15 Available June 15 Review Hands-on Hands-on Similar designs, different materials Microsoft has done a masterful job in creating a design aesthetic for the Surface line that maintains the brand’s identity but isn’t simply cookie cutter. The Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are obviously of the same family, but each looks and feels like it should for the kind of machine it is. They’re both solidly build with the usual Surface quality and attention to detail, and they both incorporate a splash of color with Alcantara fabric surrounding the keyboard. Of course, they’re also completely different machines. The Surface Laptop is — as the name implies — a traditional clamshell notebook without any kind of convertibility. The Surface Pro, on the other hand, is a tablet that turns into a notebook-style machine when the Type Cover keyboard is snapped on. In fact, Microsoft stopped calling the Surface Pro a “tablet that can replace your notebook” and just refers to it generically as a “laptop.” Tricky. In terms of specifics, the Surface Laptop is machined from a chunk of aluminum, eschewing the magnesium alloy used on other Surface devices. It’s very thin for a notebook at 0.57 inches, and light at 2.76 pounds, making it thinner and lighter than Apple’s MacBook Pro 13. The Surface Laptop is a wedge design, meaning that it tapers from its thickest point at the rear down to very thin at the front, which results in a more comfortable typing angle. It also incorporates the aforementioned Alcantara fabric on the keyboard deck that comes in four colors — platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold — and the optional Surface Pen comes in the same color scheme. Notably, the Surface Laptop carries the same color scheme throughout its chassis and is, therefore, a very colorful machine as well. The Surface Pro is made from the company’s usual magnesium alloy, and it’s very similar to the previous generations, only with slightly rounded edges. It’s a touch thinner and lighter, at 0.33 inches and a maximum of 1.73 pounds, but not by much, demonstrating that Microsoft found a comfortable mix of design and materials and then stuck with it. Attach the new keyboard and the combination weighs in at 2.41 pounds, which is similar to the Surface Laptop when fully assembled. Speaking of, the new Signature Type Covers are slightly improved over the previous models and are covered in Alcantara fabric in platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, or black. The Surface Pen can be color matched as well, but isn’t included with the tablet — or rather, laptop — this time around. The Surface Pro itself is the same magnesium silver as past Surface devices, and thus features a more muted design overall. It’s hard to pick a winner between these two machines. They’re both similarly thin and light when all of the required accessories are taken into account, and they’re both well-built and very attractive machines. You can’t even fault one over the other in terms of notebook versus 2-in-1 because either form factor can be right or wrong depending on a given user’s requirements. Winner: Tie Great display vs. even better display If there’s one thing Microsoft got right with the Surface line, it’s its choice in displays. First, it switched to the 3:2 aspect ratio with the Surface Pro 3, which is taller than the common 16:9 widescreen ratio and better for productivity. There’s some letterboxing when watching video, but you get to see more of your documents. Second, Microsoft uses high-resolution and high-quality displays that are sharp, offer excellent contrast with deep blacks, and provide solid color support. No matter which Surface you buy, you’re guaranteed to get one of the best displays around. The display on the Surface Laptop is a 13.5-inch PixelSense panel with 2,256 x 1,504 resolution, or 201PPI. It features Corning Gorilla Glass for scratch and shatter resistance, and it supports 10-point multitouch and the Surface Pen. A 720p HD webcam sits above the display where it belongs, and an infrared camera provides Windows Hello support via facial recognition. The Surface Pro sports a 12.3-inch PixelSense display with 2,736 x 1,824 resolution, or 267PPI — making it one of the sharpest “laptop” displays around. It’s also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass, and offers 10-point multitouch and Surface Pen support. The Surface Pro’s active digitizer has been enhanced with a hardware accelerator and quadruples the pressure sensitivity at 4,096 levels, and so it’s the best-performing and most accurate of all the Surface devices for drawing and handwriting on the screen. A 5-megapixel, 1080p HD webcam is on front, with Windows Hello support via infrared camera and facial recognition, and there’s an 8-megapixel camera with autofocus and 1080p video support on the back. Again, it’s difficult to pick a winner here. These are excellent displays with high resolutions — albeit, neither are 4K UHD — and the same 3:2 aspect ratio. They both support touch and pen input, although both make far more sense on the detachable Surface Pro. You really can’t go wrong with either. We’re going to give the nod here to the Surface Pro, however, given its higher sharpness and its superior pen specifications. Plus, it’s simply a more natural device for Windows Inking. Winner: Surface Pro Very similar for typing and touching Microsoft’s most recent Type Covers have always provided a solid typing experience, with some points taken away for providing a slightly less stable experience when the keyboard is magnetically attached at an angle. Microsoft has used a similar keyboard design on the Surface Laptop, and of course, the use of Alcantara fabric across the board means that the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are going to feel very similar when in use. Both keyboards offer 1.5-millimeter travel, and a similar feel. The touchpads are also similar, with Microsoft Precision Touchpad support, multitouch capability, and a glass surface. The Surface Laptop’s touchpad appears to be a bit larger, however, and that counts for something. It’s becoming a theme in this comparison, but again, picking a winner is difficult. If you went back and forth between the two machines, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in the typing and touchpad experience. However, the Type Cover does bounce around a little when typing, and isn’t as spacious, so we think the Surface Laptop edges out the Surface Pro here. Winner: Surface Laptop Almost identical hardware The Surface Laptop utilizes Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, with the former offering Intel HD 620 graphics and the latter bumping up to Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics. UP to 16GB of RAM can be configured, and up to a 1TB PCIe SSD can be selected (eventually, but just 512GB for now). All of that makes the Surface Laptop competitive on paper with other thin-and-light notebooks. The Surface Pro offers a wider range of processors, including the low-power Intel Core m3, Core i5, and Core i7. Notably, the Core m3 and Core i5 models are fanless, meaning they’ll be completely silent in operation but could theoretically slow down more quickly when they heat up. The Core i7 also promises quieter fans than previous generations. The Surface Pro can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and up to a 1TB PCIe SSD, and it also offers Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics with the Core i7 option. Obviously, it’s reasonable to expect these peers to perform similarly. The big difference is the availability of a less powerful Core m3 chip in the Pro, which is not available in the Laptop. Winner: Tie Both are limited to the past when it comes to plugging in Microsoft has taken a curious position regarding the increasingly ubiquitous USB Type-C connection. While most manufacturers are moving steadily in the direction of this futuristic connectivity, Microsoft believes that the USB Type-C connection is basically too confusing for its customers. We tend to think that’s a bit silly, and that it’s a real shame that Microsoft left off a port that would provide some additional longevity. That said, the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro both offer similarly limited connectivity. Both have a single USB 3.0 Type-A port, a mini-DisplayPort, the Surface Connect port, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. The Surface Pro, however, includes a Type Cover connector and microSD card reader. We’re disappointed with the connectivity of both machines. However, the Surface Pro can at least more easily transfer some images from a camera given its microSD card reader, and so we’ll grudgingly give that machine the win in this category. Winner: Surface Pro The laptop lasts longer than the 2-in-1 As mentioned above, both the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are thin and light machines for their respective categories. And, when you attach the Type Cover to the Surface Pro, the two machines become even more alike in terms of tossing in a backpack and carrying around. The Surface Laptop is a larger machine because of its larger display, but there’s remarkably little difference between the two machines otherwise. The same can be said for battery life, where Microsoft has made some promising strides. On paper, at least, and depending on the configuration, Microsoft is promising 14.5 hours of battery life with the Surface Laptop and 13.5 hours with the Surface Pro. That gives the Laptop a small victory here. Winner: Surface Laptop Pricing and availability The Surface Laptop was introduced at Microsoft’s recent education-oriented event, which was odd considering that it’s not at all an inexpensive machine. Microsoft anticipates that it will be popular among college students who might otherwise gravitate toward a MacBook, but otherwise, it’s not going to make its way into many classrooms. It starts at $999 with a Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD, and jumps all the way up to $2,199 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Surface Laptop comes standard with the limited Windows 10 S, which only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store. That’s not going to be popular with many buyers of this class of machine, and it makes us wonder exactly what Microsoft is planning. It’s easy enough to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, however, and that’s free until the end of 2017 when the upgrade will cost $49. The Surface Pro is priced similarly to the Surface Pro 4, though the as-yet-unpriced new Surface Pen is no longer included. Pricing starts at $799 for a Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, and jumps all the way up to $2,699 for a Core i7, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It is, therefore, a real mix in terms of pricing, offering decent pricing at the low end but then heading straight for the stratosphere when more attractively configured. Keep in mind that the Signature Type Cover runs $160, meaning that a fully-equipped, entry-level Surface Pro will cost around $960, plus whatever price Microsoft attaches to the new Surface Pen. Winner: Tie Conclusion It might not seem fair to pit these two against each other. They’re aimed at different markets with very different use cases. Yet they’re very similar machines, and we bet many are wondering if it makes sense to leap to the Surface Pro’s 2-in-1 design, or stick with the more traditional Laptop. Our comparison tilts slightly in favor of the Surface Pro. It has a better display, a wider range of configuration options, and a more versatile package. In exchange, it’s not quite as enjoyable to use as a laptop, and drops an hour of quoted battery life. Weighing the pros and cons can be difficult, a choice must be made — and the Pro is the one we’d buy.

The reverse engineering experts at TechInsights have been doing just that, and they recently published their initial findings. With some of the first high-resolution die photographs of 3D XPoint, TechInsights has provided precise measurements of the die size and memory density. The 128Gb 3D XPoint die is 206.5 mm2, much larger than is typical for modern NAND flash or DRAM but comparable to Intel's 128Gb 20nm planar MLC NAND. A large total die size is typical for Intel and Micron, as they have historically not catered to the mobile market with their NAND flash while competitors like Samsung and Toshiba have strived to ensure their flash will physically fit in devices like smartphones. (That trend is changing with the introduction this year of 64-layer 3D NAND where Intel and Micron are producing both a larger 512Gb TLC part and a smaller 256Gb TLC part.) The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is using memory of similar density to the Intel SSD DC P3700 that it is displacing as the flagship of Intel's SSD product line. When comparing similar chips, die size is a strong predictor of manufacturing cost, but 3D XPoint memory is quite different from NAND flash memory, both older planar NAND or newer 3D NAND. Still, there's some value in noting that the P4800X is arriving with a price tag about 25% higher than the P3700 initially carried. This suggests that the manufacturing process for 3D XPoint is either more expensive than planar NAND or that 3D XPoint yields are not mature enough, but a lot of the markup can also be explained by the lack of high-performance competition for Optane SSDs. TechInsights calculates that 91.4% of the 3D XPoint die area is occupied by the memory array itself. This is a much higher figure than for NAND flash, where the record is 84.9% for Intel/Micron 3D NAND with its "CMOS under the array" design that puts a large portion of the peripheral circuitry underneath the memory array instead of alongside. Samsung's current 48-layer 3D V-NAND manages an array efficiency of just 70%, and 3D NAND from Toshiba and SK Hynix has been comparable. This means that once Intel gets around to increasing they layer count in future generations of 3D XPoint memory, they should be able to get much closer to the ideal capacity scaling than 3D NAND memory can currently achieve. The analysis from TechInsights confirms that 3D XPoint memory is manufactured using a 20nm process, with the same pitch in both the bitline and wordline directions of the memory array. The DRAM market is only just moving beyond this milestone, so comparing the density of 3D XPoint to current DRAM highlights the fundamental capacity advantage 3D XPoint enjoys: around 4.5 times higher density compared to typical 20nm DRAM, and about 3.3 times higher than the most advanced 1Xnm DDR4 on the market. This gap is likely to widen with future generations of 3D XPoint. The materials and construction of an individual 3D XPoint memory cell have not been fully analyzed, but it appears to be a phase change memory element with a doped chalcogenide selector switch. The 3D XPoint memory array is constructed between the fourth and fifth metal interconnect layers above the silicon die.

POST A COMMENT 12 Comments View All Comments wumpus - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Interesting article. I wonder if the emphasis on comparing 3dxpoint to MLC/TLC flash was techinsight's idea or anandtech's. From the original propaganda coming from Intel, I expected a memory that would barge in between DRAM and Flash, forcing DRAM to act more like a cache (presumably something like HBM connected to the CPU) and in turn caching slower, denser, and cheaper Flash (TLC or denser). This also appears to be what Intel thought with the shipping Optane, although that is pretty much moot after the introduction of pseudo-SLC 3d flash (no real caching needed, although it might make a good dram replacement in SSDs). And of course the big questions remain: can Intel get the latency below milliseconds and get the endurance enough to use <1ms latency? Reply vladx - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link It's only the first generation, I think Intel's hype numbers were for much later when the technology finally matures. Reply melgross - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Seriously, I'm always surprised when tech types are disappointed in new technology. As it is, this provides a NJ get of major advantages, and it's just first generation. When did NAND first come out, 20 years ago? I still have a NAND card from my old Agfa minilab that cost US $250 and has 4MB storage (it was used to store settings in the machine.) Give this a few years. I mean, the first usable SSD was just 16GB. The ones we saw back then as really usable were, by todays standards for SSD, very slow, and cost $3,600 for a 32GB drive. Reply dwrivers - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Take a look at the Optane drive review from a few weeks ago and you'll see that latency is <10uS with 5-9s <100uS. The endurance is listed as 30 drive-writes per day. Looks like the technology is delivering something new and exciting that fits between DRAM and NAND Flash. http://www.anandtech.com/show/11209/intel-optane-s... Reply hahmed330 - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Optane will probably never replace DRAM unless ridiculously drastic improvements are made since DRAM pretty much have a legendary endurance that optane probably could never match. As a caching scratch board it can make sense, but it's usefulness is quite limited especially for your average Joe. Reply boeush - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link So they only need to stack 8 layers of this to leave the most advanced 3D NAND in the dust density/capacity-wise, without even stepping fien to a smaller process node. The only issue then would be cost per die - something that might well be resolved through higher volumes and better yields... I can see this completely replacing NAND within the next 10 years or so... Reply jjj - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link This is highly misleading , you focus on density when manufacturing is very different from NAND and DRAM. You do realize that most of your readers don't understand that cost is not just die size. Even you don't seem to understand the difference between costs and pricing. Cost isn't really a factor in how XPoint is priced today. Reply dwrivers - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link The article says that die size is a "strong predictor" of cost, which it certainly is. Reply jjj - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Not even close to that when you compare 2 very different things. Reply jjj - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link And to state the obvious, since the article fails to do so, XPoint competes with NAND as is lacks the specs to compete with DRAM. If you look at bit density vs Micron's 64L 256GB, 4.34 vs 0.62, that's 7 times. That only gets worse as the 3D NAND architecture is aimed at scaling on the vertical while XPoint isn't. WD/Toshiba likely have a more 3D NAND like architecture for their ReRAM, we'll see soon enough. As for DRAM, we'll see ,it might go 4F2, might go 3D , might even be replaced by a SCM.

Reuters More On: israel Palestinian prisoners end 40-day hunger strike The Six-Day War at 50: Jerusalem then and now Trump draws ire for message at Holocaust museum Trump says peace between Israelis and Palestinians is key to ending Middle East conflict Wondering where to find the next tech startup propelling humanity to the next best thing? Israel’s answer to Silicon Valley is Silicon Wadi, an area around Tel Aviv on the country’s coastal plain with a heavy concentration of high-tech industries that rivals the San Francisco Bay-area’s cluster of innovative firms. There are about 4,300 startups operating in Israel, with about 2,900 of these located within a 10-mile radius, a rate of development second in intensity to only Silicon Valley itself. Even as President Trump was meeting with the Israeli political elite on the Jerusalem leg of his first foreign trip, a huge slice of that country’s brain trust was gathered in Midtown Manhattan to explore the reasons behind this tech wave and showcase some of the developments that have enabled this small country to punch above its weight. Or maybe jumping would be a more apt metaphor. “The cat flea has the ability to jump almost 200 times its height,” Oded Shoseyov, a professor of protein engineering and nano biotechnology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told the crowd at Nexus: Israel, a gathering sponsored by the American Friends of Hebrew University. Shoseyov, who has his name on more than 50 patents and has served as the scientific founder of 10 companies specializing in everything from nanotechnology to production of medical cannabis, says that one of the most exciting scientific quests is understanding the jumping power of the flea. That and other marvels of nature are helping spark solutions to real-world challenges faced by humans. CollPlant, one of the companies he helped found, is attempting to bioengineer solutions to these problems by cloning human DNA onto tobacco plants. “I have no doubt that we’ll be able to produce a human heart in the laboratory,” he says. “This heart is not going to be the same as a human heart, it’s going to be better.” One of the more established players in both Silicon Valley and its Middle Eastern rival is Intel Corp., which set up a research and production operation in Israel in 1972. Intel Israel has since grown to the point where it has become Israel’s largest private employer, with more than 10,200 workers on its payroll as of last year. According to Maxine Fassberg, executive in residence and vice president of Intel Capital, the company exported $3.35 billion of chips and other products from Israel last year, accounting for 1 percent to 2 percent of the country’s GDP. In addition to the tech developments fostered by Intel, Fassberg credits both Israel’s defense sector and its academia for propelling this development. “The bottom line is the people and the quality of the education there,” she says. For his part, Dr. Yaron Daniely, chief executive of Yissum, Hebrew University’s technology transfer arm, and himself the driving force behind many Israeli developments in medical technology, credits the amazing performance of Israeli R&D to “chutzpah,” shown in the willingness of the country’s scientists and entrepreneurs to take on risk. “Exceptional people exist everywhere who are more creative than others, but that doesn’t guarantee success,” he points out. “We were arrogant Israelis. We didn’t think that we were stupid.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under israel ,  patents ,  silicon valley ,  tel aviv Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos does the unthinkable with new Amazon book store Read Next Jeff Bezos does the unthinkable with new Amazon book store Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 50,017 How Team Obama tried to hack the election 26,971 I was a Saudi arms dealer's 'pleasure wife' 16,624 Why these couples are leaving NYC to live on cruise ships Now On Heidi Klum bares all in sexy new photo book Rock royalty pays tribute to legendary Gregg Allman Cannes audience gives film standing ovation after bomb scare SEE ALL Video 0:47 After 17 years of trying to conceive, woman gives birth to sextuplets Now On 10 Shocking Stories Behind Famous Sex Scenes SEE ALL More Stories page six Paranoid Bill Cosby fears his drink will be spiked before trial Now On Decider 10 Movies Where The Actors Had Real Sex On Camera nypost How Team Obama tried to hack the election New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy Book 12 review Samsung's Galaxy Book aims for the stars, but barely breaks orbit Share The Galaxy Book’s display is out of this world, but its battery life and keyboard keep it grounded. The Galaxy Book’s display is out of this world, but its battery life and keyboard keep it grounded. The Galaxy Book’s display is out of this world, but its battery life and keyboard keep it grounded. Highs Thin and light OLED display looks beautiful Clear, loud speakers Solid processor performance Lows Awkward keyboard cover Lacks built-in stand Poor battery life DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Samsung Galaxy Book 12 review By Brad Bourque Posted on 05.26.17 Research Center: Samsung Galaxy Book Over the last few years, 2-in-1 and hybrid systems have gone a from clumsy pipe-dream to something of a creative outlet for normally stodgy computer makers. It’s also given traditionally smartphone-centric brands like Samsung and LG an entry point into the computing market, by leveraging existing skills building tablets. Samsung’s previous attempt, the TabPro S, was alright. Its awkward design didn’t sit right with laptop users, but the Super AMOLED screen looked great. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and Plus improved on the formula, but without Windows 10, they focused on budget buyers instead of competing with the Surface Pro 4. The Galaxy Book hits the reset button on Samsung’s 2-in-1 line, with Windows 10, two size options, Intel Core i5 processors, and an improved Super AMOLED screens that promise deep black levels and unmatched contrast. Pricing starts at $1,130 for the 12-inch version, which has 4GB of RAM and a 128GB solid state drive. Our review unit, upgraded to 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, retails for $1,330. Is the Galaxy Book a new beginning for Samsung’s PC ambitions? Let’s find out. Unbearably light There are two distinct pieces to Samsung’s Galaxy Book — the tablet, and the detachable keyboard. The tablet itself shows off Samsung’s strong points, with a design language lifted directly off its Galaxy smartphone line. It has sleek, rounded edges, and a medium-dark silver color that users may recognize from the Chromebook Plus. It’s light enough to work well as a tablet, with a texture that doesn’t slip, although the buttons on the upper left aren’t exactly convenient. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The trade-off is that the Galaxy Book is so very, very light, it doesn’t feel like a sturdy system. There’s no panel flex, and there are no major gaps to speak of, but the Competiting Surface Pro keeps its weight below two pounds as well, and feels a lot more premium than the Galaxy Book. The shape is also very nondescript – which will work for some people. Both systems suffer the same issues when used as a laptop. The Galaxy Book has a folio keyboard, so it wraps around the system like a hot dog bun, with magnetic points on the cover to stick to magnetic points on the tablet. Propping up the screen means scooting the back cover down to one of several points, as opposed to the kickstand on the Surface Pro, which adjustable to any position along its range of motion. While neither system sits well on your lap, the Galaxy Book takes up gobs of space, which makes it particularly hard to use in tight quarters. A few good ports The Galaxy Book has a pair of USB Type-C ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. That’s a common set of configurations for the category, and even beats out the new Surface Pro, which only boats a Type-A USB Port. The Galaxy Book charges over either of its Type-C ports, where the Surface’s magnetic power connection pops right out if someone trips on the cable. There are advantages on both sides, but the Galaxy Book certainly has the better set of wired plugs. For wireless connections, the Galaxy Book packs in 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and optional LTE. Feeling awkward As we mentioned above, the Galaxy Book’s detachable keyboard and touchpad don’t set the bar high for sturdiness and space. Despite a physical connection to the system, we often saw lag in keyboard and trackpad response after the system was sitting idle for a short time. It didn’t take long, and even during our screen testing, we had issues when we didn’t touch either input for less than 30 seconds. It’s a minor inconvenience, but also one that shouldn’t exist. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The keys themselves have solid travel, with a soft, linear action that will appeal to laptop users looking for something light for occasional typing. It’s backlit, as well, with three different color settings that illuminate the characters, and the keycaps around them, in a bluish off-white. Active stylus support is the saving grace for the so-far-troubled Galaxy Book. The pen provides a sharp, responsive writing experience, although its’ drawings capabilities don’t quite match the sensitivity levels provided by the Surface Pen and PixelSense display. The pen writes a familiar story. On its own, it feels comfortable and light, if not on the small side. It writes well, and Samsung’s handwriting wizardry is sharp and reliable. Sitting next to the Surface Pen, the difference is evident immediately. The Surface Pen’s sturdy, barrel-shaped design feels excellent in hand, writes and draws beautifully, and has a real button and eraser, where the Galaxy Pen only has a side button. Movie and music machine Finally, the Galaxy Book has its moment in the sun. Samsung’s displays have always been a strong point for the brand, and it was one of the first manufacturers to put OLED displays into laptops. Organic LEDs create their own light when powered, so there’s no glow in the dark areas of the screen, resulting in perfectly flat black levels. No, the number isn’t a mistake — the Samsung really did hit a contrast ratio above 300,000:1, thanks to the perfect black levels provided by its Super AMOLED panel. It dunked on the Surface Pro 4, which boasted one of the best contrast ratios we’ve seen from a non-OLED screen at just over 1,000:1. The Surface Pro 4 must backlight the whole screen all the time, so even a completely black screen still has some brightness to it, where the Samsung has none. Color accuracy was nothing to write home about, but that’s typically only important to those designing design or production work. The Samsung makes up for it by covering a whopping 99 percent of the AdobeRGB spectrum, a quality we’re only used to seeing in high-end desktop monitors, and the very best laptop screens. The screen is a joy in everyday use. Not only does the screen score exceptionally well in almost all our tests, it’s a joy in everyday use. Deep black levels are incredibly important when it comes to image quality and immersion, because they allow greater sense of depth, and greater detail in shadows. A simple, black jacket is the perfect example. Most laptops and 2-in-1s will display the jacket as dark grey, with little detail in the fabric. On the Samsung Galaxy Book 12, however, the jacket looked dark as night, and showed fine detail in the fabric’s texture. That makes Samsung’s device a superb choice for movies. The Galaxy Book also manages to pack in some serious speakers for its size. Even at full volume, they produce loud, clear sound, with just a hint of distortion, something we’re not used to hearing from laptops in general, let alone a 12-inch 2-in-1. Bass is lacking, but we don’t expect great subwoofers in any laptop, even massive gaming machines. Ready to sprint Our review unit packed in the Core i5-7200U with 8GB of RAM, a step up from the 4GB of RAM found in the base 12-inch model. It’s bound to perform much better than the Core M chips that are becoming more common, but is far from a powerhouse. Compared to similar systems, the Galaxy Book holds its own performance-wise. Granted, these are all a far cry from the sort of performance we see from higher-end laptops, but power tends to take a backseat to versatility and portability with 2-in-1s — a solid trade, if it’s fair on both sides. None of them are built for encoding video, so the slow times on the 4K conversion test shouldn’t be a major concern. In everyday use, the Galaxy Book didn’t feel sluggish or unresponsive, which becomes the more pertinent question at this end of the performance spectrum. Snappy performance and fast boot times are critical, and the Galaxy Book 12 did not disappoint. Just an SSD The SSD in our review unit had 256GB of capacity, which is the other half of the upgrade from the base 12-inch model. The drive connects over the usual SATA standard. Some systems are moving towards the PCIe connection, which has performance benefits. While Samsung’s read and write speeds were competitive, both the HP EliteBook and Surface Pro 4 beat them handily, thanks to their use of the faster PCIe connection. The Surface Pro 4 is a middle ground, with faster read speeds, but write speeds that fall in line with the Galaxy Book. Given the price, we feel giving the Galaxy Book 12 a PCIe drive would’ve been the right call. It’s ironic, actually – Samsung itself produces some of the best solid state drives, but its 2-in-1 falls behind competitors in this area. Game off We have yet to see a 2-in-1 with any sort of graphical power, and the Galaxy Book is no different. Its Intel HD 620 integrated GPU is fine for 2D games and HD movies, but lacks the sort of power, and driver support, needed for modern 3D titles. The 3DMark scores of the competitors fell close to each other, but were all well short of even the most basic dedicated GPU options found in larger systems. Not that we expect anywhere near that sort of performance, particularly in smaller, portable machines like the Surface Pro and Galaxy Book. Its benchmark performance didn’t give us confidence in the Galaxy Book’s gaming prowess, and a quick test run in Sid Meier’s Civilization VI only confirmed that. The game ran at just over 10 frames per second on average at 1080p, with 2X MSAA on, and both sliders set to medium. At Ultra, it went from moderately unplayable to a complete slideshow, at five frames per second. It might be able to play the odd round of Hearthstone, but if your first question is “can it game?” it’s unlikely you’ll be satisfied with the answer. Compact size, compact battery Coming in under two pounds, the Galaxy Book is exceptionally compact. It folds up neatly, and its small footprint means it shouldn’t have any issue fitting into a small back or laptop backpack. That’s only half the story. The other half is battery life, an area where 2-in-1s don’t just need to be average, they need to be excellent. It’s one of the main draws in a lightweight laptop, and the Galaxy Book does fine, but that’s about the nicest we can say. It falls behind the Elitebook G2 in longevity in all but the video playback loop, where both systems lasted just over 12 hours. Both Peacekeeper and a web browsing loop drained the Galaxy Book’s battery in less than five hours, well short of the Elitebook. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 lasted six hours, 26 minutes in the Peacekeeper test – and its hardware is several generations older. We’ve not yet tested the battery life of the new Surface Pro. We previously hoped that OLED screens would improve battery life, but in practice, that’s only been the case in certain situations. That said, the Galaxy Book packs plenty of battery life for a mixed workload, although you may still want to bring a charger to the office. Ditch the screensaver Samsung has kept its Windows 10 installation clean for the most part, although there were certainly some oddities right out of the box. For one, Samsung still insists on using a screensaver, which is just the default cheesy spinning text. As Microsoft has moved almost every system setting into the new Settings pane, screensaver options were left in the old dialogue menu, so turning it off requires a few steps. Samsung Galaxy Book Compared To Samsung Chromebook Pro Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Acer Spin 7 Lenovo Yoga Book Samsung Notebook 7 spin Dell Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Acer Switch Alpha 12 Huawei Matebook Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Dell XPS 12 (2013) Lenovo ThinkPad Helix Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 Apart from that, there’s no extra bloatware to speak of. Samsung includes a settings panel, but it rolls everything esoteric about the machine into one simple application, including screen options, keyboard and stylus options, and even customer support and warranty links. If manufacturers must include such a menu, that’s the way we prefer they do it. Warranty Samsung’s one year limited warranty on the Galaxy Book is typical of the category. Our Take Samsung’s Galaxy Book 12 aims squarely at Microsoft’s Surface Pro and similar 2-in-1s, and it lands at least one hit – display quality. For some users, the OLED screen will be the killer feature, and admittedly, there’s a lot of appeal to a system that makes watching movies and music videos an absolute pleasure. Yet you might not watch for long, because the tablet’s battery life is a sore spot. Is there a better alternative? Yes. In fact, that’s the Samsung’s biggest issue. It seems appealing at a glance, but loses when set next to the cheaper, more refined Surface Pro. HP’s EliteBook x360 G2 is more expensive, but has one of our favorite laptop keyboards and killer performance. There’s no shortage of competitive 2-in-1s, which means Samsung must really kill it to make a name for itself. The Galaxy Book doesn’t go far enough. How long will it last? Samsung’s adoption of cutting edge tech is limited to the Super AMOLED screen and active stylus support. It’s unlikely any major new features will come to the category in the next few years, and a full-power SSD also helps this system go the distance. Whether it will physically hold up is a question only time can answer, but that keyboard may need a replacement after a couple years. Should you buy it? No, unless the Galaxy Book will spend most its life playing movies. It’s not that the Galaxy Book is a bad option – but there are better options for a lower price.
Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Our Report covers Major Patent Troller Uniloc Filing 3 Lawsuits against Apple and a Video taking a Peek at the 'Patent Scam' Industry | Main May 27, 2017 Major Tech & Industrial Companies Race to Acquire AI Startups as the AI Revolution Draws Nigh   It was just yesterday that we posted a report titled "Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges." Two weeks ago we posted a report titled "AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response." One of Reuters latest reports makes the same point about the activity surrounding AI in the tech sector.   A new Reuters report quotes a statement by research firm CB Insights about the AI frenzy: "A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel respectively."   The companies noted in the report declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data.   Apple is focused mainly on the retail/consumer sector while AI is ripping through all sectors of technology. Nvidia's Tesla P100 AI GPU was just adopted by IBM who see's this GPU as a game changer for the AI revolution.   Intel is going full tilt into into AI and made one of their largest acquisitions ever to gain Israel's Mobileye for autonomous vehicles. And the Reuters report today points to Ford Motor spending a billion dollars on Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams ag Google and Uber Technologies.   Large acquisitions aside, Apple never talks about their plans or projects. We know for a fact that they have a Project Titan team resides in Ottawa Canada in an industrial park that houses a research team from BlackBerry developing an autonomous vehicle OS and Apple is hiring as many of BlackBerry engineers that they can for their carOS efforts. You can't be developing an carOS for autonomous vehicles without a connection to AI. So while we don't know at what stage Apple is at, it's assured that one of their AI projects is related to Project Titan. One of their major AI acquisitions was Vocal IQ, a company that had a major focus on a digital assistant designed for the autonomous car.   I remember the unveiling of Apple's iPhone in 2007 which set off the mobile revolution which was an amazing time to see unfold. The AI revolution is not yet here. All we see is the preparation for the AI revolution, but for now it's just tiny baby steps coming to market in the form of Home devices and elementary digital assistants.   So many industries are banking on the coming 5G networks to help ignite the revolution and that's only three years away. So time will tell if that's when the starting gun for the AI Revolution truly fires.Yet whenever it does, we'll get to behold one of the most interesting times in history unfold. The AI revolution will of course dwarf the mobile revolution in shear scope covering every major market sector from the consumer, to the enterprise, to vehicles, to home automation, robotics and far beyond. It's a wonderful time to be alive.  For more on this, read the new Reuters report titled "Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The VR Ready flavor of the XPS 27 has the same 4K display and the same 10-speaker audio sub-system as the latest iteration of the large XPS AIO, but is powered by a more powerful CPU from Intel along with AMD’s discrete Radeon RX 570 graphics board. AIO PCs have existed for decades, with their continued popularity fueled by their compact, desk-sized footprint. In the recent years demand for higher performance and even gaming-grade all-in-ones increased noticeably, and manufacturers started to offer AIOs with rather powerful hardware. In fact, in early 2016 several PC makers even introduced Mini-ITX-based AIOs with top-of-the-range discrete graphics cards aiming at customers seeking for maximum performance. Dell’s new XPS 27 with the VR Ready badge are designed for gamers with average requirements for performance. The systems are still considerably more powerful than their predecessors launched earlier this year are because they do not use integrated or mobile graphics, but rely on AMD’s Radeon RX 570 (2048 stream processors, 128 texture units, 32 ROPs, 256-bit memory bus, etc.) graphics adapter with 8 GB of memory. Meanwhile, the key feature of the latest XPS 27 remained intact: the audio sub-system with 10 speakers (six on the front, two down firing and two radiating) designed to enable surround sound without using bulky external audio equipment. The VR Ready versions of the Dell XPS 27 are based on Intel’s Core i7-7700 CPU as well as the H170 PCH. By default, the systems are equipped with 16 GB of DDR4-2133 memory, but that is upgradeable to 64 GB. As for storage, the PCs have one M.2 slot (PCIe 3.0 x4) as well as two 2.5” bays for HDDs or SSDs, all accessible to the end user. When it comes to connectivity, the Dell XPS 27 feature 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.x, a GbE port, five USB 3.0 Type-A headers, one HDMI output, one DisplayPort 1.2, two Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB Type-C), an SD/MMC card reader, a 720p webcam with an IR sensor for facial recognition, a microphone and so on. Overall, there are plenty of ports to plug-in additional peripherals, including various VR gear.

Meanwhile, computers with touch-enabled screens also feature articulating stands for added convenience. The stand comes at an extra cost, so some gamers may prefer to install a larger SSD and/or more memory and skip the touch option. At present Dell offers two versions of the VR Ready XPS 27 featuring Intel’s Core i7-7700 CPU and AMD’s Radeon RX 570 GPU, but different storage configurations and touch support. The model with a 2 TB HDD and 32 GB caching SSD costs $1999.99, whereas the model with a 512 GB PCIe SSD, a touchscreen display with articulating stand and optional Windows 10 Pro comes at $2,649.99.

What I would change is the sparse 32GB SSD cache in the 2000 dollar model, had it been a 128GB cache (like the Surface Studio or 2TB Fusion Drive) it would be ok to have a rust drive in there.

Reply Hul8 - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link I wonder if the touch display works with stylus pens. If that is the case, this kind of a computer would make for a good computer for artist types.

Reply Lolimaster - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link If you can put a i7 7700 you can put a Ryzen 5 1600 or Ryzen 1700 which murder that outdated cpu for even less price.

Xeon X5670 @ 4.4ghz DDR3 @ 1600 7-8-7 GTX 970 I am wanting to go Ryzen, but I am undecided on whether to buy a 1600x or a 1700/x. I have a new 4k monitor, and use the pc for: Netflix/Hulu/Youtubes Browsing Gaming (Diablo3, Forza Horizon 3, and some others,) FH3 is the most demanding game i play currently I multitask a bit, always have a browser open with couple of tabs on 2nd monitor while gaming. The 6 core xeon was usually enough for this, except for FH3, and honestly the 970 doesnt cut it for that game @4k either. But gfx upgrade will wait until Pascal2 So....Which Ryzen do I buy, I will likely hold onto the system 4+ years. I WILL be ocing the cpu, I have an open loop with a tripple 120 rad and a MCP655 pump.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) have been on a volatile ride this month. AMD stock came into May hot, up 20%. Shares subsequently lost 24% after AMD missed revenue estimates and reported in-line earnings results. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Those losses were seemingly in the rearview mirror when, in mid-May, rumors of a licensing deal between AMD and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) materialized. No comment from the company and denial from Intel caused those gains to fade though. Moving Forward with Advanced Micro Devices Shares are still down about 19% for the month of May. Despite the decline, Advanced Micro Devices is still up a whopping 184% over the past 12 months. Investors now need to figure out if it’s time to bail on AMD stock or get in on the action. A big part of AMD’s story is execution. Basically, can management deliver? Over the past six quarters, AMD has beaten EPS estimates four times and had in-line results the other two. In that same span, Advanced Micro Devices has beaten revenue estimates five times. Not to get too historical, but AMD didn’t have one beat in either category for the six quarters prior to that period. So, to say management is improving would be an understatement. Analysts expect earnings of 7 cents per share in 2017. It would be a big deal if AMD were to become profitable this year, after four years of losses. Building on that momentum, analysts expect ~330% earnings growth in 2018 to 30 cents per share. This is where management’s execution comes into play. Advanced Micro’s debt picture is another reason for optimism. In June, AMD was carrying $2.24 billion in debt. As of last quarter, that figure stood at just $1.41 billion, a reduction of 37%. Finally, there’s valuation. As AMD works toward profitability, its earnings-based valuation is just okay. But, on a sales-basis, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t too bad. In fact, trading at 2.33x trailing sales is lower than both Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). On a forward sales basis, AMD is also cheaper. Trading AMD Stock AMD gives bullish traders a good opening – albeit, a slight one. Support currently sits at the 200-day moving average, around $10.10. Below that, the stock is pretty iffy. Source: Stockcharts.com That’s good for bulls and bears alike though. Bulls can use this level, or one close to it, as their stop-loss. AMD stock should rally should that level hold, although it could have trouble clearing $12.50. Previously serving as support, this level will now likely act as resistance and give AMD stock limited upside. Make no mistake about it, AMD suffered some big damage when it fell on earnings. But, a run back to $12.50 would represent a 15%-20% return, depending on where investors buy the stock. The Intel-rumor rally gave hope to bullish momentum returning. But, its negative reaction could cause the MACD to turn bearish once more (purple circle). That’s what gives bears some hope. Should the MACD turn bearish – the black line falling below the red line – and the $10 level give way as support, bears will be in control. In that case, there’s no real way to know how much downside could exist. But, one thing would be certain: Bulls would be in trouble. At least in the short-term, then, being long AMD would be painful. In the current case of Advanced Micro Devices, the advantage goes to bulls, for now. But, that will change if AMD stock falls below $10.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Eric Brown May 26, 2017 Thin Client Market Embraces Raspberry Pi rx-hdx_white_background2.png NComputing has unveiled the RX-HDX, its second Raspberry Pi based thin client. Used with permission Is the Raspberry Pi ready to take over the low-end thin client market? This week, NComputing unveiled the RX-HDX, its second Raspberry Pi based thin client. In addition, ViewSonic announced a software upgrade for the Pi-based SC-T25 thin client that it announced last year. The future of thin clients -- low-cost, remotely managed virtual client computers -- has always been a question mark. On one hand, dropping PC prices and increasing use of multimedia in the enterprise has slowed the demand for bare-bones thin clients. Yet, improvements in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology and the ongoing need to cut maintenance, support, and operating costs have kept the market alive. Cheap PCs have may have put the brakes on thin clients in recent years, but a rebound seems likely. The arrival of more affordable and power efficient embedded computers -- and the Raspberry Pi in particular -- is helping to drive down prices and restore thin clients’ edge over standalone PCs. Early last year, Citrix, one of the major virtualization software providers for thin clients, along with VMware and Microsoft, jumpstarted the Pi thin client market by partnering with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Broadcom, ThinLinx, and others to bring its Citrix HDX remote display protocol to the Raspberry Pi. The H264-ready Citrix HDX technology, which is available with Citrix’s XenDesktop virtual desktop and XenApp virtual application software, is an extension of Citrix’s earlier ICA protocol. It adds intelligent redirection, adaptive compression, and data de-duplication to boost performance, especially in multimedia. Citrix HDX is implemented partially via a custom version of a SoC -- in this case the Broadcom BCM43437 -- that enables compute-intensive HDX algorithms to execute on the CPU. Yet, HDX avoids device obsolescence by not “burning the remoting protocol into silicon,” says Citrix. Last year, Citrix announced a Raspberry Pi 3 based Citrix HDX Ready Pi mini-PC reference design with preconfigured HDX support for XenDesktop and XenApp. The device’s Linux-based HDX SoC Receiver SDK enables hardware acceleration on the quad-core Broadcom SoC, as well as off-loading to the VideoCore IV GPU. The device offers device management for firmware updates, remote configuration, and DHCP tagging for plug and play deployment. It can automatically connect to Citrix’s StoreFront enterprise app store like higher-end Citrix clients. The Citrix HDX Ready Pi ships with a version of ThinLinx’s TLXOS. This Raspbian spin-off, which supports VMware Horizon Blast Extreme and Microsoft RDP/RemoteFX protocols as well as Citrix HDX, also provides a virtual client and management stack that can manage both x86 and ARM devices at once. The TLXOS client runs on Intel’s NUCs and Compute Sticks in addition to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3. ViewSonic  SC-T25 and NComputing RX-HDX Last July, ViewSonic released a version of the Citrix HDX Ready Pi as the $89 SC-T25. This week, ViewSonic announced that the SC-T25 now offers the Linux-based NoTouch OS from Stratodesk, another Citrix HDX collaborator. NoTouch OS provides the SC-T25 with new features like Skype for Business support, as well as single sign-on and dual monitor support. Also this week, NComputing unveiled its own $119, Citrix HDX compliant RX-HDX thin client. The product is also based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi technology, but features a different design borrowed from NComputing’s $99, Raspberry Pi 3-based RX300 thin client, announced in March. The RX300 hosts images provided by its own Windows-based vSpace Pro 10 platform, and is aimed more at the educational and small business markets where NComputing is among the leaders. The new RX-HDX, meanwhile, should boost its prospects in the enterprise market. Due to ship in July, NComputing’s RX-HDX features dual monitor support and a sleep mode button. There’s also a Pi Management Console (PMC) and web-based device management for up to 10,000 RX devices. The RX-HDX runs on less than 5W, and offers Raspberry Pi 3 features such as 1GB RAM, WiFi and Bluetooth, and 4x USB ports with full USB redirection. There’s also a Kensington lock, an optional VESA mount, and a sealed, internal 8GB microSD card. Even at the $119 level, the Citrix HDX Ready Pi systems are competitive with DIY solutions. A homegrown thin client system with a $10 TXLOS build and a typical Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit and keyboard and mouse bundle can be had for about $100 without the display. Initially, Citrix listed Micro Center as a Citrix HDX Ready Pi partner, but no longer. The computer retailer still offers a PowerSpec Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit that is billed as a zero thin client with “Citrix Receiver for Linux and a fully licensed ThinLinX TLXOS RPi OS on 8GB microSD.” The system sells for only $50, discounted from $80. Although it appears to be based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi, Micro Center does not promote the connection. Unlike ViewSonic and Micro Center, which are newcomers to thin clients, NComputing was ranked number three in the market at 10.2 percent, according to a March 2016 IDC report. The report also noted that NComputing was one of the fastest growing thin client vendors after fourth place Centerm of China. The 2015 thin client market slumped due to competition from low-cost computers such as Chromebooks. However, IDC projected the market would return to steady growth through 2019 when it expects sales of 6.4 million units, up from 5.1 million in 2015. This week’s reaffirmation by NComputing and ViewSonic of their Raspberry Pi experiments suggests that thin client market leaders Dell and HP, which both saw reduced sales in 2015, might consider similar moves. There are other low-cost, VESA mountable size embedded platforms to build on, but it’s hard to beat the Pi 3 for its platform ecosystem. Its price/performance is pretty darn good, as well. “The Raspberry Pi is renowned for its innovation, portable size, versatility, and economic viability,” said NComputing CTO Richard Sah in an email Q&A. “With each iteration, the affordable computer has established itself as a robust and reliable device, one increasingly become viable within an enterprise setting. NComputing strives to be the market leader in Pi-based thin clients and will continue to innovate on top of the Pi platform.” Aside from small, and high price/performance, the Raspberry Pi also attracted NComputing with its larger developer base. “With a vast community of developers behind Raspberry Pi, we believe the platform will become more and more popular in different vertical markets,” says Sah. Meanwhile several open source community projects are offering alternatives to TXLOS for DIY Pi-based thin clients. The Raspberry Pi Thin Client project, which now supplies a RPiTC v3 1.12 release, supports Citrix Receiver 13.4.2, VMWare Horizon 4.3, NoMachine 5.2.11, and FreeRDP, among other platforms. There’s also WTware, which offers a client for Windows Remote Desktop Services and Windows Terminal Server. The rise of Raspberry Pi based thin clients could boost the role of ARM thin clients in this very x86-centric market. ARM thin clients have been available for years, and like a fair share of x86 thin clients, they run Linux. Options include the i.MX6-based Atrust T66, Allwinner A20-based Share FL120, and NComputing’s own Cortex-A9 based N500.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Zotac’s new mini PC lineup includes AMD Ryzen, Intel Kaby Lake CPUs and NVIDIA graphics 05/26/2017 at 11:21 AM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Zotac is expanding its line of tiny desktop computers with a whole bunch of new ZBOX mini PCs All of the new ZBOX E-series computers support for NVIDIA GeForce 10 series graphics, but you get a choice of CPU options: some models ship with Intel Kaby Lake chips while others are equipped with AMD Ryzen processors. Zotac’s ZBOX M-series of more mainstream mini computers are also getting an update, as is the company’s eve tinier ZBOX P-Series. Folks looking for something a bit more powerful can also opt for Zotac’s brand new MEK Gaming PC, which is much less compact, but still pretty small for a gaming tower. Zotac ZBOX EN1050K More details should be revealed at Computex next week, but here’s a brief run-down of the new systems: E-series (Magnus Gaming Series) ZBOX EN1050K – Compact desktop with Intel Kaby Lake/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 ZBOX EK5106o – Taller model with Intel Kaby Lake Core i5/NVIDIA GeForce 1060 ZBOX EK71070 – Intel Kaby Lake Core i7/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 ZBOX ER51060 – AMD Ryzen/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 ZBOX ER51070 – AMD Ryzen/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 M-series ZBOX MI553 – Intel Kaby Lake model (with Thunderbolt 3) ZBOX MA551 – AMD Ryzen model (without TB3) P-Series The Zotac ZBOX PI225 is a fanless mini computer with support for 4K displays. Zotac calls this a “card-sized PC, although it seems to be a bit larger than a typical playing card or business card. But it does seem to have at least two USB Type-C ports and a microSD card slot. There’s also a new ZBOX PI335 model coming, which is expected to look a lot like older P-series models from the company. MEK Gaming PC This new “gaming first” PC features an Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, GeForce GTX 1080 mini graphics, and a “low-profile” CPU cooler. And that’s about all we know for now. via Zotac, Digital Trends and TechReport Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 6 Comments on "Zotac’s new mini PC lineup includes AMD Ryzen, Intel Kaby Lake CPUs and NVIDIA graphics" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest CampGareth Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

The mini PC with it’s also interesting since as far as I know the Intel Skull Canyon NUC is the only TB3 mini PC and we need more options in that space.

I really dont like the slowness of Atom or the fan noise/fragility of the Core i series which ultimately requires turning them off/on so they dont break.

(AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock AMD stock slightly favors bulls, but a drop below $10 would change that By Bret Kenwell, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 27, 2017, 1:08 pm EDT     Popular Posts: The 7 Best “Comeback” Stocks to Buy for a Huge Second Half 7 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Every Kind of Investor Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock Recent Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock General Electric Company (GE): What to Do With GE Stock at 52-Week Lows 7 Sports Stocks Everyone Knows — 4 Winners, 3 Losers View All Posts Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on a volatile ride this month. AMD stock came into May hot, up 20%. Shares subsequently lost 24% after AMD missed revenue estimates and reported in-line earnings results. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Those losses were seemingly in the rearview mirror when, in mid-May, rumors of a licensing deal between AMD and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) materialized. No comment from the company and denial from Intel caused those gains to fade though. Moving Forward with Advanced Micro Devices Shares are still down about 19% for the month of May. Despite the decline, Advanced Micro Devices is still up a whopping 184% over the past 12 months. Investors now need to figure out if it’s time to bail on AMD stock or get in on the action. A big part of AMD’s story is execution. Basically, can management deliver? Over the past six quarters, AMD has beaten EPS estimates four times and had in-line results the other two. In that same span, Advanced Micro Devices has beaten revenue estimates five times. Not to get too historical, but AMD didn’t have one beat in either category for the six quarters prior to that period. So, to say management is improving would be an understatement. Analysts expect earnings of 7 cents per share in 2017. It would be a big deal if AMD were to become profitable this year, after four years of losses. Building on that momentum, analysts expect ~330% earnings growth in 2018 to 30 cents per share. This is where management’s execution comes into play. Advanced Micro’s debt picture is another reason for optimism. In June, AMD was carrying $2.24 billion in debt. As of last quarter, that figure stood at just $1.41 billion, a reduction of 37%. Finally, there’s valuation. As AMD works toward profitability, its earnings-based valuation is just okay. But, on a sales-basis, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t too bad. In fact, trading at 2.33x trailing sales is lower than both Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). On a forward sales basis, AMD is also cheaper. Trading AMD Stock AMD gives bullish traders a good opening — albeit, a slight one. Support currently sits at the 200-day moving average, around $10.10. Below that, the stock is pretty iffy. Source: Stockcharts.com That’s good for bulls and bears alike though. Bulls can use this level, or one close to it, as their stop-loss. AMD stock should rally should that level hold, although it could have trouble clearing $12.50. Previously serving as support, this level will now likely act as resistance and give AMD stock limited upside. Make no mistake about it, AMD suffered some big damage when it fell on earnings. But, a run back to $12.50 would represent a 15%-20% return, depending on where investors buy the stock. The Intel-rumor rally gave hope to bullish momentum returning. But, its negative reaction could cause the MACD to turn bearish once more (purple circle). That’s what gives bears some hope. Should the MACD turn bearish — the black line falling below the red line — and the $10 level give way as support, bears will be in control. In that case, there’s no real way to know how much downside could exist. But, one thing would be certain: Bulls would be in trouble. At least in the short-term, then, being long AMD would be painful. In the current case of Advanced Micro Devices, the advantage goes to bulls, for now. But, that will change if AMD stock falls below $10.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Will Himax Technologies Stock Rebound on This Potential Design Win? The company missed estimates but gave investors an encouraging signal that business could soon take off. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 27, 2017 at 12:00PM Himax Technologies' (NASDAQ:HIMX) fiscal 2017 first quarter failed to meet Wall Street's revenue and earnings targets, thanks to lower orders from its augmented reality (AR) and smartphone customers. Nevertheless, shares initially jumped more than 12% after the report as the semiconductor and sensor specialist has potentially landed an important design win with a major smartphone customer. Why Himax can land a spot at Apple As it turns out, Himax has received a large order commitment from an unnamed customer for its wafer-level optics (WLO) sensors. Rumors suggest that this could be Apple as the next iPhone is expected to feature 3D sensing technology, so Cupertino could be tapping Himax to supply the 3D scanners. Image source: Himax Technologies.  Back in March, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the next iPhone's front camera will come equipped with AR capabilities and advanced facial recognition. What's more, the front camera is also expected to take 3D selfies and scan 3D objects. Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan believes that Himax could become the supplier of choice for Apple given its progress in WLO technology (via Barron's): Today, Intel's RealSense 3D camera has enabled 3D sensing in PC/tablet platforms. Himax's wafer-level optics (WLO) technology can further reduce the size and fit the 3D sensing in smartphones. Now, Himax has been dropping subtle hints regarding the uptake of its WLO products. Earlier this year, the company pointed out that it will spend between $50 million and $55 million to enhance its WLO and liquid-crystals-on-silicon (LCOS) capacity. More specifically, Himax had pointed out that the "WLO technology is adopted by our customers to enable new things such as 3D depth scanning," so it was already preparing for a production ramp to meet an anticipated jump in demand. Now, a design win at Apple has probably encouraged Himax to boost investment in this area. The semiconductor specialist will spend $80 million to build new WLO capacity this year with a major ramp slated to begin in the third quarter. In fact, Himax believes that it will witness "explosive revenue growth" once this technology goes mainstream, and the company is already collaborating with leading OEMs to achieve this goal. Why a place in the iPhone will be big for Himax Himax Technologies has struggled to increase revenue in recent quarters, while its margin has also been on the decline as some of its AR customers have decided to scrap current-generation products. Data by YCharts. A design win for the next iPhone will bring about a much-needed boost to its financials. Chan believes that 20% of Himax revenue will come from 3D sensing products in 2018. Consensus estimates place revenue growth at 14% in fiscal 2018 versus a 6% decline this year. The turnaround makes sense if Apple ends up manufacturing approximately 100 million units of its next-generation smartphone. That will deliver significant top line gains to Himax, and the adoption of its 3D sensing products will also have a positive effect on the bottom line since they carry higher margins.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build Artificial Intelligence smarts iCrowdNewswire – May 27, 2017 A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co (F.N) invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

With that in mind, we're here to offer you a roundup of some of the latest gear and consumer electronics news that you may have missed. For this edition, we're covering new Huawei MateBook laptops with Dolby Atmos technology, an Acer tablet with a quantum dot display, the launch of Alexa voice control for the DISH Hopper DVR, the arrival of the Starz app on Samsung Smart TVs, and Screen Innovations' ambient light rejecting tech. So, without further ado, here's a rundown of some of the latest gear and tech news: Huawei Announces New MateBook Laptops with Dolby Atmos Sound Systems Huawei has revealed its new series of MateBook Laptops. The products will feature the world's first Dolby Atmos Sound System with custom speakers and software specially designed for a PC form factor. "Dolby Atmos Sound System is enabling a new level of immersive experiences through PC speakers, extending the reach of Dolby Atmos into the portable realm," said Giles Baker, SVP, Consumer Entertainment Group, Dolby Laboratories. "This innovation is made possible through deep collaboration in both hardware and software engineering, and we are thrilled to partner with Huawei on its new feature-rich set of laptops." The MateBook Dolby Atmos Sound Systems were developed in partnership with Dolby and offer boosted bass, enhanced volume without distortion on speakers and headphones, and a larger range of frequencies. The flagship Huawei MateBook X model will include two motors in each speaker, placed in an upward-firing configuration to direct sound at the listener in a clear and natural way. And beyond Atmos audio, the MateBook X features a 13-inch 2K display, a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. In addition, the Huawei MateBook D will also feature a Dolby Atmos Sound System.  "We are very excited to continue our track record of bringing to market high-end consumer devices with the latest technologies," said Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group. "And what better way to showcase our innovation than working with Dolby, the innovator in sound and imaging technology, to bring the best possible audio experience to our customers." Pricing has not been announced for the new Huawei MateBook laptops with Dolby Atmos, but the MateBook X is expected to hit the market this summer. Sources: Dolby, Engadget Acer Details Iconia Tab 10 Tablet with Quantum Dot Display Acer has announced the latest addition to its tablet lineup. The new Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) has been designed with premium multimedia experiences in mind, and includes quantum dot display technology. The device is powered by quad-core MediaTek processor running Android 7.0 Nougat, and is rated for up to 8 hours of battery life. An Acer-patented subwoofer and four speakers with DTS-HD Premium Sound are integrated as well, along with 802.11ac wireless support. In addition, the 10-inch IPS display features wide-viewing-angles and quantum dot technology. Quantum dot tech places nano-crystals on a film over an LCD display's backlight. The nano-crystals then emit different colors when exposed to light depending on their size, offering a wider color range with higher brightness, deeper saturation, and better accuracy. Pricing and availability for the Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) has not been announced yet. Source: Acer DISH Launches Alexa Support for Hopper DVR & Brings DISH Anywhere App to Amazon Fire TV DISH has announced the arrival of Amazon Alexa compatibility for its Hopper 3 and Wally set-top boxes. With Alexa support, users can now control their set-top boxes with voice commands through a paired Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap. "Hopper and Alexa introduce next-level convenience that redefines the way TV fits into our lives," said Niraj Desai, DISH vice president of product management. "Instantly, it's easier to read player stats on your phone while flipping between basketball games; to chop ingredients in the kitchen while rewinding a TV scene you just missed; to snack on popcorn while searching for your favorite film – the list goes on." Broadband-connected Hopper DVRs (all generations) or Wally set-top boxes can now pair directly with an Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap, adding hands-free Alexa voice control support for navigation, play, pause, fast-forward, rewind, and searches based on channel, title, actor or genre. In addition, universal search functionality works across DISH's live, recorded, and on-demand titles as well as Netflix's library of TV shows and movies. For instance, a customer could simply say "Alexa, tune to AMC" or " Alexa, find Matt Damon movies" to change channels or search for films. Meanwhile, DISH has also announced the launch of its DISH Anywhere app on the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick. The app lets Hopper customers watch all of their live and recorded content, along with thousands of DISH on-demand titles, from any location on Internet-connected mobile devices, computers, and now through Fire TV devices. "While DISH Anywhere has historically been embraced on mobile devices, users are now getting even more of what they want – their DISH subscription on any TV at no extra cost," said Niraj Desai, DISH vice president of product management. "DISH Anywhere on Fire TV is an excellent value that further brings choice and flexibility to our customers' television experience."

(Photo: Angelo Carconi, epa) 3886 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 192 COMMENTEMAILMORE TAORMINA, Italy — Wrapping up his first foreign trip as commander-in-chief, President Trump left the G-7 summit Saturday amid ongoing international deadlocks over trade, climate change and the fate of a global treaty on restricting heat-trapping carbon emissions. While the American president and G-7 allies agreed to increase efforts to fight terrorism, Trump, his aides and other world leaders acknowledged ongoing disputes over trade rules and whether the United States should remain part of the Paris climate change agreement. Climate talks in particular were "very unsatisfactory," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. Trump, who received conflicting advice on climate change from aides, tweeted after the G-7 meetings that "I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!" The precise date is uncertain, and he has delayed previous plans to make that announcement. I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2017 Speaking later to U.S. military personnel before heading back to Washington, Trump said many countries have "a large number of disagreements" with the U.S., but he believes he hit "a home run" during his trip. "We made a lot of good friends this week," Trump said. His voyage began in the Middle East, continued to the Vatican for a meeting with Pope Francis, led to NATO headquarters in Brussels and wound up on the Sicilian coast for the Group of Seven industrial nations summit. Trump took to Twitter to say that "lots of very important matters" were discussed at the G-7, but "first on the list, of course, is terrorism." He also cited pledges by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to "step up payments considerably, as they should," on their defense budgets. While some analysts criticized Trump for not endorsing the alliance's mutual defense pledge, the president tweeted that "money is beginning to pour in - NATO will be much stronger." Big G7 meetings today. Lots of very important matters under discussion. First on the list, of course, is terrorism. #G7Taormina— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2017 Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably, as they should. Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2017 In addition to protesting Trump's views on climate change, Germany and other G-7 members pushed back on Trump's claims that other countries engage in unfair trade practices against the United States. The back-and-forth ended what European Union President Donald Tusk called "the most challenging G-7 summit in years."

Trump and his aides have denied collusion and described the investigations as "witch hunts." Read more: Kushner, Russians discussed secret communication link, reports say Jared Kushner under FBI scrutiny in Russia investigation While other leaders held traditional post-G-7 news conferences Saturday, Trump did not. Instead, he spoke to U.S. military personnel at the nearby Naval Air Station Sigonella, from which Air Force One departed. The president and first lady arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Saturday night and returned to the White House aboard Marine One, landing on the South Lawn at 9:22 p.m. The president waved as he entered the residence but made no comment. Trump focused on terrorism, NATO Recounting his trip, Trump stressed the need to win the fight against terrorism. Citing this week's attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt, Trump said the U.S. is resolved to defeat terrorism, which he called "a bad threat to all humanity." In the Middle East, a more conciliatory Trump praised prospects for new peace talks and urged Muslim leaders to help defeat terrorism; during a more combative visit to Brussels, Trump demanded changes to the U.S. financial relationship with NATO. Both visits drew some criticisms. During the president's sojourn through Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, analyst Aaron David Miller — a Middle East negotiator in both Republican and Democratic administrations — said his head "was spinning" over Trump's hopes for a peace deal. "Never has a US President expressed so much confidence in a conflict-ending peace agreement w/so little prospect of success," tweeted Miller, vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Head spinning: Never has a US President expressed so much confidence in a conflict-ending peace agreement w/so little prospect of success— Aaron David Miller (@aarondmiller2) May 23, 2017 In Brussels, Trump surprised NATO leaders by avoiding an explicit endorsement of "Article 5," the mutual defense provision of the NATO charter that requires members to regard an attack on one member as an attack on all. "The President chose instead to alienate our European and Canadian allies by publicly berating them over their defense spending," said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council official and now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "He's just made it an awful lot easier for allies to refuse anything he ever needs from them." Read more: Trump's NATO mystery: How much does he support it? At NATO, Trump does not pledge U.S. commitment to collective defense Aides said Trump fully supports NATO, noting that he spoke at a memorial dedicated to invocation of Article 5 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. "It's clear that the president is committed to Article 5 and the alliance," National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said. "That's why he was there for the leaders' meeting." During his speech in Brussels, Trump also demanded NATO members increase defense spending, arguing that the United States is carrying too much of the financial burden. He echoed those comments to the troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella, saying "other nations must pay more" for common defense. "We're behind NATO all the way," the president said, "but we want to be treated fairly." Despite Trump's suggestions to the contrary, NATO countries do not owe money to the United States; alliance members have agreed to increase their own defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product, and say they are making progress toward that goal. Trip ends without final decision on Paris Accord At the G-7, held at a hilly seaside village, the issues of terrorism, trade and climate change dominated meetings mostly closed to the press. European officials have long sought to pressure Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. During their meeting at the Vatican, Pope Francis gave Trump a book he wrote on climate change. In backing the pact reached in Paris in 2015, supporters say countries should be required to reduce carbon emissions as to way to mitigate the threats of global warming.

Trump and allies size each other up While some Trump aides want the U.S. to stay in the Paris framework, other officials say new regulations will hurt the American energy industry, thereby reducing economic growth. The G-7 was unable to come to a consensus on the topic. The annual G-7 communique — shorter than usual at only six pages — said that nearly all the members agree on climate change, with one exception: "The United States of America is in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics." Gary Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, said Trump's views on climate change are "evolving" and that he came to the G-7 "to learn and get smarter" ahead of his decision on the Paris deal. "His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States," he said.

Other countries said they are following mutually agreed upon rules. Merkel pointed out that her country couldn't re-negotiate rules with the United States if it wanted to, as Germany is a member of the European Union. "We have a currency union," Merkel told reporters. "We are practically a common market. To pick out one country is, I think, not so appropriate." Awkward moments along the way Aides said Trump advanced his agenda and made new connections with world leaders during the trip, though it also had its share of awkward moments. There was a long and seemingly competitive handshake between Trump and new French President Emmanuel Macron. There was Trump pushing aside the prime minister of Montenegro to get to the front of a NATO family photo. British Prime Minister Theresa May got on Trump over U.S. intelligence leaks, while Merkel pushed back against Trump complaints about car trading policy.

During the G-7, observers accused Trump of not using headphones to hear the translations of comments by speakers from other countries. Spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump used a different method, tweeting: "As usual @POTUS wears a single ear piece for translation in his right ear."

(Photo: Angelo Carconi, epa) 3886 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 192 COMMENTEMAILMORE TAORMINA, Italy — Wrapping up his first foreign trip as commander-in-chief, President Trump left the G-7 summit Saturday amid ongoing international deadlocks over trade, climate change and the fate of a global treaty on restricting heat-trapping carbon emissions. While the American president and G-7 allies agreed to increase efforts to fight terrorism, Trump, his aides and other world leaders acknowledged ongoing disputes over trade rules and whether the United States should remain part of the Paris climate change agreement. Climate talks in particular were "very unsatisfactory," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. Trump, who received conflicting advice on climate change from aides, tweeted after the G-7 meetings that "I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!" The precise date is uncertain, and he has delayed previous plans to make that announcement. I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2017 Speaking later to U.S. military personnel before heading back to Washington, Trump said many countries have "a large number of disagreements" with the U.S., but he believes he hit "a home run" during his trip. "We made a lot of good friends this week," Trump said. His voyage began in the Middle East, continued to the Vatican for a meeting with Pope Francis, led to NATO headquarters in Brussels and wound up on the Sicilian coast for the Group of Seven industrial nations summit. Trump took to Twitter to say that "lots of very important matters" were discussed at the G-7, but "first on the list, of course, is terrorism." He also cited pledges by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to "step up payments considerably, as they should," on their defense budgets. While some analysts criticized Trump for not endorsing the alliance's mutual defense pledge, the president tweeted that "money is beginning to pour in - NATO will be much stronger." Big G7 meetings today. Lots of very important matters under discussion. First on the list, of course, is terrorism. #G7Taormina— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2017 Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably, as they should. Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2017 In addition to protesting Trump's views on climate change, Germany and other G-7 members pushed back on Trump's claims that other countries engage in unfair trade practices against the United States. The back-and-forth ended what European Union President Donald Tusk called "the most challenging G-7 summit in years."

Trump and his aides have denied collusion and described the investigations as "witch hunts." Read more: Kushner, Russians discussed secret communication link, reports say Jared Kushner under FBI scrutiny in Russia investigation While other leaders held traditional post-G-7 news conferences Saturday, Trump did not. Instead, he spoke to U.S. military personnel at the nearby Naval Air Station Sigonella, from which Air Force One departed. The president and first lady arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Saturday night and returned to the White House aboard Marine One, landing on the South Lawn at 9:22 p.m. The president waved as he entered the residence but made no comment. Trump focused on terrorism, NATO Recounting his trip, Trump stressed the need to win the fight against terrorism. Citing this week's attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt, Trump said the U.S. is resolved to defeat terrorism, which he called "a bad threat to all humanity." In the Middle East, a more conciliatory Trump praised prospects for new peace talks and urged Muslim leaders to help defeat terrorism; during a more combative visit to Brussels, Trump demanded changes to the U.S. financial relationship with NATO. Both visits drew some criticisms. During the president's sojourn through Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, analyst Aaron David Miller — a Middle East negotiator in both Republican and Democratic administrations — said his head "was spinning" over Trump's hopes for a peace deal. "Never has a US President expressed so much confidence in a conflict-ending peace agreement w/so little prospect of success," tweeted Miller, vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Head spinning: Never has a US President expressed so much confidence in a conflict-ending peace agreement w/so little prospect of success— Aaron David Miller (@aarondmiller2) May 23, 2017 In Brussels, Trump surprised NATO leaders by avoiding an explicit endorsement of "Article 5," the mutual defense provision of the NATO charter that requires members to regard an attack on one member as an attack on all. "The President chose instead to alienate our European and Canadian allies by publicly berating them over their defense spending," said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council official and now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "He's just made it an awful lot easier for allies to refuse anything he ever needs from them." Read more: Trump's NATO mystery: How much does he support it? At NATO, Trump does not pledge U.S. commitment to collective defense Aides said Trump fully supports NATO, noting that he spoke at a memorial dedicated to invocation of Article 5 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. "It's clear that the president is committed to Article 5 and the alliance," National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said. "That's why he was there for the leaders' meeting." During his speech in Brussels, Trump also demanded NATO members increase defense spending, arguing that the United States is carrying too much of the financial burden. He echoed those comments to the troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella, saying "other nations must pay more" for common defense. "We're behind NATO all the way," the president said, "but we want to be treated fairly." Despite Trump's suggestions to the contrary, NATO countries do not owe money to the United States; alliance members have agreed to increase their own defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product, and say they are making progress toward that goal. Trip ends without final decision on Paris Accord At the G-7, held at a hilly seaside village, the issues of terrorism, trade and climate change dominated meetings mostly closed to the press. European officials have long sought to pressure Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. During their meeting at the Vatican, Pope Francis gave Trump a book he wrote on climate change. In backing the pact reached in Paris in 2015, supporters say countries should be required to reduce carbon emissions as to way to mitigate the threats of global warming.

Trump and allies size each other up While some Trump aides want the U.S. to stay in the Paris framework, other officials say new regulations will hurt the American energy industry, thereby reducing economic growth. The G-7 was unable to come to a consensus on the topic. The annual G-7 communique — shorter than usual at only six pages — said that nearly all the members agree on climate change, with one exception: "The United States of America is in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics." Gary Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, said Trump's views on climate change are "evolving" and that he came to the G-7 "to learn and get smarter" ahead of his decision on the Paris deal. "His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States," he said.

Other countries said they are following mutually agreed upon rules. Merkel pointed out that her country couldn't re-negotiate rules with the United States if it wanted to, as Germany is a member of the European Union. "We have a currency union," Merkel told reporters. "We are practically a common market. To pick out one country is, I think, not so appropriate." Awkward moments along the way Aides said Trump advanced his agenda and made new connections with world leaders during the trip, though it also had its share of awkward moments. There was a long and seemingly competitive handshake between Trump and new French President Emmanuel Macron. There was Trump pushing aside the prime minister of Montenegro to get to the front of a NATO family photo. British Prime Minister Theresa May got on Trump over U.S. intelligence leaks, while Merkel pushed back against Trump complaints about car trading policy.

During the G-7, observers accused Trump of not using headphones to hear the translations of comments by speakers from other countries. Spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump used a different method, tweeting: "As usual @POTUS wears a single ear piece for translation in his right ear."

Ramos CALIFORNIA. Rubeliene Chezka Gloria, Myrelle Angela Colas and Nadine Antonette Obafial from Davao City National High School won the second grand award of US$1,5000 in the plant sciences from the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair held in Los Angeles, California on May 14-19, 2017. THEY proved that the acacia bark extract is an effective organic insecticide against the adult black rice bug. For this outstanding science investigatory project, Rubeliene Chezka Gloria, Myrelle Angela Colas and Nadine Antonette Obafial of the Davao City National High School brought home the second grand award of US$1,5000 in the plant sciences from the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) held in Los Angeles, California on May 14 to 19, 2017. The trio will be in Grade 10 when schools open in June. They will have the next three years until they graduate from senior high school to hone their research skills with new projects that can be of great benefit to the country. They brought honor and pride to their school and country, and they also earned a place in the galaxy. Their names will be given to three asteroids discovered by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Near Earth Asteroid Research Program (LINEAR). The Fernandez, Colas and Obafial asteroids will join the main-belt asteroids previously named after Filipinos under that program: 28439 Miguel Reyes, 11697 Estrella, 12088 Macalintal, 12522 Rara and 13241 Biyo. The first was named after Miguel Arnold Reyes, a grand awardee for his materials and bioengineering project in the 2011 ISEF. The other three were those of awardees in the 2002 ISEF: Allan Noriel Estrella and Jeric Valles Macalintal for their physics team project, Prem Vilas Rara for his microbiology study, and Dr. Josette Biyo for excellence in teaching. The Davao team was part of this year’s ISEF Team Philippines, which included Ricky Dave Mercado of Nabuslot National High School, Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro and Maries Ann Silvestre of Juan R. Liwag Memorial High School, Gapan, Nueva Ecija. ISEF Team Philippines was consolidated from among the top winners in the life and physical sciences competition in the National Science and Technology Fair of the Department of Education held in Tagaytay City in December 2016. The Davao girls extracted their potential insecticide from chipped-off acacia bark. They set up experimental houses with rice plants and black rice bugs. They tested varying concentrations of acacia extract on the bugs for one week to determine which is more effective in killing them. Their coach is Julius Centina. Mercado examined the morphology of agricultural wastes—coconut husk, banana pseudo-stem and sugarcane husk—and he found that coconut husk fibers, which have more diverse microporous cells, have better noise and hear reduction properties. He competed in the environmental engineering category. Silvestre investigated the neuro-protective potential of coconut leaf extract using a transgenic worm in a search of a cure for Alzheimer’s Disease and Inclusion Body Myositis. The study competed in biochemistry. The Department of Education is looking at the victory of the young scientists from Davao National High School as an inspiration for the students who will pursue their science research plans as soon as the schools open in June. This year, around 1,800 finalists from 78 countries, regions and territories were in the ISEF in Los Angeles to vie for grand prizes in twenty categories. From the best of each category, the three ‘bests of the best’ went home with the Dudley E. Moore award of $75,000 and the two runners-up, Intel Foundation Young Scientist awardees, winning $50,000 each. Top winner Ivo Zell from Germany got the Moore award for his design of a small flying wing based on a bell-shaped lift distribution. Runner-ups Amber Young from Florida worked on a technique to predict the orbits of space junk circling the earth, and Valerio Pagliarino from Italy addressed how to get internet service to remote areas by using lasers to transmit signals between large high-voltage power transmission towers.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Much to Sean Hannity’s dismay, Fox News issued a long-awaited retraction on Tuesday of a story involving slain Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich pushed heavily by the host. Naturally, Hannity hit back via Twitter, slamming liberal watchdog Media Matters for America for trying to get him fired. IMPORTANT! Mediamatters is trying to silence me, get me fired, pressure my advertising on radio & TV. Liberal Fascism. I need your help!! — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017 “In case you haven’t been following it, the Seth Rich conspiracy holds that before his death (or, in this version of events, assassination) in July Mr. Rich had been involved in the leaking of Clinton campaign emails to WikiLeaks, which the United States intelligence community has attributed to Russian-sponsored hackers,” The New York Times summed up on Wednesday, just before Hannity lost his first advertiser amid fallout. But Media Matters and others have been debunking Hannity’s fake news for years. Here are 5 of his more baseless theories: 1. CIA framed Russia for hacking the DNC Fox News reported on Russia’s hacking the DNC as well as the January 6 Intel report. Yet, less than 48 hours after a Wikileaks dump of the Vault 7 documents (March 7), Hannity began citing Breitbart’s reporting of the scoop: “WikiLeaks: CIA Uses ‘Stolen’ Malware To ‘Attribute’ Cyberattacks To Nations Like Russia.” The Fox News host was joined on his show by retired 9/11-truther and torture proponent Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaffer. “Sean, we did it. Not me, but our guys, former members of NSA, retired intelligence officers used these tools to break in there and get the information out. That’s what the Democrats don’t want to talk about because it doesn’t fit their narrative,” Shaffer said. “You’re telling me this whole Russian story that the media has been running with for months and months and months — that it was our people that did it, and they put the fingerprints of the Russians on it?” Hannity asked. “That’s right,” Shaffer said, although he then admitted on-air he had no proof. 2. Hillary’s Health As Media Matters noted, Hannity perpetuated the rumor of  Hillary Clinton failing heath weeks after it was debunked. 3. Benghazi  “During the attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times, and we needed, you know, permission from the Libyans to actually save Americans, and that’s what they were discussing,” Hannity said, shortly after the GOP’s report on the 2012 attack, was released on June 28, 2016. Politifact rated Hannity’s comment mostly false. 4. Obamacare “Average Americans are feeling the pain of Obamacare and the healthcare overhaul train wreck,” Hannity announced in an  October 2013 episode. “and six of them are here tonight to tell us their stories.” One week later, Salon reporter Eric Stern had tracked down all six guests, proving their Obamacare misnomers were easily debunked. 5. Voter Fraud Hannity continues to cite Philadelphia’s overwhelming preference for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012 as proof of voter fraud. “In 59 separate precincts in inner city Philadelphia, Mitt Romney did not get a single vote! Not one!” he reiterated last August, nearly four years later. “Maybe I’m being conspiratorial,” he added. to which CNN’s Brian Stelter. answered, “Yes, Hannity, you are.” Essay: Trump is sowing doubt about the legitimacy of the election. It’s dangerous. Press has a duty to challenge him https://t.co/V6CCyZIfdF — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 7, 2016 Additionally, Fact.check.org has considered this an open-shut case as of January 2013. “It’s not mathematically impossible,” Lori Robertson wrote. “The 59 districts are in areas of the city that are mainly African American, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. And Obama received 93 percent of the black vote nationwide.” Report typos and corrections to [email protected] About the Author Next on Raw Story > Jared Kushner’s connections to Russia may damage Trump By commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

I preordered the surface pro 5 and am excited to use it for streaming PS4 and some good old rimworld but these add some additional possibilities to the mix! Thanks Alec!

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list. Rocket League and League of Legends. I am surprised at some of these picks, like Prey and Elder Scroll Online, I thought you need an amazing PC to run these.

I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS.

It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

That was some exciting news to me. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:58 Barts says: I played these on my Dell Latitude E7250 and I highly recommend them: Darkest Dungeon Sunless Sea Invisible Inc.

How did that old quote go? “640×480 ought to be enough pixels for anybody.” Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:25 Chaoslord AJ says: Prey is the only entry that surprised me. Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

By: IANS | Moscow | Updated: May 27, 2017 1:29 pm The company recommended to use robust security solutions and make sure they keep all software up to date and regularly run a system scan to check for possible infection. (Source: AP) As global ransomware attacks show no signs of slowing down, the volume of mobile ransomware has grown over three-fold during the first quarter of the year, a cyber security firm said on Friday. According to Moscow-based cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab, the number of mobile ransomware files detected reached 2,18,625 during the first quarter, compared to 61,832 in the previous quarter. The growth of ransomware attacks on all devices grew with 11 new cryptor families and 55,679 new modifications making their appearance in the first quarter. Also Read:  Top US Intel chiefs express doubts over Kaspersky Security “Ransomware targeting mobile devices soared in first quarter, with new ransomware families and modifications continuing to proliferate. People need to bear in mind that attackers can try to block access to their data not only on a PC but also on their mobile device,” said Roman Unuchek, Senior Malware Analyst at Kaspersky Lab. “Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Fusob.h” remained the most widely used mobile ransomware, accounting for nearly 45 per cent of all users attacked by this threat. “Once run, the Trojan requests administrator privileges, collects information about the device, including GPS coordinates and call history, and uploads the data to a malicious server. Based on what it receives, the server may send back a command to block the device,” the company explained. According to Kaspersky Lab, it detected and repelled 480 million malicious attacks from online resources located in 190 countries all over the world and 80 million unique URLs were recognised as malicious by web antivirus components. Also Read:  Kaspersky lab identifies mysterious ‘Hajime’ malware affecting IOT devices globally “Attempted infections by malware that aims to steal money via online access to bank accounts were registered on 288,000 user computers,” the company said. Kaspersky Lab mobile security products also detected 13,33,605 malicious installation packages and 32,038 mobile banking Trojans. The company recommended to use robust security solutions and make sure they keep all software up to date and regularly run a system scan to check for possible infection. “Stay wise while online. Do not enter personal information into a website if you are at all unsure or suspicious. Back up valuable information,” the cyber security firm suggested.

PHOTO: AFP A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. The next revolution: artificial intelligence Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Toyota to use Nvidia’s AI technology for self-driving cars Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

Is the Raspberry Pi ready to take over the low-end thin client market? This week, NComputing unveiled the RX-HDX, its second Raspberry Pi based thin client. In addition, ViewSonic announced a software upgrade for the Pi-based SC-T25 thin client that it announced last year. The future of thin clients — low-cost, remotely managed virtual client computers — has always been a question mark. On one hand, dropping PC prices and increasing use of multimedia in the enterprise has slowed the demand for bare-bones thin clients. Yet, improvements in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology and the ongoing need to cut maintenance, support, and operating costs have kept the market alive. NComputing’s RX-HDX (left) and Citrix HDX Ready Pi (click images to enlarge) Cheap PCs have may have put the brakes on thin clients in recent years, but a rebound seems likely. The arrival of more affordable and power efficient embedded computers — and the Raspberry Pi in particular — is helping to drive down prices and restore thin clients’ edge over standalone PCs. Early last year, Citrix, one of the major virtualization software providers for thin clients, along with VMware and Microsoft, jumpstarted the Pi thin client market by partnering with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Broadcom, ThinLinx, and others to bring its Citrix HDX remote display protocol to the Raspberry Pi. The H264-ready Citrix HDX technology, which is available with Citrix’s XenDesktop virtual desktop and XenApp virtual application software, is an extension of Citrix’s earlier ICA protocol. It adds intelligent redirection, adaptive compression, and data de-duplication to boost performance, especially in multimedia. Citrix HDX is implemented partially via a custom version of a SoC — in this case the Broadcom BCM43437 — that enables compute-intensive HDX algorithms to execute on the CPU. Yet, HDX avoids device obsolescence by not “burning the remoting protocol into silicon,” says Citrix. Last year, Citrix announced a Raspberry Pi 3 based Citrix HDX Ready Pi mini-PC reference design with preconfigured HDX support for XenDesktop and XenApp. The device’s Linux-based HDX SoC Receiver SDK enables hardware acceleration on the quad-core Broadcom SoC, as well as off-loading to the VideoCore IV GPU. The device offers device management for firmware updates, remote configuration, and DHCP tagging for plug and play deployment. It can automatically connect to Citrix’s StoreFront enterprise app store like higher-end Citrix clients. The Citrix HDX Ready Pi ships with a version of ThinLinx’s TLXOS. This Raspbian spin-off, which supports VMware Horizon Blast Extreme and Microsoft RDP/RemoteFX protocols as well as Citrix HDX, also provides a virtual client and management stack that can manage both x86 and ARM devices at once. The TLXOS client runs on Intel’s NUCs and Compute Sticks in addition to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3.   ViewSonic SC-T25 and NComputing RX-HDX Last July, ViewSonic released a version of the Citrix HDX Ready Pi as the $89 SC-T25. This week, ViewSonic announced that the SC-T25 now offers the Linux-based NoTouch OS from Stratodesk, another Citrix HDX collaborator. NoTouch OS provides the SC-T25 with new features like Skype for Business support, as well as single sign-on and dual monitor support. ViewSonic SC-T25, front and back (click images to enlarge) Also this week, NComputing unveiled its own $119, Citrix HDX compliant RX-HDX thin client. The product is also based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi technology, but features a different design borrowed from NComputing’s $99, Raspberry Pi 3-based RX300 thin client, announced in March. The RX300 hosts images provided by its own Windows-based vSpace Pro 10 platform, and is aimed more at the educational and small business markets where NComputing is among the leaders. The new RX-HDX, meanwhile, should boost its prospects in the enterprise market. Due to ship in July, NComputing’s RX-HDX features dual monitor support and a sleep mode button. There’s also a Pi Management Console (PMC) and web-based device management for up to 10,000 RX devices. The RX-HDX runs on less than 5W, and offers Raspberry Pi 3 features such as 1GB RAM, WiFi and Bluetooth, and 4x USB ports with full USB redirection. There’s also a Kensington lock, an optional VESA mount, and a sealed, internal 8GB microSD card. NComputing RX300 alone (left) and with monitor, mouse and keyboard (click images to enlarge) Even at the $119 level, the Citrix HDX Ready Pi systems are competitive with DIY solutions. A homegrown thin client system with a $10 TXLOS build and a typical Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit and keyboard and mouse bundle can be had for about $100 without the display. Initially, Citrix listed Micro Center as a Citrix HDX Ready Pi partner, but no longer. The computer retailer still offers a PowerSpec Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit that is billed as a zero thin client with “Citrix Receiver for Linux and a fully licensed ThinLinX TLXOS RPi OS on 8GB microSD.” The system sells with for only $50, discounted from $80. Although it appears to be based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi, Micro Center does not promote the connection. Unlike ViewSonic and Micro Center, which are newcomers to thin clients, NComputing was ranked number three in the market at 10.2 percent, according to a Mar. 2016 IDC report. The report also noted that NComputing was onee of the fastest growing thin client vendors after fourth place Centerm of China. The 2015 thin client market slumped due to competition from low-cost computers such as Chromebooks. However, IDC projected the market would return to steady growth through 2019 when it expects sales of 6.4 million units, up from 5.1 million in 2015. This week’s reaffirmation by NComputing and ViewSonic of their Raspberry Pi experiments suggests that thin client market leaders Dell and HP, which both saw reduced sales in 2015, might consider similar moves. There are other low-cost, VESA mountable size embedded platforms to build on, but it’s hard to beat the Pi 3 for its platform ecosystem. Its price/performance is pretty darn good, as well. Raspberry Pi 3 “The Raspberry Pi is renowned for its innovation, portable size, versatility, and economic viability,” said NComputing CTO Richard Sah in an email Q&A. “With each iteration, the affordable computer has established itself as a robust and reliable device, one increasingly become viable within an enterprise setting. NComputing strives to be the market leader in Pi-based thin clients and will continue to innovate on top of the Pi platform.” Aside from small, and high price/performance, the Raspberry Pi also attracted NComputing with its larger developer base. “With a vast community of developers behind Raspberry Pi, we believe the platform will become more and more popular in different vertical markets,” said Sah. Meanwhile several open source community projects are offering alternatives to TXLOS for DIY Pi-based thin clients. The Raspberry Pi Thin Client project, which now supplies a RPiTC v3 1.12 release, supports Citrix Receiver 13.4.2, VMWare Horizon 4.3, NoMachine 5.2.11, and FreeRDP, among other platforms. There’s also WTware, which offers a client for Windows Remote Desktop Services and Windows Terminal Server. The rise of Raspberry Pi based thin clients could boost the role of ARM thin clients in this very x86-centric market. ARM thin clients have been available for years, and like a fair share of x86 thin clients, they run Linux. Options include the i.MX6-based Atrust T66, Allwinner A20-based Share FL120, and NComputing’s own Cortex-A9 based N500. This article is copyright © 2017 Linux.com and was originally published here.

As Information Age points out, Enhancing E-commerce, calculating valuations, inventory management and of course enabling driverless cars are among the many uses of artificial intelligence. With this in mind, which tech stocks should investors buy to cash in on this trend? Source: ©iStock.com/carloscastilla Although Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now appears to be the prime beneficiary of the machine learning aspect of artificial intelligence, Nvidia stock has soared over 200% in the last year and likely already reflects a great deal of revenue from AI. Consequently, investors should wait for a better entry point before buying Nvidia stock. But four other tech stocks Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Delphi Automotive PLC (NYSE:DLPH),  Visteon Corp (NYSE:VC), and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) — are definitely poised to get a meaningful boost from AI and should be bought at current levels. The first three companies have significant exposure to technology that enables self-driving cars. That technology is not only poised to proliferate in cars, but could very well potentially spread to other mobile systems, i.e., drones and robots. Obviously, both drones and robots could be used to carry out a plethora of highly useful functions. As a result, companies that provide the technology that enables autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile systems should do quite well over the longer-term. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year Additionally, Intel has a number of products and upcoming products that should generate strong, needle-moving revenue for the company as AI becomes more widespread. Baidu has spent a great deal of money on AI. Moreover, the company should benefit from the superior data it has on Chinese consumers and from the tremendous size and growth of the Chinese market.

Given that history, it only seemed natural for me to take on the task of helping you, our faithful reader, learn how to create your own Hackintosh. I’m currently in the process of doing just that with an HP Z2 G3 Mini, but more on that later. For now, here are the five best motherboards to choose from if you want to start creating a Hackintosh. Any good Hackintosh has to start with a great motherboard, such as this Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1 A Few Preliminary Notes First, why is creating a Hackintosh worthy of detailed hardware discussions? The main reason is that Cupertino does a reasonably good job of trying to ensure its operating system only runs on Apple hardware. I say “reasonably good job” because there are ways around the constraints built into OS X and macOS. Second, you will need to understand that this is a moving target. As Apple releases new hardware, it adds support for certain devices, while taking away support for older hardware. Because of this, I give you this list with an important caveat: it’s prone to change over the years. This list consists of the most compatible motherboards as of May 2017. It’s also worth noting that some of these motherboards won’t support resolutions higher than 1080p at 60hz. Intel, AMD, and nVidia graphics resolutions higher than that will require a DisplayPort connection, but nVidia 9XX cards with HDMI or DisplayPort will support displays to 4K resolution at 60hz. On to the List of Motherboards Good for Creating a Hackintosh These motherboards are all considered to be easily adaptable to running macOS Sierra. That means the built-in chipsets work, with some modification or custom drivers, under macOS Sierra. While I have my own preferences as far as form factor, I’ve tried to make this list inclusive of many different motherboard and case sizes. ATX Form Factor Motherboards Gigabyte’s GA-Z170XP-SLI motherboard is a great choice for the ATX form factor If you opt for an ATX form factor, such as in a medium- to large-sized tower or desktop case, your best option is the Gigabyte GA-Z170XP-SLI motherboard. It boasts an LGA1151 CPU socket, and supports sixth generation Intel Core processors. This motherboard has plenty of PCI-Express expansion slots for building a monster of a Hackintosh. It has built-in gigabyte Ethernet supported by macOS, along with an excellent on-board audio chipset that also works wonderfully in Sierra. The only drawback to this motherboard is that the onboard graphics only supports HDMI, but we will be providing you with a list of much better graphics cards in an upcoming article. The Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1 is another fantastic ATX motherboard for creating a Hackintosh Another excellent choice for an ATX motherboard is the Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1. This mobo has an LGA1151 CPU socket with support for sixth-generation Intel Core processors, and is ready for USB-C, M.2 SATA and SSD drives, and more than enough RAM to keep your Hackintosh running smoothly. It’s expandable, has integrated Intel HD graphics with HDMI and DisplayPort ports, and has gigabit Ethernet support. The Realtek ALC1150 audio chipset supports up to 7.1-channel surround sound, and the system board has plenty of USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, and USB-C ports. Everything is macOS Sierra-friendly.

You covered all of the main pain points about making MacOS work on other than Apple hardware. The Network, WiFi, and Sound hardware are the biggest headaches in choosing a motherboard. I would love it if you expanded the information into a table showing what hardware drivers to use for each, and if the built in WiFi / Bluetooth on these boards work. When I did my last two Hacks, that was the most interesting part to get working. Love the series so far and want to see where you go with video cards. –Rick– May 26, 2017 at 4:09 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 26, 2017 Thanks, Rick! I’ll definitely consider that kind of a table 🙂 I agree, after graphics, Wi-FI and Bluetooth are the biggest challenges. Very little support out there, especially if you want to use an M.2 card for your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. May 26, 2017 at 4:12 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Fantastic article Jeff. Have you come across any motherboards that support Xeons? May 26, 2017 at 4:18 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 With regard to the wifi/Bluetooth, I bet you can buy the part from eBay straight from an iMac. I bought such a part and upgraded my 5,1 cheese grater Mac Pro to the latest Bluetooth and 802.11ac May 26, 2017 at 4:22 EDT PM Rick Allen May 26, 2017 @John – Yes, I did end up buying the Mini PCI/E cards off of eBay that had the proper Broadcom chipsets. In my Mac Pro 5.1 I have TP-Link AC Wifi card. Also working on flashing a Titan X 12 gig card to go into it. May 26, 2017 at 4:28 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Nice job Rick! The titan is a beast. Does the fan kick up running it? May 26, 2017 at 4:38 EDT PM emlitu May 27, 2017 Thank you for a great article. Would it be possible to select a motherboard that supports Thunderbolt 3. I know you mentioned the ones that support USB 3.1 but that does not mean they are TB3 as well. Thanks so much. May 27, 2017 at 4:56 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Posted 26 May 2017 Kyle R. ConwayFeed 15up 4 comments Image by :  opensource.com Have you ever heard someone say, "It's impossible to do X with Linux"? Me too. This is the story of how I busted the myths about open source in my own head and used Linux to finish my PhD in fine arts. Many people think non-technical students can't use Linux, and they make a lot of assumptions about people who use it in their advanced degree programs. They scoff and reply with something along the lines of, "Well, of course; those people do 'computer stuff,' but in my [lofty, important, unique area] it's just not possible." Well, it is possible, and I'm proof. Here are some of the many (misguided) reasons I've heard people use to argue why Linux can't work in higher ed: Real world: Linux/open source is not what I'll/they'll need or use in the real world. Tool over task: I have to use [special program] in [specific field]. Special knowledge: Sure, it works for you because you understand computers. Change is hard: Open source is just different/another thing to learn. I know how to use [Windows/Mac/Chrome]. Lack of integration: It just won't run/do [specific application / task]. While all of these things hold a grain of truth, usually the objections come because they're underexplored or misplaced. How I discovered Linux I grew up using Windows, learning Microsoft Office, and believing that I should use them because well, honestly, I didn't think about tools because that was just what everyone else used. Eventually, I bought a PowerPC Mac Mini, only to discover mere months later that Apple was switching to Intel processors and my desktop would eventually be unsupported. (A shoutout to Debian for keeping the Mac Mini running and useful well into 2017.) Being newly married and entering graduate school 1,000 miles away from family made me extremely price sensitive. I also had a growing interest in free/libre software, having been swayed by the ethical arguments and the strong communities, plus I like having alternatives that aren't necessarily driven by a profit motive (and if they are—and if things go wrong—they can be forked). Learning that GIMP was this thing called "free and open source software" opened a new world to me. Suddenly I saw open source software everywhere, even in things I was already using, and I reached out for other options like OpenOffice, Firefox, and Audacity. That brought me to something entirely new to me: free and open source operating systems. I read with interest and suspicion. Eventually, Ubuntu's Wubi install (a familiar-feeling .exe file) won me over because it allowed me to choose whether to boot into Ubuntu or Windows. I found myself using Windows Vista less and less, until one day my Wubi install wasn't an option anymore. It had disappeared. The community came through for me, and I learned how to use Windows' cmd.exe to restore my folder, boot back into Ubuntu, and rescue my files. That day I wiped my drive and installed Ubuntu as my sole OS. To this day, I've never met another Linux user in the flesh. The tools shouldn't matter Language works against you when you're an open source student in a closed-source world. Instructors will tell you to turn in your paper as a Word document (with specific formatting guidelines and instructions for the version of Word that's on their computer) or insist that you give a PowerPoint presentation. They're likely well-meaning people who are unaware of the alternatives. You'll have to educate them. At the end of the day, they're not teaching you software, they're teaching you concepts and ideas. In my fine arts PhD program, I was ultimately being judged on how effectively I employed the concepts of narrative structure or negative space, so it shouldn't (and didn't) really matter if I put the words into LibreOffice or the pixels into GIMP; what I said with those words and how I arranged the pixels are what was most important. How I found the right solutions Still, finding the right open source tools was somewhat of a trial-and-error process. While you can use LibreOffice Impress for presentations, I saw so many PowerPoint-style presentation mishaps that I started to use PDFs when presenting. Every computer and every OS will display them, and they always work―no glitches. At the beginning, I designed in LibreOffice Impress and printed to PDF, but eventually, I started hand-designing my own slides in Inkscape for pixel-perfect presentations. Now there are tons of cool, open source presentation software available. For example, Sozi is an amazing tool that creates what most people know as Prezi-style presentations. I greatly prefer it, as you can dance around your .svg files from Inkscape and infinitely zoom without loss. Here's a quick, incomplete example of something I did for the Fedora Project about the process of becoming a contributor. Perhaps the most essential tool in my area of study is playwriting software. There are important reasons for standard formatting in plays, such as allowing a quick way to assess a play's length (i.e., how long will this play be?) by page number that is common across all scripts. Professional playwrights tend to use the closed source Final Draft for formatting, and the old, rebellious writers use Microsoft Word with painful, manual manipulations. Since neither of those met my demands, I googled a bit and found Celtx. This cross-platform desktop application worked beautifully. It turned out that no one could tell I didn't use Final Draft, and I was even able to help other writers use Celtx on their own computers. You'd probably be surprised how many of my fellow students had Windows but not Microsoft Word. I introduced them to OpenOffice (and later LibreOffice) and even created some custom formats and keyboard shortcuts to make quick work of formatting play scripts in those apps in real time. When I was writing scripts as part of my dissertation project, I moved to Emacs for writing and LaTeX for processing PDFs because why not? The words are what matter most, the format matters next, the software matters not at all. Since then there have been even more interesting developments. Screenwriter John August found the joy of open-format text files and developed a markdown-like plain-text conversion system called Fountain. Apps (many open source) can be created to leverage this format. Busting the myths I think educators, students, and others often get lost on the tools at the expense of the thing they're actually doing—teaching and learning new ideas—and that's a mistake. If education is overly focused on teaching you a specific tool, then you could just as easily RTFM and save the expense of a degree. People have legitimate reasons to think they can't use Linux for education, but if you dig just a layer below their initial, knee-jerk assumptions, you'll often find they're built on unsound ground. Remember all those reasons I relayed at the beginning for why people say open source won't work in education? Here are my responses to them. Real world The real world changes so fast that this really isn't a solid argument. I wrote my dissertation on Emacs and Gedit and formatted it in LibreOffice. I work at an organization that runs on Google Apps for Business. In the real world, you're better off being adaptable, and most organizations expect to give you on-the-job training anyway. Start learning to adapt today. Consider it part of your education. Tool over task This is related to No. 1 but has a different focus. The tool (Photoshop, Word, Final Draft) is not what you're actually trying to accomplish (e.g., create a poster for your event, send a memo, write a screenplay). Don't confuse the tool with the task. I was fortunate to team-teach an art course with Dirk Fowler at Texas Tech University. Dirk is a visual artist who has made posters for bands you probably like. He's also a visual artist who doesn't use Photoshop―he doesn't even use computers, rather he uses an antique letterpress. Task > Tool. Special knowledge I "understand" computers (better than most, I guess) because I tried to do things with them that teachers couldn't or wouldn't teach me. Again, start adapting. Don’t let your fear of getting it wrong prevent you from learning something new. There's no cost to start (i.e. free as in beer) and nothing prevents you from learning (i.e. free as in freedom). Wanna know how it works? Read the source, mod the config file, or talk with the dev on IRC. Heck, get a group of users together and code it yourselves or fund its development. You'll gain knowledge by doing, and that knowledge is both specific (to the improvements you identify and the changes you make) as well as general (because whether you know it or not you can affect the tools you use directly if they're free/libre and open source). Change is hard Yes, it is. That's the wrong point to make though. The question isn't whether or not it's hard―it's whether or not it's worth it. When most "normal" users have complaints about their tools they tend to make an incorrect assumption―not that they don't know how to do it (which might be true), or that the tool doesn't do it (which also might be true), but that it simply can't be done. And I can't overstate this point enough: using and being a part of the community that uses open source tools means that the answer the to question "Can X be done?" is always―always―yes. It might not be how you thought of doing it, but there's always a way (and, helpfully, often multiple ways). So if "change is hard" is the mantra you hear, focus on the benefits: Is it worth it? (Note: the answer is always "yes.") Lack of integration Do you need to use [application]? If so, then, by all means, use it. If not, what are you waiting for? And even if you do need to use a certain application for some reason, ask yourself what you're missing by not integrating other tools into your workflow. As an example, Emacs's Org-Mode is amazing. I challenge any writer hooked on Scrivener to watch science writer Jay Dixit's walk through of his customized Org-Mode writing setup and not drool a few times. Then, read an article by Howard Abrams about styling Org-Mode as a word processor so that it looks better for writing. The point is this: There are features out there that you don't even know you're missing. You'd want them if you knew about them. There are people just like you who have already thought these features up, coded them together, and shared them freely. I promise they'll help. Lastly, the biggest lack of integration is that a piece of software is not open source and free/libre. That one omisson means you have anti-integrations (e.g. no export at all for vendor lock-in), and no real ability to get new features added ("it's too hard to maintain, "not enough of our users want it," "we don't integrate with X because they're a competitor"). Every time I even think of using a closed piece of software I run through a list of negatives related to this "lack of integration" that is thrown around―falsely―as a negative of free/libre software. The opposite is true. Can this free/libre software integrate with X? Yes. If like me, you're using open source against the grain in your industry, you've probably heard similar excuses from your colleagues about why it won't work. How do you respond?

Thanks for the great links to other open source products like Sozi. I'm going to have to explore that more.

Conway on 26 May 2017 Permalink Sozi is great. And as someone who has recently needed to use its business-approved alternative, Prezi, it's going to get even more serious looks from designers because Prezi has just released a new version of their product ("next") that severely limits the ability for designers to move around a single, connected freely. reply Vote up! 1 Vote down! 0 Bob Martens on 26 May 2017 Permalink Thanks for the article!

The pen and keyboard cover are also improved, and this is one of the first mobile systems that includes Intel’s latest processors. The bad: Microsoft still refuses to include the Type Cover keyboard with the tablet, forcing a separate purchase. Battery life still isn’t enough for a full day. Latest news videos The cost: $624 to $1,052 The bottom line: A host of small refinements cements the Surface Pro 4’s position as the best-in-class Windows tablet — as long as you’re prepared to pay extra for the required keyboard cover. Lenovo Yoga 910 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: This premium convertible has a gorgeous display that spans nearly the entire lid and delivers solid performance and long battery life for the category. It’s a really cool looking laptop, too. The bad: The right-hand Shift key is poorly placed and sized. Webcam is at the bottom of the screen. No direct video output or SD card slot. Separate USB Type-C ports for power and video-out kill the option for a single connection all-in-one dock. The cost: $1,000 to $1,085 The bottom line: With a beautiful design, excellent performance and battery life, and a great display, the Lenovo is a head-turning hybrid. Apple iPad Pro Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The iPad Pro is the biggest and fastest Apple tablet. The pressure-sensitive Pencil stylus offers superior sketching and drawing, and the Pro’s gorgeous screen and quad speakers are ideal for split-screen apps, multitasking and watching movies. The bad: Few apps are optimized to take advantage of the Pro’s full potential. Its large size makes it less portable than other iPads. Once you’ve paid for the Pencil and keyboard peripherals, the Pro costs as much as a good laptop, but lacks its flexibility. The cost: $600 (32 GB, refurbished) to $799 The bottom line: The iPad Pro is a dream machine for graphic designers and media mavens, but this elegant tablet needs more optimized apps and accessories before it can achieve laptop-killer status. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The Galaxy is an elegantly designed tablet that comes with a capable stylus. It has a stunning screen, fingerprint sensor for extra security and satisfyingly loud quad speakers. It’s also the first HDR-ready tablet. The bad: Despite the hype, HDR content is not available on the tablet yet. Large games take time to load. The keyboard add-on is an expensive extra. The cost: $550 to $600 The bottom line: Samsung packs buzz-worthy features like S Pen and HDR support into the premium Galaxy, but without a keyboard, it’s still more about content consumption than creation.

At least 500 regular employees and as many as 711 would be affected, according to a May 19 letter released by state officials Thursday night: “This employment action is expected to be permanent.” The letter also says the plant could close, painting a considerably more dire picture than the one SolarWorld has presented in the two weeks since its German parent declared itself insolvent. As recently as Wednesday, SolarWorld had said it was operating as usual and ” intends to continue operating into the future,” albeit with an unspecified number of job cuts. SolarWorld sent its May 19 letter in compliance with the 1998 federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employers to give employees and local communities advance notice of large job cutbacks. It’s not clear why state officials hadn’t disclosed the letter earlier. Previously, they’d said they were expecting a letter from the company but didn’t know when. Like other U.S. solar manufacturers, SolarWorld had been under growing pressure from Chinese competitors the company says are dumping products on the American market. Earlier Thursday, SolarWorld joined a trade case that it hopes could trigger tariffs or other sanctions on Chinese imports. SolarWorld opened its 103-acre Washington County campus in 2008, after spending $440 million to convert an idle computer chip factory for solar production. State and local tax breaks worth $80 million helped underwrite the project. From the start, though, SolarWorld has battled Chinese competition in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels in 2012 and 2014, but they proved insufficient. On May 10, the company’s German parent, SolarWorld AG, announced it could no longer cover its debts and would file for insolvency – which is roughly analogous to corporate bankruptcy in the United States. The pending layoffs may be the largest since last year, when Intel eliminated 784 jobs in Washington County in a massive restructuring. Hundreds or thousands of additional Intel employees in Oregon – Intel won’t say just how many – took buyouts to leave the company as it retooled to prepare for long-term decline in the PC market. Nonetheless, Oregon’s job market is the best it’s been in decades. The state’s unemployment rate stands at 3.7 percent, the lowest since at least 1976. And economists say Oregon is approaching “full employment” – a metric that suggests employers are having increasing trouble filling open positions, but not that every single person who wants a job can find one. Oregon once sought to become a leader in solar manufacturing, pumping tens of millions of dollars in subsidized loans and tax credits at a time into large companies like Sanyo and SolarWorld, as well as smaller outfits with little track record, such as the thin film solar manufacturer SoloPower and polysilicon manufacturer Peak Sun Solar. The strategy has largely flopped. Oregon has 4,509 jobs in the solar industry, according to the most recent census from the Solar Foundation. But only 1,200 of those jobs are in manufacturing, and SolarWorld accounts for two-thirds of them. The solar installation and development business, by contrast, remains fairly strong, and is largely responsible for the 1,500 jobs the industry added in 2016.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list.

Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS.

It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

How did that old quote go? “640×480 ought to be enough pixels for anybody.” Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:25 Chaoslord AJ says: Prey is the only entry that surprised me. Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

Acer Spin 1 and Nitro 5 laptops are ready for school season by Eric Born  4:30 PM on May 25, 2017 Parents and students alike might not be ready to hear this, but back-to-school season is a few short months away. That means it's time for notebook manufacturers to update their lineups in anticipation of those end-of-summer sales events. Accordingly, Acer has a new Spin convertible and a lineup of Nitro 5 gaming notebooks to show off at Computex this year—all with affordable price tags. The Spin 1 notebook is a thin-and-light 11.6" convertible notebook with a metal chassis. It weighs only 2.8 lbs (1.24 kg) and is 0.55" thin (14 mm), so it'll slip easily into a backpack or satchel. The touch-enabled IPS display has a resolution of 1920x1080, generally a good fit for a smaller laptop screen. Acer touts how well the notebook pairs up with a stylus and the latest tools in the Windows 10 Creators Update, though we don't know if the laptop comes with a pen. Buyers get to pick one of Intel's "latest" (we presume seventh-generation) Pentium or Celeron processors, and 32, 64, or 128 GB of eMMC storage. The systems pack 4GB of DDR3L memory, and their battery should be good for about eight hours. Peripheral connectivity comes courtesy of a USB 3.1 port and a USB 2.0 connector. There's also an HDMI output and a microSD card slot. For networking purposes, the Spin 1 uses an 802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi adapter. Users who like their notebooks served with a side of gaming might take a peek at Acer's Nitro 5 lineup. Acer equips these 15.6" notebooks with a 1920x1080 display and more horsepower than the lightweight Spin 1 models. Users can get a machine with two combinations: a choice of Kaby Lake Core i7 CPUs paired with GeForce cards up to a GTX 1050 Ti, or an AMD seventh-generation A-series processors coupled with a Radeon RX 550. Acer says the notebooks support up to 32GB of DDR4-2400 RAM. The company doesn't say what's the baseline storage configuration, but notes that buyers have options for PCIe SSDs and an optional HDD as secondary storage. The Nitro 5s come with one USB 3.1 Type-C port, one USB 3.0 connector, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI 2.0 output. Wireless networking comes by way of an 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter with 2x2 MIMO support. The systems are kept cool with two fans that exhaust heat out the back, and have a black-and-red "gamer" style finish. These notebooks will all start selling in July. Pricing for the Spin 1 starts at a remarkably affordable $329, while the Nitro 5 models start at $799.

Ryzen AGESA 1.0.0.6 exposes more memory overclocking options by Jeff Kampman  4:12 PM on May 25, 2017 Over the past couple months, we've come to understand that memory speed and latency plays a major role in Ryzen CPU performance. Higher speeds and lower latencies are desirable for getting the most out of a Ryzen chip. Outside of a few motherboards with external base-clock generators, however, the memory multipliers for Ryzen CPUs have maxed out at 32. With a 100-MHz default base clock, that means builders have been limited to running overclocked RAM at DDR4-3200 speeds. Today, that all changes. AMD has announced that its AMD Generic Encapsulated System Architecture, or AGESA, version 1.0.0.6 will expose 26 new RAM tuning settings to tweakers looking to extract the most from their Ryzen systems' RAM. These updates should bring AM4 motherboards' firmware settings for memory tweaking more on par with that of the Intel competition. Of the wealth of memory overclocking options AGESA 1.0.0.6 will offer, the two most important settings to me are an extended range of memory multipliers (up to 40, or DDR4-4000) and the option to set command rates at one tick or two ticks (1T or 2T). For example, the hot G.Skill DDR4-3866 memory I have here requires a 38.66 multiplier and a 2T command rate, but those settings simply couldn't be dialed in on Ryzen motherboards under the current AGESA (1.0.0.4) without resorting to changes in the base clock that also controls important bus rates like PCI Express. Changing that base clock rate could result in unexpected behavior, so it's a relief that the masses won't have to resort to that approach any longer.  Of course, AMD is quick to point out that using memory speeds above DDR4-2667 or settings not in accordance with JEDEC values is considered overclocking. Overclocking RAM with these new knobs will void a Ryzen CPU's factory warranty, even if you're using the company's Ryzen Master utility. Still, the temptation of performance gains will probably be too much to resist for many Ryzen owners. In news that will be music to the ears of another class of users, AMD also says that AGESA 1.0.0.6 will improve support for PCI Express Access Control Services, or ACS. According to the company, these improvements will allow users who run virtual machines on their Ryzen systems to better manage the assignment of PCIe devices within IOMMU groups. In short, the company says this feature will let VM wizards dedicate multiple graphics cards within a Ryzen system to the operating systems of their choice, whether natively installed or virtual, among other benefits. AMD says motherboard firmware incorporating AGESA 1.0.0.6 will be available starting in "mid-to-late June." The company notes that some motherboard makers have already begun issuing beta firmwares for some products with the new AGESA on board, most notably Gigabyte with its AX370-Gaming 5 and Asus with its Crosshair VI Hero. Folks eager to push Ryzen memory performance to its limits will doubtless welcome this update warmly.   Tags: CPUs Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Zotac previews plenty of petite PCs for Computex 2017 by Zak Killian  3:30 PM on May 25, 2017 Zotac is probably more known for its mini-PCs than its graphics products. The company was doing "NUC-likes" before the NUC existed, and it continues to produce some of the more interesting mini-PCs around. At Computex, Zotac will be showing off no less than nine new takes on the Zbox idea, plus an intriguing gaming machine called MEK. Zotac Zbox EN1050K The E-series is primarily aimed at gamers and enthusiasts who need high performance. Zotac will have five new E-series machines to show off at Computex, including the EN1050K, EK51060, EK71070, ER51060, and the ER51070. The first model, the EN1050K, is externally identical to the Magnus EN1070 we reviewed. We can surmise from the model name that it probably includes a GeForce GTX 1050 or GTX 1050 Ti, but the rest of the hardware is a mystery for now. Zotac Zbox ER51070 The other four E-series machines utilize a taller chassis like that found on the EN1080 Magnus. The extra height gives them room to accommodate a standard desktop graphics card rather than having to rely on mobile-specific hardware. The two "EK" models, EK51060 and EK71070, use Kaby Lake Core i5 and i7 processors respectively. Those CPUs are paired with GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 graphics cards depending on the model. Zotac Zbox ER51070 Meanwhile, the ER51060 and ER51070 are mini-PCs based on AMD's Ryzen processors. Zotac doesn't specify exactly which chips, although it says that the CPUs in question have a 65W TDP rating. Given that fact and the "R5" in the model numbers, we could probably make a fair guess. Besides the different internals, these machines appear to be identical to their Intel-based counterparts. That means you get a desktop-style (Zotac says "full-size") GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 card. Zotac Zbox MA551 The M-series comprises Zotac's bread-and-butter mini-PCs. Zotac says the M stands for "multi-function", but it could as easily be "mainstream." The company will be bringing two M-series machines to Computex, the MI553 and MA551. These two little computers are nearly identical, except that one uses a Kaby Lake Intel processor, while the other uses a 65W Ryzen CPU. Zotac Zbox MA551 The Intel-powered MI553 comes with Thunderbolt 3 support, although it loses an HDMI port versus its Ryzen cousin for the privilege. Meanwhile, the Ryzen-based MA551 has a whole bunch of video connections. That leaves us wondering if it includes a discrete graphics card in some form, or if it will be based on an as-yet unannounced Ryzen-based APU. We're as eager to know as you are. Zotac Zbox PI225 The smallest of Zotac's mini-PCs are the Zbox P-series, formerly known as Zbox Pico. The company calls these its smallest Zboxes yet. The info sheet refers to the PI225 as "card-sized," and while the machine appears to be a a little too big for that moniker, it's doesn't appear to be larger than a typical smartphone. Zotac PR says the passively-cooled pocket PC is "4K display ready." Another fanless pocket PC, the PI335, will also be debuting at Computex. That model is thicker and closer to what we've seen from previous Zbox P-series models. Zotac Gaming MEK Finally, there's the MEK Gaming PC. While this machine doesn't exactly qualify as "mini PC," it's nonetheless interesting. The MEK is Zotac's first product from its new Zotac Gaming brand. The machine appears to be a more-or-less standard Mini-ITX gaming PC. The company didn't say much about what kind of internals will be available in the, but given its expertise with cramming hardware into micro machines, we have high expectations for the MEK's firepower.

Over at Greek online retailer Skroutz two 16-core Threadripper Processors surfaced online in their store, the AMD Threadripper 1998 and 1998X. Interesting as Threadripper processors are due for release in the summer. The listing is curious as it doesn't even come with pricetags. However the listing does show some specifications. Both models are th 16-core 32-threaded parts, and they have specced them at a 3.20 GHz base (unknown Boost) for the 1998 model and 3.5 GHz for the 1998X model.  Both procs are tagged under socket SP3r2, AMD's 4,094-pin LGA socket. AMD’s high-end desktop (HEDT) platform, code named Whitehaven, will include support for quad-channel DDR4 memory and up to 44 PCIe lanes. It will compete directly with Intel’s upcoming HEDT X299 platform and Skylake X CPUs which will feature up to 12 cores. Previous have indicated that the flagship 1998X would feature clock speeds of 3.5GHz base and 3.9GHz boost with AMD XFR (Extended Frequency Range) feature. The CPU get a very reasonable 155W TDP, 5 watts less than Intel’s 12-core Skylake X CPU. To be released soon? Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Whether or not it can compete clock for clock with intels sklyake x etc is irrelevant, because if people see that they can buy a cpu with more cores with a motherboard that has 44pci lanes top to bottom, they might think long term it's a better and possibly cheaper option and intel will have to react accordingly. The 4 core b.s race is over, and it would be pointless to say '10, 12, 16 cores is overkill' because then sooner it's available the sooner it will become mainstream and I applaud AMD for doing what intel held off doing for far too long because of their market dominance.

Moran Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Requesting Swift Movement of MGT Act By Foreign Affairs Publisher  /  May 27, 2017  /  Comments Off on Sen. Moran Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Requesting Swift Movement of MGT Act       Print       Email MIL OSI United States – Source: United States Senator for Kansas – Jerry Moran Headline: Sen. Moran Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Requesting Swift Movement of MGT Act WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today authored a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee requesting swift consideration of the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act of 2017 (S. 990/H.R. 2227), legislation to modernize government information technology (IT), eliminate wasteful spending and strengthen cybersecurity. The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.). “In the time that has passed since we first introduced this legislation, the threats of hacking, espionage and cybercrime have only grown more real,” said Sen. Moran. “This month we saw a worldwide ransomware attack that impacted hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Protecting our data has never been more important. By bringing government IT systems into the 21st century, not only can we strengthen the security of our data, we can save billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing long-term wasteful spending.” “Senators from both sides of the aisle recognize the urgency of this issue: as we have seen just this month with the ‘WannaCry’ attack, global cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pose a complex and serious threat to our national security,” said Sen. Udall. “But the federal government continues to rely on grossly outdated IT systems that make us vulnerable to such damaging cyberattacks. I welcome House passage of this bipartisan legislation, which will help federal agencies to retire old systems and invest in new and critical technologies. Maintaining old IT systems is a security risk and costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year. Now it’s time for the Senate to pass this bipartisan bill and see it signed into law, to ensure that our government is getting better service at a better value for American taxpayers.”? “Having spent twelve years in the technology sector, I know firsthand the threats cyber criminals pose and the need for modernized equipment to protect against attacks,” said Sen. Daines. “We have seen in recent years attacks on private business and governments that have crippling effects. It is more important now than ever to pass this important bipartisan legislation and bring the government into the modern era.”   “Ensuring that government agencies have the resources to invest in current technology is just smart management: Up-to-date systems means better service delivery and improved cyber security,” said Sen. Warner. “Our bipartisan legislation is a commonsense step to enable federal agencies to make these critical investments.” In the House, which passed the MGT Act with bipartisan support on May 17, the bill was led by U.S. Representatives Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). The bill is supported by a number of IT industry stakeholders and trade associations including the IT Alliance for the Public Sector (ITAPS), Professional Services Council (PSC), TechNet, Amazon Web Service, Cisco, Adobe, BMC, Brocade, Intel, Microsoft, Business Roundtable, CA Technologie, Compuware, CSRA, Level 3 and Unisys. Full text of the letter is below and can be found here.  Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member McCaskill, We write to respectfully request that the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs mark up the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act of 2017. We believe our bipartisan legislation complements your interest in improving how the federal government acquires, implements, and manages information technology (IT).  The federal government spends over $80 billion annually on major IT systems, with more than 75 percent expended on maintaining existing IT rather than investing in development, modernization and enhancement activities.  The rising cost of maintaining such “legacy” IT systems hinders the ability for agencies to replace their aging technology tools with more cost-effective solutions. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), federal IT systems use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks.[2] Aging federal IT systems may pose other serious security risks due to the inability to use data encryption, multi-factor authentication and other current security best practices. The MGT Act would establish IT working capital funds at the 24 agencies pursuant to the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576) and a separate centralized modernization fund within the Department of the Treasury for a federal IT expert board to administer across the federal government.  Savings obtained by federal agencies through streamlining IT systems, replacing legacy products and transitioning to cloud computing can be placed in a working capital fund that can be accessed for up to 3 years for further modernization efforts. The House of Representatives has already approved its companion legislation, H.R. 2227, which passed by voice vote on May 17, 2017.  The MGT Act garnered endorsements from numerous stakeholder groups, including the IT Alliance for the Public Sector (ITAPS), Professional Services Council (PSC), TechNet, Amazon Web Service, Cisco, and others.  Reporting the MGT Act out of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs will help advance our shared goal of preserving national security and ensuring that the federal government uses taxpayer dollars wisely.  Thank you for your consideration and your continued leadership on these issues.  ###     Print       Email Published: 14 hours ago on May 27, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 27, 2017 @ 7:50 pm Filed Under: Americas, English, MIL OSI, News Releases, Open Source Intel, United States, United States Government, United States of America, United States Senate, United States Senator for Kansas - Jerry Moran NEXT ARTICLE → Queensland’s NAIF announcement a nail in the coffin for Adani’s Carmichael mega-mine ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Motorists advised to drive with caution on Tamaki Drive, Auckland About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts Macindoe attends International Transport Forum UPDATE: Serious crash in Taita, Lower Hutt Appeal for witnesses to fatal collision in Edmonton Obituary for David Lee Hart Obituary for Jeremy Eugene Barnett © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Computing as either a laptop or a tablet is becoming an industry standard — even long-time holdouts like Apple, with the iPad Pro, have dipped their toes in the 2-in-1 water. Into this crowded field comes Samsung’s Microsoft Pro 4 clone, the Galaxy Book. Spec-wise, it’s a fierce machine: The Galaxy Book boasts a lot of the cutting edge in hybrid tablets. This includes a sharp Super AMOLED display, with a 2,160-by-1,440 resolution, the latest, fastest, fanless Intel Core i5 processor, and two USB-C ports to plug in all your peripherals. (We should say — we're testing out the 12-inch version. There is also a 10-inch version that is considerably cheaper, and has considerably less going for it.) There’s plenty of storage offered, starting at 128GB and going up to 512GB, and plenty of memory for all your computing needs, with 8GB of RAM. ALSO: 72 Hours With the iPad Pro The Galaxy Book comes bundled with a keyboard cover and included S-Pen, unlike, say, the iPad Pro or the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, whose pens and keyboards are sold separately. If you’re in the market for a new laptop and you’d like a tablet for all your entertainment, the Galaxy Book is a fair value proposition, with a starting price of $1,130. Over three days, we put the hybrid tablet through the motions. Here’s what we found. Day 1 The first thing you notice about the Galaxy Book is how thin it is for a full-powered Windows tablet — before you put the cover on. At only a few millimeters thin and 1.6 pounds heavy, the tablet itself is easy to pick up and carry around one-handed (not a trivial detail for those looking to replace their laptop). When you slap the keyboard cover on, it definitely adds a little density and heft into the mix, but that’s at least partially because of the quality of the keyboard itself: It’s unrivaled in the 2-in-1 community, as far as we can tell. While Type Covers for the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 have valued thinness and low-key travel, the Galaxy Book’s keyboard has more of a full-on laptop feel to it. That means the keys are snappy, have lots of travel, and are generously spaced. In other words, you feel like you’re typing on a laptop. Typing this review right now might be a breeze, but I immediately notice one of the hybrid’s biggest weaknesses: The keyboard cover is flimsily adjustable to three positions, so while you can modify the Galaxy Book’s “lapability” (how well the laptop sits in your lap), like you can with the Surface Pro 4, there’s a bit of a balancing act going on. That’s due to the fact that the tablet itself doesn’t have an adjustable stand, but relies on the keyboard to stay vertical. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but not a deal breaker. ALSO: Tablets That Do It All for Under $100 And the battery life? We’ve only been typing this review for a couple hours, switching between Word and Chrome on medium brightness, and the tablet’s already drained 25 percent of its battery. The Galaxy Book might just squeeze by with an all-day battery life, but barely. Day 2 Since the Galaxy Book comes boxed with software, we needed an update. That's when we noticed something: While the Galaxy Book performed the update well, it got hot. Very hot. The Galaxy Book relies on Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor, an i5 that doesn’t require a fan, but in this instance, the tablet feels like it could use one. The included S-Pen is certainly one of the bigger draws (no pun intended) of the Galaxy Book. The S-Pen isn’t pressure sensitive, like the Apple Pencil, but performs admirably. The tip moves across the screen smoothly, and there’s no delay in what you’re drawing and what you end up seeing on the screen. In order to plug in any peripherals — a mouse, a hard drive, what have you — we needed to use an adapter (or “dongle”) because there are two USB-C ports, and that’s all you get. Either port will charge the device when it’s plugged in. You’re seeing more and more USB-C ports on machines, such as the new Macbook Pros, and that’s because they’re becoming a highly adaptable universal standard. We’re glad to see them included on the Galaxy Book — it keeps the device thin, and with a simple adapter, you can plug in whatever you’d like. Of course, you’ll have to pay extra for that dongle. Day 3 By day three, it's clear that the Samsung Galaxy Book is a breeze to get used to, and is capable of running multiple programs and windows without any slowdown. We wrote in Word, browsed in both Chrome and Edge, and played a video in VLC without experiencing any stuttering or slowdowns.  The batteries, however, continue to be a problem. Barely half an hour into working, we’re down to 85 percent life. We checked, and there were no demanding tasks outside of Chrome and Word. Samsung estimates that the tablet will get 10 hours or so of life with mixed use, but we’re entirely skeptical. Then again, it could just be our test model. It’s evident that the Galaxy Book is meant to be a Surface Pro 4 competitor — and, for right now, it beats the Surface Pro 4 in terms of specs. The Galaxy Book has the latest hardware, but the Surface Pro 5 is expected soon, so the Galaxy Book won’t be top-of-the-line for too incredibly long. It’s sure to beat the Surface Pro 5 in price — at $1,300 or so, keyboard and pen included, it’s a really great value — and the keyboard is one of the best we’ve used with a 2-in-1. But the Galaxy Book could use some finessing in terms of its keyboard cover’s “lapability,” battery life, and heat. When it comes to a Windows machines, we say Microsoft makes the best ones. Samsung’s new Galaxy Book isn’t far behind, and more budget friendly. If you’re looking for a Windows 2-in-1 to replace your laptop, in a thin design and future-proofed with USB-C ports, it’s a good deal.  More News The 5 Best Yard Games to Buy Now Sneak Peek: An Exclusive Look at BMW's Sleek, Sexy Concept 8 Series The World's First Motorcycle Helmet Head-Up Display Is Finally Here A Great Hang: 6 Hammocks Made for Sleeping Under the Stars The Memorial Day Sales You Don't Want to Miss All Stories Want More?

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 6:23 PM Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. (Reuters) Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. You May Also Like To Watch This: The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. No Comments.

Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-05-26 22:58:52 UTC Apple's reportedly working on a new kind of chip — potentially for future iOS devices — that'll be used just for processing AI, Bloomberg reports.  SEE ALSO: New leaked photos reportedly reveal the final design of the iPhone 8 Bloomberg says the chip's called the Apple Neural Engine internally, and could be used for "offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip." By moving AI processing to a dedicated chip, battery life in devices could also see a boost since the main CPU and GPU wouldn't be crunching as much data and gobbling as much power. The report says Apple plans to integrate the chip into its devices, but it's unclear when that'll happen, and if any iOS devices launching this year will have it. Apple's work on an AI chip shouldn't surprise anyone who's paying attention to the competition. Virtually every tech company is working on improving AI processing on mobile devices. Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 chip, which is already in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a special module dedicated to processing AI tasks.  Years ago, Apple started designing its own mobile processors to improve performance and reduce power consumption, and it's really paid off.  Despite having fewer cores, the iPhone 7 still crushes the Galaxy S8 when it comes to sheer performance. iPhones and iPads also come with an Apple-designed "M"-branded motion coprocessor to collect sensor data from the various included sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.). It's this M chip that helps with tracking health and fitness data. Furthermore, in addition to the main Intel processors in the new MacBook Pros, there's also a small Apple-made "T1" chip for powering the Touch Bar. Apple's AirPods also have a custom W1 chip that helps with pairing them to iOS devices. Clearly, Apple loves making custom chips for things. We're all for it, especially if that means longer battery life. If the future is AI everywhere (and it definitely looks like that's where things are headed), it's in Apple's best interests to control the stack (like it always does) with its own AI chip.

By: Bloomberg | Published:May 27, 2017 1:02 pm Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Even today the first generation TPUs beat anything commercially available. But Google now has generation 2 which is just miles ahead of anything else. A TPU pod is able to generate 11.5 peta flops of fp16. No that is NOT a typo. But the key is Google is doing it on a small fraction of the power of any compe or. So Google inference per joule is a tiny fraction of someone like Nvidia. Smart move on Apple to try to copy Google and create something similar. Google shared the details of their generation 1 in a paper that Apple could then just use to build theirs.

Home > News By Company > Market Research Hub Tweet   Global Client Solid-State Drive (SSD) Market to grow at a CAGR of 36.14% during the period 2017-2021 An SSD is a solid state disk or an electronic disk that is used for data storage and is built out of semiconductors. It uses the same I/O interface design as HDDs and stores data in solid state memory.   Market Research Hub - Market Research Company (EMAILWIRE.COM, May 27, 2017 ) An SSD is a solid-state disk or an electronic disk that is used for data storage and is built out of semiconductors. It uses the same I/O interface design as HDDs and stores data in solid state memory. They are made of silicon microchips and stores data electronically. These devices use dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or negative-AND (NAND)-based flash memory to store data. The lack of moving parts reduces the risk of mechanical failures of SSDs allowing data transfer at higher speeds. In addition, they are suited for harsh environments, extreme shock, high altitude, and consume less power. Request For Free Sample @ http://www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=1107450 This market research study identifies Samsung, Kingston, Lite-On, and Toshiba as the leading players in the global client solid-state drive (SSD) market. A comprehensive analysis of this market is also presented by the end-user (laptops and PCs), by product (MLC NAND, TLC NAND, and 3D NAND), and by geography (the Americas, APAC, and EMEA). According to Market Research Hubs market research report, the global client solid state drive market will grow rapidly during the next four years and in terms of units, will post an impressive CAGR of more than 36% by 2021. The enhanced performance and durability of SSDs will drive the growth prospects for the client solid-state drive market during the projected period. The market is witnessing a huge shift from HDDs towards SSDs because HDDs are more susceptible to damage, hold up a high-traffic environment, require loads of extra RAM to work normally, and physically scans the disk for reads/writes. SSDs reaches memory addresses much faster, contains no physical tracks or sectors, exhibits better performance with high I/O environments, offers instant access, faster file transfers, quicker boot ups, and an overall faster computing experience, which in turn, will result in the increased sales volume of SSDs. The client SSD market in APAC accounted for the majority market share during 2016 and the region will continue its dominance in the forthcoming years as well. The markets growth in this region is mainly attributed to the presence of major vendors in countries such as South Korea and Japan and the rise in indigenous manufacturing in the region. Countries such as Taiwan, China, and India will be the major contributors to the growth of the client SSD market in APAC. Market Research Hub analysts forecast the global client solid-state drive (SSD) market to grow at a CAGR of 36.14% during the period 2017-2021.

Photo / Getty Images Apple got an early start in artificial intelligence with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn't been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com and Alphabet in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person's view of the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." Improved Performance Continued below.

Philippines at a grave risk of "contamination" by Isis Ecostore takes legal action against former employee Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc's latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google's data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple's hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, adding that it's unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple's operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer's conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker's ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman Courtesy of Warner Brothers/DC Entertainment A Lasso, A Lady and A Legacy: Wonder Woman In Comics And Film - 1:18 Great Hera’s Girdle! Wonder Woman fans of all ages and stripes are eagerly awaiting the roll-out of the Amazing Amazon’s new feature film. It’s almost more than we can bear, from the Lynda Carter flashbacks to conceptually suspect campaigns to introduce Wondy as a UN spokeswoman and purveyor of protein bars. We’ve gone peak nerd and can’t resist drawing your attention to several related stories, including comic book store events in Redmond, Salem, Hillsboro, St. Johns, and Eugene. If you can’t get to a retailer, there are still plenty of Wonder Woman comics to check out. Did you know one of the most celebrated writers in the character’s history lives in Portland? We chat up comic book writer Greg Rucka about his history with the character. We also touch base with a BDSM practitioner to ask: Exactly what is up with the bracelets and rope stuff, anyway? Then there’s the matter of going to the movie. The Portland chapter of Women in Film is pleased to invite you along for a Friday night screening, to show support for the first $100+ million budget blockbuster action film in the hands of a female director. While the trailers are flying fast and furious on the big screen, several observers, including the Women in Film ladies, have noticed that the early marketing effort belies something less than full support. (Here’s a bit chunkier read from Adweek.) It seems entirely possible that a world without a Wonder Woman breakfast cereal tie-in might not be so bad for the film’s prestige. You decide. And we’ll see you in the popcorn line next weekend.  Could Holograms Bring The Universe To A Classroom Near You? - 24:55 A virtual trip to the pyramids? An interactive hologram of the solar system?

A Portland producer had planned to stage the play this fall, casting an African-American actor, Damien Geter, in one of the four lead roles. However, as Albee was notoriously strict about casting, his estate delivered an ultimatum: cast a white actor in the role or lose the rights to the production. The producer Michael Streeter cancelled the play. Streeter talked about his decision with OPB’s Dave Miller and with Brian Herrera, an Assistant Professor of Theater at Princeton University who’s working on a book about casting.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.
