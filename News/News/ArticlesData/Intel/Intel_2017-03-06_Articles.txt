A lot of VR games at this stage of development are taking two tacks when it comes to how they work. They're either games wed normally play on a flatscreen, but which in VR we can now look around in, like flight sims and racing games; or they're one-trick gimmicks, like Eagle Flight (the elevator pitch is basically "You're a bird in Paris"). What we're really waiting for, are the games that do something truly unique, in a way we've never even considered before. What we're really waiting for, is a game like Star Trek: Bridge Crew. Intel had a demo of the game up and running at the Intel Extreme Masters in Poland, and while others raced toward the Virtuix Omni treadmill, or the sailboard setup (which was pretty awesome, I admit), I only had eyes for getting onto the bridge of a starship. The demo in question was pretty limited - it was only for one person, and it only ran for about ten minutes. But it's a testament to how damn good it was - despite some flaws, which we'll get to - that when I'm back in Sydney, I'm going to order a pair of Touch controllers for my Rift headset. I have to admit this - I am a dyed in the wool Trekkie. I grew up watching TOS re-runs with my mum in the 70s, discovered what I still call 'My Star Trek' with TNG in the 80s, adored what DS9 did with the setting later, and was enthralled with Enterprise. Voyager? Not so much. The movies? Hell, I even like the reboots. I've a couple of uniforms, I roleplay and write Star Trek games... I love it. So, I may be a little biased. In fact, when the bridge of the USS Aegis appeared around me, I got a little emotional. I have imagined being a bridge officer for almost as long as I can remember, and just being able to look around the bridge was amazing. But in Bridge Crew you do far more than look. The demo gave me a brief time with all four of the main bridge stations - engineering, helm, tactical, and of course the captain's seat. There was a very brief tutorial of each station's role, then a chance to fiddle with some virtual knobs, before you moved on the next station. To call it a tantalising, teasing taste of what's to come is an understatement. The game will be released on all three major VR platforms - PSVR, Vive, and Rift, but you will absolutely need controllers - so make that upgrade to your Rift now, Iike I'm doing. Between the buttons on the controller, and the trigger, you get a surprisingly deft amount of control over each touch-screen station. In fact, one of the best effects in the game is when you take your index fingers off the trigger, and they then point on your virtual hands - it effectively mirrors your natural movement, so you can use precise controls. Sure, the lack of actual feedback was a touch distracting, and I would recommend not trying to touch your virtual finger-tips together (the sensation when your 'hands' 'touch' and you can't feel it is... odd to the say the least), but it offered an amazing sense of presence. The other great thing about how places you on the bridge is that your avatar is always seated, so when you look down, and see your virtual body, with your legs tucked under your panel, it feels natural. Look around, and you'll see your crewmates, too.  I can't think of another VR game that has offered such a thrilling sense of presence, and when the full version releases, and you can crew up with three other players, this will be a remarkable experience, as you follow your captain's orders, facing various threats as you explore a region of the galaxy known only as The Trench. I will admit, it's not perfect. In particular, the relatively low res, at least on the Rift, is a distraction, and it can make the controls and displays hard to read, which is a vital part of the game. Too, it doesn't help that we're used to seeing this sets in high resolution on the films; it's jarring to see these bright, clean stations (the game is set in the Klevin timeline, so if you dislike the design of that setting you're out of luck) so pixellated. Similarly, I know, when I'm playing captain, that I'm going to have to resist physically getting up to peer over the shoulder of one of my crew. I kind of want to see a version of this game that uses room-scale VR, because that would be just about the best thing - but at least, this way, the game plays on all the platforms, which is far better than it relying on a single one. It's also a game you'll want to play with some space around you, as bumping into things is supremely distracting. If you do VR at your computer desk, make sure you push back for a lot of room.  Also - and I hope this is a demo thing - the translation of movement in game, and actually managing to manipulate controls was more than a little... hit and miss. I suspect that's down to this being setup for a big show, with lots of people using it. It would be hard to keep everything synced up, and with your own rig play it will likely track movements far more more precisely. Still, as a promise of what's to come, I'm super-excited. Not only will this game finally take Star Trek fans where no one has gone before, but it takes VR in a similar direction. This is the game that every Trekkie needs to play.   Related Articles Interview: Frank Soqui, Intel's General Manager of Virtual Reality Review: Oculus Touch gets you hands on in virtual worlds Review: Google Daydream View virtual reality headset One Minute Review: Alcatel Idol 4S goes virtual Review: Insta360 Nano Source: Copyright © Hyper Magazine.

What we found when testing these Clarkdale overclocking enabled processors was that they offered up decent gaming performance when compared to the high end processors of the time. But then again, games were not as readily optimized to use more than one core at a time. Fast forward to 2017 with the Kaby Lake launch back on January 3, and Intel is looking to rekindle this magic with the Core i3 7350K. We took a look at the top dog inthe product stack, the Core i7 7700K, and found that the IPC improvements, high end clock speeds, and overclocking abilities added up to some serious firepower in the mid range. Priced at $169, the Core i3 7350K is in a strange position with a Core i5 7400 sitting just a scant $20 away to give you a bit more cache and potential. Without a Core i5 7400 to test against, we will see where the performance of this entry point into overclocking CPU falls performance wise and if it can game with the best of the processors on the market. Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Closer Look: Intel's 7th Generation processors code named Kaby Lake are built on Intel's 14nm+ process. The Core series will consist of quad-core and dual-core variants with and without Hyper Threading, depending on the SKU. The Core i3 7350K is one of the dual-core versions with Hyper Threading that allows the end user to access up to four threads at one time for improved performance. The die shot below is representative of the Core i7 7700K, but with the Core i3 7350K we would see a little less hardware in the package. The Intel 200 Series chipset for the enthusiast will wrap around the Z270 chipset. While there are several others for different usage scenarios, I will focus my look on the Z270 chipset, as it's built for use with Intel 6th and 7th Generation Core series overclocking enabled SKU's in mind. Taking a look around the block diagram shows that there are 16x PCIe 3.0 lanes dedicated for discrete graphics, with support for up to three displays and Thunderbolt connectivity. There are a total of 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes available. Support for peripheral connectivity includes up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, 14 USB 2.0 ports, six SATA 6Gb/s ports, Intel I219-V gigabit LAN connectivity, a new Intel High Definition sound solution that uses an integrated digital signal processor, dual channel memory support, and Intel's latest storage solutions. A couple new additions to the feature set come to fruition with the 7th Generation processors and 200 Series chipset. Optane Memory will be a quick access memory to improve performance and responsiveness when it hits the market. Hardware level security options make its way to the table to further reduce the exposure of the system.     The Core i3 7350K features a baseline clock speed of 4.2GHz, but does not employ Turbo Boost technology to dynamically raise the core clock frequency; rather, it swtches between the low power and full power states. That equates to roughly 800MHz or 4200MHz. As an interesting part of the product stack, the dual-core with Hyper Threading Core i3 7350K features a lower amount of L3 cache than the next step up, the Core i5 7400. One more interesting note is that the Core i3 7350K is the only processor in the product stack to feature a 60W TDP. The rest of the stack include 35W, 51W, 65W, and 91W processors. The graphics capabilities of this processor and pretty much the whole of the "S" series Kaby Lake product stack rely on Intel HD 630 graphics running at 1150MHz. It's not the Iris Pro line, but an enthusiast or power user usually will be using a discrete card for their graphics fix anyhow. Memory support for this platform will be dual channel DDR4 with speeds up to 2400MHz officially supported and DDR3 officially supported at speeds up to 1600MHz. Knowing the kind of memory speeds that Skylake could hit, Kaby Lake should prove to be every bit as capable in this respect.     We have fewer cores than the Core i5 and Core i7 on this overclocking enabled processor. Can the lower amount of L3 shared cache and higher clock speed deliver the kind of performance needed to deliver performance on a budget? Let's find out. --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K: Introduction & Closer Look2 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K: Specifications & Features3 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Setup & Overclocking4 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Apophysis, WinRAR, Geekbench, Bibble 55 » Intel 7th Generation Core 3 7350K Testing: Office 2010, POV Ray, ProShow Gold, HandBrake6 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: SiSoft Sandra, AIDA 647 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Cinebench R15, HW Bot X.265, PCMark 8.28 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Gaming9 » Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K: Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K: Introduction & Closer Look Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K: Specifications & Features Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Setup & Overclocking Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Apophysis, WinRAR, Geekbench, Bibble 5 Intel 7th Generation Core 3 7350K Testing: Office 2010, POV Ray, ProShow Gold, HandBrake Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: SiSoft Sandra, AIDA 64 Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Cinebench R15, HW Bot X.265, PCMark 8.2 Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Testing: Gaming Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K: Conclusion Related Products Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Review Recent Articles Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Review AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Review ASUS ROG Maximus IX Formula Review Galactic Civilizations III v2.0 Review Anonabox FAWKES Tor Router Review MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review NEST Protect and NEST Learning Thermostat Review OCC's Top 3 Video Cards of 2016 Watch_Dogs 2 Performance Analysis GTX 1070 Overclocking Guide » all reviews Forum Posts Backlight bleed ASUS Maximus IX Formula Ryzen 1700X PC Build Help Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Reviewed NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Benchmarks Leaked Latest News NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Benchmarks Leaked IBM Announces Plans to Build Universal Quantum Computing Systems Hardware Roundup: Monday, March 6, 2017, Edition Amazon Explains S3 Internet Outage G.SKILL Announces DDR4 RAM for AMD Ryzen Systems Hardware Roundup: Friday, March 3, 2017, Edition More AMD Ryzen CPUs on the Way Hardware Roundup: Thursday, March 2, 2017, Edition AMD Ryzen Benchmarks Posted Ahead of Release Random Pic Click to enlarge Most Popular Articles AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Review MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review Galactic Civilizations III v2.0 Review ASUS ROG Maximus IX Formula Review Anonabox FAWKES Tor Router Review Latest Comments Firefox Gets a 64-bit Version for Windows [6] Repairing Nerves with 3D Printed Guides [1] Valve Announces the Vive VR Headset, Built by HTC [1] Sony Announces Premium Sound Memory Card [1] NVIDIA Hit With Class Action Lawsuit Over GTX 970 Memory Issue [1] Predicting the Past in Quantum Mechanics [1] Equation Group Spying Software Found on Hard Drives Across the World [3] Super Bowl Halftime Show Powered by MAINGEAR System with Four GeForce GTX Titan Z GPUs [3] Fake Facebook Porn Links Infect Over 110,000 Users with Trojan in Just Two Days [1] ContactReview RequestsForumsAdvertiseOCC Logos and Banners © 2001-2017 Overclockers Club ® Privacy Policy Elapsed: 0.0270061493   (xlweb1)

Few people know that Dell also offers Ubuntu on its high-end Precision mobile workstation line. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | March 7, 2017 -- 01:27 GMT (17:27 PST) | Topic: Hardware CEO and founder of Dell, Michael Dell, has long been a Linux supporter. By 2007, under his guidance, Dell became the first major OEM to offer a laptop with pre-installed Linux. His Linux of choice? Ubuntu Linux. Ten years later, Dell is still selling Ubuntu Linux-powered laptops. With the option of Xeon processors, up to 64GBs of RAM, and TBs of storage, Dell Precision 5720 will be a Linux developer or engineer's dream come true. The best known of these is the Dell XPS 13 developer edition, but it's not the only Linux laptop Dell offers. Read this 31 ways to improve your iPhone's battery life For enterprise, mobile devices about to become irrelevant Ten reasons to still consider a basic flip phone in today's smartphone world In a blog post, Barton George, senior principal engineer at Dell's Office of the CTO, announced "the next generation of our Ubuntu-based Precision mobile workstation line." All of these systems boast Ubuntu 16.04 long-term support (LTS), 7th generation Intel Core or Intel Xeon processors, and Thunderbolt 3, AKA 40 Gigabit per second (Gbps) USB-C, ports. As the Xeon processor option shows, these are top-of-the-line laptops for professionals. It took longer than expected for Dell to get this new set of five Ubuntu-powered Precision mobile workstations out the door. The Precision 5520 and 3520 are now available. To see their Ubuntu option, go to each laptop's page and click on customize and buy. The 3520, the entry-level workstation, starts with an Intel Core 2.5GHz i5-7300HQ Quad Core processor with Intel HD Graphics 630. From there, you can upgrade it all the way to an Intel Core Xeon 3 GHz E3-1505M v6 processor with Nvidia Quadro M62 graphics. For RAM, it starts with 4GBs and can be raised up to 16GBs of error correcting code (ECC) memory. ECC RAM is for when you absolutely can't afford any memory mistakes. For storage, the 3520 begins at a 500GB hard drive and zooms up from there to a 2TB hard drive or a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD). Its 15.6 display has a maximum resolution of 1,366 by 768. This model's price is currently $897.50. That's $101.50 less than the same machine with Windows 10 Pro. Yes, that's right. At long, long last, you can get a Linux laptop from a mainline vendor without paying the "Windows tax". The 5520 is Dell's lightest 15" mobile workstation. Its default configuration starts with an Intel Core 2.8GHz i5-7440HQ Quad Core processor with Intel HD Graphics 630. You can upgrade the graphics with Nvidia's new Quadro M1200 graphics and 4GBs of video RAM. On the memory front, it begins at 8GBs of RAM and can go up to 32GBs. For storage, this workstation starts at a 500GB hard drive and can be ramped up to either a 2TB hard drive or several different 1TB SSDs. You have two display choices: A 15.6 1,920 x 780 or a 3,840 x 2,160 screen for an extra $299. The price starts at $1,297.50. Again, this is just over $100 cheaper than the same model with Windows 10 Pro. The other Dell Ubuntu workstations on their way are the Precision 7520 and 7720. These should be out within the next few weeks. The full specifications for these aren't out yet. It's believed the 7720 will offer an Intel Kaby Lake processor. George called it the "world's most powerful mobile workstation". Both machines also offer Xeon processors. The 7520 will come with a 15.6" display, while the heftier 7720 will offer a 17.3" display. Both offer NVIDIA Quadro and AMD Radeon Pro graphics options. Each system can have up to 64GBs of RAM. Yes, I said, 64. The 7520 maxes out at 3TBs of storage, while the 7720 can hold up to 4TBs of storage. Prices will be high, but you're also getting more power than you can get from any other current standard laptop. Finally, the all-in-one desktop, the Precision 5720, will be out in April. This model comes with a 4K 27" display, powered by the 7th Generation Intel Core or a Xeon E3-1200 v6 series processor. It can also handle up to 64GBs of RAM. For storage, the sky's the limit with slots for a M.2 PCIe SSD and a pair of 2.5" SATA drives. Last but not least, it also comes with the option of AMD Radeon Pro graphics. Its price tag is also unknown, but it's safe to assume it won't be cheap. None of these are machines for casual users, but if you're a pro and your work demands the best possible hardware, it will be hard to beat them. Let me just add that my birthday isn't that far away (OK, so it's six months out, sue me), and I'd be happy to have any of these in my office.

Blog :  Mismatch in Incentives Gives Cybercriminals an Edge Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch Microsoft and Steelcase Finally Begin to Obsolesce Cubicle Hell Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 06 Mar, 2017          |         |     Share I hate cubicles with a passion and I know I’m not the only one. The guy who came up with the idea of the cubicle went to his grave hating them worse than I do. They were supposed to be emergency office space, something to be used as a result of a crisis or disaster, not something folks had to effectively live in for hours on end. A few years back, Conan O’Brien visited Intel and compared its cubicle farm to hell. Intel redid the entire floor after he left. Way back in 2007, I saw progress to address this cubicle problem but, sadly, progress hasn’t been what I’d hoped. Well, apparently Steelcase, which sells a ton of cubicles, along with Microsoft, got the memo. They are collaborating on making a line of office furniture and accessories that could actually make you want to come in to work again. Cubicle Hell I think the most memorable cubicle experience I ever had was going to a now shut-down IBM site in San Jose, where the accounting and HR folks were put into a beautiful, new, all-glass building, but not allowed to see the view. You see, some executive thought that people would fight to get a cubicle by a window so they put a walkway around the perimeter of the building and walled it off so no one could actually see outside. Except for the top floor, where the executives had expansive views of the valley in their well-appointed offices. The top folks got a view; the folks who did the work got something like eight stories of above-ground basement and fluorescent light. I had a nice big office with no windows and it felt like being locked in solitary confinement for the day. I only spent a couple of years at that site, but thinking back, it felt like more than a decade. IBM was hardly alone. The cubicle mentality ranged, and still ranges, from small to large companies. And largely because firms are heavily cost focused, and didn’t seem to care that much about productivity, or at least, couldn’t measure it as well, the executives focused on the costs they could see and not the productivity they couldn’t. However, with the application of analytics, suddenly firms are coming to grips with problems associated with excess absence, sickness and mental health issues tied to slamming people into fluorescent lighted hell pits for weeks on end. Fortunately, also, a few of these executives who came out of these pits had something called “empathy” and also felt motivated to fix the problems. Microsoft and Steelcase Solutions Microsoft and Steelcase are proposing something closer to open-plan designs. Yes, they do have a version of cubicles, but their version has low walls. This allows employees to see out into the building and not feel walled off; they are less likely to feel they are in a space smaller than would be legally allowed for criminals in solitary confinement. You’ll notice standing desks as part of the proposal. I have a Steelcase treadmill desk myself that I should likely use more often, but these things are life savers because, increasingly, we are connecting chronic health problems to folks sitting too much. Offices have windows so that people can see out and feel a stronger part of the working community, and collaboration spaces are less like large versions of walled boxes and more conducive to people actually working with each other rather than talking at each other. The Microsoft Surface Hub stands out as a major part of this and it is uniquely designed to make people who are remote feel more like they are part of the collaborative process. On Surface, it is interesting to note that Steelcase has created unique micro-cubicle desks specifically for those who are hoteling or need some privacy, specifically designed for products similar to the Surface like 2-in-1 laptops and optimized for the unique kickstand that partially defines that product. You can see an example of this type of work space at the bottom of this page. Wrapping Up: Work Spaces Influence Employee Health We’re having issues with younger and older working people. Young people coming in and facing cubicles and a strict work ethic are having surprisingly high rates of mental health issues, and those who have been sitting on their butts for most of their careers are having a whole host of medical problems, all of which are dramatically reducing productivity and raising medical insurance costs. Microsoft and Steelcase appear to be recognizing this problem and moving to address it, hopefully both with offerings to their customers and changes to their own working environments. In the end, I think that every firm should take a look around and realize it is time to recognize and step up to addressing this problem and end the pervasive hell of traditional cubicle farms and windowless offices. Maybe then, fewer people will end up feeling like Joe in this clip. I’m sure more than one of us can identify with Joe’s departing words and that is just sad.

Paul Dillien, Principal, High Tech Marketing 3/6/2017 06:00 PM EST  1 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet From these numbers, it appears that FPGAs outgrew the overall semiconductor market (6% vs. 1.5%). I don't need the assistance of a firm of accountants to work out that Xilinx topped the rankings for FPGA billings during 2016. This is no surprise as Xilinx has been at the top for well over a decade now. As I discussed in my previous column (see Who Would Have Predicted So Much Programmability?), 2016 was a difficult year to call for semiconductor revenue, with the final consensus being that the market managed a modest increase. Having said this, the year saw lots of changes in FPGA-land. Most obvious is that Intel completed its acquisition of Altera at the end of 2015, meaning there is now a full year of numbers under the new ownership. Meanwhile, Microsemi was also on a buying spree. It absorbed PMC-Sierra with the deal completing in 2015, while later divesting its Remote Radio Head Business to MaxLinear and board-level products to Mercury System. And then there's Lattice Semiconductor, which had bought Silicon Image in 2015, and is now adding licensing and ASSP revenues to its numbers. (Lattice is currently waiting government agency review on a proposed take-over itself.) All this makes the task of figuring out exactly what billings should be specifically attributed to FPGAs substantially more complicated. With this in mind, my guesstimate of the final numbers is as follows: Guesstimate of final numbers x 1,000,000 (Source: Paul Dillien) In calculating these numbers, I have made adjustments for sales of items such as CPLDs, ASSPs, and power devices, but included software and IP. So, my take is that FPGAs outgrew the overall semiconductor market (6% vs. 1.5%). I didn't find any significant shift in market share, although Brian Krzanich (Intel CEO) claimed that Altera had taken share. In fact, what surprises me more is that Xilinx is not drawing away fast. The headline grabbing "largest-fastest-latest technology" parts are also the highest priced devices. Xilinx has beaten Altera to the last three nodes, with more than a one-year lead to 16/14nm technology. I expected this dominance would drive more design wins and therefore revenue. Admittedly, these high-end devices tend to be reserved for exotic applications in ASIC emulation, communications, or the military, but these are the families that move the needle the most. The design-in time for complex FPGAs is getting longer, but I'd expect ASIC emulation to be early to market. Emulator companies have to build a complex software environment that can partition ASIC design into manageable chunks and then pass the design to the vendor tools. This is no mean feat, but they don't need to verify a design and integrate it with software, as that is down to their end-customers. Communication applications are more involved, and take longer to get to production status, with military applications typically taking longer still. Thus, it may be that added revenue acceleration from Xilinx will begin to appear in the next few quarters. I guess that it is a bit early for Altera to reap many benefits of being part of Intel. Everyone knows that Intel is intent on retaining its supremacy in the Data Center by leveraging FPGAs for acceleration. The flip side could be that Altera has less attention for other markets -- only time will tell. I have a suspicion that my analysis of Microsemi underestimates its FPGA revenue, and the Lattice numbers may be too high. Neither company breaks out their numbers on a regular basis. Microsemi has a sharp focus on the security aspects of FPGAs in defence and aerospace which take a bit longer to design-in, but the projects stay in production for more years. Microsemi would benefit more than most from the proposed boost in the US defence budget. Some of the Lattice products get used in consumer applications, which are characterized by a rapid ramp up to high volume production with an equally steep decline. Lattice also has a strong offering in mid-range families. To round out the numbers, QuickLogic has seen a dramatic fall-off in revenue as its business is so heavily driven by a few projects in Samsung. The CEO still hopes that the company will break even by the end of 2017 to halt a long string of loss-making quarters. My guesstimate of "others" includes Achronix, which is still VC funded and so does not report its results. But wait... what is the winner of "Best FPGA of 2016"? Well everyone will have a different interpretation of what factors make a product "best," but -- for my money -- the most complex FPGA family rolled out last year has got to be the Virtex UltraScale+ family. That said, heaven only knows how long it will take a team to design and verify a device boasting 2.8M logic cells and 96 transceivers or the MPSoC with multiple processor cores supported by 600k Logic cells. What about you? Do you agree with my suggestion, or do you have your own suggestion for Best FPGA of 2016"?

Mac Anytime Soon An analysis of Intel's three-year financial guidance suggests that it expects to stay in Apple's notebook computers over that time frame. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 3:30PM Rumors are swirling that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may be on the verge of losing its spot as the supplier of the processors that power Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products. Hypotheses range from Apple's designing its own chip for the Mac to speculation that Apple will use chips from alternative processor vendors. However, I believe that based on Intel's recent commentary at its Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlikely that the company is going to lose these orders. Image source: Apple. Intel's CCG financial guidance If Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor orders, this would manifest as a reduction in the company's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue and operating profits. If we estimate that Apple pays an average of $200 for Intel processors and related components, then that's $4 billion in revenue that could potentially be at risk. Put another way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop significantly), then Intel could potentially see more than 10% of its CCG revenue vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world, but it's the sort of thing that would sting. At its investor day, Intel said that it expects its revenue in CCG to decline at a "low-single-digits" pace -- or an average of 1%-3% annually over the next three years. If we compound the low and high ends of that range, Intel is planning for between a 3% and a 9% decline in CCG revenue from 2016 levels by the end of 2019. Here's a translation to hard dollar figures: Intel is planning for CCG revenue to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3 billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the midpoint. At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in his investor meeting presentation that he expects the PC processor total addressable market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2 billion down from where the company pegged the total addressable market in 2016. Putting the numbers together If Intel expects the PC processor total addressable market to drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is planning for "low-single-digit" declines in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion decline at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the company is guiding for significant personal-computer processor revenue share loss. Now, it's worth noting that forecasts this long out aren't going to be perfect, but Intel likely has visibility into the personal-computer design win pipelines at its various customers, including Apple. If Apple were preparing to shift away from Intel processors for Macs released over the next couple of years, then Intel would likely be aware of that imminent shift and should have included that expectation in its multi-year forecast. Based on this analysis, I don't think Intel investors ought to worry too much about Apple's switching away from Intel processors anytime soon in its MacBook or iMac products. Over the long term, however, anything is possible, so Intel will have to make sure that it has an increasingly compelling product pipeline to keep Apple interested. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 3:00PM At this point, it's well-known that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is planning to release a fourth wave of products built using its 14-nanometer chip manufacturing technology, as the company's upcoming 10-nanometer technology continues to face yield and, therefore, cost structure challenges. The good news is that this fourth wave of 14-nanometer products is expected to feature both implementation and manufacturing technology improvements that should enable both higher performance and lower power consumption -- something that Intel's major customers (i.e., large personal computer vendors) will certainly appreciate. Intel's Fab 32. Image source: Intel. Here, I'd like to go over one additional way that Intel can improve the power efficiency of its next-generation platforms. Migrating the PCH to 14-nano tech Every Intel Core processor requires a separate support chip, known as a Platform Controller Hub (PCH), to function. Here's how Intel describes a PCH, also known as a chipset, in its most recent form 10-K filing (opens in PDF): A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and optical disc drives. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. The PCH can either be found as a separate chip mounted on the motherboard of the computer or it can reside on the same CPU package as the main processor itself. In applications that are more limited in power and space (e.g., thin and light notebooks and 2-in-1 notebook/tablet hybrids), the PCH is generally located on the CPU package, whereas less power/space sensitive applications (e.g., desktop computers) usually have the PCH as a stand-alone chip on the motherboard. The PCH for Intel platforms is usually built on manufacturing technology that's at least a generation behind what the main processor is using. These older manufacturing technologies are utilized for both cost reasons (older manufacturing technologies tend to be inexpensive) as well as to keep factories tooled to produce older-generation technologies busy (factory underutilization can hurt a company's gross profit margins). CPU generation Westmere (2010) Sandy Bridge (2011) Ivy Bridge (2012) Haswell (2013) Broadwell (2014) Skylake (2015) Kaby Lake (2016) CPU mfg. tech 32nm 32nm 22nm 22nm 14nm 14nm 14nm PCH mfg. tech 65nm 65nm 65nm 32nm 32nm 22nm 22nm Data source: Intel ARK. In the table above, you can see that Intel used its older 65-nanometer technology to build its PCH chips for years. It then skipped its 45-nanometer technology for PCH chips altogether before migrating its PCH chips to 32-nanometer for the Haswell/Broadwell generations. Then in 2015, it moved the PCH to its much more efficient 22-nanometer technology. These migrations to new manufacturing technologies helped the company to both reduce the power that its PCH chips consumed while at the same time allowing it to add more features and functionality. To that end, it could make sense for Intel to migrate the PCH chips for its next-generation processor families from the 22-nanometer technology that it uses today to its 14-nanometer technology. Do the logistics work out? It may seem like a good idea from a product capability perspective for Intel to build its next PCH chips on 14-nanometer technology rather than on 22-nanometer technology, but for this to be feasible, it needs to have planned its manufacturing capacity on various technology generations around such a transition. In particular, for this to be feasible, Intel needs to have significantly reduced the amount of 22-nanometer capacity that it has online right now, as those factories are being used to crank out the PCH chips for Intel's current notebook and desktop personal computer platforms. It also needs to have enough 14-nanometer capacity in place to handle the increased demand for 14-nanometer chips that such a migration would entail. I think that both conditions have been met. For example, Intel's Fab 28 in Israel is expected to be upgraded from being able to manufacture chips on the company's 22-nanometer technology to being its first 10-nanometer technology. This upgrade is likely to mean a significant reduction in its total 22-nanometer chip capacity. At the same time, BlueFin Research Partners recently said that the company's Fab 24 in Ireland has "reached full 14[-nanometer] capacity" and that Intel is "increasing their [sic] 14[-nanometer] product mix another 4-5% in the June quarter" at its Fab 32 in Arizona. (Fab 32 currently produces chips on the company's 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer technologies.) So, by the end of the year, Intel is likely to have significantly less 22-nanometer capacity in place, while it should have more 14-nanometer capacity as well as some 10-nanometer capacity online. Indeed, as it begins to shift its personal computer processors over to 10-nanometer at the end of the year (though the big shift away from 14-nanometer processors toward 10-nanometer processors isn't expected to happen until the second half of 2018), it'll need to keep its significant 14-nanometer capacity busy. Migrating the PCH chips to 14-nanometer in the second half of 2017 seems like a good way to both improve its next-generation products while also keeping its 14-nanometer production lines full.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Page 1 of 1. 20 Comments If all goes according to plan, Linus Torvalds will have announced the first release candidate of the upcoming Linux 4.11 kernel before the day is through. The Linux 4.11-rc1 release also marks the end of the feature merge window for this kernel cycle. So with that said, here is a look at the new features of the Linux 4.11 kernel that I have been covering through closely watching the Git repository and mailing list over the past two weeks. Highlights of the Linux 4.11 from our original coverage of the kernel developments this cycle include: DRM / Graphics: - AMDGPU power management continues to mature with Linux 4.11. Likely due to TTM memory management improvements, Linux 4.11 is faster for RADV Vulkan. - Intel has enabled frame-buffer compression by default for Skylake hardware and newer. - Intel's DRM driver also now handles DisplayPort MST audio. They added multi-stream transport capabilities a few kernels ago while this work is about allowing audio for DP MST displays. - Intel also has initial Geminilake graphics support. Geminilake SoCs will be shipping later this year. - The Nouveau DRM driver went through a Secure Boot code refactoring and based off that work NVIDIA even released the signed Pascal firmware for Pascal consumer cards along with code for bringing up accelerated support for the GeForce GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080. But that accelerated Pascal support isn't landing until Linux 4.12. - TinyDRM was merged for helping to make DRM drivers for small displays/devices. - ASPEED AST2500 display support. - Various other DRM driver and core updates. - Minor work done on FBDEV. Processors: - Intel's Turbo Boost Max 3.0 is better supported and will allow this boosting feature to operate on more systems/motherboards. - Support for a variety of new ARM SoCs and boards like the Banana Pi M64, SolidRun MACCHIATOBin, BCM958712DxXMC NorthStar2 developer board, and HiSilicon Kirin960/Hi3660 and HiKey960. There is also WeTek Hub and WeTek Play2 support. - A variety of KVM improvements. - OpenRISC optimizations. - PVHv2 support for Xen. - Tweaking to the Intel P-State driver. - TurboStat updates. File-Systems / Storage: - MD RAID optimizations. - XFS clean-ups. - EXT4 fixes. - Various block layer updates. - Some new F2FS functionality. - Fixes and optimizations for Btrfs. Other Hardware: - Power-saving PCI-E L1 PM substate support is exciting to see now supported under Linux. - New Raspberry Pi drivers. - Realtek ALC1220 is now supported, which is the codec used by many Intel Kabylake and AMD Ryzen motherboards. Thus with Linux 4.11 many of these newer motherboards will finally have working audio! - New input drivers for the Zeitech ZET6223 touchscreen and Samsung Touchkeys. - New media drivers for a variety of different STM, Marvell, Toshiba, and other brands. - EFI memory attributes table support. - Better Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM2) support. - Wacom Intuos Pro support. - A lot of networking updates. Other: - The new statx system call for providing enhanced file information and other benefits. - The Serial Device Bus was introduced, also known as SERDEV, although drivers aren't making use of this serial device bus until at least Linux 4.12. That's it for our highlights. If we missed anything interesting from the Linux 4.11 merge window, let us know in the forums! More Linux 4.11 benchmarks to come up shortly on Phoronix.

Technology 1 0 0 March 5, 2017 iMac 2017 Updates: AMD RYZEN 7 Chips To Beat Out Intel’s Kaby Lake Chips? Simon Alvarez There is probably no other product in Apple’s lineup that is in dire need of an update than the iMac. With marginal upgrades being rolled out for years, the time is high for the tech giant to focus its efforts on making its iconic all-in-one desktop computer competitive once more. Considering the rumors about the 2017 iMac, however, it appears that Apple might finally be putting some real effort on improving and updating its excellent, albeit neglected machine. Speculations are high that the iMac 2017 would feature Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors, which would give Apple’s all-in-one enough horsepower to make it extremely competitive in the market. However, AMD’s recent launch of its top-tier RYZEN 7 chips might put a damper on Intel and Apple’s partnership, according to a report from Architosh. This is due to the AMD RYZEN 7 series’ formidable performance per watt, with the chipmaker’s RYZEN 7 1800X setting a new record in benchmark tests. What was particularly remarkable, however, was how powerful AMD’s chip was per watt, which means that the RYZEN 7 was not only a capable processor, it was highly efficient as well. This particular combination of power and efficiency, in turn, makes the RYZEN 7 chips perfect for Apple’s computers. https://t.co/ZMcF2n9ErK : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017 Definitely On Apple's Cards; Here's Why It Should Be Worth….. pic.twitter.com/BWySGScbKg — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 27, 2017 The RYZEN 7 1800X chip that AMD tested was compared to Intel’s top-tier Core i7 processor, which is a formidable chip in its own right. While Intel’s Core i7 chip featured a TDP (thermal design point) of 140W, AMD’s RYZEN 7 1800X consumed a measly 95W. Compared to Intel’s chip, AMD’s processor was more than 30 percent more power-efficient while delivering even slightly better performance. This is not all, however, as the AMD RYZEN 7 1800X processor that was tested was only being sold by the chipmaker for a very reasonable price of $499, far less than the $1,089 demanded by Intel’s Core i7 chip. With its lower price, better performance and far better power efficiency in mind, there is a pretty good chance that Apple would break away from tradition and partner up with AMD for the iMac 2017’s processors instead. After all, being an all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac 2017 would benefit from low power consumption. Of course, these are but speculations for now, especially since Apple is yet to announce which processor it would utilize in the iMac 2017. Thus, it is best to take these speculations with a grain of salt. For now, however, it appears than AMD’s RYZEN 7 series is the best bet for the Cupertino-based tech giant. https://t.co/iOu7lgdAXp : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017: Apple Hard At Work To Deliver Unparalleled Desktop With Performance; Q1 2017 … pic.twitter.com/EYpmP4w3yL — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 12, 2017 Overall, rumors about the iMac 2017 are abounding, with speculations stating that the upcoming all-in-one would feature powerful internals that could rival the best in the industry. A PC Advisor report even stated that a Best Buy leak from last year has teased the specs of the iMac 2017 through a mistaken listing. Though the information displayed by Best Buy might have just been an honest mistake from the retailer, there is a good chance that some of the information featured in the listing are accurate. The Best Buy iMac leak listed the next-generation device as a powerhouse machine with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive. Coupled with a 27-inch 5K display, the iMac that was teased in the leak was pretty much a monster. The price of the device, listed at $3,199, also seemed to be in line with previous pricing conventions followed by the Cupertino-based tech giant. Official details about the iMac 2017 remain scarce, with Apple being highly secretive about the updated all-in-one’s progress. Nevertheless, expectations are high for the next iteration of the iconic machine. After all, with Apple seemingly preparing to retire its ubiquitous Mac Pro, there is a need for a powerful iMac 2017 to take its place. If rumors prove true about the upcoming all-in-one, the iMac 2017 might just be this year’s desktop computer to beat.

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook for 2017, and cover its likely design, tech specs, new features and UK pricing by Lewis Painter | 06 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the new 12-inch MacBook for 2017 be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? Apple released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, and almost a year on, we're looking to the future and what we could expect from this year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple didn't update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, which saw the launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Following that event Apple discontinued the 11in MacBook Air, a move that suggests that the 12-inch MacBook may soon replace the Air line-up as Apple's consumer-oriented Mac laptops, although the models are likely to see a price cut before that would happen. Read more: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals UK New MacBook 2017 release date UK: When is the new 12in MacBook coming out? When will Apple release the next-generation 12in MacBook for 2017? Will it launch at a spring Apple event? Apple launched the 2015 version of the 12in MacBook at a spring event that year, but that is no indication that Apple will do the same in 2017. The 2016 MacBook wasn't unveiled at Apple's 2016 spring event (which saw Apple reveal the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps). Instead, Apple quietly introduced the new MacBook a few weeks later in April 2016. We anticipate that the 2017 MacBook will see a similarly quiet launch. Nor do we expect to see a refreshed range in April to mark the current model's one year anniversary. We don't expect to see a 12-inch MacBook until the summer (June, or maybe July to coincide with WWDC). If Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is correct (as reported by MacRumors in January 2017) in his prediction that a new 12in MacBook is set to go into production in early Q2 2017 - April or thereabouts, a June or July launch could be feasible.  New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? It certainly looks like the MacBook Air's days are numbered. After its October 2016 event Apple removed the 11in MacBook Air from sale along with the legacy MacBook Pro with SuperDrive, which had been lurking in the Apple Store for some years. While the 13in MacBook Air remains, it hasn't been significantly updated since March 2015, apart from Apple's decision to offer as standard, 8GB RAM for all MacBook Air models (given that the range was so hampered by its 4GB RAM that we recommended anyone purchasing the computer to upgrade the RAM at point of purchase, this update was rightfully celebrated and long overdue). Another reason we may soon see the demise of the MacBook Air is that Apple's MacBook Air design is not as groundbreaking now as it was eight years ago when it launched. When the MacBook Air first arrived, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name, but the MacBook and MacBook Pro now outshine it in those areas. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. In terms of weight the MacBook Air weighs 1.35kg while the MacBook Pro now weighs only a fraction more at 1.37kg and the MacBook weighs just 0.92kg. If Apple continues to sell the MacBook Air maybe it should drop Air from it's name. It's not all bad though. The MacBook Air is both more powerful and £300 cheaper than the MacBook. It is the only Mac laptop that is available for less than £1000. For that reason we do still recommend it, although you might do better buying a refurbished MacBook Pro if you need a Mac that costs less than £1000. Given that the MacBook Air is Apple's lowest cost Mac laptop you'd think it would be its most popular model, and yet, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (back in 2015), the 12in MacBook is Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro. See more MacBook Air rumours here. So we think that the 13in MacBook Air will be replaced, but we don't think that will happen before the price of the MacBook and potentially the entry-level MacBook Pro, is reduced. History indicates that this will be the case: the last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was when the MacBook Air launched alongside the old white and black MacBooks. Those models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. We hope that the same will happen, with new 12in MacBook models being priced lower than they are currently and replacing the 13in MacBook Air as the entry level MacBook, while the more advanced specs will be provided by the 13in MacBook Pro. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive and underpowered. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Price While we're still some way ahead of the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it's a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. However, there is a possibility that Apple will reduce the price of the MacBook in 2017, especially if it discontinues the MacBook Air. With the demise of the 11in MacBook Air came a hike to the point of entry for consumers wishing to buy a Mac laptop. The entry price of Apple's MacBook Air laptop is now £949 (thanks in part to Apple's post-Brexit £100 increase, the model had previously cost £849). Before Apple discontinued it, an 11in MacBook Air had been priced at £749. In comparison, the entry-level MacBook Pro, with 2.0GHz dual-core processor and 256GB SSD costs £1,449, while the entry-level 12in MacBook with 1.1GHz m3 chip is £1,249. There is certainly a place for a lower cost Mac laptop and it would seem that for now the MacBook Air will fulfil that role. However, a reduction in price for the MacBook is possible, bringing it into line with the price of the MacBook Air currently. It's interesting to note here that the US prices, less influenced by currency fluctuations, are as follows:  12in MacBook - from $1,299 (£1,249) 13in MacBook Air - from $999 (£949) 13in MacBook Pro - from $1,499  (£1,449) If you ignore the somewhat confusing currently translations (it's not entirely fair to convert dollars to pounds as there is also VAT to add to the US prices, and there are other 'costs of doing business' to take account of - at least that's Apple's excuse) the price differences are roughly the same, with the MacBook being £300/$300 more than the Air, and the Pro being £200/$200 more than the MacBook. Reduce the MacBook price by £300/$300 and you have a new entry-level price that's below the magic £1000/$1000 mark. We don't expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air from the line up until it is willing to shave this much off the price of the MacBook. If it was to do so expect the entry-level MacBook to offer much slower processors and probably less storage than it does currently. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Processors The new MacBooks are likely to have Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Kaby Lake is the generation of chips after Skylake, and it offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. There is another interesting possibility with regards to processors. Back in September 2016 Dutch-language site Techtastic spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. The discovery was thought to indicate that Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its MacBooks. As it happens that's exactly what it did a month later with the launch of the MacBook Pro. In that case the chip powers the Touch Bar, but future ARM chips are being developed to look after other functions. The rumours continue: a Bloomberg report from February 2017 claims that Apple is working on a chip, codenamed T310, that will handle the "Power Nap"  functionality and improve the battery life of MacBooks. Whether this chip will end up in the MacBook remains to be seen. We think it's unlikely to make its debut on the next model as Apple is likely to save it for the next model of MacBook Pro. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook 2017 release date UK: RAM Currently the MacBook ships with 8GB RAM as standard. There is no option to increase RAM at point of sale, and the Mac is not user upgradable. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the new MacBooks will offer a 16GB of RAM option, up from 8GB of RAM in the 2016 models. Apple could upgrade the two current models to 16GB RAM and keep a 8GB option as a lower-priced model. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Design Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won't be seeing huge physical changes in 2017. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to sit alongside the Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Apple seems intent on marketing the MacBook alongside the iPhone and iPad, given the matching colour choices. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don't expect that to change dramatically in future. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Bigger Screen One possible change that we might see concerns the screen size. At present the MacBook is available in one size: 12 inches, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that a 15-inch model will be unveiled later this year. In a research note Kuo mentions a 15in MacBook that he believes will go into production in quarter four of 2017. However, this model is likely to be a MacBook Pro as it is said to feature 32GB RAM, so is definitely not the MacBook. Nevertheless, adding a bigger model to the range would make sense if Apple is planning to phase out the MacBook Air. Then Apple would offer 13in and 15in MacBook Pro models as well as 12in and 15in MacBook models (or perhaps 12in and 14in MacBook models as it used to do). New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Ports Will the new MacBook support Thunderbolt? When the MacBook launched in 2015 it featured USB Type-C and little else. While USB Type-C now supports Thunderbolt type 3 (which as exactly the same port), this early port didn't. Described by many as the one port to rule them all, the USB Type-C port and the Thunderbolt 3 port is identical, so any device using either standard can be plugged into it. Rather than suggesting that USB-C means death to Thunderbolt, it rather suggests that the standard has been given new life, indeed, now in addition to the MacBook Pro, many PCs support Thunderbolt too. There's good reason to support Thunderbolt 3. The standard allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of Thunderbolt 2 (and it's backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 2). Whether a MacBook user really needs Thunderbolt is another question though, with it being a standard utilised in video production and other high power applications.  Nevertheless, we expect that the new MacBook will feature the new USB Type-C port and therefore it will support Thunderbolt 3. Given Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since Thunderbolt's introduction in 2011 it is unlikely to fall out of favour with the company. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. Another reason Apple could turn it's back on Thunderbolt is if it stopped using Intel processors in its Macs. Intel is the company behind Thunderbolt and it requires an Intel processor to work... It's not a completely crazy idea, there have been rumours that Apple could ditch Intel in favour of its own chip production. Indeed, the company is already said to be working on its own chips with ARM, these chips would take care of certain functions, just like the Apple T1 chip in the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: LTE Will the 2017 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if this patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satellite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it would tie the user down to a particular carrier.  New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Keyboard Will the 2017 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? According to a 9to5Mac report in October 2016, Apple has been in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Trackpad Will the 2017 MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if another patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was approved in May 2016, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad. Thinking of buying a Mac? Read our Which Mac? Best Mac buyers guide.

Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017).

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 8:45AM At Mobile World Congress, China-based mobile chip vendor Spreadtrum announced a new chip dubbed the SC9861G-IA, targeted at the "global mid-level and premium smartphone market." The chip is unique for a couple of reasons. The first is that it uses eight of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Atom-based processor cores codenamed Airmont. The second is that it is built by Intel using its 14-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Spreadtrum says that the chip "is scheduled to go into mass production in the second quarter of 2017," which suggests availability in shipping devices at some point in the second half of 2017.  Image source: Spreadtrum via PCQuest. Interestingly, this product isn't being pitched as a co-branded/co-developed chip from both Spreadtrum and Intel; instead, it is pitched as a Spreadtrum product that is manufactured by Intel's contract chip manufacturing division, known as Intel Custom Foundry (ICF). In this column, I'd like to do two things: what this chip could mean for Intel and what the potential long-term implications of this announcement could be for both companies. Near term? Don't expect significant success In the near term, I doubt that this chip will find significant success in either the mid-range or premium smartphone markets. The processor cores are quite slow currently for a mid-range smartphone, let alone a premium product. To put this into perspective, the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 652 achieves a single-core score of 1467 in the popular Geekbench 4 performance test. Spreadtrum says that the Airmont CPU core inside the SC9861G-IA runs at 2GHz. Based on how other Airmont-based chips perform in Geekbench 4, the Spreadtrum chip is likely to be way behind the competing Snapdragon 652 in per-core performance. From a user-experience perspective, the Spreadtrum chip looks as though it'll be markedly inferior to the competing Snapdragon 652 chip. In addition to being slower than the competition, at least in CPU tasks, I'd expect that this Spreadtrum chip will be less desirable to potential customers because it runs Intel Architecture (a.k.a. x86) rather than the ARM architecture. Although Intel invested significantly in bringing up the software ecosystem around Intel Architecture, it still doesn't appear to be as robust as the incumbent ARM ecosystem, which could lead to app compatibility and/or performance issues. I just don't know why a smartphone vendor would pick this chip over something from Qualcomm, MediaTek, or even from elsewhere in Spreadtrum's portfolio. Taking a longer-term view At the Intel Developer Forum last year, Intel announced that it had inked a deal with ARM Holdings to make its intellectual property available for customers designing chips to be manufactured by ICF. I suspect that Spreadtrum will cease using Intel's Atom processor cores for future ICF-built chips going forward. Instead, I expect Spreadtrum to use ARM cores optimized for Intel's manufacturing technology. If Spreadtrum can, using ARM technology, fully leverage Intel's manufacturing technology to build great mobile processors, then that could ultimately prove to be a long-term "win" for both Spreadtrum and Intel. Intel would win because Spreadtrum is a reasonably successful mobile processor vendor, and if it can get Spreadtrum to move significant volumes of its products into Intel's manufacturing plants, then that's revenue and profit upside for Intel. Spreadtrum could win if Intel's claims that its manufacturing technology is superior to competing technologies hold up and ultimately allow Spreadtrum to build better and more cost-effective chips than it could have using alternative technologies.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Matthew Jones, 49, experienced high altitude sickness close to Base Camp and died on Friday. A post-mortem has been conducted and his body will be returned to Australia once the required paperwork is complete with the help of embassy staff and friends who were trekking with him, Pardip Karki, manager of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal, told Reuters. The father of two from Melbourne has been fondly remembered by colleagues at tech company Intel. Managing director Kate Burleigh said in a statement that Mr Jones had worked at Intel for 16 years and tributes from customers and colleagues he knew around the world were flowing in. "Matt was truly one of a kind who will be greatly missed. The Intel team is mourning the loss of our friend and colleague," she said. Mr Jones was travelling in a group of 18 people heading for Khumjung when he became sick on Thursday night and decided to stay behind in a hotel, a spokesman for Eastern Region Police in Nepal said on Monday. "He was having problems due to the altitude, that's why he didn't go on," the spokesman told AAP. "Early in the morning he was found dead in his room." Ms Burleigh said Mr Jones had a highly successful career at Intel where he was a leader across many sectors of the business, most recently in telecommunications. "He was a unique character and will be remembered for not only his great work ethic and leadership but also his sharp wit and passion for good wine, fancy dress parties, history, travel and 'vexillology' (the study of flags)," she said. Intel said it was providing support to the wife and children of Mr Jones. "We ask that you respect the family's wishes and let them mourn in private at this time." The Everest base camp is more than 5km above sea level and climbers rest there for several days to acclimatise before tackling the mountain, but Mr Jones had not been planning to go higher. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular advice over the Australian man's death.

Here's our AMD Ryzen 1800X review. For value, the Ryzen 7 1800X cannot be beaten right now By Jim Martin | 06 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Specifications 14nm x86 processor Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base clock 4.0GHz boost clock (4.1GHz with XFR) 95W TDP See full specs Expert's Rating Price when reviewed £499, US$499 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review Although AMD never stopped selling processors for desktop PCs, it has felt an awful lot like it did for the last few years. Intel has so dominated the market at all levels, from budget machines right up to the most expensive enthusiast rigs, that there was really no point in choosing a PC with an AMD processor. We won't go into it here, but you can read more about AMD's history. But with the launch of Ryzen, that has all changed. We’re reviewing the range-topping 1800X here, but there are two other Ryzen 7 chips on sale now, and two Ryzen 5 chips which are launching in a couple of months. See also: Ryzen release date, price and specifications AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Price Here’s how the range looks at the moment, but AMD will add more models over time. You can buy the three Ryzen 7 chips from Overclockers UK. Most come with one of AMD's three new CPU coolers, but not the top two models. It's assumed you will have your own already, or want to use a high-end liquid-cooling system. It's worth noting, too, that AM3 and FM2+ "clip style" coolers are compatible with Socket AM4. Product Line Model Cores / Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) TDP (Watts) Included Cooler Price Ryzen 7 1800X 8 / 16 3.6 4.0 95 N/A £499 / $499 Ryzen 7 1700X 8 / 16 3.4 3.8 95 N/A £399 / $399 Ryzen 7 1700 8 / 16 3.0 3.7 65 Wraith Spire £329 / $329 Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 3.6 4.0 TBC Wraith Spire TBC Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 3.5 3.7 TBC Wraith Spire TBC Note: These chips are not APUs like AMD’s other A-series CPUs. This means that they do not have built-in graphics chips. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Features and design Four years ago AMD realised it needed to completely redesign its CPU in order to compete with Intel, and began developing what we now know as the ‘Zen’ architecture. The Ryzen 7 1800X is the current flagship consumer CPU based on Zen, and is an eight-core processor that runs at 3.6GHz (up to 4.1GHz with a suitable cooler – more on this later). AMD has gone down the same route as Intel and now uses Simultaneous MultiThreading (SMT) rather than the Clustered MultiThreading (CMT) that its older processors used. We’re not going to go into the deep technical details here because what really matters is whether the Ryzen 1800X is good value, and whether you should buy one. But before we do that, we need to explain a few other things about the new features AMD has put into Ryzen. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Socket AM4 First, Ryzen is not going to fit into any existing AMD motherboard. That’s hardly surprising, given that this is truly a “clean-sheet” design. So you’ll need a new motherboard which has an AM4 socket with 1331 pins. AMD says you’ll be able to upgrade processors with an AM4 socket until 2020, barring any technology advances which require a physical change to the pinouts, such as PCI Express 4 or DDR5 RAM. Ryzen is more of a system-on-a-chip (SoC) like smartphone processors, which means the actual chipset on an AM4 motherboard is relatively basic. There are eight to choose between, but the most common are likely to be the B350 and X370. The former is the more mainstream offering which allows overclocking, while the latter is aimed at enthusiasts who want the maximum number of features on their board. These new boards, such as the Asus Crosshair VI Hero X370 that we used for testing the 1800X, have the latest features such as PCIe gen 3, an M.2 slot for the latest NVMe SSDs, USB 3.1 gen 2 ports and support for DDR4 RAM. Ryzen CPUs have a total of 24 PCIe lanes. This isn’t as many as Intel’s top chipsets offer, but it’s enough. 16 lanes are dedicated to the graphics card, and the rest are for the motherboard maker to use for I/O and things such as NVMe SSDs. If you do go for an X370 motherboard and want to run dual graphics cards, note that each will have to use 8 PCIe lanes. Similarly, if you must use multiple NVMe drives simultaneously, you may be better off with Intel’s Broadwell-E and the X99 chipset. But you’d better have deep pockets, as such as setup does not come cheap. This, ultimately, is where Ryzen delivers its knock-out blow: for the vast majority of PC enthusiasts, the Ryzen 7 chips offer plenty of performance, along with great efficiency, at a much lower price. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: SenseMI One of Ryzen’s really clever features is a grid of super-accurate sensors across the silicon which act much like the telemetry on an F1 car. They feed back power and temperature data so that the chip can adjust its speed based on conditions. SenseMI is the name for a group of five technologies which AMD says ultimately give Ryzen the edge. Precision Boost: Using the sensors, the chip can finely adjust its speed on the fly in 25MHz increments. It will increase or decrease speed based on temperature, load and current. Pure Power: Similar to the boosting, the same sensors are used to adjust the CPU’s power consumption for a given task. Since each chip is very slightly different from every other at the silion level, the data from the sensors means each chip can optimise its power usage individually. Extended Frequency Range (XFR): Only Ryzen chips with model numbers ending in ‘X’ support XFR. This is basically automatic overclocking and allows the chip to boost beyond the usual top frequency if the data from the sensors show that there is ‘headroom’ to run faster. Essentially, if you have a good cooling system which keeps temperatures down, you’ll see an extra 100MHz, so 4.1GHz instead of 4GHz with a Ryzen 1800X. Neural Net Prediction: This is an artificial intelligence neural network that learns to predict what an application will do based on past runs, and queues up instructions so they can be executed quicker. Smart Prefetch: Pretty much the same as neural net prediction, but for data rather than CPU instructions. Sophisticated learning algorithms track software behaviour to anticipate what data will be needed, and load it into the Ryzen’s caches so it’s ready when called for. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Performance But enough about features and technology. The bottom line is: how fast does it go? The short answer is fast, and certainly in line with AMD’s claims. Intel hasn’t released an eight-core Kaby Lake processor yet, which is why the main comparison is with the Core i7-6900K. The i7-7700K is the top Kaby Lake chip right now, and that’s a quad-core, eight-thread chip. It’s also the same price as the Ryzen 7 1700, which has the full complement of eight cores, 16 threads. The 1800X isn’t always faster than the i7-6900K, so in pure performance terms, AMD hasn’t conclusively stolen the crown from Intel. But if you look not at absolute speed, but bang-per-buck, you’re getting what amounts to basically the same performance in most scenarios for half the cash. This fact will undoubtedly force Intel to make big price cuts to its six- and eight-core CPUs, and we’re already hearing rumours that it has already done so. We’ll have to wait a bit until we see retailers passing on the savings, though. Single-core performance isn’t where Ryzen’s strength lies: it’s roughly on a par with Intel Haswell chips, but as soon as you use an application or game which can use Ryzen’s large number of cores, it accelerates away from any same-price chip from Intel (and matches those costing a lot more). You can see this illustrated in the Geekbench results below - an overclocked Core i5-7600K is faster than a stock Ryzen 1800X in the single-core test, but the Ryzen kills it in multi-core. Also, note the massive lead that Ryzen holds in the Cinebench rendering test. The graphs below show how the Ryzen 1800X stacks up against the most recent Kaby Lake PC we've reviewed, the Overclockers UK Titan Bayonet. This uses an i5-7600K overclocked to 4.7GHz on air and a GTX 1070. Overall, it's a similar price (around £1600) to our Ryzen test rig, hence the comparison. Note that our rig had a GTX 1080, but the results below focus on CPU, not GPU performance, of course. Our colleagues at our sister title PC World benchmarked two Ryzen chips against Intel's top chips (the systems here are fitted with 32GB of RAM and GTX 1080 graphics cards - read more and see more test results here). Most of the results above are self-explanatory, and are what we would expect. However, in many games right now it seems that you will get better performance if you have a high-end Intel chip. AMD says this is down to the fact that games are currently optimised for Intel processors, but developers are working to optimise for Ryzen as quickly as they can to take full advantage of the extra cores and threads on offer.  But, you have to bear in mind that the Ashes of the Singularity test was run at 1080p at low quality settings in order to look at CPU performance and take the GPU out of the equation. In the real world, you're not going to do that, and the Tomb Raider results - at Ultimate quality - show that all you'll get very similar results regardless of which of these four CPUs you have. Overclocking In theory you should be able to get even more performance for free by overclocking a Ryzen chip. This is something AMD has been keen to point out at every opportunity: all Ryzen chips are unlocked and, when paired with the right motherboard, can be overclocked at will. There’s even a new tool, Ryzen Master, which you can download and use to set up four different overclocking profiles. Of course, you’ll have to agree to the big disclaimer that you’ll void your warranty if you do overclock as there is potential to damage the chip and other hardware if you don’t know what you’re doing (or if you push frequencies or voltages too high). We couldn’t do much with our air-cooled system, being supplied with a Noctua NH-U12S by AMD for testing. Still, we did see XFR in action on occasion, with the frequency jumping to 4.1GHz in CPU-Z while temperatures were low enough. However, the chip was reluctant to go much beyond this and we suspect you’ll need a liquid cooling system to get the most from Ryzen. It runs fairly hot even when idling, sitting around 60 degrees C with the Noctua, and an additional 120mm fan extracting hot air from the case. Intel chips – in PCs we’ve reviewed recently – appear to be more accommodating to overclocking on air cooling. AMD Ryzen 1800X: Specs 14nm x86 processor Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base clock 4.0GHz boost clock (4.1GHz with XFR) 95W TDP 14nm x86 processor Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base clock 4.0GHz boost clock (4.1GHz with XFR) 95W TDP OUR VERDICT Right now, the Ryzen 7 1800X is proof that AMD is back on form. Although it hasn’t knocked Intel off the top spot for outright performance – and certainly not for single-core applications - it has set new standards for value and efficiency. It will surely prompt game and app developers to optimise their software for eight-core chips, and there is certainly more performance to come from Ryzen. If you’re thinking of buying or building a high-end PC right now, a Ryzen 7 chip is the obvious choice.

GOP leaders are hoping to get the bill through committee and to the House floor before the end of this month, giving the Senate enough time to take up the proposal before the Easter recess in mid-April. House Republican leadership aides are presenting a unified front with the White House, citing weekend work to smooth out differences, including a Friday staff meeting at the White House led by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and a Saturday call with House Speaker Paul Ryan, E&C Chairman Greg Walden, Mulvaney, HHS Secretary Tom Price and others. Go-to guy: Mulvaney, a founding House Freedom Caucus member, is being described by some as the White House’s point man on the Obamacare repeal, supplanting HHS Secretary Price (See this Trump deep dive from the Washington Post’s Philip Rucker, Robert Costa and Ashley Parker: http://wapo.st/2mtX1Dn.) Giving Mulvaney a lead role could help placate angry conservatives who have promised to vote against the bill in recent weeks. Outside noise: Conservative groups including Heritage Action, the Club for Growth and Freedom Partners are “pushing lawmakers to buck House Speaker Paul Ryan and oppose the Republican blueprint.” Michelle Hackman for the Wall Street Journal: http://on.wsj.com/2lO0l7S The big question remains: Will conservatives go along with the final proposal? GOP hardliners have panned the refundable tax credits as “Obamacare lite.” But the most recent draft, leaked late last week, still included individual tax credits based on age, Paul Demko reports.

Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Dems. King held a marathon town hall fielding questions about Gorsuch Sunday night in Portland. And although he didn’t tip his hand on how he feels about the SCOTUS nominee, King did drop hints about how he could eventually get to “yes” on Gorsuch, Seung Min reports from Portland. “Whatever else you can say about him, my sense from his record is, he’s exceedingly independent,” King said at the end of a nearly four-hour listening session in a packed University of Southern Maine auditorium. "He’s a real stickler for limits on executive power,” King added, calling that a particularly important trait in the Trump-era.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Senate Intel Committee member who flew down to Florida with Trump on Air Force One Friday, said he’d seen “no evidence” to back up Trump’s claims. Democrats went further, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying “the president is in trouble” for making the wiretapping accusations. Coming attractions: House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, a Trump ally, said his committee will look into Trump’s claims as part of its larger Russia probe. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intel panel, will be meeting with officials this week for an “unprecedented look” at intelligence related to the probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 7:30AM Analysts with BlueFin Research Partners recently warned that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) next-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, which is scheduled to go into mass production in the second half of 2017, could be delayed by several months because of yield-rate issues. According to statements that Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala made to PC World, even Intel's top brass aren't completely confident in the public launch schedule of its first 10-nanometer product, code-named Cannonlake. Image source: Intel. The word "if" Intel has previously said that it intends to begin shipping Cannonlake chips for low-power notebooks and notebook/tablet hybrid devices by the "end of this year and really ramp into 2018." Renduchintala made the following statement to PC World: "If Cannonlake comes out at the end of the year, it'll be interesting what we actually market it as. We haven't decided yet." Notice that Renduchintala didn't use the word "when" but "if," signaling doubt that the company will manage to launch the product as expected. This jibes with BlueFin's commentary, in which the analysts say that Intel is both facing poor manufacturing yields and that it hasn't "locked down the complete process of records (PORs) to date." What BlueFin is saying with respect to PORs is this: Intel has yet to lock down the final manufacturing recipe for its 10-nanometer technology -- it's still making potentially significant changes to the manufacturing technology itself. The development of Intel's 10-nanometer technology appears to be quite troubled, and Renduchintala's apparent lack of confidence that the company will even launch the Cannonlake chip this year is yet more evidence of this.  Intel dodged a bullet by doing a fourth wave on 14-nanometer Intel's 10-nanometer process appears to be in extremely poor shape. The good news, though, is that Intel wisely decided to build a "fourth wave" of products based on its current 14-nanometer technology to service the market between late 2017 through either late 2018 or early 2019. The Cannonlake chips that Renduchintala is referring to aren't designed to address the entire personal computer market -- just a subset of it. Chips based on the company's proven 14-nanometer technology should address the bulk of the market and allow Intel to meet its customer commitments.  Indeed, Renduchintala told PC World that Intel's goal is to deliver "a yearly cadence of platform upgrade that actually gives meaningful performance improvements from the generation that preceded it." Had Intel not begun cooking up a new generation of parts on its 14-nanometer technology, it would have likely been stuck selling its current seventh-generation Core processors with no significant performance and/or feature improvements generation-on-generation. That would be bad for Intel's customers who rely on Intel to put out new processors so that they can sell updated systems with those new processors as key marketing points -- and bad for Intel itself. Renduchintala's mentality vis-a-vis products and manufacturing is now one of pragmatism. He told PC World that the company will "be focused more on the generation by the amount of performance increment that it will give [Intel]" and even said that he doesn't believe that "[product] generations will be tagged to [manufacturing] node transition." Now, to make all this work, Intel's manufacturing group will still need to improve the performance and efficiency of its manufacturing technologies each year. However, it is generally easier to improve the performance/power characteristics of a pre-existing manufacturing technology than it is to try to move to an all-new technology that brings a significant chip-area reduction compared to the prior generation.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - RTS110BK Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email WASHINGTON -- The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: -Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. -Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. -An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. -A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. -A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. -His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly - the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 - after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I - bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching - much less exceeding - the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home - from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. © 2017 The Associated Press.

It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday March 7, 2017 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode Tributes for 'one of a kind' Melbourne father who died climbing Everest Aisha Dow 6 Mar 2017, 11:12 p.m. A Melbourne father-of-two and tech professional who died on Mount Everest last week has been remembered as "truly one of a kind". A Melbourne father-of-two and tech professional who died on Mount Everest last week has been remembered as "truly one of a kind". Matthew Jones passed away while trekking in Nepal. Fairfax Media has been told he was not attempting to reach the summit, but was among the tens of thousands of tourists who every year trek to Everest base camp, mostly without incident. Mr Jones had a successful career at multinational tech company, Intel, and on Monday tributes were flowing in from around the world. Intel Australia's managing director Kate Burleigh said no words could express the void Mr Jones would leave behind. "He was a unique character and will be remembered for not only his great work ethic and leadership but also his sharp wit and passion for good wine, fancy dress parties, history, travel and 'vexillology' [the study of flags] ," she said. "Matt was truly one of a kind who will be greatly missed. The Intel team is mourning the loss of our friend and colleague." It is understood Mr Jones reached base camp on Friday, but started experiencing breathing difficulties upon his descent. He reportedly died the next day. Local media have said a 49-year-old Australian man died at Lobuche village, located just below base camp, at 4940 metres above sea level, after likely falling ill with altitude sickness. They reported he had been staying at the Madan Hotel in Pheruche of Khumjung-7, in the Solukhumbu district. In a statement, Intel said it was providing "support in this difficult time to Matthew's wife and family". "We ask that you respect the family's wishes and let them mourn in private at this time. " A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would only say the department was aware of the death of an Australian man in Nepal. "We stand ready to offer consular assistance in accordance with the consular services charter," DFAT said in a statement.

Surface Book vs. Porsche Design Book One: A specs comparison We take a close look at what the specs say about these shiny, premium PCs. Melissa Riofrio (PC World (US online)) on 06 March, 2017 22:30 0 - - - - print email Ooh. Shiny. When Porsche Design unveiled its Book One at Mobile World Congress, Microsoft’s premium Surface Book finally had a rival for Best Trophy Laptop—the one you buy not because you need it, but because you can afford the best. We haven’t tested the Book One yet—it doesn’t ship until April—but we can compare its specs to those of the Surface Book closest in price and specs. Run through the list with us and see if you agree on which device is most drool-worthy. Price Both models come in at the high end for a mainstream laptop: Book One: $2,495 Surface Book: $2,699 Case material, dimensions, and weight Melissa Riofrio With all the PC parts in the display, the Porsche Design Book One naturally has vents along the screen’s sides. Higher-end laptops eschew plastic for lighter, tougher, and more prestigious materials. The Book One is thinner overall, but not lighter, and not without further compromise. Book One: Anodized aluminum in a matte, silvery finish. It measures 12.26 x 8.9 x 0.63 inches and weighs 3.77 pounds. Surface Book: Magnesium in a matte, silvery finish. It measures 12.3 x 9.14 x 0.51-0.9 inches (because of the hinge—more on that later) and weighs 3.63 pounds. The hinge and display mechanisms Melissa Riofrio Automotive gears inspired the 360-degree hinge between the display and keyboard on the Porsche Design Book One Laptop hinges are a challenge. Most designs have the top half roll a bit behind the bottom half when opened. A piano hinge keeps the display half above the keyboard half. Both the Book One and the Surface Book offer innovative hinges to accommodate their detachable displays—and add to their cachet as premium laptops. Melissa Riofrio When you separate the Porsche Design Book One’s keyboard from its display, a slender top slice with small tabs remains. The Book One is the only laptop available with both a 360-degree hinge and a detachable display. Its two VarioGear hinges consist of two stainless steel, gear-like cogs inspired by automotive mechanics. They roll over each other and also tilt to keep the laptop’s two halves in smooth contact. A small, plastic part called the "intelligent distance ring" manages the tilt, though aesthetically it seems out of place among these shiny gears. A small button on the laptop’s right side detaches the display, leaving behind a slender bar with insertion tabs. Gordon Mah Ung Microsoft calls this a Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge. The Surface Book’s Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge is even more complicated, with an articulated structure and a Muscle Wire Lock mechanism to release the display (which Microsoft calls the Clipboard). What some people don’t like is the hinge’s broad bend, which makes the Surface Book nearly an inch thick on that side. Operating system Both offer Windows 10 Pro, which is a good thing, as you get more control over system settings. CPU, RAM, and storage The Book One has an advantage here. It comes with Intel’s 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Core i7-7500U, a dual-core chip that runs at 2.7GHz up to 3.5GHz. It has 16GB of LPDDR3 memory running at 1,866MHz, and a 512GB PCIe SSD. The Surface Book line is still on Intel’s 6th-generation Skylake CPUs. This model has a dual-core Core i7-6600U that runs at 2.6GHz to 3.4GHz. It comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Graphics This is the one place where the Book One made a hard choice, going with Intel’s integrated HD Graphics 620—a solid performer for mainstream use, and probably the only viable choice given how thin the Book One is. It’s just that when the Porsche name is attached to something, it’s natural to expect speedier discrete graphics to be part of the package. The Surface Book in this comparison is a fall 2016 refresh using Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 965M, which alternates with integrated Intel HD 520 graphics. Of course, including this discrete GPU in the keyboard base (the Intel HD 520 is in the Clipboard) means the Surface Book is thicker and probably runs hotter than the Book One. Gordon Mah Ung Microsoft’s Surface Book has a high-resolution PixelSense display. Display Both of these laptops offer top-notch screens. Just remember that high-resolution displays demand more processing power and battery life. The Book One has a 13.3-inch QHD+ (3200x1800) IPS display with an LED backlight and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The 10-point multitouch display uses Gorilla Glass 4. The Surface Book has a 13.5-inch PixelSense IPS display with a 3000x2000 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio, plus 10-point multitouch. Keyboard, touchpad, and pen Melissa Riofrio Of course the pen that comes with the Porsche Design Book One is also a high-end design, made of aluminum. These are the parts you’ll use most often. On laptops this expensive, they’d better be good. The Surface Book’s Chiclet-style keyboard features 19mm pitch and 1.6mm of travel, which delivered a pleasant typing experience during our review. We have no specs on the Book One’s keyboard. At the press briefing, I typed briefly on one of the demo models and it felt fine, but we’d obviously need to use it more to make a fuller determination.  Both models use Microsoft’s Precision Touchpad. Not surprisingly, it’s designed to work well with Windows 10 and offers multigesture controls that expand what traditional touchpads can do. Both models come with aluminum pens that attach magnetically to the side of the display and have one flat side so they won't roll away. The Book One Pen, which is made by Wacom, has 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity. It weighs 0.67 ounce (19 grams) with its AAAA battery installed. Porsche Design says the battery should last about 7.5 months, assuming about three hours of use per day. Peter Ruecktenwald The new Surface Pen has interchangeable nibs for a choice of writing or drawing feel. The Surface Book’s Surface Pen has been through a few iterations and now offers four different colors, but just 1,024 levels of pressure. It weighs 0.7 ounce (20 grams) with its AAAA battery. It comes with a Pen Tip Kit, making it more customizable than the Book One Pen, and its pen clip also makes it a little more practical. Camera and audio Both laptops have dual microphones to optimize voice interaction with Windows 10’s Cortana, plus dual speakers. Both have front 5MP cameras and infrared cameras for Windows Hello. The Surface Book also has an 8MP rear-facing camera. Ports The Book One has one USB 3.1 Type C port and two USB 3.0 Type A ports in the keyboard dock, plus a microSD card reader. The display has a USB 3.1 Type C Thunderbolt port. The Surface Book could use an update. Its current model has no USB-C, just two USB 3.0 Type A ports and an SD card slot, plus mini DisplayPort. Battery The Book One offers a generous 70Wh total of battery capacity, split between 25Wh in the display and 45Wh in the keyboard dock. The total runtime is up to 14 hours per Porsche Design (your mileage will vary), and it can charge to full in less than two hours. The Surface Book’s battery is even huger, and similarly split: 62Wh in the keyboard base and 18Wh in the Clipboard. It lasts up to 12 hours by Microsoft’s account, factoring in, of course, greater battery use by the discrete GPU. What the specs say Specs can take us only so far in judging one laptop over another. What we can say is that while the Surface Book’s discrete GPU is a compelling part, it’s surrounded by an older CPU and a few other aging components. The Book One’s integrated graphics is nothing exciting, but it’s a fresher build that would probably work fine except for gaming or workstation applications. We’ll be able to say for sure once we’ve tested it. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. Related Coverage Pence jokes with 'enemy of the people' at Gridiron Dinner White House aides defend Trump's wiretapping claim Afghan family detained in Los Angeles are asking for release You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama's time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: -Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. -Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. -An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. -A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama's presidency. -A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. -His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly - the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission "was started before I got here," Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." THE FACTS: That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services." The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants' children "are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population." This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the "long-run fiscal impact" of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive "if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account." ___ TRUMP: "We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price" of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 - after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company's CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "I don't see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this." ___ TRUMP: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump's term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer "one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn't come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: "Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force." THE FACTS: That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation's unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: "Our Navy is now the smallest it's been since, believe or not, World War I. Don't worry. It's going to soon be the largest it's been." THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it's been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I - bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a "peace dividend" from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump's military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching - much less exceeding - the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It's unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home - from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center." THE FACTS: It's unclear what Justice Department data he's citing, but the most recent government information doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It's true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that's no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world." THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world's best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy's top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world's finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson's main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. "We will not be able to 'buy' our way out of the challenges that we face," he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Ford at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) Posted: Monday, March 6, 2017 2:38 am AP FACT CHECK: Trump takes credit where it's not deserved Associated Press | WASHINGTON (AP) — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama's time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: —Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. —Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama's presidency. —A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission "was started before I got here," Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." THE FACTS: That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services."

I'm not going to talk about Intel as an investment. However, as the largest semiconductor company, with 98% market share in datacenter processors and a leader in process technology, there is plenty to take a look at. Anything in "quotes" means that it is a verbatim quote from either the presenter or the presentation during the morning. Client Computing and Datacenter Historically, Intel has used the chips for its highest-volume PC products to drive its process technology. These days, that means what Intel calls all-in-one devices. These basically compress all the functionality of a desktop PC into a very compact form factor. There were two reasons for doing this. The first is that these were the highest-volume products. It is one of the truisms of semiconductor manufacturing that if you want to get a high yield, then you have to run a lot of wafers. The second reason is that the chips were not excessively large (with regard to area). Very large chips yield poorly for defect density reasons, so running very large chips on an immature process is expensive. Click here to read more ...

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. —Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. Advertisement —Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. —A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

As promised, we're back to follow up on our initial 1080p testing with a more in-depth look at Ryzen's gaming performance across a 16 titles played at 1080p and 1440p resolutions. In addition to including more games, we're also adding results for the 1800X and 1700X with SMT disabled as Anandtech forum-goers have discovered a problem with the Windows 10 scheduler that can cause Ryzen to perform worse in lightly-threaded applications with SMT enabled. Apparently Windows 10 treats all Ryzen threads the same (not identifying SMT from physical cores) and thus the operating system thinks all threads have access to their own L2 and L3 cache when in fact they don't. To start with a clean slate for this test, I built a brand new test system using the Gigabyte X370 Gaming 5 motherboard and EK XLC Predator 240 all-in-one liquid cooler for good measure. The Gaming 5 was updated with the latest F3 BIOS revision and my Corsair DDR4 memory was running at 1.5GHz for a double data rate of 3000 mega transfers per second. With all of that being the case, we should be showing Ryzen in the best possible light as it exists today and this is indeed the performance you can expect to see if you invest in one of AMD's new processors. Ahead are the results from 16 games tested at two resolutions on 11 different processors (plus the two configurations sans SMT), making for a total of 416 results from at least 1,250 individual benchmark runs. Gathering all this data took around four full days of work and let's just say I'm thankful I had the foresight to test Intel's processors before Ryzen arrived...

The Division, Hitman, Civ VI, Overwatch Starting with Tom Clancy's: The Division, we find a rather severe GPU bottleneck (even at 1080p) when using the ultra quality settings. Of course it's not until we look at the dual-core Intel chips or the AMD FX-8370 that we start to see performance fall away ever so slightly. As you would expect, the 1440p results look much the same: the dual-core Intel chips catch up for the average frame rate, but are still lacking slightly when looking at the minimum. Needless to say, the Ryzen CPUs all do well here. Using DirectX11 for testing, the Ryzen CPUs are similar to the Core i7-5960X which makes them a good bit slower than the 6900K, 6700K and 7700K, though AMD's new chips still did slightly better than the unlocked Core i5 Skylake and Kaby Lake CPUs. Disabling SMT support doesn't have much of an impact on performance here though it did afford us an extra frame or two. Moving to 1440p shows some interesting changes in the results, though they are mostly expected. As the system's GPU becomes the performance-limiting factor, the margins between CPUs narrows. The 1800X for example is now just 11% slower than the 6900K where as it was 19% slower at 1080p. Overall, strong performance from Ryzen CPUs here as they roughly match the 5960X. The Civilization VI numbers might seem surprising but AMD's own review guide showed Ryzen to be quite a bit down on performance here in relation to the Intel CPUs. Still the performance was far from poor as the 1800X was just 10% slower than the 6900K at 1080p and just 7% slower for the minimum result. Jumping to 1440p, the results don't change much: the 1800X is still 10% slower than the 6900K which is obviously a commendable effort and a solid result for AMD. I changed my methodology a bit for testing Overwatch. I now run a 12-player bot match while spectating. The bots are set to easy and I only used the "Zarya" hero and the "Ilios" map. When the bots begin battling I start the test which runs for 5 minutes and as always the average results from three runs are reported. This is an in-depth test which I have found to produce accurate results. The only other change here has been the upgrade from ultra to epic quality settings which helps to knock the frame rates down from that 300 fps cap. At 1080p we see that like my previous test, the Ryzen processors don't seem particularly impressive when looking at the average frame rate, though they are plenty fast enough to drive a 144Hz display in this title and what's important to note here is their minimum frame rate results. Out of the box the 1800X isn't much slower than the 5960X, but with SMT disabled it actually pulls ahead. So we have here a good example of why the Windows scheduler needs to be updated for Ryzen. Ryzen becomes rather competitive at 1440p. The 1800X pulls ahead of the 5960X out of the box and this time disabling SMT doesn't lead to the same minimum frame rate gains. I have to say that both the 1800X and 1700X look great here.

We talk about games, the lack of AAA content, and how the technology can change... everything. Everyone’s bullish about virtual reality. Developers are continuing to develop new titles, and are starting to design games that take advantage of the unique opportunities of the medium. The makers of the HMDs themselves are starting to see sales increase, and with that increased market, we're seeing the first round of price drops, with Oculus now cutting about a hundred dollars from the Rift's starting price. And, at the Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice, Intel is pushing the technology hard - after all, you need high end PC hardware to make the most of VR, so anything which drives CPU sales is definitely a good thing. The one sticking point, though, remains the lack of truly killer titles and applications. Even Intel's own Frank Soqui, the General Manager of the company's VR division, admits that we're still waiting for the content that's really going to make VR sing. "We need those triple AAA titles," he told me. "The games that will drive VR take up." Essentially, VR needs its Crysis moment, when a game is so good that people will invest not for the novelty of the hardware, but for what can be done on it. Which kind of begs the question - is VR actually... ready? Is it, as many vendors continue to promise, here to stay? "Well, for me 'here' has a specific meaning," Soqui says when I ask him, after pointing out that it is a kind of nebulous thing right now. "But I look at the level of industry investment; I'm looking at the hardware capabilities that are there. I'm looking at the cross-sector investments that are being made, not just in gaming, but they're getting made commercially, in the enterprise. I look at price points coming down, at the quality of the experience - I think that's here." "What's not here," he says, "is the compelling content." We're really, really close, though.  At Intel's hardware demo area at IEM, VR featured heavily alongside high-end gaming PCs pushing out 4K gaming content, and sleek laptops with all the power of a desktop themselves.  There was the inevitable high-end driving simulator, complete with hydraulic shocks to rock a racing chair around as your tackle your racing line. There was a Virtuix Omni - if you were at the last Upgrade Australia event in Sydney, you may have already tried one! - where you could run about on the spot shooting zombies, and an impressive sail-boarding simulator that was a tonne of fun - if somewhat impractical for the home. There were two really great demos that really stuck out for me, however, and both showed what VR can do without needing to invest in even more tech, like racing-sim chairs or full-motion harnesses. The first was an upcoming game, one that I've been excited about for a while - Star Trek: Bridge Crew. The game pretty much does what it says on the tin, placing you on a starship bridge, as either Captain, Helm, Tactical, or Engineer. It can be played solo, with AI in each position apart from yours, but it's ideally a co-op experience, with a live player in each position. The demo shuffled you through each of them, showing off how each role plays, and it was pretty amazing. I'm a Star Trek fan, so may be biased, but the sense of presence was stunning. Using controllers, I could look down at my virtual hands as they manipulated various ship functions, and it really was just like in the movies.  I may have gotten a little quietly emotional. For me, it's the first true killer app of VR. When I pointed this out to Frank, he predictably called me a big nerd, and I'm not going to deny it.  "For me," Soqui went on, talking about the game that was his 'ah ha!' moment, "it was playing a game where my avatar was a woman, and I looked down, and... Wow! I'm in someone else's body!" "I've talked to film makers about this," he says, warming up to the topic, "about empathy. How does it feel to be in someone else's shoes?" The second impressive use of VR was in eSports broadcasting. Watching a stream of a game online is nothing new, but what Intel's aiming for is letting viewers get inside these matches - virtually. There's something very compelling about the chance to be virtually present in the arena for a big eSports match, and even more compelling about then being able to actually get inside the game, to watch it from any angle. In fact, finding new ways to present eSports to wider, more diverse crowds is one of Intel's big challenges in growing competitive gaming. They're both heavily gaming-focused though, and Intel's looking well beyond play for where VR can have the most impact. "Let's look at a collaborative work space, for instance," Soqui posits. "Say I'm trying to show you a 3D model, and I want to show it, and collaborate with someone over it. I've got to use Skype to talk to, you and spin this thing around with a mouse... Is this how want to work together?" "But with VR goggles and a shared space, I can spin that model with my hands, and so can you, we're going to look at it from different angles - whatever that object is. It could be art, it could be a building... We work that way naturally, and VR let's us do that." Which goes back to Frank's earlier point about empathy, and VR's ability to let us see the world from new angles. "What is it like to be in... Sarajevo," he says. "How does it feel to be a person of a certain ethnicity... How does it feel to be someone in a wheelchair? You don't know that point of view until you see it; and VR can do that." Another challenge that's facing VR at the moment is the hardware-based silo mentality that tends to be the norm when in comes to technology and software development. Games that are only on one platform, for instance. Developer Ubisoft has already promised that all its VR titles will be hardware agnostic - they'll run on PSVR, Rift, and Vive. But more needs to be done keep VR open. "I wouldn't say we're pushing for open standards, but we're certainly trying to influence people about the value of interoperability. It serves both consumer and business interests to have more content on more platforms. There's often a tension between business interests, as well as providing the best experience possible, as well as open standards - a lot of times those conflict with each other until the market matures." "I know that if I lock something down, I can create the best experience. But is that what the end user wants? Yeah, they want to the best experience, but they expect interoperability." "You just can't lock people into one platform," Soqui adds. "I wouldn't say we're pushing for open standards, but we're certainly trying to influence people about the value of interoperability." Of course, there's more to VR than just games and hardware. It always comes back to that unique experience of being there that really separates it out from any other form of media we've known. So how do you combine old media, like films, and traditional film-making techniques, with the startlingly young field of VR. Flat media, whether it's a film, a TV show, a documentary, even news broadcasts, all work based on similar principles, base around cuts, editing, and camera angles. When I point this out, and quiz Frank about his work with film-makers, his response was almost philosophical. "Why," he asked me, "is the cut used as a narrative device?" "Because," I replied, "it's something we're watching, not something we're in." Which was as dumb answer, but hey I'm no film student. And it was also what Frank wanted me to be say. "Yes, exactly! And here's the other thing - most of those of those movies or stories are based around something the author was in, around an experience, and it had to be translated from that experience into a flat space... I would argue that creators don't have to translate anymore. With VR, what they create, or write about, is what you experience. No cuts, no edits. You can just be there." As Frank's talking about film, and narrative, and a new way to explore these things, he's getting more animated. This is his last interview of a long day, so his passion and excitement is all the more astonishing. But then so is this still relatively new technology, and that helps keep things fresh, and capable of still surprising a veteran and evangalist like Frank. "You know what still gets me," Soqui says, sitting back and looking up at the ceiling. "What surprises me is how people react to it, that first time. When I see people's physical reaction, when they shout out, or when they duck..."  "And we're just at the tip of the iceberg for how your senses can be fooled."  Which makes me wonder, if a game like Bridge Crew can get me excited now... Maybe Frank's right - we ain't seen nothing yet.

Solus' Linux Driver Management Tool Enables "Always-On" Nvidia Optimus Support GO Hybrid Intel/AMD GPUs can now be detected Mar 7, 2017 01:57 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Joshua Strobl from the Solus Project has managed to publish a new weekly newsletter to inform users of the independently-developed Solus operating system about the latest developments. It would appear that Solus' development team is still working hard these days to improve the upcoming Linux Driver Management (LDM) tool, which is now capable of detecting multiple system configurations, including hybrid Intel and AMD Radeon or Intel and Nvidia GPUs, but also computers with AMD APUs by automatically configuring the graphics stack. "Ikey has spent considerable amount of time this week dedicated to shaping up our Linux Driver Management tool, which will be responsible for our switchable graphics solution. The initial version of LDM will enable always-on Optimus, as that is the highest priority item, before moving on to switchable graphics itself," reveals Joshua Strobl, Solus Project Communications Manager. On-demand Nvidia Optimus support is coming soon The first development releases of the Linux Driver Management tool are now available on GitHub if you want to take them for a test drive, especially if you're using Solus with a Nvidia graphics card. It enables "always on" Nvidia Optimus support by default, but future releases should also come with on-demand Nvidia Optimus support and out-of-the-box support for AMD Radeon GPUs. It also looks like the Solus devs are planning to deprecate the gl-driver-switch utility from the operating system and seamlessly roll out Linux Driver Management to existing users, when the tool will be mature enough for production use. Upcoming Solus ISO snapshots will also include LDM by default. Other than that, they managed to release a new Help Center and improve the contributor experience. Up next for Solus, there will be a new maintenance update to the Budgie 10.x desktop environment, namely version 10.3, which should be out at the end of Q1, along with a new ISO snapshot for those who plan on reinstalling or deploy the operating system on more PCs. As expected, Q2 will kick off with the development of the long-anticipated Budgie 11 desktop, which will be rewritten in Qt5 and C++. #Solus#Linux Driver Management#Nvidia Optimus#AMD Radeon#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Latest Weekly Build of Black Lab Linux Improves Microsoft Surface Studio Support The Road to Mageia 6 Linux Continues, Second Development Build Adds New Updates Canonical Releases Snapd 2.23 Snappy Daemon with GalliumOS & Linux Mint Support Debian-Based siduction 2017.1.0 OS Gets Linux Kernel 4.10, Drops 32-bit Support Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    Solus Other Linux Distros Refracta: A Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux and designed for home PC users GALPon MiniNo: A lightweight, Debian-based Linux distribution specifically designed for old computers Ultimate Edition: An Ubuntu based Open Source Linux operating system with a lot of software pre-added 4MLinux Core: A core version of the 4MLinux operating system aimed for building your own distro GeckoLinux: An open source GNU/Linux distribution based on openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Leap ArchBang: A simple GNU/Linux distribution based on the powerful Arch Linux operating system Container Linux by CoreOS: A new kind of Linux-based operating system designed for massive server deployments Reader comments Litebook Launches Cheap, Chromebook-like Linux Laptop Powered by elementary OS more on: Litebook i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. Comey disputed the allegation and reportedly asked the Justice Department to publicly denounce the claim, according to media reports. When asked by ABC if Trump accepted Comey’s denial, Huckabee said, "I don't think he does. I think he firmly believes that this is a storyline that has been reported pretty widely by quite a few outlets." Numerous lawmakers, including House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz said there was so far no evidence to support Trump’s claim.

By: Jon Coulter | SSDs in Storage | Posted: 15 hours, 15 mins ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Introduction & Specifications] Page 1 [Introduction & Specifications] Page 2 [Drive Details and Specifications] Page 3 [Benchmarks PCIe Storage - Samsung 960 EVO 1TB - Intel vs. AMD] Page 4 [Benchmarks SATA Storage - Samsung 750 EVO 500GB - Intel vs. AMD] Page 5 [Final Thoughts] Introduction     AMD is finally back in the game with the launch of Ryzen. Ryzen is undoubtedly going to be massively popular, which is why TweakTown is planning to do several Ryzen builds for testing various categories of hardware performance. We have decided that Ryzen will be a part of our solid state storage reviews going forward; so, if you want to know what level of SSD performance you can expect from your Ryzen build, TweakTown will have the answers you are looking for.     We were able to get some limited hands-on time with Ryzen at GDC (Game Developers Conference) 2017 courtesy of XtremeSystems owner and world class overclocker Charles Wirth, or "Fugger" as he is known to most of the world.   Like all of you reading this, we wanted to see how Ryzen stacks up against Intel in terms of SSD storage performance.     We only had a few hours to test a couple of SSDs on the Ryzen platform so we couldn't run our usual testing suite, but we did get enough that we can get an accurate idea of what you can expect from Ryzen-based SSD storage performance.     Testing Platform   We tested utilizing AMD's top of the line Ryzen R7 1800X running on the AM4 X370 Enthusiast Chipset.     Click here for TweakTown's extensive review of the Ryzen 1800X CPU.     The motherboard we had access to was GIGABYTE's top of the line AORUS AX370-Gaming 5.     The DRAM supplied was Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR 4 3000MHz.     Altogether a top-end Ryzen testing platform. We ran everything at stock speeds and air-cooled. It is important to keep in mind that motherboard was not running on a finalized BIOS so there may be some future improvements that could positively affect performance.

They often fail to see that with such cpus pushed to the mainstream users game developers will be able to design games to work with more cores. There is also another thing , up to now , coding with multiple cpus is a nightmare ;thus, the need for more optimized game engines is required. All in all , the new AMd cpus simply are gamer changer. Despite the fact that I love intel product , this to me means cpus will be a lot cheaper and 2018 will bring interesting changes No it won't. All these chips have done is bring more cores at a cheaper price but end of the day that doesn't change the fact that 4 core 8 thread 6 core 12 thread and 8 core core 16 thread CPUs from Intel have been around for 3 maybe 4 years now and some at a price that isn't that much more than the current top end Ryzen. Has THAT changed games? No not really the best you'll find from any game of the last 5 years is 6 threads, though I am lead to believe that Doom uses whatever it can get it's hands on. So if game developers haven't bothered to change up their game development to take advantage of a CPU that has been readily available for the last 5 years why are they suddenly going to change up their game just because a 'cheaper' CPU with extra cores has appeared on the market? Even worse you have to also take in to account that this new CPU has to establish a market that has been long held by Intel. I suspect that a lot of folk are clutching at straws, that everyone wanted this chip to appear on the scene and just blow what Intel has away and it really hasn't done that. It's good in some areas and worse in others and the best case scenario is everyone agrees that depending on what you want to do with your PC you now have a viable alternative to Intel that you can choose, but some folk just don't want to accept that, they're clutching at developers suddenly making their game engines better, developing the engines for better multi threading, develop their games so that they will work better with the new chip and given that game developers haven't done this so far with an established CPU market why on th earth would they suddenly funnel huge amounts of time and money in to doing it for a CPU that has to establish its place in the market?     The Laughing Ma View Public Profile Find all posts by The Laughing Ma     (#27) Prince Valiant Master Guru     Videocard: GB GTX980 G1 Processor: i5 4670k Mainboard: ASRock Z87 Ex.4 Memory: 8GB Corsair Veng. Soundcard: Essence ST/HD800S PSU: Corsair HX650 Yesterday, 17:15 | posts: 355 Quote: Originally Posted by yasamoka There was no talk of the framerate required for CS:GO to perform smoothly. That sentence revolved around the huge difference when high framerates were involved, indicating a bottleneck of sorts (that I hope would be sorted out very soon). As for that game engine you speak badly of, CS:GO is one of the games with the lowest input latency at equivalent framerates to other games. 300FPS is more in line with keeping that latency as low as possible since it can run so easily on any gaming machine. Higher FPS always makes more sense, even if it's much higher than your refresh rate - frametimes go down, variance goes down, input latency goes down, and the game becomes more fluid than simply running at your refresh rate (e.g. 60 / 144 / 165 / 240FPS). High framerates are what Fast Sync leverages. The more frames you're rendering, the less jitter introduced by Fast Sync (there are so many frames the deltas are much smaller). Also, if your minimum framerate is slightly higher than your refresh rate, with VSync off you get jitter (try playing with 61-62FPS at 60Hz for example) and tearing and with Fast Sync you get (somewhat worse) jitter and no tearing. If you're leaving your framerate go over your refresh rate, it better be a lot higher (ideally a multiple of your refresh rate). Higher framerate and lower latency are always good. I don't quite understand why some people are dismissive of either. I figure they don't know or they've forgotten what it was like to play with CRTs at high refresh rate and PS/2 keyboard and mouse .     Prince Valiant View Public Profile Find all posts by Prince Valiant   (#28) BlueRay Member Guru     Videocard: GTX970 Processor: i5 2500k Mainboard: Gigabyte Memory: 8GB Soundcard: PSU: Corsair AX750 Yesterday, 17:32 | posts: 109 Even though Ryzen is not topping the max fps an i7 7700k can top it's not fr behind nor the gaming performance is terrible. This is far from the Buldozer fail. This is a competitive CPU with some child decease every new platform has. I believe that Ryzen will mature way better into the future than any 4 core Intel is offering. Also we must take account that Ryzen is way more useful in other things except gaming. And even in gaming is useful when you multitask along side with the game like streaming for example or running something in the background. Unfortunately today we test and judge something only by the max fps number forgetting everything else. All these days I spent them watching and reading reviews from every possible source. Be it big and well known reviewers but also lesser known ones. Ryzen is a competitive product and offers great value. If AMD did something wrong this time is that they released the product without waiting for some basic patching and more stable bios. They should have waited a bit more and release a bit later with better Bios and the Windows patch. It's bad when you release something and then promise fixes via patching. It doesn't sound good to the average potential buyer plus the product is not getting the reviews scores it can get.     BlueRay View Public Profile Find all posts by BlueRay   (#29) TheDeeGee Ancient Guru     Videocard: MSI GTX 1070 AERO OC Processor: Intel Core 4770K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z87X-UD5H Memory: Crucial Ballistix LP 16GB Soundcard: SoundBlaster ZxR PSU: Seasonic Platinum 760 Yesterday, 17:57 | posts: 4,881 Quote: Originally Posted by fantaskarsef LN2 overclocking.

This is due to its frequency relations with other interfaces, such as the PCIe. Unlike with Intel's more recent CPUs, there is no asynchronous mode (straps / gears) available, which would allow stepping down the PCIe frequency at certain intervals. The PCIe frequency relation is fixed and therefore it increases at the same rate with the BCLK. Gen. 3 operation can generally be sustained up to ~107MHz frequency and higher speeds will usually require forcing the links to either Gen. 2 or to Gen. 1 modes. Unstable PCIe can cause various issues, such as system crashes, data corruption (M.2 SSDs), graphical artifacts and various kinds of other undefined behavior."

I hope you're right, because this would really kick up the CPU market into another gear & Intel would have to fight to compete. Thing is, only time will tell if this turns out to be the truth. In truth I think any gamer with a 60Hz monitor of any resolution can rest easy that a Ryzen CPU is a good buy, it's just for the folks who want say 90 or 100fps plus on 144Hz monitors where they're better off sticking with Intel for now. In fact, if I was building a new rig with a 60 or 75Hz monitor I'd for sure use a Ryzen CPU - cheaper & more future proof because of all those 8 cores, plus it would be awesome for non-gaming stuff too.     Robbo9999 View Public Profile Find all posts by Robbo9999 Page 2 of 2 < 1 2 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Sarah Tew/CNET Laptops by David Carnoy March 6, 2017 9:00 AM PST @DavidCarnoy Best Buy frequently offers discounts on Apple products, but its "Deal of the Day" for March 6 caught my attention because it's the first time I've seen the latest MacBook Pros on sale. The caveat here is that the $175 discount is for Apple's entry-level $1,500 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is missing the step-up models' Touch Bar. It also has a slower processor (2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5) and integrated Intel Graphics chip (Intel Iris Graphics 540). That $1,325 price tag is still pretty expensive -- Best Buy's open box deals are better -- but if you're in the market for a MacBook Pro, it's worth a look. The deal is for today only but I suspect we'll see this model on sale again in the coming months. It's also worth mentioning that Apple will price match up to 10 percent in its own stores, so you should be able to get that same notebook for $150 off in an Apple Store if you show the Apple sales people the Best Buy ad.

Steve Helber — The Associated Press file By Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard, The Associated Press Posted: 03/06/17, 9:01 AM EST | Updated: 19 secs ago # Comments WASHINGTON >> The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for:  Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. Advertisement  Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making.  An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities.  A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency.  A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president.  His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.

But a few weeks ago, the Microsoft Store began selling its entry-level Pro 4 without the Pen in the US for the first time. It followed various other retailers who had been offering the same 'no pen' SKU - with the Intel Core m3 model of the Pro 4 tablet - for several weeks before that. Now, though, Microsoft has completely dropped the SKU of that model that includes the Pen in the box. In recent weeks, the Microsoft Store has listed both the standard (with Pen) and 'no pen' SKUs on its Surface Pro 4 page: But the option to buy the Intel Core m3 model with a Pen in the box has now disappeared from the main store listing... ...and the option to buy that model with a Pen is also absent from the 'Configure your device' page on which all of the available product configurations are shown: While the Microsoft Store has dropped the Pen-inclusive Core m3 SKU, you may still be able to find one at other US retailers. But even if you purchase the 'no pen' SKU from the Microsoft Store, the Surface Pen is still available to purchase separately there, priced at $59.99. As with other Surface Pro 4 models, the Type Cover keyboard accessory is also sold separately, priced from $129.99. The Intel Core m3 SKU with the Surface Pen is still listed on the Microsoft Store in other markets, including the United Kingdom, although the SKU that includes the Pen is currently out of stock there, showing an 'Email me when available' button. Oddly, whether you choose to buy the Pro 4 with or without the Pen in the UK, you'll pay the same price of £749. This latest revision to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 line-up comes amid growing rumors that the company is planning to launch a new version of the tablet in the next few months. While the Pro 4 remains popular, it's now 18 months old - and with other devices recently launching with Intel's latest Kaby Lake chips, USB Type-C ports, 4G LTE connectivity, and other features lacking on the Pro 4, many potential buyers are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Pro 5.

Intel Pushes Out More Early DRM Testing Code For Linux 4.12 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 6 March 2017 at 06:06 AM EST. Add A Comment Intel's Daniel Vetter has updated their drm-intel-testing tree with early code to begin testing that should end up being queued for the Linux 4.12 kernel. Now that Linux 4.11-rc1 is out, Intel developers have already turned their sights to Linux 4.12 with beginning to stage the work they hope to see for this next big kernel cycle. Among the work staged right now for Intel DRM testing are atomic improvements, GPU reset improvements, a lot of code improvements, atomic mode-setting being enabled by default, Broxton fixes, color manager support for Geminilake, a lot of early fixes to the Geminilake code delivered in Linux 4.11, and a variety of other internal code improvements.

When it was first released around four years ago, reception was not that great. However, Microsoft made a big leap in terms of features on the Surface Pro. And while everything went silent regarding the upcoming tablet, a new rumor just kept it alive and back in the limelight. Back in October 2016, Microsoft has announced the upcoming Windows 10 update, the Windows 10 Creators. This new version of the OS will centre heavily on user content creations like 3D, virtual reality, and mixed reality. According to PC Advisor, the update will come as early as April this year. Because of this, many believe that Microsoft will also unveil the new Surface Pro 5. Late last year, many Surface Pro fans were a bit disappointed that Microsoft held on to the laptop update. Instead of hearing about it during the previous Microsoft event, they saw other products instead. Windows 10 Creators Update (via microsoft.com) Rumor has it that at the time of the said event, Microsoft is still waiting for Intel to release the Kaby Lake processors to go with the tablet. Furthermore, the software giant is still in the process of ironing out the upcoming Windows 10 update. Now Intel has officially released the Kaby Lake, and since the Windows 10 Creators is already penned for an April release, the Surface Pro 5 could be coming really soon. There is absolutely no reason for Microsoft to delay on the release unless there are major technical issues. And so far, there has been none. Just like in previous iterations, the Surface Pro 5 will sport the i-series processors from Intel. The mid-range version of the product will have an i5 while the high-end will sport the i7 mobile processor. However, many are hoping that Microsoft will expand the system memory to 32GB on the high-end version of the tablet. Furthermore, another thing on the wish list of consumers is a 4K PixelSense display to complement the tablet’s discrete graphics card. It has been more than a year since the last Surface Pro tablet was released. Fans are already getting impatient with the waiting game that Microsoft is playing.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 6 March 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Wearable computing market grows as gadgets evolve Increasing demand: An athlete demonstrates the New Balance RunIQ fitness tracker watch at an exhibit of wearables by Intel during the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show (CES). — AFP The global market for "wearable" computing such as fitness-trackers, smartwatches, and software-infused ear pieces is growing strong, according to figures release Thursday by International Data Corporation. Shipments of such gadgets hit a new quarterly high of 33.9 million units in the final three months of last year, and were up 25% to 102.4 million for the entire year, according to an IDC Worldwide Wearable Device Tracker report. The market is growing strong as devices evolve from serving singular purposes such as tracking how far a wearer walks to gathering more detailed health data and even having telecommunications service connections instead of relying on being synched to smartphones, the report indicated. Staff of Taiwanese company Viseeo demonstrate Doctor V's alcohol breathalyser function during its demonstration at Wearable Expo in Tokyo — Reuters "Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to becomeavailable," IDC wearables research manger Ramon Llama said in the report. "This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a standalone experience." New contenders, including companies known for fashion or with specialities such as baby monitoring, are entering a market with established major players such as Apple and Google, according to the reports. "With the entrance of multiple new vendors with strengths in different industries, the wearables market is expected to maintain a positive outlook, though much of this growth is coming from vendor push rather than consumer demand," sais IDC senior research manager Jitesh Ubrani. Improving shipments of ear-worn devices, referred to in the report as "hearables," and clothing with sensors woven in, while still relatively tiny, showed promise that the market is becoming about more than just wrist-worn devices, according to IDC. Fitbit continued to dominate, losing ground but holding on to 19.2% of the market in the final quarter of last year, while Xiaomi's "relentless growth" nearly doubled its share to 15.2%. Apple was in third place with its smart watch, which "proved to be a magnificent success for the company" and accounted for 13.6% of the market during the quarter, according to IDC. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Pyongyang bans Malaysians from leaving N.

Deloitte Deloitte Office, BangaloreFacebook "Along with the benefit of work from home to take care of our children who have not yet started to go to school, what I love about Deloitte is its efforts to have a fifty-fifty workforce of men and women.

President Donald Trump couldn't be happier. Following Chief executive officer Darren Woods's announcement of the projects on Monday (March 6), Trump described Exxon as a "true American success story" in a statement. The president followed up with a trademark tweet: "We are already winning again, America!" and a White House video. After decades of locating refineries and chemical plants close to raw materials and end markets in the Middle East and East Asia, Exxon is committed to steering construction dollars to its home country, Woods said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. The plan involves 11 projects in the Gulf Coast region, some of which were in the works as far back as 2013. "These projects are export machines, generating products that high-growth nations need to support larger populations with higher standards of living," Woods said. "The supply is here; the demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots." Exxon followed other US giants such as Ford Motor, Intel, General Motors and Wal-Mart Stores responding to Trump's call to eschew overseas investments and focus on domestic developments. Like those other plans, Exxon didn't specify how much of the 10-year investment programme was previously announced. All the jobs will be located along the Gulf Coast, and many will pay an average of US$100,000 a year, Woods said. The investments will continue at least through 2022, Woods said in only his second public appearance since January, when he succeeded Rex Tillerson, who left the CEO job to become Trump's secretary of state. Woods' comments followed Exxon's disclosure last week that it's shifting half its worldwide drilling budget to US shale fields next year. One of the projects includes the construction of an ethane cracker at Exxon's Baytown, Texas, chemical complex that began in June 2014 and was projected to employ 10,000 construction workers and spur 4,000 additional full-time positions. Another was the expansion of Exxon's Mont Belvieu, Texas, polyethylene plant, where work began around the same time. The company didn't say how much the investments would cost. "This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work," Trump said in a statement. "Many of the products that will be manufactured here in the United States by American workers will be exported to other countries, improving our balance of trade." Like Exxon bosses before him, in his remarks on Monday Woods championed "free and fair trade" as essential for economic growth and corporate profitability. That stance may veer from Trump's repeated criticisms of various international trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, as unfair and disadvantageous to US workers. Woods, a 52-year-old Exxon lifer, inherited a company hobbled by the biggest reserves reduction in its modern history and the loss of the platinum credit rating it held for 85 years as a 2 1/2-year collapse in crude markets destroyed cash flow. The expansion programme, dubbed "Growing the Gulf" by Exxon, hews close to Woods' pedigree as a quintessential downstream executive, or one who focused on refineries and chemicals for most of his career. Woods' comments at CERAWeek may presage major themes up for debate at the oil industry's biggest annual conference. He was preceded at the conclave by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak; luminaries yet to appear during the week-long conference include Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih, Opec secretary general Mohammad Barkindo, and the CEOs of Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Total and BP.

(Photo courtesy the White House) Immigration advocates are unsure what the merit-based immigration system President Donald Trump called for on Feb. 28 would do for the country – mostly because they don’t know exactly what the president meant. “Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits,” Trump said in his address Tuesday to a joint session of Congress. “It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families – including immigrant families – enter the middle class.” But the president did not say what “merit” means – education, specialization or filling a gap in the market could all be considered meritorious traits – just that immigrants should be able to support themselves financially when they come to this country. There were no more details in his speech, and the White House did not return a request for comment or clarification on his proposal. A merit-based plan would be a shift from the current American immigration system, which allocates visas based on criteria of diversity, employment needs, humanitarian aid and family connections. What needs to be determined is where the existing criteria would fit in to a new system, said immigration attorney William Stock in an email. He and others said one possibility is that prioritizing high-skilled workers could be a backdoor way to limit immigration based on family ties in the U.S. “I think what we’ll wind up seeing is a significant reduction in family-based immigration and potentially an elimination of the visa lottery,” said Mo Goldman, an immigration lawyer in Tucson. “It could have a negative impact as far as the need we have in certain areas of our industries,” he said. “Not everyone who comes here as an immigrant is going to wind up working for Intel.” Different regions of the country have different needs and certain sectors, like agriculture, rely heavily on migrant workers. Data from the National Agriculture Workers Survey show that almost 80 percent of agricultural workers are foreign-born. “When you get into Arizona, we have such a huge diversity of industry, be it agricultural, industry or tourism,” Goldman said. The Western Growers Association declined to comment on Trump’s proposal, based on the lack of detail in his address, but the Arizona Farm Bureau said in a statement that it hopes the president will address all of the issues with immigration reform moving forward. The president also did not detail how rigid a new system would be. For example, Stock said, many Midwestern towns face population and labor force decline, but those cities require immigrants of all skill levels to fill the vacancies. Trump did reference Canada’s immigration system as an example of the kind he hoped to implement. But Canada learned the hard way that weighting admission in favor of higher educational attainment is not a recipe for success. “Whether or not someone has a particular job offer is a better determinant (of success) than if they just have a Ph.D.,” said Meghan Benton, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. “High-skilled migrants were massively underemployed, or in some cases, unemployed.” She said high-skilled migrants in Canada were encountering barriers – language, unrecognized professional credentials and so on – that lower-skilled workers did not have to face. Responding to these issues, Canada amended the point system in 2015 and moved toward a system that prioritizes migrants who have job offers awaiting them in the country, Benton said. Furthermore, there is hardly a dearth of skilled immigrants in the current system. “There tends to be an equating of low-skilled with family-based immigration,” said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at MPI and the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner. “That’s not really accurate.” She said skilled immigrants are admitted to the U.S. under all the current immigration criteria, “not simply through the labor market categories.” In fact, she said, there has been a recent uptick in the number of skilled immigrants coming here for family reasons. In 2015, around 30 percent of the immigrants age 25 and over in the U.S. had college degrees, according to an MPI study of Census Bureau data. In Arizona, around 40 percent of adult immigrants had at least some college education, according to the same study. Regardless of whether the president intends to fully replace the current system or just change the proportions, Meissner said the consensus among immigration experts is that legal immigration across all skill levels and sectors is necessary for a healthy economy. “I think on paper, the idea of targeting people with the highest skills is something that has a certain appeal,” said Robert Sakaniwa, the associate director for advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “But the government, I don’t think, is the best arbiter of what employees are needed in the country. The actual employers are the best judge of that,” he said.

The grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation， established by Intel Corporation co-founder Gordon E. Moore and his wife Betty I. Moore in September 2000， to the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) project will help build 110 new telescopes， so as to creat a much more sensitive array able to detect faint radio signals at a wavelength of 21 centimeters. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded the team 10 million dollars last year to boost the number of telescopes to 240， a project being built in South Africa that should be completed in 2018， when the Moore-funded expansion will begin. "Expanding HERA will help us map bubbles of ionization around early galaxies in our universe and will extend our ability to find the earliest signs of star formation in our universe，" said HERA lead investigator Aaron Parsons， an associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. The radio waves to be explored by the array can potentially provide a history of the so-called "epoch of reionization，" a period beginning about 400 million years after the Big Bang when the first stars started to form and emitted copious high-energy light that eventually ionized about 90 percent of the hydrogen atoms in the universe. That event allowed starlight to travel uninterrupted through the universe， into telescopes today. The Big Bang， theorized as the beginning of the expansion of the universe， took place approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Using next-generation instrumentation for 21-centimeter cosmology， HERA will probe the 3-D structure of the universe during the very first appearance of stars， galaxies and black holes. The first generation of hot massive stars and black-hole binaries filled the intergalactic medium with X-rays. "These X-rays would have heated up the hydrogen surrounding galaxies and should produce detectable fluctuations in the 21-centimeter line，" Jacqueline Hewitt， lead investigator on the Moore Foundation grant and director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research， was quoted as saying in a news release from UC Berkeley on Monday. "Measurements of the 'epoch of X-rays' power spectrum could， in principle， distinguish between different scenarios for the very first generation of stars." The grant from the Moore Foundation was awarded through the MIT， a member of the HERA collaboration that also includes other U.S. universities and research institutes and two institutes in Italy and South Africa. | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen last Friday also signalled a potentially steeper pace of further rate hikes this year. A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2 percent in January, beating economists’ expectations. US Treasuries fell, pushing yields on the 10-year note three basis points higher to 2.51 percent, while the greenback strengthened. Wall Street weakened. In 1.16pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.01pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4 percent. The Dow fell, led by declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Intel, recently down 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in commercial poultry in the US this year, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement. “Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers’ needs,” Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson, told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system. Shares of Tyson Foods traded 3.4 percent weaker as of 12.07pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a decline of 0.5 percent from the previous close.The UK’s FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index gave up 0.5 percent, and Germany’s DAX Index dropped 0.6 percent. Shares of Deutsche Bank closed 3.2 percent after the Germany’s biggest lender on Sunday announced it is seeking to raise about 8 billion euros by issuing new shares as part of a plan to overhaul its business. “The question is … whether the bank will need more yet again in a few years,” Stefan de Schutter, a trader at Frankfurt-based Alpha, told Reuters. “ Until now, none of the restructuring measures have borne fruit.” Bucking the trend, shares of Standard Life climbed 5.7 percent after it agreed to acquire Aberdeen Asset Management to form one of Europe’s biggest fund managers.

Courtesy Hussein Chalayan Standing out at Paris Fashion Week, the city where the world’s fashion elite have always congregated, is no easy feat. Hussein Chalayan, more a theater director and artist than a mere mortal designer, has been mesmerizing audiences there for the past sixteen years. Chalayan is known for his symbolic runway performances where he draws inspiration from anthropology, architecture and technology (he’s even collaborated with Intel) and translates them into his collections and story-telling presentations. If you haven’t seen a video of his Google Earth cityscape frocks and laser emitting dresses, you haven’t lived. Kim Jakobsen To for Chalayan Courtesy Hussein Chalayan So how does a designer, one who seems to be hard wired for avant-garde creations, tackle an everyday fabric like denim? He makes it his own, which isn’t to say these pieces won’t be hanging alongside the Levi’s in your closet. While the Cyprus-blooded Brit showed his signature Fall/Winter ’17 collection at London Fashion Week, Chalayan brought his sophisticated, tailored denim in various dark shades to Paris. There were jackets, capes and trousers of varying thickness. Never basic, the designer incorporated tear-off labels on garments that allow fashionistas to choose the level of distress they’re after. We were able to briefly catch up with Chalayan during his busy Paris schedule and find out more about his denim approach: You’ve incorporated denim into your collections for many years. How does an avant-garde designer like yourself approach the dressed-down concept of denim? The new collection has the same language that I use in my main line collection, but there are so many ideas that I can represent in denim and I looked forward to reconnecting with certain pieces from my archive for inspiration….. so we referenced our archive denim pieces, remade classics in denim versions and then I mixed some signature pieces in knit and jersey into the collection. The tear-off tag. Courtesy Hussein Chalayan What are the newer details in this collection that we won’t find in previous pieces? The denim collection distincts itself by the signature paper label. The paper is stitched to every garment onto openings or pockets and it can be left intact or torn …it just depends on the look the customer wants. In this way, the paper label makes every piece unique. The white paper label plays a bit with my packaging theme of previous collections and the idea of the “virgin” garment, giving the collection its own identity. Which elements will we see from your archive? The focus of the denim line, as well as my main collection, is timeless styles and silhouettes. For the denim range I’ve revisited iconic archive pieces, like the extended sleeve lengths and a silhouette first seen in my F/W ‘98 show, Panoramic. My favourite pieces from the collection are the classic, oversized jacket, deformed biker trousers and the knitwear. I also love the cropped, simple trousers and the classic shirt without a tail. Simple back pockets leave space for experimental shapes. Courtesy Hussein Chalayan You’ve often said that you pull energy from the world around you. Where did you draw inspiration from for this collection? My inspiration is drawn from a modern reincarnation of ancient values, specifically those endorsed and encouraged by corporate forces. I wanted to convey a sense of protest and celebration …and create empowering forms and styles of dressing simply for the purpose of “self-entitlement.” For both my collections I explored the idea of new, isolated individuals that the current world is generating. I have been thinking a lot about individuality…and erosion in a digital, corporatized age. Denim can be considered a universal fabric. Who is the person wearing your denim line, in your mind? The denim line is younger than the main line, although anyone can wear certain pieces in the collection. It’s just a different thing….you can play with the pieces and mix and match to fit your own personality. Most of the garments in my collection are androgynous…and I was inspired by the metropolitan woman.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen last Friday also signalled a potentially steeper pace of further rate hikes this year. A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2 percent in January, beating economists' expectations. US Treasuries fell, pushing yields on the 10-year note three basis points higher to 2.51 percent, while the greenback strengthened. Wall Street weakened. In 1.16pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.01pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4 percent. The Dow fell, led by declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Intel, recently down 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in commercial poultry in the US this year, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement. “Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers’ needs,” Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson, told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system. Shares of Tyson Foods traded 3.4 percent weaker as of 12.07pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a decline of 0.5 percent from the previous close.The UK’s FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index gave up 0.5 percent, and Germany’s DAX Index dropped 0.6 percent. Shares of Deutsche Bank closed 3.2 percent after the Germany’s biggest lender on Sunday announced it is seeking to raise about 8 billion euros by issuing new shares as part of a plan to overhaul its business. “The question is ... whether the bank will need more yet again in a few years,” Stefan de Schutter, a trader at Frankfurt-based Alpha, told Reuters. “ Until now, none of the restructuring measures have borne fruit.” Bucking the trend, shares of Standard Life climbed 5.7 percent after it agreed to acquire Aberdeen Asset Management to form one of Europe’s biggest fund managers. In other deal news, shares of PSA Group of France closed 2.7 percent higher in Paris after it agreed to buy Opel from General Motors.

Cavium-owned MontaVista Software has advanced its Carrier Grade eXpress (CGX) Linux development platform to version 2.2 with features aimed at 5G, NFV, and IoT. The two-year old CGX is a somewhat scaled down, easier to use version of Carrier Grade Edition Linux, and it’s similarly registered for the Linux Foundation’s Carrier Grade Linux 5.0. However, it has a broader audience than CGE’s high-end networking focus, and offers an option for a minimal build aimed at the Internet of Things. Simplified architecture diagram for Carrier Grade eXpress (click image to enlarge) Like the earlier CGX and CGE distributions, as well as commercial embedded Linux distros, including Wind River Linux and Mentor Embedded Linux, CGX 2.2 is based on Yocto Project code. CGX 2.2 advances to a foundation of Linux 4.9 LTS with Yocto 2.2 and GCC 6.2. As before, GX supports ARM, x86, MIPS, and PowerPC SoCs. It offers BSPs for evaluation boards from AMD (GX-410), Atmel (SAMA5D4), Cavium (ThunderX/X2 and Octeon), and Intel, including Xeon and Atom (up through Apollo Lake) and Quark (Galileo board). BSPs are also provided for Marvell Armada and NXP i.MX6 (via a Variscite DVK-MX6-V2 board), as well as the Xilinx Zynq 7000. CGX 2.2 supports emerging 5G cellular technology in its Data Plane profile, offering low latency and bandwidth optimization, plus capabilities for content caching, heterogeneous network convergence, RAN virtualization, and network slicing. New Network Function Virtualization (NFV) features showcased in the Virtualization profile are said to include improved support for containers, Docker, and KVM, as well as optimized DPDK and ODP data plane support. The IoT profile has been enhanced with “extensive wired and wireless connectivity features, advanced security capabilities and device management features for connecting to the cloud,” says MontaVista. Two other optional profiles are also available. First, there’s a next generation build engine based on MontaVista Integration Platform (MVIP) with virtualized build nodes to scale out automatic builds on GIT commits, and “split build deliverables for higher scalability and effectiveness.” The final profile is a next generation test tool based on MontaVista Test Automation Framework (MVTAF). It offers a self-contained test framework with automatic test cycles on virtual hardware, as well as Real-Time Quality reports. In addition to offering CGL functions like High Availability (HA), field diagnostics, and resiliency, the CGX 2.2 BSPs provide a variety of security features. These include secure boot, update, root of trust, identification, and vulnerability automation.   Further information MontaVista is currently rolling out MontaVista CGX Linux 2.2 to “strategic customers” via an early access program. More information may be found at MontaVista’s CGX product page.   Related posts: MontaVista spins IoT version of its Carrier Grade Linux Wind River Linux profiles step up to Yocto Project 1.7 Commercial embedded Linux distro boosts virtualization Cavium adds OpenWRT support to Octeon III Wind River Linux 8 supports Yocto Project 2.0, Intel Skylake Heterogeneous multicore dev platform targets Linux Mentor Embedded Linux adds SMACK security and IoT support Wind blows Helix Cloud, Pulsar Linux, Rocket RTOS toward IoT Wind River Linux taps Yocto Project 1.7, adds binary option Real-Time Linux shacks up with the Linux Foundation (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

LEAD What Monica Lewinsky's TED Talk Teaches Us About Conquering Stage Fright Scared of speaking in public? You're not alone. Learn how three TED speakers overcame their stage fright and turned fear into excitement. By Fia Fasbinder Fia Fasbinder, CEO of The MOXiE Institute, arms speakers with the tools to deliver killer presentations. With over 15 years of experience in public speaking, classroom instruction, and presentation skill development, Fia teaches speakers to communicate with confidence, clarity and credibility. With a theater degree from NYU and a Masters in Education, Fia is uniquely positioned to render and teach dramatic arts concepts to adult learners. Her unique approach to keynoting utilizes theatrical techniques and performing arts skills in addition to practical, real world knowledge culled from coaching clients at TEDX, UCSD, Qualcomm, Intel and numerous Fortune 500 companies. @moxiespeaker CEO, The MOXiE Institute@moxiespeaker WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement "According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking," comedian Jerry Seinfeld once mused. "Number two is death. Death is number two. This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy." There are plenty of suggestions to overcome general fear, but the fear of public speaking, or glossophobia, is a bit trickier. 75 percent of the U.S. suffers from speech anxiety. That means three out of every four people would rather not talk in front of the other four. As Mark Twain famously said, "There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars." Statistically speaking, he's definitely right. Not even the professionals get off easy when it comes to public speaking. Presenters from TED may look cool, calm and collected. But, it's not that easy. In his book, TED curator Chris Anderson discusses the many nervous speakers that have passed through TED's wings. Let's take a look at how three notable TED speakers overcame their speech anxiety on that little red circle. Their techniques will help shed light on speaking techniques that you can use the next time you have pre-presentation jitters. Monica Lewinsky: Know What You Say Matters Chris Anderson's book talks about the great fear Monica Lewinsky felt before and during her TED Talk. After years of public ridicule and shame, Monica Lewinsky decided to come forward. "'The shame sticks to you like tar,' she told The Guardian." This was her chance to set the record straight about her shame. But would everyone's preconceived thoughts drown out her words? But Monica Lewinsky knew that what she had to say mattered. In fact, she wrote it at the top of the notes she brought on stage. Every time Lewinsky glanced at the music stand that held her papers, she saw, "THIS MATTERS." Realizing the importance of your message minimizes your fear. You shouldn't be nervous--your audience wants and needs to hear what you have to say. Your message is more important than your fear. Write down your specific message and why it is important. This will be your fuel to power through fear. Write down your specific message and why it is important. This will be your fuel to power through fear. Daniel Hardman: The Funny Side of Fear What is the opposite of fear? Humor? Laughter? Both? Daniel Hardman's struggle with anxiety taught him to laugh at fear. A stand up comedian and neuroscience student, Hardman took a step back and found humor in the situation at hand. Hardman rationalizes the irrational. You can do the same. Humor is the great unifier. Besides humanizing a speaker, humor also creates perspective. Laughing reduces anxiety, but also allows a speaker to step back and say, "I'm so worked up...over what?" "Control is an illusion," Hardman says. Knowing this lets a speaker throw caution to the wind. Try finding the humor in your situation. We're all in this together--let's laugh about it. Right now, take a moment to step back from your speech and find the angle that makes it all funny. Humor comes from oppositions and contradictions: what aspects of your speech push against each other? This is the breeding ground for comedy. Joe Kowan: "I Have Never Been More Terrified...Until Now" Joe Kowan, a graphic designer and musician, had a problem. He craved connecting with an audience through his music--not an unusual goal for an artist or speaker. His issue: his intense fear of public speaking. In his TED Talk, Kowan talks about his "flight or fight" response to performing for crowds. How did he overcome it? He didn't. Instead, Kowan incorporated his fear into his act. "By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening," Kowan explains, "that gave the audience permission to think about it. They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous--they could experience that with me." Embracing his stage fright allowed Kowan to perform his set. To overcome your own speech anxiety, use your fear. Turn that nervousness into excitement. Doing this will stop your fear from inhibiting you. Make it an asset. How do you turn fear into excitement? It comes back to your message. Be excited to deliver it because of its importance. Know the significance of your message. Find humor in your situation. Embrace fear. By doing all three, you'll not only overcome your stage fright, you'll rise above it. Talk like TED: don't let anxiety get the best of you--let fear make you better. Enjoy the experience and benefit from that enjoyment on stage. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Mar 6, 2017 Advertisement

Page 1 of 6. 39 Comments Our latest Ryzen Linux benchmarks are looking at the impact of the CPUFreq scaling driver's governors have on the performance of the Ryzen 7 1800X, including a look at the power consumption and performance-per-Watt when changing the governors. ACPI CPUFreq is what takes care of the CPU frequency scaling for AMD Ryzen processors on Linux to switch between the high and low-power states depending upon load (there isn't any AMD-specific driver for modern AMD CPUs, unlike Intel's P-State driver). On most Linux distributions like Ubuntu, ondemand is the default CPUFreq governor. For this article I tested the Linux 4.10 kernel with CPUFreq's ondemand, performance, schedutil, powersave, and conservative governors. Some basic/quick information about the each of them: Ondemand - Commonly the default, it scales the the driver based on current load and will usually go to the highest state then dropping back as deemed appropriate. Performance - Aiming for running the CPU at its maximum frequency. Schedutil - Schedutil is the newest governor and it's about making use of information from the Linux kernel's scheduler to try to better change the CPU frequency in a timely manner based on the scheduler utilization metrics. Powersave - Powersave is a common governor for those looking to extend their battery life or reduce power consumption by running at the lowest frequency state for longer periods of time. Conservative - This is similar to powersave in its approach and prefers running at lower frequencies for longer periods of time. These tests happened on the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X system while using the Linux 4.10 kernel with Ubuntu 17.04 x86_64. During the testing process, the Phoronix Test Suite was monitoring the AC system power consumption using a WattsUp Pro power meter and also auto-generating performance-per-Watt data points.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / PC / Zotac’s new Nano mini-PC now sports Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of RAM Zotac’s new Nano mini-PC now sports Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of RAM Matthew Wilson 13 hours ago PC Zotac’s Kaby Lake powered gaming series of Zbox mini-PCs from earlier this year were certainly impressive on paper but not everyone requires a GTX 1070 inside their palm-sized system. So to cater to those who perhaps don’t need the gaming horsepower, this week Zotac is introducing the ZBox Nano, featuring Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs, up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM and more all inside of Zotac’s smallest chassis yet.   If you’re wondering just how small the ZBox Nano is, then here are the exact dimensions: 5.76 (H) x 4.98 (W) x 2.36 inches (D). For IO, the system carries dual ethernet ports, four USB 3.0 ports, DisplayPort and HDMI. In terms of under the hood specifications, there are configurations with an Intel Core i5 7200U and an Intel Core i3 7100U depending on how much power you need. In both cases, Intel HD 620 graphics are used which is good enough for 4K resolution support but won’t get you very far with GPU intensive workloads. Aside from that, there are two SODIMM DDR4 slots supporting up to 32GB of RAM at 2133MHz. KitGuru Says: This system isn’t quite as impressive as the ZBOX Magnus, which is just a tad bigger but packs a powerful graphics card. However, not everyone will need that sort of gaming horsepower, so it makes sense to offer something a little dialled back at a lower price.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags news ZBOX Nano Zotac Previous G2A is now partnered with more than 100 developers for G2A Direct Next Nvidia GTX 1080Ti benchmark results leak out ahead of reviews Check Also This month’s Humble Bundle is all about benchmarking The Humble Bundle is often a great place to get some deals on games and … NicoleBrooks11 <- I profited $104k in last 12 months by freelancing from my house a­­n­­d I did that by wor­king part time f­o­r 3 or sometimes more hours /daily.

"A watered down ban is still a ban," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who predicted the latest order would face "the same uphill climb" in court. "Despite the Administration’s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more. It is mean-spirited and un-American. It must be repealed." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believes Trump's revised order is better and will "pass legal muster." "I congratulate the Administration for modifying the original order to ensure that it is prospective in application, protective of those with valid visas and legal status, and exempts Iraqis, as five thousand Americans are currently fighting alongside them against (the Islamic State)," Graham said. "I believe the new order will withstand legal challenges as it’s drafted in a fashion as to not be a religious ban, but a ban on individuals coming from compromised governments and failed states." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., dismissed the changes as nothing more than "repackaging." "The Trump Administration’s repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral, unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their Muslim and refugee ban," she said. "This is the same ban, with the same purpose, driven by the same dangerous discrimination that weakens our ability to fight terror." Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who is Muslim, declared on Twitter that "Trump's Muslim Ban is still a Muslim Ban." Trump's Muslim Ban is still a Muslim Ban. https://t.co/WtL7B8eg75— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) March 6, 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the revised order "advances our shared goal of protecting the homeland." "I commend the administration and (Homeland Security) Secretary (John) Kelly in particular for their hard work on this measure to improve our vetting standards," Ryan said. "We will continue to work with President Trump to keep our country safe." House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who criticized the Trump administration's abrupt, confusing rollout of its original order, said his committee will be overseeing the president's latest effort to ensure it is handled better. "I have long supported taking bold steps to keep terrorists from entering America," McCaul said. "I look forward to reading the details of the President’s new executive order and conducting oversight to ensure it is implemented smoothly. This month, I am also launching a bipartisan congressional task force focused on closing security gaps that might be exploited by jihadists to sneak into our country, and I hope the Administration will work closely with us to put in place new security checks to protect our people from the threat of terror."

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted that the new travel order still targets Muslims and is "still illegal." Version 2 of the ban still targets Muslims, still inspires more terrorism, still violates our founding principles. Oh, and still illegal. https://t.co/b80kX16G2D— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) March 6, 2017 Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Trump's action will "strengthen our immigration and refugee screening process." "It’s refreshing to see an administration that isn’t ashamed to uphold the most important Constitutional responsibility of the federal government: to protect the American people," Gosar said. "We can no longer ignore the facts that leaders from the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and the Department of Homeland Security have testified before Congress that they do not have the necessary resources to thoroughly vet immigrants and refugees from terrorist strongholds. There is no question that the Constitution and federal law grant the president the authority to take these necessary actions, which will not only protect the homeland but also safeguard refugees and legal immigrants."

The primary aim of TIP is to bring mobile operators, infrastructure providers, system integrators, and other technology companies together to collaborate on the development of new technologies and reimagine traditional approaches to building and deploying telecom network infrastructure. Operators and the broader telecom industry need to collaborate, be more flexible, innovative and efficient, and TIP looks to help achieve this goal. As a pioneer in telecommunications in the Middle East and Africa, Zain brings vast expertise and resources to the initiative as it will leverage its regional footprint and experience in network deployments across challenging territories to support TIP. TIP is exploring new approaches and technologies across these initial focus areas: access, backhaul, and core and management. The projects within these areas utilize the unique engineering and operational expertise of each member, focusing on developing new technologies and exploring new approaches to deployment in both developed and emerging markets. Each member contributes to the area of its expertise, while learning from others so that together all parties can collaborate and build better, faster, more efficient systems. Commenting on becoming a part of the TIP initiative, Scott Gegenheimer, Zain Group CEO said, “It could be argued that scaling traditional telecom infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband data is not moving as fast as it needs to ensure customers receive the mobile experience they demand and deserve. Zain recognizes there isn’t a single solution for this, and that no one company can tackle the problem alone. We firmly believe collaboration in innovation will drive efficiencies in our business and we are keen to be part of such prime opportunities wherever they may arise.” Gegenheimer continued, “Being a staunch advocate of the expansion of connectivity for all, Zain fully appreciates the power the internet has to enhance and empower the communities it serves. There are 4 billion people in the world who still don’t have a data connection and we commend Facebook and the other founding companies for kick-starting TIP. We have high expectations that this initiative will result in bridging the digital divide by greater inclusion, and call on for more of our regional and industry peers to join us in this initiative.” Since the launch of TIP in February 2016, the initiative has achieved numerous milestones including the creation of ‘TIP Ecosystem Acceleration Centers’ that incubate local talent around the world and accelerate product development through support from leading global and local investors. A ‘People and Process Project Group’ was also created in order to develop and share cultural and process transformation best practices that can improve operators’ key metrics. In addition, Facebook contributed Voyager, the industry’s first white-box transponder and IP/MPLS routing solution that was successfully tested. Furthermore, Facebook’s OpenCellular designs and schematics are now fully open source within TIP to accelerate the industry’s ability to provide wireless access in remote areas of the world. Driving a faster pace of innovation in telecom infrastructure is necessary to meet new technology challenges and to unlock new opportunities for everyone in the ecosystem. Flexibility will be key in everything TIP does though and the goal is to allow mobile network systems to evolve without having to start over. Zain, together with other leading industry entities across the globe, are committed to exploring new technologies and approaches that will positively impact mobile users of today and the future.

Earlier, they were of opinion that the technology, which is 10-100 times faster than 4G, would debut only by 2021. Many countries across the world is working for the technology’s faster rollout and its India debut would not be far behind. “Experiments have started, I was thinking of 2021, but it looks like 2019 now. Lots of things are getting ready and 5G is going to come in much faster. We will see commercial rollouts in 2019, while 2020 will see a lot of action. In India, 5G application is more of an Internet of Things (IoT),” Bharti Airtel Chairman and Managing Director Sunil Bharti Mittal said.Wireless tech Apart from the high-speed broadband speeds, 5G is the latest wireless technology that promises connections without drops nor latency and facilitates complex mobile internet applications. The high-end applications that the technology, which is still under in development, would range from remote driving to advanced healthcare and agriculture among others. “India is also ready for the technology, with all the policies in place,” Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma said, adding that a lot of operators and vendors are conducting experiments and use cases. The biggest bottleneck for the industry – operators, chip-makers and device manufacturers – is the need of a standard technology and protocol. Sensing the urgency, a number of industry players under the aegis of the specifications group 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is slated to meet in a couple of weeks to thrash out a common standard. The companies that have promised to reach a standard for 5G included a mix of wireless carriers, chip providers and device makers — such as Intel, Qualcomm, Intel, AT&T, Sprint and Deutsche Telekom – all of them part of the 3GPP standards group. Qualcomm is readying for 5G rollout, with its earlier launch of Snapdragon X50 5G modem. It has also collaborated with Ericsson and Vodafone for 5G trials, while device-makers such as ZTE and Ericsson and operators such as Telstra and DoCoMo are also ready for the challenge.Seamless transformation “We will be completely ready by 2019. However, the success of 5G would depend upon the seamless transformation from 4G to 5G, while countries such as Germany, Japan and America are moving much faster on this line,” Cristiano Amon, Executive Vice- President at Qualcomm, said. Spectrum for the technology is also not finalised. Operators are experimenting with various frequencies such as 600-700 MHz (Europe), 3.4-3.6 GHz (China) and 4.4-4.9 GHz (Japan) among others. “It’s not an overnight emergence of 5G, as there is a 10-year research cycle leading up to its culmination,” Magnus Ewerbring, chief technology officer-APAC region at Ericsson, said. “We wouldn’t be seeing massive deployments in 2019, as there is a lot of complexity to the technology. However, this is a good start,” Julie Coppernoll, vice-president, client computing at Intel, which has several chairs on 3GPP, said.

But if it today's consumers won't bring it into their homes, tomorrow's might find it already there. By Ross Rubin | March 6, 2017 -- 17:46 GMT (09:46 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things Apple's Home app. (Image: Apple) Following mixed results in turning watches and TV into platforms, and statements from Tim Cook that the smartphone-sized opportunity of augmented reality is more of a core technology than a product, and rumors that its self-driving car efforts have been stalled, does Apple have a next killer product? And if there isn't one per se, does Apple have a strategy for the Internet of Things? Read this IoT security under scrutiny as Apple looks at smart home system Internet of Things security is under scrutiny as Apple moves to introduce its smart home system and Google works to expand its suite of web-enabled home devices. Read More It does not, at least in the vein of a communication platform from ambitious cross-industry bodies such as the Open Connectivity Forum, which hatched from two rival industry standards groups driven by chip giants Intel and Qualcomm, or an operating system such as Android Things, the latest IoT evolution from its main ecosystem competitor. But what Apple does have is HomeKit. It's here. It works. It's well thought-out. And as far as consumers go, it may be enough. The software developer kit, which lets developers of objects communicate with Apple products, received a consumer face with the launch of the Apple Home app. And Apple recently launched a new website to make it easier for consumers to learn more about it and navigate what can be a complex functionality. With its supported devices, HomeKit delivers just about everything a digitally controlled and communicating home might want -- from the basics of door locks and thermostats to blinds that react to motion sensors and other triggers. For example, one can have the lights come on and the temperature rise when the door lock is opened, and we can expect to see all kinds of standalone buttons and gesture detectors that plug into the technology. A recent addition is support for cameras such as those from D-Link. HomeKit has also woven other elements of its technology platform into the picture. Chief among these is Siri, which is vying with Amazon's Alexa to be the premiere voice interface for object control. Apple here is staying true to its reputation for detail and security. Siri will not ask you to blurt out a password to authenticate, and it's using radio-free, camera-based code scanning to avoid "man in the middle" attacks. The company also works closely with vendors of products such as the Philips Hue to best interpret a wide range of spoken options for its bulbs that can display millions of colors. Of course, the Home app on iOS brings the iPad and iPhone into the mix. And Apple TV can act as a scheduling agent when those devices aren't within range to turn products on and off. And really any product hosting Siri becomes a complement for CarPlay and Apple Watch, Siri's homes in the car and on the wrist. One recently opened Apple technology that isn't get playing into HomeKit is iMessage. It promises to be a key play for Apple should we begin having conversations with inanimate objects even if the bloom is starting to fade from the chatbot rose. However, much like extended Siri conversations, these would likely be limited to a follow-up question or two for clarification rather than having to feign empathy for your refrigerator emotionally blubbering out its latest bout with frost build-up. Another critical part of the Apple success formula that hasn't been fully leveraged for HomeKit is the Apple stores. Sure, they sell a number of HomeKit-compatible products, but it's difficult to demonstrate them live without, say, the lights in the store flashing on and off as they might under the fingers of a curious five year old The dream of home automation is an old one. Former PC Magazine editor and now Ziff Brothers investment analyst Mark Miller once told me that the first article he ever published was on home automation. That was in 1979. The upending of home automation from holistic security-derived systems to app-enabled smartphone accessories on open standards has surely allowed more people to experiment with elements of home control. This has encouraged traditional security vendors such as ADT and Vivint to begin supporting products like the Echo. But Apple may not even need to sell to customers directly. Much as it has worked with automakers to preinstall CarPlay support, it is now working with home builders to install a stub of HomeKit-enabled devices, say, a door lock, thermostat, and lights, into new homes so that future homeowners will find a series of companion products waiting for them to control when they are given the keys. Or, rather, the Wi-Fi passcode that will let them remotely control the door locks. HomeKit represents an Apple in transition. It is a company that is still focusing on its own products and their attendant operating systems to be sure. But it is also looking at opportunities to become a platform provider beyond its own app store. That may not make Apple an infrastructure company, but it continues to serve its customer and build loyalty while competitors are still at the starting gate.

Trump’s Immigration Policy Threatens Asians Working in Silicon Valley Asians in Silicon Valley, whether CEOs or undocumented workers, will be impacted by the new policies. In Silicon Valley, where 60 percent of foreign-born individuals hail from India, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Asian countries, the outcry against President Trump's anti-immigration stance has been especially high-profile. And the latest immigration rules, rolled out in the last few days, have many communities on edge. On Friday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency announced that it would suspend the H-1B visa program, one of the main routes to employment for immigrants sponsored by tech companies. Then Trump signed a new executive order on Monday banning entry from six countries: Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. These new rules will weaken the Asian community in the US, and its powerful contribution to the technology industry in the US. Throughout 2015, Asians made up 27 percent of the workforce at Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn, and Yahoo (though they were underrepresented in managerial and executive-level positions). In recent years, they've also made gains in the C suite with Google's Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, and Microsoft's Indian-born CEO, Satya Nadella. Microsoft, Google and Amazon were in the top 20 companies that sponsor immigrant workers through H-1B visas, according to My Visa Jobs. But less visibly, thousands of low-paid foreign workers on H-1B visa programs also work to keep Silicon Valley running. Many work as janitors, security guards, maintenance employees, or cooks to support their families. And often for a less-than-livable wage. When the first wave of travel ban and immigration rules was announced under the Trump administration, more than 100 tech companies, included Apple and Facebook, joined together to sign an amicus brief opposing the executive order. These companies are likely to speak out again since the latest rules are just slightly scaled-back versions of those announced earlier, though several of them also seek to benefit from the Trump administration. "The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees," it read. "It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States." Meanwhile, the administration's crackdown on undocumented workers will also upend the communities in and around Silicon Valley. There are an estimated 1.6 million undocumented Asian immigrants in the valley—a number that may be surprising to some—according to AAPI Data. They account for roughly 14 percent of the entire undocumented population, and have remained largely invisible compared to other minority diaspora. "Undocumented immigration is clearly not just a Latinx issue, but also a deep AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islanders] one too," Gregory Cendana, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA), told Motherboard. Trump's newest immigration rules, which seek to deport anyone in violation of immigration laws, not just those with criminal records, will impact almost all immigrant communities. The measures detailed in two Department of Homeland Security memos introduced in February outline a policy that looks similar to President Obama's, but with greater and more severe law enforcement mandates. Together, first and second-generation Asian Americans (in many cases, children and their immigrant parents) amounted to 37 percent of their racial demographic in 2012, a Pew Research Center census found. The combination of stripped-down visa programs and law enforcement will undoubtedly alter the communities that comprise Silicon Valley, and weaken some economic sectors supported by Asian immigrants.  But maybe that's what Steve Bannon wants.

The original Microsoft Surface Book was quite a stunner. Being a rather unexpected device from the tech giant, the first-generation Surface Book boasted impressive specs and a unique design that is both innovative and attractive. Fast forward to October, 2016, and the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base was unveiled, which made the hybrid device even more powerful. With the successful run of its first homegrown flagship laptop, it is pretty much certain that Microsoft would be releasing a follow-up to the powerful machine in the near future, in the form of the Surface Book 2. While details about the Surface Book 2 are pretty scarce, for now, speculations are high that the next flagship laptop from the tech giant would be a formidable device. With this in mind, here are three things that Microsoft must do in order to ensure the Surface Book 2 becomes a success among consumers. Give The Surface Book 2 More Power While the current iteration of the Surface Book already has ample power to stand toe-to-toe with the best that the industry has to offer, it would be beneficial to Microsoft to release the Surface Book 2 with the latest 7th-generation Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processors, according to a T3 report. By doing so, Microsoft would be able to ensure that the Surface Book 2 is capable of delivering flagship-grade performance to its users. After all, the main draw of the device itself is unparalleled power. https://t.co/iZL3Ba93GM : #SurfaceBook2 #Laptop – Surface Book 2 Release Date: #Microsoft Surface Book Discount Hints Upcoming Launch pic.twitter.com/9xkpX6wNRV — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) February 11, 2017 The original Surface Book wowed users and critics alike with its performance, and while the device in itself had a few notable quirks, it was nonetheless one of the best devices released for its generation. In order to continue the series’ momentum and live up to the reputation of the Surface brand, the Surface Book 2 must be the most powerful portable device that Microsoft would release to date. Equip The Surface Book 2 With Bigger Batteries The first-generation Surface Book was a stunning machine that offered performance beyond what is offered by its biggest rivals. Despite this, however, one of the things that users of the device complained about was the fact that the Surface Book simply did not have enough juice for real portable productivity. The Surface Book was capable of detaching its screen as a tablet, and while the feature was useful, the display’s measly four hours of battery life severely limited the flagship’s real-world usefulness, according to a TechRadar report. Thus, for the Surface Book 2, Microsoft must make it a point to release a device that performs well and could last a good amount of time. After all, endurance is something that tech users are very particular about. The continued existence of long-lasting, but otherwise outdated machines such as the Apple MacBook Air, which boasts as much as 13 hours of battery life, is proof of this. Thus, for the Surface Book 2, Microsoft should aim for about nine- to 10-hours of battery life at the very least. https://t.co/jeinIGaAJb : #SurfaceBook2 #SurfacePro5 – #Microsoft Surface Book 2 Coming With Surface Pro 5 In March? Predecessor's $200 … pic.twitter.com/aXiMg5mkDZ — SndyAaron (@SndyAaron) January 27, 2017 Feature A More Solid Design In a lot of ways, the first-generation Surface Book was a prototype device that was created largely to test the market’s response to the hybrid’s concept. This is quite evident in the machine’s quirks and imperfections, such as its poor battery life and the distracting, rather annoying gap created by the device’s Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge when the hybrid is closed. Thus, for the Surface Book 2, it would be best if Microsoft ensures that the design of the upcoming device is solid, sleek, and attractive at the same time. The Surface line of devices have always been beautifully built and designed, and nothing less would be acceptable for the Surface Book 2. Microsoft should at least ensure that the Surface Book 2 would close like a normal laptop, without any noticeable gaps. The Surface Book 2 is rumored for release sometime during the first half of the year. Pricing for the upcoming flagship has not been revealed, though speculations are high that just like its predecessor, the Surface Book 2 would be offered at a premium price, worthy of its specs and features.

"We congratulate our Best Paper and Best Poster Winners for 2017," stated Tom Fitzpatrick, DVCon U.S. Program Chair.  "When you consider the high quality of the papers and posters accepted for the DVCon U.S. technical program, being judged one of the ‘best of the best' is quite an accomplishment. We are very proud of the breadth and depth of the papers and posters submitted on such a broad range of leading-edge topics to create such an exciting conference for our attendees. I would also like to thank my colleagues on our Technical Program Committee for their untiring efforts in working with our authors to ensure that all papers and presentations provide the level of technical information that our attendees have come to expect when they come to DVCon."  Highlights of the Week: Accellera Day opened the conference on Monday morning to a packed audience eager to learn more about the emerging Portable Stimulus standard.  Tom Alsop, a Principal Engineer at Intel, was recognized during the Accellera-sponsored luncheon as the recipient of the sixth annual Accellera Technical Excellence Award.  He served as co-chair of the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) Working Group for eight years and is currently chair of the IEEE P1800.2 UVM Working Group. On Tuesday Dr. Anirudh Devgan, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Digital & Signoff Group and System & Verification Group at Cadence, delivered the keynote, "Tomorrows Verification Today," and Harry Foster, Chief Scientist for Mentor Graphics, presented a special session, "Trends in Functional Verification: A 2016 Study" that provided some invaluable insight into the state of today's electronics industry. For a copy of either presentation, visit the DVCon U.S. homepage.  There were two panels on Wednesday.  The first panel, "Users Talk Back on Portable Stimulus" provided some lively discussion regarding how to shape and get involved in the development of the emerging standard.   The second panel, "SystemVerilog Jinxed Half My Career: Where Do We Go from Here?" was well-attended and offered interesting perspectives on the impact of the standard. Thursday provided attendees with a full day of sponsored technical tutorials to choose from. The DVCon Steering Committee values all feedback regarding the conference.  Attendees have been given a survey and are asked to provide input on how to make DVCon U.S. 2018 even better.

They are advancing the cause by investing in new technologies. Amazon is the latest to do so, saying that it will install rooftop solar systems at 15 locations in five different states this year and that it is planning to deploy solar systems on 50 fulfillment and sortation centers globally by 2020. The combined capacity of the initial solar projects that will go up this year will be 41 megawatts. The facilities where the solar systems will go will be in California, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada and New Jersey, it says. Amazon adds that the projects could produce as much as 80% of a location’s annual electricity. “As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders,” said Dave Clark, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, in a formal statement. “We are putting our scale and inventive culture to work on sustainability—this is good for the environment, our business and our customers. By diversifying our energy portfolio, we can keep business costs low and pass along further savings to customers. It’s a win-win.” The company has invested in wind energy as well in locations around the country: Ohio, Indiana and Texas, to name three. Altogether, it said that it will generate 3.6 million MWh of renewable energy. Internet giants are voracious consumers of energy, not just to keep the lights on but to power their data centers as well. Last December, Google said it would be using carbon offsets this year to pay for the renewable energy programs it plans to implement at its data centers. Intel is doing the same. “We are involved up and down the value chain,” says Mike Bates, global energy director for Intel, whose company’s data centers are starved for energy. It’s about helping the United States reduce its carbon emissions. And it’s also about creating goodwill in the communities where Intel operates as well as among the customers who buy its products. America’s Internet dynamos have pledged to consume nearly all of their electricity from sustainable sources. Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft filed a brief favoring the Clean Power Plan, which aims to cut carbon emissions by 32% by 2030. The four own more than 50 data centers in 12 states.  The high-tech companies “have committed to consuming energy in an environmentally responsible way and, specifically, to reducing the carbon footprint associated with their operations,” says their brief. “Because the Clean Power Plan reflects reasonable expectations about the operations of the electricity market and the increasing use of renewable energy,” the group supports the plan.

(AMD) Stock Is Still a Buy on Any GOOD Dip New hardware from Advanced Micro Devices fell short of the hype, but don't jump to conclusions yet By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Mar 6, 2017, 10:20 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in March 8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right Now Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Is Even Worse Than Q4 Earnings Suggest Recent Posts: Why Snap Inc (SNAP), Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (DB) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Did General Motors Company (GM) Discount Too Deeply? 3 Reasons T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) NEEDS to Merge With Sprint Corp (S) View All Posts To say last week was a tough one for owners of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) would be a considerable understatement. It was an awful week, with AMD stock giving up nearly 15% of its value since the prior Monday’s close. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr The setback was spurred by news that the company’s new ballyhooed Ryzen processor wasn’t all it was supposed to be. That is to say, it didn’t operate as well as it was expected to, particularly for gamers, who make up a key piece of the struggling PC market. Is this a much-deserved selloff, or does the market just not understand what the Ryzen was supposed to be for AMD? It’s a little of both. At the end of the day though, the future for Advanced Micro Devices still looks much better than its past. Advanced Micro Devices’ Ryzen Disappoints, But … Although it wasn’t alone in its disappointment, it was largely all-things-computer website Ars Technica that did the bulk of the damage to AMD stock last week, when reviewer Mark Walton opined “The [Ryzen] 1800X lags behind its Intel counterparts in gaming, regardless of whether it’s running at the same clock speed or higher.” PCWorld and PC Gamer were also unenthused, saying games didn’t play as well on the hardware as had been hoped. Those tests, however, weren’t entirely fair. Chief among the important footnotes is that the games being used to perform those trials weren’t likely optimized to operate on the new Ryzen CPU. It’s an overlooked nuance of the PC gaming market, but that software is designed to run on a specific set of hardware (or several different configurations of hardware). As AMD CEO Lisa Su recently explained, “What we’re doing with the high-end is putting an 8-core processor out there, where today most games use only 4 cores. So, there’s some software tuning that needs to be done.” Even then, though, owners of AMD stock may not be correctly assessing the situation. The Rest of the AMD Story While Ryzen may have missed the mark, it was a tainted trial. Aside from the lack of games being written specifically with the Ryzen’s new architecture in mind, the new CPU is only one part of a one-two punch combination Advanced Micro Devices has been developing for quite some time now. The second half of that combination is the new graphics-processing unit called Vega. As I explained back on Jan. 12: “The Vega platform employs a whole new kind of thinking about the way a machine handles all the video-based demands put on it. Its second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) is a stacked memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics-processing units today. This arrangement allows for a so-called High Bandwidth Cache and High Bandwidth Controller, which effectively offloads the memory work usually performed by a graphics card to that computer’s — the motherboard’s — memory. This means a practically infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display. The maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes.” It matters, because Vega and Ryzen work very well together. It’s also worth noting that not all of the recent tests of Ryzen were done using a motherboard that favors Ryzen. Future boards will be built from the ground up for both the new CPU and the new GPU.

Howard Fast 06 March 2017 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments Ask just about any IT company about their workforce diversity programs and many, albeit with some notable exceptions, are likely to say something like "yes, we have that", whether they do or not. Are they peddling falsehoods? Probably not intentionally, but the actual landscape is something quite complex. With few exceptions, almost every IT heavyweight in Silicon Valley and elsewhere still can't claim to have a workforce that even comes close to mirroring the diversity of the minority U.S. population at large. Related articles The Dream of ‘Channel Esperanto' Does VAR Mean ‘Value at Risk'? Many may not fully understand the task at hand. A new report from Open MIC, an organization that works on issues ranging from workforce diversity to internet access to privacy, sheds some light on the diversity chasm many IT companies face. The report, entitled Breaking the Mold: Investing in Racial Diversity in Tech, released on 13 February and directed at investors, contends that achieving minority diversity in IT goes well beyond what's socially right. It makes the case that it's financially counterproductive for companies not to change the composition of their workforces. "Diversity is not simply about filling seats at the table, it's also about the decisions that get made at the table," the study's authors wrote. According to Open MIC's report, based on vendor data filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, among prominent IT companies, excluding Amazon and Apple, the percentage of African American staffers ranges from two percent to seven percent, while those of Hispanic heritage represent about three percent to eight percent. Think about that for a minute. For an industry that prides itself on not only its innovation in technology, but also on being forward looking and finding new ways to work, engage and collaborate with one another, taken as a group it can't conquer a perpetual and glaring disparity in hiring minorities. Even high profile chip maker Intel, which has made a number of public commitments to diversity, has openly admitted its continuing struggle in that regard, perhaps fully understanding the implications of not doing so. Last June, Intel collaborated with Dalberg Global Development Advisors to survey 167 U.S. technology companies in an eye-opening study entitled Decoding Diversity: The Financial and Economic Returns to Diversity in Tech. While the report made the point that African American, Hispanic, Native American and female workers are underrepresented at technology companies - ethnic and racial minorities by 16 to 18 percent and women by about 19 percent, it also observed how little their representation has changed in the past 15 years. In that decade and a half, the racial and ethnic staffing numbers have risen by only one to two percentage points and the female workforce has slid by one percentage point, the report points out. Those results, despite the $1.2 billion allocated to diversity programs in the past five years by technology companies, are startling. And beyond that the study finds compelling, financial claims as well that may resonate well with investors and, correspondingly, with the C-suite. The resulting data produced something every business can understand: It established a direct correlation between workforce racial/ethnic diversity and financial performance, finding that for every incremental percentage point in African-American and Hispanic representation at tech companies, a three-percentage point increase in revenue resulted. What this means is that the technology industry could realize as much as a 22 percent increase in revenue, amounting to upwards of $370 billion annually if its workforces more accurately reflected the racial and ethnic diversity available specifically in today's engineering talent pool.

Talk John Gibson Mar 6, 2017 (Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool Image via AP) by John Gibson Follow on Twitter, Facebook, listen free/live on foxnewsradio app The media had a meltdown over the weekend when Donald Trump tweeted that Obama wire tapped him. The headlines were marching in lockstep: Trump Makes Accusation Without Providing Evidence. The New York Times’ Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman are a good example. Their story today is headlined: “A Conspiracy Theory’s Journey From Talk Radio to Trump’s Twitter”, which is NYT-speak for saying Trump was relying on unreliable sources. (Why the President would be assumed to go to sketchy sources when he has the Intel Community at his disposal seems odd.) But at the bottom of the story, Baker and Haberman felt obligated to link to several stories in the New York Times over the last few weeks which had to come from wire taps and other forms of U.S. government surveillance during the waning days of the Obama administration. Like this, and this, and this. Even before Trump’s Saturday tweets one would have not been far off base categorizing these stories as the results of Obama spying on Trump associates and, presumably, Trump himself. So why the outrage that Trump made the charge himself? Because outrage is the reflexive response to Trump from the media and the left. Also because a President is supposed to be in a box: He has access to any information the U.S. government possesses, but he is also supposed to observe classification restrictions. So unless he uses his unilateral power to declassify the information, he is not supposed to reveal his spy agencies spied on him under the previous administration of President Obama. Obviously, this President doesn’t feel bound by those niceties. If Dems don’t like it, they can impeach him. Oh wait. They would need the Congress, and they don’t have either the House or the Senate.  So they are left with the media, where they can make a lot of ominous sounding noises. Politico, in a story buried deep on its page, went over some legal possibilities the Trump team could have been under surveillance,  and noted this: “While it’s unknown whether any of these scenarios occurred, it’s ‘very likely that the people in the Obama administration had access to the communication of senior Trump officials in the run-up to the election, because they have very, very broad authority,’ said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has advocated for revising surveillance laws.” OK, so the previous President could have had access to wiretaps on Russian officials that swept up conversations with Trump people. The previous President could have suggested or ordered further investigation which would have led to more electronic surveillance. Sure he could have. So is it really such an offense that Trump said it? Obama and his people can squeal all they want trying to make Trump look like the buffoon. But their trail of leaks of surveilled conversations seems to indicate Trump is on the right trail.       John Gibson You May Be Interested In...

Smartphone apps like Waze, a godsend for some road warriors because they shave minutes and even hours off their commutes with their creative detours off main highways, are causing headaches for city planners. Using crosswalks, wider sidewalks and traffic lights, these transportation engineers aim to make neighborhood traffic slow, safe, and friendly for pedestrians — not send frustrated commuters barreling down side roads. But the GPS-enabled computer programs often don't know that, or care. Their creators, such as Waze (owned by Google), are sympathetic, to a degree. They may give cities tips on how to effectively game the program so a neighborhood detour doesn't seem that appealing. But at the end of the day, the purpose of the bots is to make use of all available road space, main thoroughfare or country lane. The upshot is mounting frustration from cities, which are trying to thwart computer systems that are savvier than ever. "Don't trust your apps!" reads one road sign in Fremont, a city of 225,000 people just north of San Jose. Located off the heavily congested 880 and 680 freeways, it's situated between major San Jose-area employers like Intel, Cisco Systems and eBay, and the more affordable housing suburbs in California's Central Valley. More coverage: Love Waze? You could use it to carpool soon NBC's Keith Morrison is the new voice of Waze Waze's growth chief: Even driverless cars need a better route With highways frequently congested, navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze started telling drivers to hop off the freeway at Fremont's Mission Boulevard, cut through residential streets and then hop back on the highway where things were clearer — much to the distress of the people who lived there. “The commuters didn’t live or work in Fremont and didn’t care about our residential neighborhoods,” said Noe Veloso, Fremont’s principal transportation engineer. When he contacted the navigation apps, he was told the apps attempt to prevent congestion by distributing traffic on all public streets, even to quiet residential roadways. The only way to stop the drivers was to change the street routing so these shortcuts were no longer that. So Fremont instituted commute-hour turn restrictions on the most heavily used residential cut-through routes. The city also partnered with Waze through its Connected Citizens Program in order to share data and information, such as the turn restrictions, so that the app takes them into account. The result has been effective, but Veloso is worried the changes may simply reroute commuters into other neighborhoods. "We’re just trying to find a balance, to eliminate some of the time savings that's sending people into our streets," Veloso said. Fremont's situation is playing out in towns and cities across the U.S., with municipal planners just starting to grasp the scope of the challenge. “Waze and Uber hit transportation planners so fast that we didn’t know what to do,” says Sam Schwartz, a former traffic coordinator for New York City. His 1992 book New York Shortcuts and Traffic Tips was a popular precursor to the systems and apps that have been downloaded by hundreds of millions of users. A sign warning drivers in Fremont, Calif. that they can no longer turn left between 3:00 - 7:00 pm, part of an effort to keep commuters from using the town as a freeway shortcut.  (Photo: Noe Veloso) At a conference of transportation engineers this summer, Schwartz said the topic was being discussed in the hallways but not yet in plenaries. “We need to get ahead of this, but we don’t know what to do,” he said. Cities are struggling to get their arms around the issues the apps raise. Boston's winding streets, some of which date back to cow paths from the 17th century, make the city especially prone to drivers taking shortcuts and back routes to get around congestion. Jascha Franklin-Hodge, the city’s chief information officer, thinks most drivers are only using traffic apps for longer trips at this point. But once they start using them in their own neighborhoods, or if cars start to integrate mapping technology into their systems, or when self-driving cars come into play in the future, then the anecdotal issues he’s hearing about today “will just be the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We can’t force an app maker to embed communal goals into their app,” he said. Waze's goal: Use all streets There is some communication between cities and the major apps. Boston, for example, uses Waze traffic jam data to help it time traffic lights in the downtown harbor area. That information helped reduce congestion by 18% month over month, according to the company. But in the end, as Fremont found, Waze believes that public roads are intended to be used by all citizens, including to alleviate gridlock. “We use the streets within reason. We find the open road and spread cars across the grid, which lowers the risk of unsafe driving behavior,” said Julie Mossler, Waze’s head of brand and global marketing. Neither Google Maps nor Apple Maps responded to requests for comment. Mapping software does have the power to slow a route down. It sets what’s known as the free flow traffic value, the time it takes to traverse a given roadway based on the physical conditions, and it's generally set to the legal speed limit. But getting those programs to lower the upper limit isn’t easy. There are too many neighborhoods, too many roads and it’s all too site-specific. Even getting a single area changed would be cost prohibitive to the app makers because it could potentially require staffers to make on-going micro updates. Waze says it hasn’t gotten any such requests. The intersection of Bosworth and Diamond Streets in San Francisco, where city planners have worked to calm traffic by removing car lanes.  (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) There’s also an inherent conflict of interest between the mapping software and the cities. “In the conflict between getting you there fast versus the neighbors who are upset about drive-through traffic, Waze’ business is with the drivers — because if you’re not getting value you’ll go use Apple Maps or TomTom,” said Mark Hallenbeck of the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the Washington State Transportation Center Today, many planners say the only alternative cities have is by physically changing street layouts. After spending decades building streets that let drivers get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible, they’re beginning to rethink the whole thing. "If you have residential streets where drivers feel comfortable doing 40 miles per hour, you didn’t do a very good job of designing them in the first place,” said Jennifer Dill, director of the National Institute for Transportation and Communities and a professor of urban planning at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. On top of that, many of the things that used to slow people down don’t anymore. “In 1953, your Chevy made a lot of noise and it gave you physical cues to tell you you were driving fast. Now in a modern car, there’s good sound deadening and you get no auditory or physical sense of how fast you’re going,” said Washington's Hallenbeck. To deal with this, city planners are contemplating redesigning roads that eliminate shortcuts or use one-way streets that prevent computers from using them as an alternative to a main thoroughfare. Seattle’s already begun this process. Its traffic engineers have spent years remaking streets so that it’s impossible to speed. They've rebuilt residential intersections as roundabouts and allowed parking on both sides of the street side to cut the useable driving space down from 36 feet to 12 feet. But sometimes these plans backfire. And municipal authorities are aware that the bots are always one or even 10 steps ahead.

The city spent 16 months and $3.1 million to reconfigure the intersection of Bosworth and Diamond streets in the Glen Park neighborhood. The heavily-used intersection includes bike lanes, lots of pedestrians, children and parents walking to an elementary school a block away, a stop for tech buses heading to Silicon Valley workplaces, a BART subway stop and multiple bus routes. The work was part of a Vision Zero plan to reduce the number of traffic fatalities to zero. It cut the number of lanes in each direction from three to two, widened the sidewalks, took out bus stops so buses now stop in the roadway and added a planted median and turn lanes. The new design is meant to be safer for pedestrians, better for transit and to discourage speeding by drivers. An unintended consequence has been an increase in drivers using mapping software that sends them down the narrow streets that traverse the neighborhood’s steep hillsides, said resident Katherine Murphy. She’s angry at the city for presuming everyone would play nice and only use the main intersection. “Do they just have their heads in the sand that people are using technology?” she said. Hallenbeck likens it to efforts to dam small streams. “The water often finds a new route around the dam. And that's what is happening in San Francisco. People are finding a new path of least resistance.” Neighbor Lexi Olian isn’t enjoying being part of that downstream effect. She’s now seeing cars on side streets that used to be empty except for people who actually lived on those blocks. “Everybody’s talking about how great walkable communities are,” she says. “ But they won’t be walkable if traffic is zooming through.” The intersection of Bosworth and Diamond Streets in San Francisco, where City planners have worked to calm traffic by removing car lanes.

By Sara Benson & Lucie Young, Telegraph Travel's San Francisco experts. Click on the tabs below for the best places to stay, eat, drink and shop, including what to do on a short break. Why go? San Francisco is one of America’s great walking cities. With a good pair of shoes and a Muni ticket (see Getting around, below), you can see almost everything in the city. Nature is a great part of the draw. San Francisco sits at the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, with lots of walking and cycling trails all along the waterfront from the Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park. A short hop across the Golden Gate Bridge are Sausalito, Point Reyes National Seashore and Muir Woods. The city is also renowned for its radical thinking and activism. It spawned the hippie movement, the Sixties’ ‘Summer of Love’ and the gay rights movement, while nearby Berkeley in the East Bay was the birthplace of the Free Speech and “locavore” (local food/sustainability) movements.

To many Americans, San Francisco is the nation’s food and wine capital. Berkeley chef Alice Waters of Chez Panisse fame started the farm-to-table obsession here in the 1970s. The city is now awash with excellent restaurants, while its proximity to the Sonoma and Napa Valleys means that, in less than two hours, travellers can enjoy tastings at some of the best wine estates in the country. Those who dine out in the city also can sip some of California’s finest vintages, many of which are not exported across state lines. When to go As the apocryphal Mark Twain saying goes, “The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.” It is a common tourist faux pas to think June, July and August are going to be warm in San Francisco. It is usually the season of fog, strong winds, unexpected chills and tourists shivering in shorts and T-shirts.

Winter temperatures are only 15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than summer (although it can be considerably rainier). Where to go Everyone who visits San Francisco should play outdoors along the waterfront: walk the Embarcadero, drop by the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, and board a boat to Alcatraz (aka ‘The Rock’). Get lost for a few hours in Golden Gate Park, where top-notch art and science museums await. Hop on one of the city’s iconic cable cars, then keep going to the Mission District, packed with trendy restaurants, boutique shops, and bars.

Local laws and etiquette Always have your passport and driver’s license with you when driving in the US, in case you get stopped by police. You can turn right at a red traffic light (provided you come to a complete stop first, and there is no oncoming traffic and no contradictory sign saying “no turn on red”). In most American cities, you have to park with your car pointing in the direction of the traffic on the correct side of the road; otherwise you will be ticketed and fined. Also, avoid parking within 15ft of a fire hydrant.

What is going to happen with Dont'a Hightower and his contract negotiations with the Patriots. Will the Patriots trade Jimmy G this off season and will the Patriots trade for Brandin Cooks. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. For a lot I'll get back to your phone calls keep coming 617. 77979837. I mentioned the Mexico championship. Spots got a little boy then Dustin Johnson. McIlroy Mickelson gets beat trying to get back get it. Could be an interesting in that. Sunday in the final round match. A championship and I'm not here to talk golf all afternoon and neither is. My Giuliani from Comcast sports net new laying on the joins me over the phone right now to talk some football. What's up Mike I don't there. Are not much. At the report that. You probably just heard remain in the trending now. Which I did not expect to be talking about it I did not expect to be talking about the patriots trying to trade for Brandon cooks. Have you heard any thing on this interest. But the patriots reportedly have in trying to acquire the lawless saints wide receiver Brandon Cox. Not Lebanon with a partner alternate obviously it duplicated. The report strong new earlier reduce the Austin community. Patriots and offered in Holland when their shopping calendar round. The Texans are hot in the they looked engagement that are wide receiver corps. And I wanted to make somewhat of an impact air. And we were well. And ignited. That telecheck and seen up close and personal a couple of years now. In him in the summertime you know the joint practices. Golden West Virginia and the Europeans in Foxboro. Then you read about the accident and I planned. Two times a year like tomatoes and it is so I needed depth and situations where. I'm not been done to brought it to the right candidate beat someone do one of those teams that would be inquired about. Well I guess maybe I should every phrase that the fact of the patriots would be interested in courts. I mean if all the patriots I would be too I get to my surprise com is why we're talking about this is that it does seem like. No lawns is willing to move coach I would in his contract they have money control. I think for two more years right given next year and then is. It is a club option on him I just eat what did three years old why would this say it's even been questioned. Well you are hard to get your other audio receivers down there and that they like each arm and took him a little bit. Post number one receiver touched it and. Can be difficult to handle at times in these claims about people little bit bled about number it'd. So. Don't eat and how the other and chomping at the he didn't help elsewhere that's him he could not sensibly. I'm probably committed begun its there's somebody out there and the city written. Order form ten. Don't feel like we're in a situation where our are gonna suck all that much even though he has. Very talented receiver. Yeah you know what are you mentioned the stock split with coach and his frustration at times with his role the offense and and you look at the numbers that he puts up you would think that. You know did additionally no frustration with his early offense and ended the numbers jump jump off the page and anybody who watches the kid play is all to tell the world. And his speed jumps off the screen so I was a little shocked somebody called in earlier while I was wondering why would know wall in its. Even be listening for deal for caught somebody called up. With this story this past season which the saints won they beat the rams. And cooks was frustrated with his role in the offense he didn't have any receptions the saints scored 49 points and I have the this story in front I mean not all I read so much data I was I was not aware of this from Brandon Cox and maybe that's just a fantasy football sodomy speak up what I mean. I feel like I'd pay enough attention to the NFL with something like this would would jump out of the and it didn't really I hadn't heard of this. I mean is this some of the mill if this is a thing wouldn't that mean that he isn't a patriots I. You know what are you how many times have been made and where we sit our nose. How are our community and even though mark how I obtained this past year you know he didn't seem like he's their kind of guy. I don't want to roll the dice on on players like death because they had the talent level and be because like pretty much every other program may feel like. Oh yeah here. It'll be different noted our rock Wheaton control and that's why. Whatever he needs. Feel like you know even as much a part of the yacht certainly won't would be yeah I think that. Don't ever shot at doing that stuff never shadow went from being. Unconventional incumbent who approaches in this kind of fallout after. Yeah and I guess if you wanted to point it's a coach and his frustrations and. And people say well it's it's asked to do with his nominees and all that but I mean since he's been and then the saints have finished I think seven and nine. The last three years and he meant it is some frustration. Which is not being a very good football team till right. I don't think there's any question about that I think commitment program and. From a college that they're so. You know obviously knowing my. I thought it was coming into it to prison where. This team was going to be ultra competitive every year. We are you know it's seven and 7979. And. I've seen other other teens how certain certainly there to the student Summers where he's gone into patriots. A look at talk and thought that a market to football and I got over there. And now digital Alter that held them but knowing that you are consistently and the other 1213 fourteen when it. Spiegel by GI from Comcast sports net new Englander I joins me over the phone right now we're talking some patriots in Mike when I see this report to the patriots. Have tried to. Trade for Brandon collection it will to give up the number 32 overall pick. And the saints decline. It did report also says the pictures wanted to pick in return from the saints they wanted to saints begin on coach and pick the 32 overall maybe it is more to that. I just have from the saints in a debt are stuck they do crazy Mike has I stuck they can while. Maybe the saints believe the patriots are gonna. Debt number twelve overall from Cleveland and then they'll have the conversation he said he gonna give us a first round pick will take twelve instead of 320. I stuck bagel maybe that's why the patriots maybe leaks upmanship that it cannot penetrate a drop off. Maybe that's up to do it negotiations on another trip on a crazy right now Mike does not think about the patriots are gonna trick grapple. And I think they're gonna get a first round pick from regardless of what's been reported. Should this interest in coach and you know ice not ice I think and you know maybe there's something bigger than just trading grapple maybe there's another another piece yet all this mean holly you peace in all this together. This offseason with the grapple stop now. Added to the to the coach report. Well. Look mighty. My Intel on Mayan calendar lol. And the patriots remain the same and I don't you know I'm not acting seated on. Abductor because there is nobody more like penalties and then he. But you know same got to upload ordered on the Monday after an injury and adults and that it was. It's interviewed in older adults can't play that aren't again. Protections and that was it's never gonna happen and you know I want to talk about widgets you trading commission and its lead in. Does it. Work dungy can get burned and so did not about. Tony didn't. I haven't been used by the patriotism and having that that app and Yemen. Buddhists. I don't think they've gotten all that they wanna do it for there to make it sound like well where I won't nominate such maturity and I think that is more or less. What you got thrown our way. Doesn't come close or absence or and to meet that price line and went you know we are. War tension and to on the roster and on the team. Because. Without control of the year anyway. And mutual too if you want to idled plant. You know mob money following next year well. Story you know this is not on stare and I don't think that they didn't want it back capital. Albeit a little bit different situation because Brady. Had to you know most mean infection and all that but. Note that a quarterback export your soul and digital content. And. And shirt absolute. Power I'm prominent member court out there are kind of treatment but I I don't think it. They're big screen let everybody know what you thrown out so ardent but I mean crap and he hit it but you wanna pry it off and. Yes so it's clearly came from the patriots I mean it's that's my opinion sounds like you bleed the same thing. And nick. It's clear that there's a method to the patriots madness when it comes to what day. Had beat a Ben off in all what they want to be offered in the future for grapple Michael nastiness and Spiegel my GI from Comcast sports net New England. In your opinion what would be the best strategy for the patriots would impede. Why do you think. They should move grapple all right I'll. I hear them talk about Mac and I didn't warm and yes content. Because. There is little to control would be the key going to be trading warm. On. So. You clearly going to be a little pride more from now that you wait until next student. Amid franchise. And didn't you know. Franchise and. Everybody else. Brady continues to play at this level considered lucky not keep all those guys and have 4550 million of them now at one position quarterback. Pick when it suddenly a backup quarterback. And. Mean you saw. Talk among the key capital unit cabinet colleague. Gotta check out you also it will not credible and that was kind of adopt it. They wanted to get ready for it to go to this last year contract but that's. I can get root language. If you take one and here you're here next year note that. There's two things but the patriots the first thing is I you got to commit to Brady I think they should. Not and I think. I think they will I just think that seems to be the obvious negative that's gonna happen next question is. Or you know does go raw apple wants to get back up for the Packers quarterback and this is some Walesa. If he can be just got a quarterback for an out of a team right now he would be an end. And what makes this so easy to me. And and then it's you know common sense is that you move on. Is pickle rubble on the opportunity. Accurate it's time to walk because he does wanna be a backup quarterback Mike. So just that fact if you commit to Brady and you know brothel can walk then no brainer trip ever know. Expected to meet this isn't over this is just good common sense you trigger up all right now. Evidently that your wallet you know he is ready export. And while he talked about my own sordid side and log showed no signs of slowing down the last couple years. Left pretty. That's help fight off the decline nearing an end up being a quarterback penalty and are in the conversation over the last three years. The bit he's forty and no one's done before at that level and done it consistently. And you feel like you'd. On Barack little. These. Stunned. Can be your franchise quarterback and. 81012 years. Are you ready to let him walk out the dual war. I'm knowing how difficult it seriously trying to quarterbacks Matt target that would be to double that yeah I'm an argument completely out of there and about why some rational for New England now would be to meet the rationale but got 270 yards or out again that the mine adult and getting hurt. And you'll reduce my number well it. Well number well it's so are you willing. Stated that it's. Aberration and he can walk out door and you can find the next guy and on the road or maybe the next guy on set war used to hang. The party do definitely. This guy's the real deal and are we gonna bet on our data and 41 trend can't start next year or another. To read for odd years maps and yes. If you're gonna make your argument. Keeping them that you are. Iowa the patriots have more to think of engines that and that potential move. On a potential trade of drop below dish ops she's an idea sub telecheck. Is that the Columbine right now although when it comes the guys who are in the league and I could be free agency when the new league year begins its I believe what is march 9. You know they didn't put the franchise tag on Donte' high Tolle I don't I kind of expected them to do that they didn't. What's your reaction then not put the tag on ital and do you think that's just shy and net that he's gone automatically. I think you're trying to do are they also I know where they are Newt's you know. There was not a on the table prior to deceive in there and and I'll think about it it was only a clerical only gone out. Because it was a huge part in piecing together. Mitch just what you're not futurity Collins and obviously. Tell him that he had the Super Bowl media sort of I but he didn't gotten team. Actually it does do it. More relaxed. After city. With the idea. And it went in Milan communication don't gonna continue to talk year over this next few days and we're gonna you can talk what you get into the thrill seekers. And we're we're hopeful that there are gonna. Now I are committed to come back to damage today. The people we got. Can continue match you gave the ball our tax in a totally straight. But I must feel pretty good about and at least human opportunity. Let it get to this point because. It is number Ahmad Ali they have an. Under the cap on. Actual dollar weakened stagnant talk and number they are about sixty million dollars that there for you on create and you. The speech he. Are so I want to say why can't franchise in the sixty million whatever number was 148. Our pro linebacker because Ian and I doubt I'd linebacker in the league shouldn't shouldn't delineate that way. Gone up so much on the look at secret contract because it's RD. A bargain for Carolina beaten term results what you would pay more clarity about it so. I think when you look at adult in the argument that it made that 91. Season because you could afford it ignited once even. And controlled so that must deal at least. So I content that it didn't impact on the table. One also had done at least one more runner. Andre it's easy for immediate notice to sit there and say you know this is what the patriots should do I mean. You know don't worry about other contracts don't warn about the cap but this is the patriots are talking. And and I guess the way I feel about it is if he goes out and gets a big offer from someone which I think he I think he probably will. I mean based on the plays he's made late in the last couple Super Bowls he's been and I guess I look at patent. I have a hard time believing the patriots are well okay not on the ruling matchup would you you know what anymore that I use I I feel like that's not the way this thing is gonna play out. Look I'm I'm I would say you're out immediate. The chain has returned and about 3035%. That I did something obsolete knock him off at bats without walker. That he's gonna. And I are on and no to. Eight and the combatant patent that route and meet and wouldn't you know whatever odd million of that hole number war. You get within four million guaranteed of that. And that's not going to be enough I mean you don't want to dump out. Am. In terms it's. All the things that I've gotten to know about shareholder time and. I reported in the spring last year you want to pay just like Colin did but not awkward. 21 of those situations where so much better here than anywhere outside I'm. I am willing to take less. To date year significantly less. That you're not one of those guys. I'm not all include that at all athletes at all agreed to give you opportunity. To get paid. 99.9. Percent of registered in a decade. I'm also. Grind it seat bin and it kind of telecheck. Collapsed. Nine year I believe it is. It is a lot to ask global player. And you can win elsewhere. Now consistently you can win here but maybe there's a place where a little bit easier. Profitable but he year over the course the year candidates here and that was about it and so. You know but you use from the south. I like what are you need I believe me you don't do you sort of the parade he said. I'd sit Nicole. Column. I just think. And I I think someone down there. Some of them not maybe Tennessee would be at risk and obviously they don't well Robinson this year agreement now run their program are not come parks. At some gum ball more and and you're going to be scrambling to find a middle linebacker. A chip in Spiegel by GRE Comcast sports and laying on my should the patriots. Should Dave play our ties. Bennett anyway like should they make him a priority in any way. Or is that going to be the same thing like she would in no debt and come back to us and it's reasonable match hit an ice on the on the same page with high at all as you just said Eddie eagle somewhere somebody opposite big money and the descendants can have would panic. In a goes out upper big money I bought out and somebody might do that would Logan Ryan. And I think these guys are all gonna come back to the patriots will say. A lot. We can win without it. And while there will be some frustration. Inside with me goal and just they somebody. There's also the other side of me that knows. At the patriots whenever they do this this seemingly right. They can't win without these guys put do you think that it isn't the same situation like he's gonna go out get a big contract or at least get a big off that comeback the patriots and it will just be too big. For the pats to match. Yeah I'd again gone and it Logan Ryan gone. I wouldn't be surprised that. Our men and gone. It does need an eight year. You know. How did they were reluctant batted it to them just in terms of equipment plant that Lendl. Mirror and mr. Wimbledon she didn't have panicked and did not gotten one player to injuries. I don't take that date course in values where is that he's going to be in the open our. Actually. Look it's either brother been very outspoken owner Michael as he talked about getting every dollar and it's that important. Arm and I don't buy or I just think that. What Republican or an assist for him it's probably relaxed deal chant payday. I'm at at thirty and you can go to lo and Ryan is gonna get absolutely. I think they don't want it by talking or use forty million welcome look at them someplace we never thought I would ever go at him. You look at the marquis de available all. These teams would create the and you look at some of the players didn't even make the market. A ward of the franchise tag or extension. Emissions Lockett came to have money to spend don't have disciplined today. He now works that even in the market and even when the context continue to go up he's not an ally. There's going to be a schemer Newt gonna day. Nuclear Hopkins greet you you suitors include don't know in the global and cynical and bring in Agence. Yeah you know what I expect works that's worked for forty. That's gonna happen so. And you know it reduced some Erica that. Earnestly implement critical error wrote a big Star Jones. You don't know that turned out these disastrous first year I think that's part of the reason why they drafted in the first round I think. Yet we partnered to rock ones are included it's dark and Nancy. I Arnold and he's Ryan usually an easy capital but it just. Carol incompetent political play out. I'd finally and I know I'm I'm just asking is because I know all. Unaudited tweets from people whose you just. Did an average we are you talked about rubble of what. You don't believe that need to grapple and children yemenite. Had anything to go with him being traded I think they should trade don't put my you know they added that it's an advocate that I had nothing to do the trade right. Yeah. And at all to sense to tackle a lot faster I love I look good you know Danny in the out Rihanna you know big ugly guys about it all the got out of all the things got out. We mean are all armed and have you along time ago that. Number that the idea that this. And incompetent that demand. Crazy world of social media he has my G Gotti Comcast sports net laying on Mike great stuff thanks a lot RT so. I'd like you got it right there great stuff as always and Alec talk and patriots stock and garrote all but. It's also talking about Brandon Cox. Have you not heard the report. You haven't I'll get some orbit at this final.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry 2016 Growth, Trends, Analysis and Market Research Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry 2016 Growth, Trends, Analysis and Market Research Posted on March 6, 2017 by ReleaseWire - Latest Press Releases in Press Releases Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 03/06/2017 — The competitive landscape of the global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry is crowded by the presence of a large number of players. The presence of a large number of participants has led to the fragmented nature of the market. Some of the major players operating in the global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry are Cisco Systems Inc., Carestream Health Inc., Carecloud Corp., AGFA Healthcare, IBM Corp., Cleardata Networks, Merge Healthcare Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., and Oracle Corp. "The high level of customization required by various healthcare organizations has resulted in the emergence of a large number of market players with unique expertise," a TMR analyst points out. This level of customized services prevents any form of standardization across the market. Browse Global Strategic Business Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/healthcare-cloud-computing.html Concerns About Data Leakage is a Major Challenge for Market Players Rapid transformations in the healthcare IT sector, coupled with the growing demand for security of access and data integrity have supported the growth of cloud computing in the healthcare industry. "An increasing number of companies are reducing investments in the creation and maintenance of a physical IT infrastructure and are shifting towards cloud computing for easier management of profiles," states TMR. However, data relocation from established systems is a major hiccup in the market's growth during the forecast horizon. Data integration and consistency is also another challenge faced by the market players. The growing concerns pertaining to data leakage have made a number of healthcare providers apprehensive about the adoption of the cloud computing technology. The market players are focusing on the introduction of wireless technologies in cloud computing solutions to allow remote access of data on a real-time basis. The increasing usage of ACOS for data sharing through mobile devices has created ample opportunities for the growth of the market players. PaaS to be Largely Preferred by the Healthcare Industry Among the major service models, the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model is expected to register the highest demand. "Simple application and high rate of deployment are the primary factors driving the demand for the PaaS model," states TMR. The PaaS model does not rely on hardware and software and offers support within the service's lifecycle. Though the market was dominated by the IaaS model in 2011, PaaS is anticipated to generate more revenue in the years to come. The global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry is projected to expand robustly at a CAGR of 21.30% during the period between 2012 and 2018. The market was valued at US$1.82 bn in 2011 and is anticipated to be worth US$6.79 bn by 2018. Download Exclusive Brochure of This Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=802 The information in this review is based on the statistical findings of a report published by Transparency Market Research, titled, "Cloud Computing Market In Healthcare Industry – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Trends And Forecast 2012 – 2018."

In Silicon Valley, where he ran a previous company, he'd be vying for engineers against Google and Facebook. "To compete in that environment for the best talent would be very, very fierce," says Lau. "In a smaller pond we are the bigger fish. That helps us attract the best possible talent." That talent has helped him attract more than $66 million in venture capital and grow his digital community to 45 million users over the last 10 years. With 130 employees and revenue growing 30 percent year-over-year, Lau says, "we are very determined to build this company in Toronto. We have no plan to open up another office elsewhere, except salespeople." Lau is a well-known presence on Toronto's fast-growing start-up scene, where by all accounts excitement about entrepreneurship is percolating as it never has before. There are currently between 2,100 and 4,100 active tech start-ups in Toronto's ecosystem, according to a report by Tech Toronto, a community for entrepreneurs. Toronto and the cities immediately surrounding it had a population of 5.4 million people in 2015. A confluence of factors is shaping the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the fourth-largest city in North America. One driver is the city's engineering talent pool. There are 150,000 full-time students enrolled in universities throughout the Greater Toronto area. In addition, the federal and provincial governments offer strong support for technology innovation and financial assistance. Start-ups are also supported by a robust venture capital community. Getty Images Allen Lau, co-founder and CEO of Wattpad More than $2 billion in venture capital was disbursed in Canada in 2016 — a 15 percent increase over 2016 and the most funding since 2002, when the number hit $2.7 billion, according to the Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association. Toronto has benefited. It was home to Canada's biggest venture deal of 2016. Thalmic Labs, a maker of wearable technologies based in Kitchener, Ontario, near Toronto, corralled $120 million in a series B round in September from investors, including Intel Capital, The Amazon Alexa Fund and Fidelity Investments Canada. With the action showing no signs of slowing and Toronto start-ups standing out in areas such as artificial intelligence, many local players say they're not interested in turning the city into the next Silicon Valley. "I think Toronto at some level really wants to be the first Toronto," says Ameet Shah, a partner at Golden Venture Partners, a seed-stage fund in Toronto whose start-up Five Mobile was acquired by Zynga in July 2011. "We hate being called Silicon Valley North." Paying it forward So why is entrepreneurship percolating in the city now? "It's a convergence of momentum," says Craig Morantz, an angel investor in the Toronto area who previously served as CEO of Kira Talent, a locally based start-up that offers a video admissions platform for colleges. One important catalyst has been the critical mass of successful Canadian tech firms, such as Shopify, Hootsuite, Kik and D2L, with offices in the city, alongside U.S. companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. "You build some anchor-tenant companies, they scale up, and the talent goes on to start other companies," says Mike McDerment, CEO of FreshBooks, an accounting software provider based in Toronto. When this seasoned talent starts companies, a growing number of angels are raring to help them get started. "More money is available at earlier stages — pre-seed, seed and series A," says Shah. With the Silicon Valley market increasingly frothy, deal-hungry venture capitalists, both from within Canada and in the United States, have also cast eyes on Toronto. "Motivated U.S. investors realize there are some really great companies up here — and are coming looking for them," says Mark MacLeod, founder of SurePath Capital Partners, a strategic advisory firm to the global small-business software market based in Toronto. He is often contacted by investors looking to check out interesting companies in the city over a day or two — which he says is easy to arrange. "Motivated U.S. investors realize there are some really great companies up here — and are coming looking for them." -Mark MacLeod, founder of SurePath Capital Partners "Capital doesn't really care about borders," says McDerment. "It's a really good environment to make an investment." His firm raised $30 million in 2014 from Oak Investment Partners, a firm with offices in Palo Alto, California, and Greenwich, Connecticut, with participation from Atlas Ventures in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Georgian Partners, a Toronto firm. And as more area start-ups evolve into scale-ups and get acquired, local entrepreneurs have developed a greater sense of what is possible, say observers. McDerment points to Bump Technologies' acquisition by Google in 2013 and Rypple's acquisition by Salesforce in 2011. "The thing people don't know about Toronto is how many great exits have happened," he says. Fortunately for fast-growing start-ups, engineers are abundant, thanks to the presence of RIM (Blackberry) and schools such as University of Waterloo, known for its prestigious engineering school, and University of Toronto. And it costs less to hire them than comparable professionals from Silicon Valley. "I can hire a very senior Canadian engineer for $70,000 U.S. dollars," says Morantz. "You can't even get someone to return your call in New York or Boston unless it's $100,000 or $200,000." Kevin Van Paassen | Bloomberg | Getty Images Employees of Wattpad Technology meet in their company's kitchen space in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It helps that Toronto's cost of living is lower than that of New York's pricier tech hubs. "Although it's not a cheap city to live, it's still affordable," says Morantz. "It's not San Francisco. It's not New York." Toronto is also very diverse, with 49 percent of the population made up of immigrants, according to Tech Toronto. "Having that kind of diversity helps you build great companies," says Morantz. "When you've got someone who is maybe first or second generation, they are coming to the table with a unique perspective." The city also has a thriving infrastructure to nurture start-ups, with hubs including DMZ, a technology incubator at Ryerson University, and MaRS, which helps connect start-ups in information and communications technology, cleantech and health with funding and advice. "The communities in the last two to three years have really matured," says Kevin Kimsa, general partner at ScaleUP Ventures, a venture fund in Toronto. "It has really acted as a catalyst for more innovation to hit the ground running." More from iCONIC: Baltimore is making a $5 billion bet that entrepreneurs can revive the city Billionaire closer to mining the moon for trillions of dollars in riches CEO who turned $345 into $30 million: Stop drooling over Silicon Valley and get to work Toronto's entrepreneurial ecosystem still has some obstacles to cross. Other than OMERS Ventures, the venture capital arm of Canada's largest pension fund, and Georgian Capital, "there is not a ton of late-stage capital," says MacLeod. "Most of the companies that are really into expansion will need to raise that capital from the U.S." But at the moment, that doesn't seem to be deterring any start-up activity. "Something has really changed the last couple of years," says Ben Baldwin, founder of ScaleDriver, a Toronto management consultancy that advises executives on building innovation, and founder of the Founder City Project, a network of start-up and scale-up founders. "Canadians are kind of rubbing their hands together like evil scientists," he said. "They are going to make a major impact." — By Elaine Pofeldt, special to CNBC.com show chapters This tech start-up lets you try out for your job, before you get an offer    Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 | 10:27 AM ET | 01:09 To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

However, Windows is expensive – especially when compared to free operating systems such as Valve’s SteamOS. SteamOS is based on Steam’s Big Picture mode and can be installed on most PCs. If you are a gamer who prefers a streamlined experience – similar to gaming consoles – a SteamOS gaming machine is a great option. This approach is only recommended for dedicated gaming systems, as SteamOS does not have as much functionality as Windows or Linux systems. We have outlined everything you need to know about building your own SteamOS gaming console below, including hardware selection, pricing, and available games. Hardware requirements SteamOS requires a 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, and 200GB of storage. The budget build we put together meets the minimum requirements and will be able to handle most games in 1080p. The Intel Pentium G4560 dual-core processor is a great value chip, and its hyper-threading and high clock speeds make it perfect for a budget gaming build. We paired it with a Radeon RX 470 – a powerful graphics card with good overclocking potential and value. Both an SSD and hard disk drive were included, as the performance gained from running your OS on an SSD is worth the extra cost. Steam Console Build Component Pricing Motherboard Gigabyte H110M-HD2 R932 Processor Intel Pentium G4560 3.5GHz R1,096 Memory Corsair ValueSelect 8GB DDR4 2,133MHz R941 Graphics Card HIS Radeon RX 470 IceQ OC 4GB R2,899 Hard Drive Western Digital 1TB 7,200RPM R757 SSD Samsung 750 Evo 120GB SATA6G R872 Power Supply Antec VP500P 500W R637 Case CoolerMaster MasterBox Lite 3 R666 Total Price R8,800 SteamOS and Peripherals Installing SteamOS is straightforward and the operating system is compatible with most modern hardware. Follow the steps below to install the free operating system on your PC. Download SteamOS Unzip the SteamOS file to a formatted FAT32 USB stick. Insert the USB stick into your target machine and boot off the stick. Make sure you select the UEFI entry, it may look something like “UEFI: Patriot Memory PMAP”. Select “Automated install” from the menu. The rest of the installation will automatically repartition the drive and install SteamOS. Once SteamOS is installed, your system will automatically reboot and create a backup of the system partition. Once you have set up your Steam console, you can set up your peripherals – such as controllers and audio devices. Controller options include Valve’s Steam Controller or an Xbox 360/One controller – which are supported by SteamOS. Game Library The library of games available for SteamOS is constantly growing, with triple-A and indie games porting to the system from Windows. There are currently over 2,200 titles which work with SteamOS. If you are an avid game collector and purchase a variety of titles, you might find yourself limited by the smaller collection of games available. For “casual” gamers or those on a budget, the limitations of the platform will not deter you.

Kaby Lake is the latest version of Intel's 14nm microarchitecture, and the last but one before we hopefully see 10nm processors appear. But for now, we have Kaby Lake, offering improved clock speeds over Skylake chips, better performance from faster clock speed changes during use, and an improved graphics core, which is clocked faster and supports 4K streaming. It takes a while for new chips to make their way into products. Typically we get desktop processors first, and in that regard Kaby Lake impresses with a 7GHz overclock. But now Zotac is embracing them, and putting passively cooled Kaby Lake processors inside its tiny ZBOX Nano desktop PC range. The Zotac ZBOX Nano sits inside a case measuring just 5.76-by-4.98 inches and only 2.36 inches deep. It makes for a great media streaming box to hide away, or can happily sit mounted on the back of a monitor. Zotac added four Kaby Lake Nano PCs to its range, carrying the names CI547 Nano and CI527 Nano, with PLUS variants also available. The CI547 uses an Intel Core i5-7200U dual core processor clocked at 2.5GHz with Turbo boosting that to 3.1GHz on demand. The CI527 uses an Intel Core i3-7100U dual core processor clocked at 2.4GHz with no Turbo frequency available. In both cases, Intel HD Graphics 620 is used to allow for up to 4K resolution. Two DDR4 SODIMM slots allow for up to 32GB of RAM running at 2133MHz. Related Zotac GeForce GTX 1050 Mini Zotac GeForce GTX 1050 Mini The PLUS variants simply add 4GB of RAM, which seems rather pointless to me. If they increase that to 8GB then I'm sure the PLUS models would prove more popular when they launch. Other features of note include an impressive five USB 3.0 ports and two USB 3.1 Type-C ports. There's also Display Port and HDMI, a 3-in-1 card reader, Gigabit LAN, 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.0, and a VESA mounting kit included in the box. And don't forget, Microsoft only officially supports Kaby Lake for use with Windows 10. Zotac originally announced these Kaby Lake Nano PCs at CES in January, but as FanlessTech noticed, only now have they made it on to the Zotac website suggesting pricing and availability will be confirmed very soon.

Cook is telling his employees to â€œkeep moving forward.â€ (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: March 6, 2017 at 5:00 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 1:18 pm That shiny new iPhone may say “assembled in China” on the back, but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the U.S. Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple — the world’s most valuable company — in the bull’s eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration’s actions would affect a who’s who of the Bay Area’s big name tech companies — which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow. “It’s a real mess,” said Marcus Noland, senior vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade. Only two months into the Trump administration, it’s difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish U.S. companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued. While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45 percent import tariff on goods from China and 35 percent on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10 percent fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20 percent “border adjustment tax” covering all imports from all countries. The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley’s biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more. Also standing to lose? Consumers who will inevitably have the increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts. “You and I are going to pay for it,” said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate, who studies supply chains. However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits. Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi last week said the proposed 20 percent border adjustment tax would “encourage Americans to buy American products” and “promote good jobs here in the United States” while raising $1 trillion over 10 years. “It will allow us to cut income taxes, which discourage people from working. It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder,” he said Thursday in an op-ed in The Hill. var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the U.S., potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies. “If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it’s not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward,” said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade. Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank. The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia. “Everything that is in our products comes from overseas,” Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. “That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it’s not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies.” HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, according to analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos. Google’s new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Santa Clara’s Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the U.S. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam. It’s not just companies making tangible products that are at risk. Even a software-and-services company like Oracle is vulnerable to tariff-related retaliation, because it has invested heavily in providing IT services in China, where its clients include state-owned enterprises. The Chinese government, on top of potentially responding tit for tat to tariffs or taxes, could bar state-owned companies from doing business with U.S. firms, said the Peterson Institute’s Noland. Companies that make some products in the U.S. won’t escape, either. They too would be vulnerable to an all encompassing import levy, such as the proposed border adjustment tax, because they use materials or parts from other countries. While only Congress can levy across-the-board tariffs, a U.S. president has “limited authority” to impose tariffs in response to “special circumstances involving discrimination against U.S. exports or other unfair trade practices,” said John Veroneau, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who served as deputy U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. Trump has complained that other countries make the U.S. pay high tariffs and taxes on American products shipped overseas. The president’s focus on China and Mexico targets two nations that play critical roles in the supply chains for major U.S. electronics firms, so high import tariffs aimed at those countries would “immediately disturb the supply networks,” Noland said. Retaliatory tariffs would mean American companies could be faced with added costs for shipping high-end, U.S.-made components to China or Mexico for final assembly, before getting hit again when they import the assembled products back into the U.S., Noland said. A full-blown trade battle with China could lead to a “supply chain war” in which the Asian nation bans exports to the U.S. of the metallic elements used in electronics manufacturing, which would “hurt U.S. electronics firms,” a September report from the Peterson Institute said. China could potentially ban the sale of specific American tech products, claiming security issues and saying, for example, “You can’t sell Apple phones in China, because we’re worried about — and then they’d make something up,” Georgia Tech’s Vande Vate said. Conflict between the U.S. and China over trade could spread to other areas, potentially affecting American firms’ access to Chinese talent, Noland said. “A trade war that started with products,” Noland said, “could spill into things like visas and immigration issues, which would disadvantage the entire high tech sector.” ___________________________________________________________ Other threatened companies and their products Tesla has a long-term contract to buy lithium mined in Mexico for the batteries it makes domestically. Cisco announced last year it was expanding manufacturing in Mexico, where it has operated since 1993. HP has production facilities in Mexico, according to market-intelligence firm BNamericas. Bay Area companies SanDisk and Intel are among semiconductor companies make chips domestically that are sent to Asia to be wired up for installation onto circuit boards that are imported back to the U.S., according to Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate.   Tags:  Apple Cisco Donald Trump Google tariff Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

Sci-Tech by Stephen Shankland March 5, 2017 9:00 PM PST @stshank Enlarge Image IBM's quantum computer looks nothing like a classical machine. IBM In a few years, the same quantum computing concepts that gave Albert Einstein the heebie-jeebies could help Amazon deliver your toothpaste faster. That's because IBM, the company that surprised the world in 1989 by spelling its name with 35 xenon atoms, is launching a business built on the weird science of quantum computing. Thirty-five years of research into the physics of the freakishly tiny is about to start paying its first dividends with real-world customers. "We will be providing access to quantum systems for selected industry partners starting this year," said Scott Crowder, who's leading the handoff of the quantum computing work from IBM Research to the IBM Systems product team. A lot is riding on quantum computing. It offers fundamental breakthroughs that could help bring back the good old days of steadier computing progress. Why is today's smartwatch as powerful as last century's refrigerator-size mainframe? Chalk it up to Moore's Law, which describes the reliable pace of chip improvements across the decades. But some computing progress has stalled, which is why a 2017 laptop doesn't get work done much faster than one from 2012. "Moore's Law is struggling," Crowder said. But quantum computers will complement traditional computers, not replace them. "It'll do the pieces of the problem the classical computer can't." Quantum computers, which take advantage of the peculiar behavior and properties of atoms, are notoriously hard for even physicists to comprehend. But quantum computing is bubbling up at university and government labs, startups such as Rigetti and D-Wave, and the research arms of Microsoft, Intel and Google. Enlarge Image Scott Crowder, chief technology officer of IBM's systems group, discusses the exponential advantages of quantum computing. Stephen Shankland/CNET The science is still in its infancy, but even as it matures, you shouldn't expect a quantum-powered iPhone. IBM's quantum computer must be cooled to a fraction of a degree away from absolute zero, a temperature colder than outer space, so its innermost niobium and aluminum components aren't perturbed by outside influences. The cooling alone takes days. That's why IBM customers will tap into quantum computers over the internet, not tuck them under their desks or plug them into the company data center. Cheap fertilizer, better security What kinds of work are quantum computers good for? Early efforts will figure out how to use quantum computers effectively and reliably -- kicking the tires, in effect. After that, though, should come gains like these: quantum chemistry work that could predict how molecules like new medicines interact; logistics projects to figure out the most efficient way to ship packages during the holiday shopping season; and new forms of security that rely on quantum physics instead of today's prevailing approach using math problems too hard to solve in a given period of time. Enlarge Image IBM's quantum computing lab. IBM One specific quantum chemistry example: Factories need lots of expensive energy to make fertilizer, but microscopic bacteria do the same thing much more efficiently somehow. "We don't understand how that reaction occurs," said Jerry Chow, manager of IBM's experimental quantum computing team. A quantum computer helps people understand what's really going on at the molecular level instead of fumbling around with trial-and-error experiments, Chow said. IBM believes quantum computers also will let investors better understand financial data and risks. And the budding field of artificial intelligence could get a boost in situations where computers must make decisions without much information. The common thread for quantum computing tasks is rapid analysis of a huge number of possible scenarios. That strength will, for one thing, be able to crack today's encryption by testing a colossal list of possible numbers to find which ones are mathematical keys that'll unlock private data. Jerry Chow, manager of IBM's experimental quantum computing team Stephen Shankland/CNET Don't hold your breath, though. That ability is still "really far away," Crowder said. Meanwhile, governments and businesses are developing new quantum-proof algorithms. Just plain weird The quantum era will add a thicket of new jargon to computing vocabulary. Brace yourself for cryogenic isolators, Josephson junctions and decoherence. For processing data, "and" and "or" logic gates from classical computing are joined by Hadamard gates and Pauli-X gates from quantum computing. At their core, quantum computers store data with "qubits" -- quantum bits. Classical computers work by manipulating conventional bits, small units of data recorded as either a 0 or 1. A single qubit, by contrast, can store both 0 and 1 overlaid through a quantum peculiarity called superposition. Superposition, combined with another quantum weirdness called entanglement, means that multiple qubits can be ganged together with exponential benefits to how much data they can store and process. A single qubit can store two states of information -- 0 and 1 at the same time -- while two qubits can store four states, three can store eight states, four can store sixteen and so on. All that overlapping data stored in the same qubits lets quantum computers explore many possible solutions to a problem much faster than conventional computers -- finding which two integers multiply together into a huge number in encryption, say, or the fastest way to deliver a lot of packages. But even then there are many practical difficulties. For example, the answer to a computing problem can be tucked away in one particular combination of 1s and 0s among many stored through superposition in entangled qubits. But the act of reading data from qubits "collapses" all the qubit states into a single collection of 1s and 0s -- and not necessarily the right one that holds the answer. So yes, it's complicated. Learning the ropes Enlarge Image A 200mm silicon wafer houses IBM quantum-computing chips with 5 qubits apiece. Stephen Shankland/CNET It'll be a long time before programmers learn the ropes for quantum computing. That's why IBM, Microsoft and Google offer simulated quantum computers. More ambitiously, IBM in 2016 opened access to a website called Quantum Experience that lets outsiders noodle with a real 5-qubit quantum computer. A laptop can't simulate more than about 30 qubits, Crowder said. In the next few years, the IBM Q quantum computers will move to 50 qubits -- each a patch of niobium atoms hooked to its comrades with specialized aluminum wiring. The real business breakthrough comes when companies can build quantum computing into their operations. That'll require about a thousand qubits, Crowder said. Another big threshold could arrive with about a million qubits, enough to overcome problems with errors undermining calculations. Those errors are more of a problem with quantum computing than classical computing. "Fault tolerance is hard in a quantum system. You're going to need a lot of qubits," Crowder said. "That's probably at least a decade-plus away." So maybe your toothpaste will arrive faster. But not anytime soon.

So, what will it take to make sure you’re on next year’s list? With a fight for the very best talent raging on, it has now become more important than ever for companies to be able to showcase that they are a great place to work. An accolade that boasts about what a great workplace it is certainly helps. On 22 February, the Great Place to Work in Ireland 2017 results were announced and Promed, Cisco and Workday took away the top prizes for best small, medium and large places to work respectively. Liberty IT made the list of best small places to work in Ireland, while AOL made it into the top 10 medium places to work. When it came to the large places to work, Salesforce and Vodafone made it into the top five, while Version 1 and Intel made it into the top 10 great places to work. Bristol-Myers Squibb and PayPal weren’t too far behind, making it into the top 20. How are they chosen? Companies that make the list are more likely to attract the best talent as it is based upon what the current employees say, as well as the companies’ own policies. The survey given to employees is a trust index survey. “It’s a survey of 58 statements, it’s been established for the last 30 years or so,” said Joseph Benkanoun-Greene, digital communications manager at Great Place to Work. “It’s the same methodology behind the Fortune 100 list.” Employees are sent an anonymous survey, in which they answer statements about their company using a Likert scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.

Statements include: ‘Management trusts me to do a good job without looking over my shoulder’, ‘When I look at what we accomplish, I feel a sense of pride’ and ‘Management’s actions match their words’. How can my organisation become a great place to work? The survey makes up two-thirds of the overall assessment, with the final third coming from a culture audit. “There are nine practices where we request a submission from the organisation,” said Benkanoun-Greene. “We recommend that the company puts together an internal team to work on compiling that document,” he said. “We ask them to submit supporting documentation with that.” Benkanoun-Greene said if a company is submitting its employee handbook and it suggests certain diversity practices, they could also submit videos to support these. “There were a couple of organisations that won special awards for having specifically innovative practices.” For example, AOL won a special award for hiring due to their cultural ambassador programme, which created a recruitment process that defined ‘culture fit’. “Organisations don’t have to create policies as robust as the award winners,” he said. “A successful policy could be something as simple as a shared charitable initiative, an acknowledgement of small wins throughout the company or taking time out to welcome new members to the team.” Benkanoun-Greene said the key point of the survey process is that companies can’t become a great workplace unless a clear majority of their employees think it is. “While free food and beanbags can make a company a nice place to work, it won’t make it a great place to work. So, the survey measures aspects like credibility, respect, fairness, pride, and camaraderie.” Tweet Share Email Share More Share Pin This Reddit Related: jobs, Intel, PayPal, Version 1, working life, AOL, Salesforce, Vodafone, employers, BMS, Liberty IT By Jenny Darmody Jenny joined Silicon Republic in 2016 as part of the Careers team.

Everyone has a different perception of what an engineer is, depending on their industry. Those working in construction think of civil and structural engineers. Tech workers will think of software. Those with a science background will think of processes. Engineers Week celebrates all of them. As tech, in particular, has grown exponentially over the last number of years, the role of the engineer has earned increased prominence in the zeitgeist. Suddenly engineers, now synonymous with Silicon Valley cool, have a certain celebrity among other tech roles. Of course, tech is far from holding a monopoly on the ‘engineer’ title, and other sectors hire engineers in droves. Given Ireland’s status as a sci-tech hub – with Dublin’s Silicon Docks, Galway’s biotech cluster and the big pharma companies dotted around the island – engineering roles are prevalent within these borders. For Engineers Week, we’ve taken a look at some of the top companies currently hiring engineers in Ireland, and gathered them here in one handy list.

Ericsson drew crowds at its demonstration at Mobile World Congress 2017. Credit: Ericsson via flickr Most Popular The who's who of 5G are an alliance of global powers acting as both friend and foe. They include operators like Verizon, T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom and AT&T; vendors such as Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei, Samsung and ZTE, which build the tech that would deploy 5G; and chipset manufacturers like Intel and Qualcomm, whose processors power things like smartphones and autonomous cars. Big money to be made on new equipment and services provides a big reason for the companies to team up. "Right now, we are in this pre-standard phase which is always a little bit like the wild west," said Helena Norrman, chief marketing officer at Ericsson. "Standards sometimes may not be equally good for companies because some companies can make more money if they make their own, depending on which businesses they're pursuing." Related Stories Why 5G Will Make Smartphones the Least Interesting Thing in Mobile The Magic of 5G: Faster Web, Less Wire and Innovative Plays for Marketers Without an overall standard, 5G could fail to deliver its promise of a truly connected world. When 2G arrived in the 1990s with no definitive standard, some phones worked only in certain countries or with particular carriers. One influential group in determining the development deadlines and ultimate standards is 3GPP, with members from every part of the world. Participating trade associations and their own members collaborate with their counterparts, but that doesn't mean there are no winners or losers. A company that contributes a key element will not only help align 5G with its business model but be compensated as others in the mobile ecosystem use that intellectual property. Everyone else still benefits from the open standard and accelerated development process. "You pay a certain price for it, but it is all there, it is all open for you to use and everyone can use the same technology, which then brings a lot of scale, which brings down prices for consumers," Ms. Norrman said. "That's really, really different than other industries."

The primary aim of TIP is to bring mobile operators, infrastructure providers, system integrators, and other technology companies together to collaborate on the development of new technologies and reimagine traditional approaches to building and deploying telecom network infrastructure. Operators and the broader telecom industry need to collaborate, be more flexible, innovative and efficient, and TIP looks to help achieve this goal. As a pioneer in telecommunications in the Middle East and Africa, Zain brings vast expertise and resources to the initiative as it will leverage its regional footprint and experience in network deployments across challenging territories to support TIP. TIP is exploring new approaches and technologies across these initial focus areas: access, backhaul, and core and management. The projects within these areas utilize the unique engineering and operational expertise of each member, focusing on developing new technologies and exploring new approaches to deployment in both developed and emerging markets. Each member contributes to the area of its expertise, while learning from others so that together all parties can collaborate and build better, faster, more efficient systems. Advertisement Commenting on becoming a part of the TIP initiative, Scott Gegenheimer, Zain Group CEO said, “It could be argued that scaling traditional telecom infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband data is not moving as fast as it needs to ensure customers receive the mobile experience they demand and deserve. Zain recognizes there isn’t a single solution for this, and that no one company can tackle the problem alone. We firmly believe collaboration in innovation will drive efficiencies in our business and we are keen to be part of such prime opportunities wherever they may arise.” Gegenheimer continued, “Being a staunch advocate of the expansion of connectivity for all, Zain fully appreciates the power the internet has to enhance and empower the communities it serves. There are 4 billion people in the world who still don’t have a data connection and we commend Facebook and the other founding companies for kick-starting TIP. We have high expectations that this initiative will result in bridging the digital divide by greater inclusion, and call on for more of our regional and industry peers to join us in this initiative.” Since the launch of TIP in February 2016, the initiative has achieved numerous milestones including the creation of ‘TIP Ecosystem Acceleration Centers’ that incubate local talent around the world and accelerate product development through support from leading global and local investors. A ‘People and Process Project Group’ was also created in order to develop and share cultural and process transformation best practices that can improve operators’ key metrics. In addition, Facebook contributed Voyager, the industry’s first white-box transponder and IP/MPLS routing solution that was successfully tested. Furthermore, Facebook’s OpenCellular designs and schematics are now fully open source within TIP to accelerate the industry’s ability to provide wireless access in remote areas of the world. Driving a faster pace of innovation in telecom infrastructure is necessary to meet new technology challenges and to unlock new opportunities for everyone in the ecosystem. Flexibility will be key in everything TIP does though and the goal is to allow mobile network systems to evolve without having to start over. Zain, together with other leading industry entities across the globe, are committed to exploring new technologies and approaches that will positively impact mobile users of today and the future.

Joseph Goebbels could not have said it better, the “it” being the inversion of American reality as the nation seeks a further leg up on global hegemony and at the same time cheapens if not degrades its labor force. Liberals feel a sense of outrage, focusing their criticism on much benighted Jeff Sessions, rather than on the emasculation of government, near-destruction of the social welfare sector, a monstrous arms build-up, absolute spoliation of water and other resources, and defying other environmental needs and safeguards, not least the effect of fracking and coal mining on climate change. Liberals, i.e., Democrats, are either unable and unwilling to protest on the systemic level (whatever the issue) or have already become, as complicit partners, a hazily leftwing extension of the Trumpian weltanschauung or consensus forming in the United States. From a Left standpoint, they are a disgrace to human identity and humanitarian ideals, like the Republicans corporatist in assumptions (here a modified hierarchical social order) and militaristic in every fiber of their being, a heritage of anticommunism still subscribed to and intended by their patriotism to remove all stigma to disloyalty. The pusillanimous fight they are putting up against Trump tends to confirm the preceding characterization. By descent I don’t mean final destination arrived at, merely, up until now the circumnavigation of fascism (in its early, more corporatist form, as in the activities and approval of the National Association of Manufacturers, rather than—isolationism quite pronounced—militarism in overt form) beginning in the 1920s. In Europe and Japan there are of course stirrings of fascism in that decade, with Italy actualizing the form, and in the 1930s Germany and Japan truly come into their own in that respect. The source for this development is capitalism, with specific ideologies, now incorporating avowed militarism, becoming rationales for both intra-capitalist rivalries and blunt anti-socialism. With and following World War II, militaristic underpinnings have become a necessitous element in the definition of capitalism, nowhere more clearly seen than in the US. Now, with Trump, circumnavigation around, is turning directly into the penetration of the genuine article. We move, under Trump, as in his address to Congress, from “exploitative capitalism,” the traditional form, to “liar capitalism,” which subsumes into itself the former, yet adds a dimension of ulterior disguise and motive that makes one alert to the prospect of permanent change. Fascism can be many-layered, and, as in Nazi Germany, seemingly less bottomless in depravity, but as I’ve noted elsewhere, it doesn’t require the concentration camp or gas chamber, and primarily, in historical form, it is based ultimately on the close alignment (co-partnership) of capitalism and the state, or more concretely, business and government. In that structural context, the impetus of the first to the second (although a reverse influence is also manifest) is the creation and reinforcement of hierarchy as the organizing principle of the social order. The capitalist class system, already in place, is then superimposed on what becomes a class-state, to defend and replenish of which the military factor springs forth as though by necessity. For fascism to operate, the parallel structures require the degree of integration which renders each of them more internally advanced, the better to complement and reinforce the potential war-provoking tendencies of both. And more, social regimentation as well is a long-term product of class and war (or its constant threat as presented by its leaders). Even without their closeness in a formal sense, we see that each, especially starting with the twentieth century, contains, as a separable factor, the same quest for hegemony and self-aggrandizement having the effect of creating a common, synthesized ruling group. Trump, in all his arrogant innocence—innocence in the sense of ignorance of how devastating his role is, for the destruction of a society that still claims to be a democratic polity—is fairly transparent in the deceptions practiced, measured by the policies already charted or enacted compared with statements he is making (the speech to Congress) or has already made. He is adept at locating the discussion of military strengthening, tax favoritism to giant corporations, the near-destruction of public-school education (only one of several options, with no special tax benefits), and the generalized dismantlement of government, in a context with platitudes about citizenship, patriotism, American greatness, in sum, a demagogic mishmash whose function is, beyond promoting concentrated wealth, deregulation, and national power, the obfuscation pure and simple of all policy making because detrimental to societal democratization and the heading off of the threat of fascism (itself subject to all manner of euphemistic expressions). Let’s turn, then, to the speech. (I am drawing on the prepared text, and may have missed slight alterations or verbal asides—as well as his use of repetition.) Trump begins with a celebration of “our Nation’s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains,” and a philo-Semitism addressing the threat to Jewish community centers and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. High-minded and certainly unobjectionable, save that his framework and appointments—a genuinely white man’s party—and his remarks in defense of Judaism which come down to the ironclad support for Israel, purposely lack a (small-“d”) democratic thrust in relating to each. He follows the tribute with, typical throughout the speech, a splurge of sentiment in which his speechwriters (Bannon? etc.) must have taken delight in their craftsmanship: “Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice—in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. This torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.” The American future converges on Trump, a frightening thought when one considers how he is reaching already to become the Leader, his melding with his followers (it is presumed he speaks for the Nation), the toleration hardly expected to be coming applied to dissident views or, in steamroller mode on his part, resistance and opposition. Thus, he states: “A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.” After more of the same, this wondrous state of mind is joined by hints at military superiority and greatness: “Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world—friend or foe—will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.” In his contemplation of the future (America soon will celebrate its 250th year), he then begins to pull out the stops on his fervent nationalism, his ridicule of past presidents, his claims of generosity in foreign policy: “I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries [outsourcing on the part of the very corporations he praises in the speech and as a constant theme]. We’ve financed and built one global project after another [not to say, his own activities in creating international projects], but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit—and so many other places throughout our land.” Concern for the poor is touching, but it seems contrary to his Billionaire Cabinet, plans for military expansion which directly affect the fate of ameliorating conditions in the inner cities, and his active promotion, the whole weight of his administration, on furthering the inequitable distribution of wealth. And the recriminatory spirit continues, this despite his previous disregard for borders where investment is concerned: “We’ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross [open sesame for anti-immigrant policy and feeling]—and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.” That infrastructure, frequently mentioned in the speech, is the province of privatization, not, like the New Deal, testimony to the will of government to stand on behalf of the public function. Here Trump the megalomaniac speaks up, the undisputed leader of a mass movement bursting the seams of government itself, so vast the groundswell for change as he directs it: “Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest [from the Nazi playbook, making “rebellion” the basis for a popular movement of the dispossessed, and not the rich industrialist or banker], spoken by families of all colors and creeds—families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.” It grew, plain folk angry and on the march: “But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus—as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.” (In all fairness to Trump, this was a somewhat accurate description of the 2016 election, in which the fascistic proclivities of a wide swath of the citizenry came out of the woodwork to give him the nomination and election, provided of course it is also recognized that electorate and candidate each reinforced these proclivities of the other.) He completes the description of political inundation, a tidal wave of Reaction: “Finally, the chorus became an earthquake—and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first—because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN [the form in the transcript]. If this is not a good introduction to incipient fascism, I don’t know what is, as if, to go back, Hitler told the workers (another euphemism, “soldiers in industry”) you are first and foremost a German, divorced from class roots or alternative identities. From there to the aforementioned mishmash, militarism and monopoly capital get somehow lost in the deeds putatively to be accomplished. Thus, “Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land…. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.” Here Trump wants “to update the Nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises.” The honor roll of corporate wealth is presented as exemplification of America First, yet in several cases known previously for their overseas investments: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States [that may be true, to be on the good side of Trump] and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” But none with a practical presence in international economic affairs is going to divest and return home, nor attempt to alter the structure of world capitalism (except as it continues to further US prominence and predominance globally), which is already in America’s favor. In Trump’s bag of rhetorical tricks, we see the inveterate boastfulness, he, the near messiah, flattered by the loyalty of a large public in the maw of false consciousness, take credit for the rise of the market simultaneous with, not coincidentally, drastic cutting of the welfare sector, his supporters cheering “U.S.A.” along the way. Only the military benefits from his priorities and framework of government: “The stock market gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. [I think here of Huey Long’s “Every man a king,” except that Trump operates on a gigantic scale—and Long possibly had some redeeming features, such as eschewing race-baiting in the deep South.] We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter [debatable savings given the record thus far, and, when Trump uses “fantastic,” unlikely to upset the apple cart given his admiration of weapons systems], and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.” Behind the theme of budget savings, however, lies the cardinal demand for deregulation, which opens the way for an attack on the environment: “We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations [the use of working people to camouflage staking out a claim for corporate capitalism], creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency: imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.” The 1 for 2 ruling is, in conception, a veiled effort to destroy, given its arbitrary nature, the regulatory effectiveness of the process—cynicism nonpareil. As for the environment, on pending measures, he says: “We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines—thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs—and I’ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.” Quite a first five weeks of activity, this reminds me of a dystopian vision of FDR’s Hundred Days in microcosm, a vicious approach to what should have been a rebuilding effort of renaissance proportions. Stopping the supply of drugs from entering America becomes the whipping boy for unrelated, or seemingly related, aspects of Trump’s program: obviously, the construction of the wall, but also the purification of domestic America, immigration-controls in general, and job creation. Trump’s get-tough policies represent a top-down framing of injecting totalitarian controls on society, using crime as a catch-all for pretext of embellishing the theme of Fortress America, which implicitly suffuses the speech. He states: “We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth—and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” Then the direct jump: “At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.” Hard to know if he here fuses Mexicans and Muslims from the seven proscribed countries as a unified threat, but the speech constantly invokes a genocidal vision of so-called deplorables or undesirables: “We want all Americans to succeed—but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.” Rule of law is problematic, with the much-feared round-up already in progress. Restoring integrity means, “we will soon begin the construction of a great wall [now Trump, Chinese Emperor] along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.” Trump has not forgotten the presumed Muslim threat: “Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.” In fact, he sees that practically lurking under every bed: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country,” and then there are attacks “in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.” And so, “[i]t is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.” Spoken like a true patriot. Trump is on the job, having issued orders for the “Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS,” impose “new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program,” and reaffirm “our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel,” all of this immediately followed by a tribute to the late Antonin Scalia, whose wife sat in the gallery. As he approaches the closing, his speech takes on a current of hyper-nationalism, achieved through criticism of previous, especially Obama’s, administrations. The gloves are off: “Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.” Perversely, these are the very facts which give a lie to what he hopes to accomplish, given his failure to consider any but rightist proposals for societal improvement: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.” To boot, “we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.” Much of which Trump criticizes could be said by a radical, on unemployment and a consequent maldistribution of wealth, except that his premise for constructing and justifying the criticism is the near-irrefragable principle (to him) of privatization, the self-evident goal in displacing the welfare and/or regulatory functions of government. We have no assurance that each problem he cites would not fare still worse under his aegis. He even calls at this point for bipartisan cooperation in advancing his agenda: solving the foregoing, “and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.” With that flourish, we now, but briefly, find the emphasis on antigovernment privatization: “But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy [as though it was in the hands until now of nefarious socialists]—making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.” To sugar the pot, Trump adds: “Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world [a dubious assertion]. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so that they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. [Fortress America is not the abandonment of foreign markets. Autarky here has an expansive dimension of growth.] At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.” Both workers and the middle class provide buffers against the government’s getting too close in the regulation of these companies. Complaining about high tariffs placed on American goods, yet “when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing,” Trump, using Harley Davison (“they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House”) for illustration, he lambastes other countries for their protective tariff, proclaiming: “I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE [caps in the original transcript].” By now his message is clear: the wall to protect against immigrants is analogous to the wall sealing America from global restrictions by its aggressive business and military leaders, this through leaping over economic battlements without fear of retaliation. He wants the adoption of a merit-based system of immigration, infrastructural improvement, citing Eisenhower’s record on the interstate highway system, and, on rebuilding, the observance of two principles: Buy American, and Hire American. This he attaches to what is quite different: “Tonight, I am calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice [privatization], increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. None of these is, or will be, shown for likely adoption. Of course, instead, again privatization: “Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. [That compulsory in practice?] The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do…. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges—leaving America with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken.” Not a word on the public option or sIngle-payer system, which would go a long way to correcting the present high costs and his other complaints, freedom of choice, another barrier, ideological in nature, to prevent direct government involvement. Trump is impatient. On health care, he says: “Obamacare is collapsing—and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice—it is a necessity.” He presents a five-part plan, in scrapping the existing system never mentioning the privatization route by name, and he does this with a plea for bipartisan cooperation, which, for Democrats, surrenders what little there is worth retaining. Hence, he says: “I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.” A private system is the watchword, so that, on point one, the movement to that status is clear from his demand that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage [implying a transfer of coverage], and that we have a stable transition [again implying a transfer from public to private] for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.” Second, more specific, “we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts—but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.” (One might see Trump’s thinking revolving around the fetishism of choice, except that “choice” is coded to indicate the correct direction.) Third, “we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.” That is, sacrifice Medicaid to the states entirely, the likelihood of adequate coverage for all problematic. Fourth, afford the medical profession absolute protection against malpractice and other suits—patients, like workers and the middle class, a barrier to taking effective action, and fifth, provide direct assistance to the health insurance industry, allowing companies to cross state lines—“creating a truly competitive national marketplace [once more sanctioning the private] that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.” Introducing from the gallery another guest, a young woman who at 15 months had contracted “a rare and serious illness,” whose father “founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.” She is now 20. What is interesting is the use made of a purely human interest story—a criticism of the Food and Drug Administration for not hastening the review process in evaluating the safety of drugs: “If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.” This of course applies to regulation in general, a persnickety federal government gumming up the works, inconsistent with—as in coal—the dismantling of government by the new forces in Washington. And in a neat quarter turn to a pressing subject on the regulatory front—the survival of public education—Trump, as in his selection of DeVos as education secretary, throws himself four-square on several alternative possibilities all on the private side of the ledger. On the offering of choice, and using blacks and Latinos as enticement for his plan, he states: “I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.” In politicizing school education—quite a menu of choices—Trump has the chutzpah of wrapping schools in a context of civil rights, perhaps calculated to resonate among liberals (to the sacrifice of public education), for as he says preceding the list: “Education is the civil rights issue of our time.” More guests are recognized, each supporting one of Trump’s talking points. One, Denisha, “failed third grade twice…. [b]ut then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit and scholarship program.” Then came remarks on violence, the murder rate in Chicago, and the need for cooperation with and respect for the police: “We must build bridges of cooperation and trust—not drive the wedge of disunity and division.” This is well put, although he sentimentalizes the topic bringing it into line with the tenor of his law-and-order self-created mandate: “We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.” And to drive home the dangers out there (immigrant scare?) he states, “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE—Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement,” a prejudgment further enflaming the populace when it comes on board. Then, not through, he introduces four more guests from the gallery, victims, themselves or a loved one, of crime. The emphasis on crime and violence suddenly introduces him, as though related, to the virtues of a strong military. Brief and to the point: “Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and—if they must—to fight and win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester [that which sets it apart], and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” There is to be more for veterans in the package: “Our veterans have delivered for this Nation—and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.” He then uses the death of Navy SEAL Ryan Owen, his “legacy etched into history,” although there remains doubt about the efficacy of the raid, to assert: “To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.” Coming from on high, already to dissuade critics of policy, here foreign policy, Trump softens—for home political consumption—his Fortress America idea, first conceding little, “Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security issues that we share with our allies across the globe.” Next, he gives, contrary to his recent record, qualified support to NATO: “We strongly support NATO…. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.” Acknowledging his nationalist (from what just preceded, nationalism itself is code for the corporate-militarist paradigm) deeply-embedded viewpoint, Trump announces: “We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations…. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict—not more.” Let’s leave matters at that; he does not let go of dramatizing the high ground: “Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.” Setting free, liberating, follow from reducing the intervention of government in the people’s lives. Why not proclaim victory, given the moral virtue of America? He outlines the factors in part composing America’s greatness: “This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God.’ Trump wants Americans to Think Big, capitalist in inspiration, a vital private sector buttressed by taking regulation off the table, venerating and appreciating the contribution being made for all of us by successful men of business, and possessing armed might second to none. I see fascism in the spirit and substance of the harmonious relations between capitalism and the state, found in earlier administrations going back, but now reaching a tipping point to seemingly irreversible structural-ideological trends under Trump. Without wishing to sound cryptic, I believe being is becoming, that is, the present context of power is rapidly progressing into a new political reality, a state having the makings of authoritarianism, which foretells the future—its petrification—of democracy. The military neatly tucked into more pacific concerns, I have sought to point out some of the contradictions in Trump’s speech.

Restaurants Editorials Letters to the Editor Endorsements Submission Policies Erik Lukens column Home Opinion Commentary: Entrepreneurship, innovation flourish when immigration welcomed print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Commentary: Entrepreneurship, innovation flourish when immigration welcomed By Stephen Tang / For The Philadelphia Inquirer Published Mar 6, 2017 at 12:02AM As the son of immigrant scientists — and as a scientist myself — I am deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s immigration policy. As the leader of a tech-based economic development organization, I’m even more apprehensive about the policy’s impact on innovation, entrepreneurship and America’s ability to compete on a global scale. I’m saddened to see this blunt-force policy affect the fate of the immigrants who have been stopped at our borders and turned away, as well as the impact on hopeful new visa applicants. Regardless of rumored changes, the policy has already sent a troubling signal to the rest of the world. We cannot forget that America was built on the twin bedrocks of immigration and entrepreneurship. Imagine starting over in a new country and using your wits and grit to launch a company, provide for family, and succeed. That was the experience of many of our grandparents and parents. Today’s immigrant entrepreneurs (often fleeing persecution in their native countries) continue that tradition of bootstrapping as they create new technologies and products. They embody the American Dream. Yet in the clamor of today’s 24/7 cycle of cable and internet news, their contributions are often overlooked and their voices are frequently missing from our nation’s rancorous debate over immigration. Imagine what life would be like without immigrant entrepreneurs such as Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone and founded what is now known as AT&T; or French-born E.I. DuPont, who founded the chemical giant in my home state of Delaware; or Intel founder Andy Grove, who was born in Hungary and revolutionized the semiconductor industry. Or, for that matter, immigrant Alexander Hamilton, who gave our fledgling nation a banking and economic system that still exists today. Today’s immigrant entrepreneurs include Sergey Brin of Google, Elon Musk of Tesla, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani. Together, their companies employ more than 70,000 people. At my organization, the University City Science Center, nearly one-third of the 58 companies in our business incubator were founded by someone born outside of the United States. Entrepreneurs such as Yasmine Mustafa, a Palestinian immigrant, whose startup ROAR for Good is developing wearable technology to prevent attacks on women. And Indian immigrant Mihir Shah, whose company, UE LifeSciences, is disrupting breast-cancer diagnostics around the globe. Yasmine, Mihir, and their fellow immigrant entrepreneurs are creating technologies and products that are transforming the world — and our economy. And they are a force that is moving America — their adopted homeland — forward. Here are some amazing statistics: • Immigrants account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population. Yet they represent more than a quarter of America’s entrepreneurs. • Nearly one-third of venture-backed founders are immigrant entrepreneurs. • More than half of America’s startups valued at $1 billion or more were started by immigrants. These numbers — and the voices and sacrifices behind them — are missing from our national debate on immigration. And that omission is creating a dangerous distortion in the immigration narrative. We need these brilliant people with their bright ideas, the companies they form, and the jobs they create. When immigration and entrepreneurship intersect, magic can — and often does — happen. We cannot afford to see that magic disappear. — Stephen Tang is the president and CEO of the University City Science Center in Philadelphia and co-chairman of the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. 16609233 View next article in Opinion     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Networking | March 6, 2017 -- 01:16 GMT (17:16 PST) | Topic: Networking Microsoft is finally moving its latest Linux Skype client to beta and adding the ability to video-conference with other people using the latest model of Skype. Skype for Linux has finally gotten to beta status with new features. Microsoft has taken its own sweet time with this move. The new version of Skype for Linux went into alpha in July 2016. There were some improvements since then, but they're not that impressive. more MWC 2017 Nokia, BlackBerry, Moto indicate smartphones entering retro era Hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Tab S3 and Windows 10 Galaxy Book LG G6 unveiled: Big screen, water resistance, dual cameras Nokia goes back to the future with three Android smartphones What you need to know about Motorola's Moto G5 Huawei unveils Watch 2, Watch 2 Classic CNET: Latest news from Barcelona This new Skype, though, promises real interoperability between Skype for Linux and the rest of the Skype family. And, you know what? It delivers. I put the Skype beta through its paces on the latest and greatest Linux Mint distribution, Mint 18.1, with the Cinnamon desktop. For the hardware, I used my main desktop, an older Dell XPS 8300. This PC has a 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 8GBs of RAM, and an AMD/ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphic card. I used a Logitech C510 Webcam for audio and video input. The new Skype promises three new features. This starts with calling updates. These enable you to call to mobiles and landlines with Skype credit. It also lets you make one-to-one video calls from Linux to Skype to users running the latest versions of Skype for Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac. The alpha had enabled you to make video calls to other Linux and Chromebook Skype users, but that was it. This new version let me call cell phones and landline phones with no trouble. The video calls were more troublesome. First, as you had in the past on many Linux distributions, to get your webcam and Skype on the same page you must make sure the Video4Linux (V4L2) application programming interface (API) library and drivers are loaded. Once that's done, you need to create the file /usr/local/bin/skype as the root user. In the Debian/Ubuntu Linux family you do this with this command from your shell: sudo vi /usr/local/bin/skype You can replace "vi" with your favorite programming editor. Once opened, if you're running 32-bit Linux you enter the following: #!/bin/bash LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype If you're running a 64-bit Linux you use these lines instead: #!/bin/bash LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype Then exit and save the file. That done, you make your new file executable with the command: sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/skype You can now exit the shell and start Skype. Your webcam should work with Skype now. It did for me. Next, you must find someone running the latest version of Skye on another platform to test video-conferencing out. In my experience, video-conferencing will not work if your colleagues are running an old edition of Skype. Even so, I had glitches when talking with users. In one case, while we were able to talk just fine, we could never make a video connection. Still this is a beta program, so that's not too surprising. Another new feature is that Linux users can now view shared screens from other Skype desktop clients. These users must be running Skype for Windows 7.33 and above or Skype for Mac 7.46 and above. Unlike video-conferencing, this worked without any trouble. However, you can't share your Linux desktop with other users. Finally, Skype's launcher now shows the number of unread conversations. And a long-needed basic feature is now present: You can see when your online contacts are showing Away and Do Not Disturb statuses. That's the good news. The bad news is there's still no group video-conferencing. In addition, Skype for Linux loves memory. After I had it on for a few hours, it was taking up 2GBs of RAM. There are other annoyances. For example, you can't search through your instant messages logs and "Rename Contacts" isn't enabled. All in all, it's better, but I have to say it doesn't look all that much better than the previous generaton of Skype for Linux, which was last refreshed in March 2013. Personally, I'm sticking with Google Hangouts for my video-conferencing needs. It runs flawlessly on Linux. If, however, your office has standardized on Skype, this is still a major step forward. Just keep in mind that it's still very much a work in progress. Want to try it for yourself? Skype for Linux beta is ready for download. Its page, however, still lists it as Skype for Linux alpha. The documentation also hasn't been updated.

The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. “I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney — of the Justice Department through the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] court,” Mukasey told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. At the same time, he said that Trump was “not correct” in saying that the former US President ordered the surveillance. According to Mukasey, the wiretap could mean suspicion that someone in Trump Tower may have been acting as “an agent of Russians.” The US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee will carry out an investigation into Trump's "wiretapping" accusations, committee Chair Devin Nunes said Sunday. ...

Unlike the original executive order from Jan. 27 that now sits in legal limbo, Iraq is the one country excluded from the 90-day ban, the official said, because the Iraqi government has made “firm commitments” to the U.S. to work toward increased cooperation in terms of information-sharing. The revised order will not indefinitely block Syrian refugees from the U.S., as the original ban had directed, and the 120-day halt to the refugee program will apply to all countries. Like the original order, the administration is lowering the previous administration’s cap for refugees admitted to the U.S. from 110,000 to 50,000 for the current fiscal year. House Republicans unveil plan for health care overhaul House Republicans have released their long-awaited bill dismantling much of former President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. The measure would roll back the government’s health care role and is expected to result in fewer people having insurance coverage.         House committees planned votes on the legislation Wednesday. That will launch perhaps the year’s defining battle in Congress, and GOP success is by no means assured because of internal divisions. The plan would repeal the law’s fines on people who don’t purchase health insurance. Instead of the statute’s income-based premium subsidies, people would get tax credits based on age. The subsidies would phase out for higher-earning people. McCain, Graham ask Trump for evidence of wiretapping claims Republican Senators are asking for evidence of President Trump’s assertion that former President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump tower. “I think the President should tell the American people what evidence he has that indicates his predecessor wiretapped Trump Tower,” Senator John McCain (R-AZ) told reporters on Monday evening. “It was a very serious charge and one that needs corroboration,” noted McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “If it’s true it’s earth-shattering,” commented Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). When asked if Mr. Trump’s claims were a distraction, he responded, “it’s not a distraction as much as it is unnerving if it’s true.” DHS says 300 refugees are being investigated by FBI for terror ties During the announcement of the new travel ban executive order, Attorney General Jeff Sessions attempted to make the case for the pause in allowing refugees into the U.S. with a statement warning of the potential national security danger they pose. “[M]ore than 300 people who came here as refugees are under FBI investigation for potential terrorism-related activities,” Sessions said Monday morning. He also said that those who are “seeking to support or commit terrorist attacks here will try to enter through our refugee program.”    The line also appears in the text of the executive order: “The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Trump offers to maintain Planned Parenthood funding if it halts abortions President Donald Trump has offered to maintain federal funding for Planned Parenthood if the group stops providing abortions. Its president spurned the proposal and noted that federal money already is not allowed to be used for abortion.  Trump confirmed Monday there had been discussions after The New York Times inquired about what it described as an informal proposal.  In a statement, Mr. Trump said polling shows most Americans oppose public funding for abortion.  Trump’s new travel ban executive order is unveiled Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled the new travel ban executive order Monday morning. There are a number of things that are different in this version of the travel ban.  Tillerson told reporters that after the signing of the first order, there was an intensive review of Iraq’s vetting policies, and as a result, the two countries would implement “multiple security measures” to help prevent people with “criminal or terroristic intent” from reaching the U.S. Kelly pointed out that nothing in the new executive order affects “existing, lawful permanent residents or persons with current authorization to enter our homeland.” FISA expert breaks down Trump’s wiretap accusation against Obama President Trump on Saturday accused former President Obama of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower during the election. The unsubstantiated and unprecedented claim is raising eyebrows. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), hundreds of warrants are issued each year to allow eavesdropping on a “foreign power or agent of a foreign power.” But according to the Justice Department, the president cannot order a wiretap if the surveillance involves “communication to which a U.S. person is a party.” Poll: Two-thirds of Americans want special prosecutor for Trump-Russia investigation Two-thirds of Americans believe a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate potential ties between Trump campaign aides and Russia, according to a new poll out Monday. In the poll, from CNN/ORC, 65 percent of those surveyed said they thought an independent special prosecutor should handle the investigation, compared with 32 percent who said Congress is capable of looking into the allegations against the president and his top aides. These numbers come the week after reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign, a revelation that resulted in Sessions recusing himself from future investigations involving the Trump campaign. DOJ asked by FBI to reject Trump’s wiretapping accusation On Saturday, senior FBI officials called Justice Department officials and asked that they publicly reject President Trump’s assertion that then-President Obama ordered the wiretapping of then-candidate Trump’s phones, CBS News’ Jeff Pegues reported, citing law enforcement sources. The message to the Justice Department came from FBI Director James Comey, who disputed the claim because it falsely suggests that the FBI broke the law. AP: Key lawmakers say they’ll investigate Trump’s wiretapping claim Key members of Congress say they will honor President Donald Trump’s request to investigate his unsubstantiated claim that Barack Obama overstepped his authority as president and had Trump’s telephones tapped during the election campaign. A U.S. official said the FBI has asked the Justice Department to dispute Trump’s allegation, though no such statement has been issued. Obama’s intelligence director also said no such action was ever carried out. AP: Fact-checking what Trump has taken credit for The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time.  Conservative news chief details call with “p---ed off” Trump Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the long-running conservative website Newsmax, says he talked to President Trump over the weekend and hasn’t “seen him this p---ed off in a long time.” “I spoke with the president twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven’t seen him this p---ed off in a long time,” Ruddy wrote in a Sunday column. On Saturday, Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that former President Obama had wiretapped his phones before the election. What you missed yesterday Clapper: No FISA order for Trump’s offices Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated for part of the national security apparatus he oversaw as DNI, that to his knowledge, there was no FISA court order for Trump’s offices. Clapper, who made the comments on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” added that while he can’t speak for other Title 3 entities or local or state law enforcement, he would know if the FBI ordered some sort of surveillance. “I can deny it,” he said definitively. Top Dem on Senate Intel Committee says Trump wiretap tweets “very reckless” President Donald Trump’s explosive accusations about his White House predecessor’s wiretapping activities during the 2016 election have dominated headlines since he first tweeted them Saturday morning -- and two top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee discussed their implications on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), the committee’s vice chair, said Mr. Trump’s Saturday morning tweets -- in which he accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower for political reasons -- were “reckless.” Mr. Trump did not cite any evidence in his tweets, though similar claims had been circulating in the conservative media in recent days. Leon Panetta: White House “paying a price” for lack of discipline After another weekend in which a tweet from President Donald Trump upended the political world, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta said the the White House is “paying a price” for its lack of “discipline.” “When the president goes off and does what he did in the last few days of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there’s something wrong,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “There’s something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate.” Trump calls on Congress to investigate wiretapping accusation President Trump is calling on Congress to investigate whether Obama abused his executive power during the presidential election. The White House issued a statement Sunday morning “requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.” The statement went on to say, “Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.” On Saturday morning, without citing any evidence, the president issued a series of tweets accusing Obama of tapping the phones in Trump Tower.  HHS Sec. Tom Price says “we believe in the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors” As President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans debate the future of Medicare, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said Sunday that Republicans “believe in the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors.” His comments come after President Donald Trump reiterated during his address to a joint session of Congress last week that he doesn’t want to change Medicare benefits. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he still thinks the future of Medicare is an “open question.” “Sunday Morning:” Kellyanne Conway: Counselor and target Last Sunday, Kellyanne Conway wasn’t defending her boss, President Donald J. Trump, on TV. She was at church, attending mass with her husband, attorney George T. Conway, and their four children, along with some friends. Breakfast at a diner came next, followed by some quality family time at their northern New Jersey home -- a brief return to what life used to be like. But these days, her Sunday routine is far from normal. The new normal includes full Secret Service protection. “Why? Have there been threats?” asked O’Donnell. “Yes,” Conway replied. “I have 24/7 Secret Service protection.” “Face the Nation” Vice Chairman of the Sen. Select Committee on Intelligence Mark Warner, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, HHS Secretary Tom Price and former Defense Secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta are the guests on “Face the Nation” this week. AP review: High court nominee Gorsuch inclined to limit environmental groups Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has shown a willingness to limit the participation of environmental groups in lawsuits involving public lands, writing in one case that allowing conservationists to intervene could complicate and slow down the judicial process, according to an Associated Press review of his rulings as a federal appeals court judge. Gorsuch has spent a decade on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears disputes about public lands ranging from energy companies’ drilling rights to the use of off-road vehicles in national forests across six Western states. AP: National Monuments Republican leaders in Maine and Utah are asking President Donald Trump to step into uncharted territory and rescind national monument designations made by his predecessor. The Antiquities Act of 1906 doesn’t give the president power to undo a designation, and no president has ever taken such a step. But Trump isn’t like other presidents. Former President Barack Obama used his power under the act to permanently preserve more land and water using national monument designations than any other president. The land is generally off limits to timber harvesting, mining and pipelines, and commercial development. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Alienware 13 Review: Laptop Size Doesn't Have To Matter Christina Warren Mar 6, 2017, 1:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  alienware alienware 13 dell gaming laptops gaming review review Share When it comes to playing games, I've always preferred consoles to computers. Building (or buying) a custom gaming rig can be fun, but I need a dedicated laptop. And gaming laptops can definitely bring the power, but often with a size and battery-life trade-off that would make it impossible to use in any non-gaming scenario. So it used to be that if I wanted to game, it was easier to for me to spend money on an Xbox One S or PlayStation 4 Pro, rather than messing with PCs. But the new Alienware 13 is changing my mind about gaming laptops.   Honestly, for Alienware, this design is quite understated The configuration I tested is pricey, running nearly $2,100 (which yes, is much more expensive than a console). It has an amazing 2560 x 1440 OLED display. It also includes a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake i7-7700HQ processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and Nvidia's GTX 1060 graphics card with 6GB of RAM. That's plenty of power for most gaming. I powered through Civilisation VI, Resident Evil 7, and Forza Horizon 3, and the Alienware 13 managed to keep up without a problem. In Forza, I had to drop down to 1080p for the graphics to work at 60fps, but that was actually impressive given that the PC port of Forza has a reputation for being terrible. With Resident Evil 7, there was sometimes a tiny delay in new areas appearing as I travelled through the game's maps at 60fps at the highest resolution. Dropping some of the textures back totally solved that problem. The computer is fast enough that it should even be able to handle some VR games, though nothing too visually taxing like Elite Dangerous. Battery life while gaming isn't going to be stellar. Not even the lower power requirements of a Kaby Lake processor is going to get the computer past the two and a half hour mark. But when used for everyday tasks, like watching video or doing browsing the internet, I managed to eek out almost seven hours. This kind of battery life is very impressive on a laptop with this much power Also impressive is the 2560 x 1440 OLED touch display. This screen is one of the best I've ever seen on a laptop, with blacks that practically disappear into the bezel, a great view from almost any angle, which is a problem for some other gaming laptops, and wonderfully vivid colours. Even the blue-emblazoned Alienware logo can't keep me from loving this screen. Check out the arse on this thing! But the price to pay this laptop's excellence its hulking size. At 3kg, it's way heavier than any of the best 33cm laptops I've reviewed over the last six months, and even heavier than it's closest competitor the 3.75 pound MSI GS43. This is not a laptop you want to lug around all the time, and people will absolutely mock you for the giant back end of the laptop — though it does give you room for a plethora of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, mini-DisplayPort, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet and that mostly useless Alienware Graphics Amplifier port (I mean, if you want to buy a whole other graphics card and the $US200 ($263) amp to try and soup up your games than be my guest...). The OLED screen is one of the best I've ever seen on a laptop. But you know what, the laptop is so good in all the ways that count, I don't even care! As a person who never considered a gaming laptop, the Alienware 13 has me filled with longing. At $2,099, this configuration is a lot more expensive than my Xbox One S setup, but it's capable of playing PC games, doing VR, and the battery life in on-gaming scenarios is good enough for actually getting shit done. If you're in the market for a good gaming laptop that can also be used as an actual portable computer, the Alienware 13 should be on your list. README This thing gets loud. Playing through Resident Evil 7 or Forza Horizon 3 causes the fans to spin with furor. The machine is hot and loud. But it's a quad-core processor and a very nice mobile GPU shoved inside a 33cm frame, so I guess this is to be expected. I had occasional problems with the wi-fi while playing games. That is, if I was trying to play a game and download another in the background, wi-fi would sometimes shut-off. I'm not sure the laptop or Windows 10 is to blame, but regardless it was frustrating. Again, the OLED screen is just fantastic. The keyboard and trackpad are both very good, not just for gaming, but for typing and getting shit done, too. Other than the trackpad lighting up and the keyboard having some backlight, this thing doesn't even look that much like a gaming laptop. Like, it doesn't scream it like some of Razer's designs do. The power brick is enormous because it is 180 watts. If you are going to travel with this thing, be aware of that added size and weight. You can configure much cheaper options that lack the 1060 graphics and the stunning OLED display and still get a good performing laptop. Comments Archfiend @travisnew87 Mar 6, 2017, 8:22pm Should you really be calling it a mobile GPU when it is not categorised as mobile? It simply runs a lower clock and TDP. Reply 0 nizmo_man @nizmo_man Mar 7, 2017, 10:28am WiFi related issue might be because of the heat. When I had a gaming laptop (MSi GE60), my old Zalman laptop cooler helped quite a bit (even when playing on my lap on the couch). Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Gadgets 6 0 0 March 3, 2017 Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Where Is It? Daryl Deino Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5 was widely expected to be released in March. Now that March is here, no announcement of the Surface Pro 5 appears to be near. There have been several sales and price cuts on the Surface Pro 4, which many thought meant that the Surface Pro 5 will be announced soon. There wasn’t always excitement for a new Surface Pro. When Microsoft released their flagship device in February of 2013, reviews were mixed. CNET gave the device three-and-a-half stars. “Microsoft and the Surface have proven the hardest point of all: that a tablet with a funky keyboard cover can replace a regular laptop, or even a desktop PC. The finer points of needing a dock, finding a better price that includes the Type Cover instead of making it a side purchase, and improving battery life — and, maybe, slimming down a bit — will hopefully come in the next iteration.” The Surface Pro 3 corrected the wrongs of the first two Surface Pro devices. [Image by Daryl Deino] It wasn’t until the Surface Pro 3, released in June of 2014, that Microsoft’s device hit the sweet spot with both great sales and critical acclaim. The newly-designed device earned four-and-a-half stars from Trusted Reviews. “Microsoft has finally nailed its tablet hybrid concept with the Surface Pro 3. It’s powerful, versatile and brilliantly put together. Not all laptop owners need apply, but the Surface Pro 3 is a convincing alternative.” The review especially praised the new flexible kickstand and the battery life. However, the battery life became an issue on the Surface Pro 4, especially before Microsoft release a firmware update. Overall, however, most would agree that the Surface Pro is the perfect laptop-tablet hybrid. Many believe the Surface Pro 4 is the perfect laptop-tablet hybrid. [Image by Daryl Deino] “The Surface Pro 4 is a microcosm of the change Microsoft is trying to spur inside its own walls. Time and time again, it missed the opportunity to leap on a new trend in consumer technology. But not with Surface. This time, Microsoft is a leader. It’s setting the trend. And unlike its new competitors, it’s had a few years to work out the kinks,” claimed Matt Smith of Digital Trends. So, what can we expect on the Surface Pro 5 when it’s released? Digital Trends has the news. “The Surface Pro 4 uses sixth-generation Intel Core processors and offers an excellent 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution, and 267 PPI. Anticipated — and logical — Surface Pro 5 updates, therefore, include a move to seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display option.” The article adds that in order to make the device as thin as possible, USB-3 ports may be replaced with USB-C ports — something Apple has been doing for the past year. Other possibilities listed include a wireless charging pen and a larger capacity battery. The one aspect that most agree on is the availability of a 4K screen on one of the higher-end versions of the Surface Pro 5. Since the success of the Surface Pro 3 and, especially, the Surface Pro 4, many other similar laptop hybrids have been released. HP recently released a pen-enabled 13-inch Spectre x360 hybrid, which has garnered excellent reviews. Then, there is Samsung, who is about to release the Galaxy Book, which will come in both 10-inch and 12-inch versions. According to CNET, the 12-inch version of the Galaxy Book will have a Super AMOLED screen. Unlike the Surface Pro 4, Samsung’s device comes with a keyboard, although the kickstand isn’t as customizable as Microsoft’s device. It will also have a 7th generation Intel Core i5 processor. So far, there has been no pricing announced. Which hybrid is on your wish list — the Surface Pro 5, the HP Spectre x360, or the Samsung Galaxy Book? Let us know in the comments section.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google March 04, 2017 Hottest areas in Artificial Intelligence artificial intelligence, business, commercialization, economic impact, future Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit IDC sees widespread adoption of cognitive systems and artificial intelligence (AI) across a broad range of industries will drive worldwide revenues from nearly $8.0 billion in 2016 to more than $47 billion in 2020. According to a new Worldwide Semiannual Cognitive/Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide from International Data Corporation (IDC), the market for cognitive/AI solutions will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 55.1% over the 2016-2020 forecast period. "Near-term opportunities for cognitive systems are in industries such as banking, securities and investments, and manufacturing," said Jessica Goepfert, program director, Customer Insights and Analysis at IDC. "In these segments, we find a wealth of unstructured data, a desire to harness insights from this information, and an openness to innovative technologies. Furthermore, the value proposition of cognitive systems aligns well with industry executives' chief priorities. For instance, cognitive technologies are being used in the banking industry to detect and combat fraud – consistently a top industry pain point. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, executives cite improving product quality as a top initiative. In this case, cognitive systems recognize and know how to respond to dynamic fluctuations in product specs by adapting the production to stay within quality targets." The industries that will invest the most in cognitive/AI systems in 2016 are banking and retail, followed by healthcare and discrete manufacturing. Combined, these four industries will generate more than half of all worldwide cognitive/AI revenues in 2016, with banking and retail each delivering nearly $1.5 billion. Healthcare and discrete manufacturing will deliver the greatest revenue growth over the 2016-2020 forecast period, with CAGRs of 69.3% and 61.4%, respectively. Education and process manufacturing will also experience significant growth over the forecast period. Nearly half of all cognitive/AI revenue throughout the forecast will go to software, which includes both cognitive applications (i.e., text and rich media analytics, tagging, searching, machine learning, categorization, clustering, hypothesis generation, question answering, visualization, filtering, alerting, and navigation) and cognitive software platforms, which facilitate the development of intelligent, advisory, and cognitively enabled solutions. As both the largest and fastest-growing category, cognitive applications spending is forecast to reach $18.2 billion in 2020. Cognitive/AI-related services (business services and IT consulting) represent the second largest revenue category while hardware revenues (primarily from dedicated purchases of servers and storage) will grow nearly as fast as software with five-year CAGRs of more than 60%.

Mumbai-based Fluid AI was founded in 2008, by two brothers Abhinav Aggarwal and Raghav Aggarwal, with a belief that the power of artificial intelligence can be used across industries, sectors and use cases. They have about a staff of 50 now. Fluid AI offers machine learning driven decision making for various business operations, and on the other it is creating virtual customer assistance for firms with a physical presence. AI Driven Operational Decision Making “The AI technology uses genetically evolving neural networks to create over 100,000 iterative models from the data sources given to us by the clients. It studies the data pattern which arises from the model evolves accordingly and improves feedbacks whenever the market conditions change.” says Abhinav. The company offers a Plug and Play artificial intelligence system, which can be installed in any system. It connects to hundreds of data sources within and outside the server and gives the suggestions based on the previously collected data. 8. Biometrics 9.

The world's largest memory chip producer is forecast to invest US$12.5 billion in facilities this year, compared with $11.3 billion in 2016, the data by market researcher IC Insights showed. Although Samsung has not disclosed its investment plans for this year, the injection of funds would allow Samsung to keep its No. 1 spot in terms of capital spending on chip facilities. Intel Corp. came in second with $12 billion in capital spending on its chip facilities this year, up 25 percent from a year earlier. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was ranked third with a planned capital spending of $10 billion this year, followed by SK hynix Inc. with $6 billion, according to the data. IC Insights said Samsung and SK hynix cut their semiconductor investment last year because of the weak DRAM market. "Although their total outlays declined, both companies increased their spending for 3D NAND flash in 2016," the market researcher said in a statement.

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In IBM Q Launches Next Stage Of Quantum Computing Revolution (IBM) By Rakesh Sharma | March 6, 2017 — 1:31 PM EST Share Get set for the next stage of computing. Research giant IBM Corp. (IBM) announced today that it was enabling access to its quantum bit computers from regular computers. “The IBM Quantum Experience enables anyone to connect to IBM’s quantum processor via the IBM Cloud, to run algorithms and experiments, work with the individual quantum bits, and explore tutorials and simulations around what might be possible with quantum computing,” the company announced in a press release. (See also: Quantum Is Coming). IBM had opened up its 5-qubit (quantum bits) computer as a cloud computing service to select partners last year. The release of today’s API (Application Programming Interface or the program used to access an application or technology) to a wider audience will enable developers to access the processor and perform complex calculations and tasks. In an interview with tech publication TechCrunch, Jerry Chow, manager of the experimental quantum computing group at IBM, said the company wanted to “figure out what quantum computing looks like in the future when we have a larger number of qubits.” IBM also announced the launch of IBM Q, an industry-wide initiative to build commercially-available universal quantum computer systems, today. This represents a first step to make powerful quantum computers, that will be able to crunch massive amounts of data and perform a wide variety of tasks in short times, available to lay people. (See also: Intel Bets Big On Quantum Computing). For the uninitiated, quantum computing is an evolution of computing, which uses 1s and 0s to store and process data. Quantum computing uses intermediate states between the two bits, also known as superposition, to enable complex and faster processing and larger storage. It will become a necessity in the future as the trove of data gathered through online transactions increases exponentially. With Moore’s law coming to an end, quantum computers are an elegant solution to the data deluge problem facing humanity in the future. In its press release today, IBM has pointed out a couple of use cases relating to quantum computing. For example, the company has zeroed in on chemistry as one of the first areas of application for the technology. Commercial IBM Q systems with more than 50 qubits processing capacity will enable IBM to “collaborate with key industry partners to develop applications that exploit the quantum speedup of such systems.” Drug development and discovery is one of the areas that could benefit from this approach. But, quantum computing is "still very far away," according to Scott Crowder from IBM's Systems Group. In the meanwhile, the Armonk-based company still has to contend with 19 straight quarters of reporting losses on its balance sheet due to changes in its business.

In an open letter to CNN's Brian Stelter published on his Conservative Review website, and directed at the larger media too, Levin wrote: I simply put together the stories that YOUR profession reported, on the public record. Do you deny there were two FISA applications? Do you deny the first was turned down? Do you deny the second was approved? It's called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It is about surveillance. The fact that we cannot discern all the details because of the secrecy, except for what the media have revealed and selective leaks by the government, should cause you to want to know more, not to trash those who point it out. Levin emailed me, "Do you deny there were two FISA applications?" I replied: "I don't know. You don't know.

He added: Your lack of curiosity and dishonesty about such matters and in dealing with me demean you and your profession. Reporters trying to determine the reason President Trump on Saturday sent out a storm of tweets accusing Obama of bugging Trump tower have looked to comments Levin made, which he said are legitimate questions raised by the media. Levin said that there are some "logical implications" that can be made from the reporting on the issue, which includes pre-election reports in papers like the New York Times. He wrote: Also from the Washington Examiner The return of Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul is back in a familiar place: at the center of attention. By W. James Antle III • 03/07/17 12:01 AM And yes, we can make several logical implications based on events and experience. A FISA application is a big deal. One, or two in this case, that involve campaign surrogates, or a server or computer related to a candidate or campaign, etc., is a big deal. President Obama's statement is not a definitive statement of anything, other than he, personally, did not order a wiretap, which I never claimed. But that does not mean he was unaware of surveillance activity by several of his departments, even through routine reports to the president, such as the Daily Intel Briefing or information conveyed to him or his staff via the Justice Department re the FBI counter-intelligence activities. As for Clapper, despite his past dissembling before Congress, he may not have been aware of what was taking place since the FBI counter-intel operation reportedly sought the warrant. The Daily Intel Briefing might provide useful information in that regard as well. On Monday, Stelter dismissed the affair as a conspiracy. His story opened this way: An incendiary idea first put forward by right-wing radio host Mark Levin is now burning across Washington, fanned by President Trump's tweets and a huge number of supportive commentators and websites — even though the facts don't back up the conclusion.

Self-driving car technology is chugging along. Find out where we are today, and when we might actually be able to buy an autonomous car. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 6, 2017 at 2:17PM Autonomous cars have been the buzz of the energy and tech sectors for years now, but how close are we as consumers to actually having fully autonomous cars in our driveways? In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Industrials, analyst Sean O'Reilly talks with Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear about the state of autonomous driving tech today, and when consumers will start to see the fruits of the industry's labors. Tune in to find out what the different levels of automation are and why they matter; where companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford (NYSE:F), and Fiat Chrysler fit into the story; where Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) alleged car project seem to be heading; and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John! John Rosevear: Good morning, Sean! How are you, today? O'Reilly: Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I missed you, buddy. Rosevear: Yeah, it's been a few weeks. O'Reilly: I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question. Rosevear: What's the question? O'Reilly: You're the only guy I know who can answer this for me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car. Rosevear: Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and really depends on what you mean by self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately. O'Reilly: I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway. Rosevear: Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of classification for things that assist drivers has become pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system, there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But, the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when you get some basic level of driver assistance, assistance that parallel parks for you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system. O'Reilly: Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised that's on here. Rosevear: That's... O'Reilly: Eye of the beholder? Rosevear: The driver is still executing that. They count that as an intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you that it starts to become assisted. These emergency stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on the front of the car, the levels one through five require some level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one. Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every minute or two, or something like that. Level three is when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can drive under certain conditions, we might say highway driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go, this is where some of the systems, GM's (NYSE:GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac soon, this is where it ends up, level three. O'Reilly: Super Cruise? [laughs]  Rosevear: That's what they call it. That's what they've been calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure that's what they're going to call it when it comes to market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that in a minute.  O'Reilly: The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that thing. Rosevear: Tesla's official instructions with the original system where you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced. These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show, like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself wherever you want under any conditions. If it's snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever, anything.  So, what we're talking about in the near future is level four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps will expand over time and you'll be able to drive -- O'Reilly: Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm actually surprised to hear this. Rosevear: Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving, and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on in San Francisco. I know GM's cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla, I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors on their existing cars. A company called Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) is going to start doing mapping with sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's been mapping for years and years. [laughs]  O'Reilly: You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what my dentist's office looks like from across the street. They're mapping cities with that, too? Rosevear: Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking. O'Reilly: So, when is this stuff coming out? Rosevear: Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship it. There's also an interesting question there that with their owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on. And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types, they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant auto supplier Delphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that has done a lot of work around-- O'Reilly: And but they are publicly traded, right? For our listeners. Rosevear: They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it gets. The third company in this is Intel, which is designing the processors. They're working together on a level four system. We've talked about this before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars may not go to retail. [laughs]  O'Reilly: What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]  Rosevear: Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says, "We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle starting in 2021." Great. Then, they say, "Yeah, but we're not going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so on." It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said, "We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this," so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they think they'll have level four functionality in their retail vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, "We throw out these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect." So, we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says, "This stuff moves much faster than we expect." There's also some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we have seen, what we generally know is coming. O'Reilly: Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their face. Rosevear: Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in 2016 -- O'Reilly: They need to get a different name for that. [laughs]  Rosevear: Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while back and said, "Wait a minute, we're not happy with it, we're going to do more work and make it more advanced. We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late 2017-18, probably around there." But again, they are not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact, they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, "We'll ship it when it's ready." But what we do know is that GM is planning to actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles, reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level four systems, and they will go into this massive test with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will you get your level four car?  O'Reilly: Which is why they invest in Lyft. Rosevear: Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that. It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on everything that's happening with the system. And it may be the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out there, you know? O'Reilly: Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a treat.  Rosevear: Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]  O'Reilly: Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars. Rosevear: Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into business and commercialize this in some way. Who will partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their latest prototype system. They've been talking to Honda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world is mindful of the example of the phone industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system developed within the established auto industry supplier structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers and so forth, but we're not selling the data to Google. [laughs]  O'Reilly: What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them at all. It's weird. Rosevear: They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik. He had been the president of TrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He was with several automakers, in management capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big presentation at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month, but it's March now. He was talking about where their system is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for automakers who might want to have conversation. It's possible those conversations have happened and nobody is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles are all Chryslers. O'Reilly: We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big plan, and I've got a push notification from The Wall Street Journal a year ago that Apple was going to build a car within the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now? Rosevear: Good question. Yeah, I remember when that Wall Street Journal thing came out. O'Reilly: You got the notification too, I'm sure. Rosevear: I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they could start a car company, the question is, do they want to? O'Reilly: Yeah, I remember you talking about that. Rosevear: Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10 billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would they want to? The margins in the car business, by Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper limit. O'Reilly: So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day? Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars operating. Rosevear: Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said, "We're not building cars, we're not going to build a car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for partnerships, we are not building cars." Apple hasn't said anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist. But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go. People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were originally talking about this was that they were going to build the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and your climate and your music and everything else and all this stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car service. That's where I thought they were going to go. Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close watchers of this kind of technology and particularly close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car for retail Tesla-style. O'Reilly: Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you the last word. When am I magically going to get my driverless car in my driveway? Rosevear: If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers, it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next couple years after that that these start to be available for retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an expensive option on a luxury car. O'Reilly: Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again, for your time. Rosevear: It's always a pleasure. O'Reilly: I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp up, this will not be our last show about this topic.  Rosevear: Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several years to come. It's a big deal. O'Reilly: Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you, again! Rosevear: All right. Take care, Sean! O'Reilly: Bye. That's it for us, folks.

The 1700 will cost about the same as the 7700k. Maybe you could look into the 6c/12t i7 6800k too. That will cost about the same as the 1700x and is a more matured platform. If you can hold out, the Ryzen 5 1600 chips could be pretty good overall. Assuming they will clock higher because they'll only be 6c/12t, they should also run cooler. They might end up being the perfect cpu for a lot of peeople. It's up to you if you want to wait. I'm waiting atm myself, few reasons. All of the motherboards I was considering with Ryzen are pre-order atm, then there's issues with the cpu too.

Ogg March 6, 2017 11:00 am EST Print Email Tweet Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sometimes contain information that shareholders need to know about. A filing with the SEC on Friday showed that Mubadala Development Company PJSC registered to sell some 45 million shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). The form 144 filing showed that these shares, which were held through West Coast Hitech, date back to 2007. What matters here is that this stake sale was from the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, and Reuters had noted that the Abu Dhabi investment fund will retain 97 million shares. Subsequent SEC filings show that stake to be just over 96.9 million shares. The date of the sale was listed as March 3, 2017, via Goldman Sachs, and the price per share was listed as block sale at $13.63 in a subsequent 13D filing. While AMD share price has been an exponential gainer over the past 12 months or so, this was listed as a stake sale worth more than $613 million. Even for a $12 billion market cap, that is a substantial stake. Mubadala is an investment and development company that was designed to support the growth of the economy of the United Arab Emirates. The company deploys capital in multiple sectors, and its interactive portfolio shows a 100% ownership in GlobalFoundries. Form 144 filings with the SEC regard the intent of holders of restricted stock to sell those shares, or a fraction of those shares, within 90 days. A lockup agreement was outlined in Monday’s 13D filing: Seller agrees that it will not, for a period of sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of, contract to dispose of, or enter into any transaction having the economic consequences of a disposition, of (i) Common Stock of the Company or (ii) any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such Common Stock, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (1) to any shares of Common Stock offered, sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a written plan for trading securities in effect on the date hereof, which was established pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, (2) to any shares of Common Stock offered, sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a registered underwritten offering, or (3) to any shares of Common Stock offered, sold or otherwise disposed of in connection with purchase by a third party of not less than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company; provided further that the undersigned may make gifts or transfers of shares of Common Stock to, or for the benefit of, family members, charitable institutions, and trusts, limited partnerships or other entities created for estate planning purposes, the principal beneficiaries of which are family members or charitable institutions, subject to the condition that any such family member or charitable institution or other holder shall execute an agreement stating that such transferee is receiving and holding the Common Stock subject to the provisions of this agreement. The foregoing restriction in the preceding paragraph is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of any Common Stock referred to in the preceding paragraph even if such Common Stock would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned.  Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any Common Stock referred to in the preceding paragraph or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such Common Stock. Some investors are likely to wonder about the timing of this major stake sale. AMD has just released its Ryzen 7 processors, which is an 8-core processor designed for gaming, video editing or other high-demand applications. Product reviews since the formal launch date have been mixed, although the price is roughly half of the closest Intel processor. 24/7 Wall St. took the top the Google search results for the search term “Ryzen review” and these are seen below: Ars Technica’s review: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X still behind Intel, but it’s great for the price; an excellent workstation CPU, but it doesn’t game as hard as we hoped. PCWorld’s Ryzen review: AMD is back … AMD’s vaunted Ryzen CPU is a multithreaded monster with one glaring weakness. PCGamer’s review: The AMD Ryzen 7: plenty of power, but underwhelming gaming performance. … Great for video editors, not so great for gamers. One issue that has been hard to ignore in recent equity trading was that AMD shares were above $15 last week. The mixed reviews of the new Ryzen 7 processors have been blamed for the drop to under $13. The trend that goes back for centuries in investing is buy the rumor (catalyst or hype) and sell the news. While a stake sale of one-third after such a massive recovery might not scare the AMD bulls at this time, maybe even sovereign wealth funds get tempted to lock in certain capital after massive recoveries. AMD shares were last seen trading at $12.77 on Monday morning, in a 52-week range of $2.15 to $15.55. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Could Gain 15% on New Chips Recent Posts: Why Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Could Jump 20% Higher Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is About to Rebound Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Isn’t Infallible After All View All Posts What is Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock really worth? That’s the main question on investors’ minds amid a rapid decline in NVDA stock that itself followed a rapid one-year run of 350%. Source: Shutterstock My answer? New investors who have waited patiently for a good entry point are finally being rewarded. Nvidia stock has bottomed. NVDA shares once traded at 41 times projected 2018 earnings in the midst of the company’s momentum-fueled run. But Nvidia has dropped 18% over the past month or so, dropping that valuation to 29. Yes, that’s still about 10 points above the S&P 500’s average forward P/E, but it still makes more sense given that analysts expect roughly 20% earnings growth next year. As such, I continue to expect NVDA stock to reach $130 to $135 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 32% to 37% returns in 2017. The reason for the stock’s decline of late? Aside from fresh money now going into Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia stock has been the subject to multiple downgrades. This is even though the semiconductor company not only crushed Wall Street’s fourth-quarter estimates on almost every metric, Nvidia also raised full-year guidance. The first downgrade came from BMO Capital, which not only downgraded NVDA stock to “Underperform” from “Market Perform,” the analyst also slashed Nvidia’s price target to $85 from $100. Based on Friday’s closing price, the downgrade assumes additional declines of almost 15%. BMO insists Nvidia is overvalued and says the strong earnings growth  the company has enjoyed has begun to slow. Moreover, the firm added that competition will begin to impact Nvidia. Notably, AMD — which has been on tear over the past three months, soaring some 53% — is likely the subject of the change in competitive landscape to which BMO refers. Likewise, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is now seen as a subtle threat, despite the fact that Nvidia’s Datacenter revenue surged a whopping 205% year-over-year, eating Intel’s lunch. Based on the company’s first-quarter revenue guidance of $1.90 billion — higher than consensus estimates of $1.87 billion — Nvidia is showing no signs of slowing down. Bottom Line for NVDA Stock After a dominant 2016, some analysts are now gun-shy about NVDA stock can do going forward, suggesting Nvidia has become a victim of its own success. Nevertheless, despite the recent declines, long-term investors should remember why they’ve bet on Nvidia stock. And given that the company’s fundamentals have not changed, despite the recent downgrades, now’s the time to add to your positions. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ARVR Qualcomm moves VR forward with wireless headset Dean Takahashi@deantak March 6, 2017 7:30 AM Tags: GB Featured, Leap Motion, Qualcomm, Tim Leland, VR, wireless VR Above: Tim Leland of Qualcomm's shows off wireless VR headset. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Virtual reality took a few steps forward last week, advances highlighted by Qualcomm‘s demo of a development headset for wireless virtual reality. The prototype is part of a reference design for a second generation of VR headsets that don’t have to be connected to a PC. Hardware companies can adopt this technology, and Qualcomm has started an accelerator to enable those companies to move faster. At least five headset makers plan to launch VR headsets in 2017 that are based on Qualcomm’s newest chip, the Snapdragon 835. Osterhout Design Group has also said it will create two augmented reality smartglasses models with the 835. I tried the headset out at GDC 2017 and was taken aback at first that I could pretty much walk anywhere in the hallway where I was testing it. The device was untethered, with all of the processing taking place in the headset itself. This one had last year’s chip, the Snapdragon 820 processor, but the production versions will use the newer 835. Qualcomm vice president Tim Leland said the device was a reference model, which others could use as their own products or as a foundation for more unique designs. The 835 will have better performance per watt, significantly better graphics, and a 20 percent improvement in motion-to-photon latency, he said. There will also be better interaction with sensors and better single-buffer rendering performance. “I think the future of VR is mobile,” Leland said. “I don’t think the future of VR is tethered to a PC. The market is starting to speak on that.” Above: Dean Takahashi tries out the Qualcomm VR headset at GDC 2017 Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The headset I tried was smaller and less bulky than existing headsets like the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift. It was battery-powered, offering about five hours of life with a 3,600 milliamp-hour battery. But the battery life will be content-dependent, Leland said. The device will have a hardware version available in the second quarter, with six degrees of motion tracking. And there will be a software kit available, as well. The headset also had a fairly large bar in front of the eyes, with a couple of sensors as part of its inside-out sensing design. (“Inside-out” means the sensors are on the headset, not on devices set up around the room). Those sensors were able to detect my hands and the movements of my 10 fingers. The device used controller-freehand tracking from Leap Motion, which meant I didn’t have to hold a touch controller in my hands. The headset ran Leap Motion’s demo software. During my test run, I was able to pick up and create blocks. I could toss them around and look at my fingers in virtual reality. The resolution was good, though the tracking wasn’t absolutely precise. It was still a little hard to pick up objects, but mainly because I had no force feedback, or sense of touch, that informed me when I had touched a block. The Leap Motion software has been integrated into Qualcomm’s reference design kit that other companies can take and put their brand names on, if they wish. Leland said hand-tracking is optional for other companies to include, but the sensor for it isn’t that expensive. It adds very little weight, so including it is kind of a no brainer for hardware companies. The Qualcomm headset was smaller than Intel’s own prototype, dubbed Project Alloy. That device has the capability of a high-end laptop, with the ability to run VR apps at 90 frames per second. The Snapdragon 835 is powerful, but I don’t know what kind of performance it will have. Qualcomm’s device was also much lighter, which means it didn’t feel so heavy on the head. Above: Qualcomm’s VR headset Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The developer headset had a four-megapixel (2560×1440) WQHD AMOLED display (two megapixels per eye) and six degrees of freedom (6DoF) motion tracking. It had two monochromatic, one-megapixel (1280×800) global shutter cameras. It had four gigabytes of LPDDR$ DRAM memory and 64 gigabytes of Flash UFS. It used wireless with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB3.1 type C (power). For audio, it featured Qualcomm Aqstic audio codec (WCD9335), and for I/O it also had a trackpad on the right side of the headset. The best thing about this prototype is that it told me the second generation of VR hardware isn’t far off. That’s a good thing, because the first generation hasn’t gotten enough traction to sustain a large number of VR startups and game companies. In other developments in VR at GDC, LG showed off its first wired headset to compete with the HTC Vive. It is based on the Steam VR technology developed by Valve and can use apps that are available in the Steam VR store.

Chinese company BOE has invested $50 million in Israeli company Cnoga Medical for 23% of the company's shares, reflecting a company value of $217 million, the two companies today reported. The shares given to BOE were newly issued, not sold shares. BOE is a Chinese laboratory equipment company that wants to establish itself as a leader in the medical sector. According to the BOE, Cnoga's product, developed by the company since 2004, and which facilitates medical monitoring and processing of information on the cloud, matches BOE's strategic plan. The deal also includes the signing of an agreement for joint marketing of Cnoga's products in China and development of a new line of products for the professional health market. RELATED ARTICLES Diabetes diagnosis co CNoga Medical raises $12.5m Cnoga Medical develops diagnostics through skin color Cnoga, based in Or Akiva, has developed a series of devices for non-invasive measurement of a range of health parameters through optical diagnosis of the changing color shades of a finger. Among other things, pulse, blood pressure, cardiac output, hemoglobin, ph, red blood vessel count, oxygen saturation, and other parameters can be measured in this way. The company's products are unique in both the way the information is obtained and the way it is handled on the cloud. In 2014, the company announced that it had received a $12.5 million investment from Chinese fund GoCapital. The company's products are distributed in a number of countries, including Italy, Brazil, and China, and are approved for marketing in 35 countries. Cnoga was founded by Dr. Yosef Segman, holder of a PhD in mathematics, who previously founded OPlus Technologies, sold to Intel. The original goal was to measure blood sugar levels non-invasively, but this proved to be an extremely difficult parameter to measure. The idea for the company actually arose in China, when Segman photographed many Chinese people, and noticed a difference in their skin hues, and differences between their skin and that of Westerners. He thought, however, that they all had one thing in common - a redness in complexion resulting from the flow of blood. The company previously cooperated with US company Texas Instruments, with support from the Israel-US Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation. Texas Instruments also led the Cnoga's first financing round, in which $8 million was raised.

I mostly associate them with their DeathAdder mouse, with the version from 2010 still being one of the best mice I've ever used. Razer has also made audio equipment like gaming headsets for quite some time, as well as a line of gaming keyboards. As time went on, some of these products gained features that were unique to Razer, such as the use of Razer-designed mechanical switches in their gaming keyboards, and RGB backlighting in various products with the Chroma branding. Razer has made a number of attempts to move beyond the world of gaming peripherals. Some have been more successful than others. For example, some gamers may remember the Razer Edge Pro, the gaming tablet that never seemed to catch on with consumers. Razer also made a fitness band called the Nabu, but it also appears to have missed the mark and has seen some pretty heavy discounts in recent times. With Razer's recent purchase of NextBit, many have begun to speculate on whether Razer plans to move into the mobile industry. While it would be fun to speculate on Razer's plans for the future, they do have one area beyond peripherals that has been an undisputed success. Their line of laptops, which started with the unveiling of the original Razer Blade in 2011, have shown that it's possible to build gaming laptops without the bulky plastic bodies and poor quality displays that traditionally characterized high-performance laptops from other vendors. As time has gone on, Razer has iterated on the original Razer Blade, and introduced both a smaller model in the form of the Razer Blade Stealth, a 14-inch model to carry on the name of the original 17-inch Razer Blade, and the Razer Blade Pro to fill the 17-inch space. That latter model is the laptop I'll be looking at today. Prior to the launch of this new model in late 2016, the Razer Blade Pro was last updated in 2014. That model was put in an awkward position right from launch. It came with NVIDIA's GTX 860M GPU, which was actually a step down from the GTX 870M in the 14-inch Razer Blade that was updated around the same time. It also only used a 1080p display due to limitations in what 17.3-inch panels were available on the market, while the 14-inch Blade Pro clocked in at 3200x1800 despite being $100 cheaper. The headline feature of the 2014 Blade Pro was its SwitchBlade touchpad, but it again suffered from unenthusiastic reception in the market. Ultimately, the Blade Pro ended up being a more niche machine, which didn't really offer advantages compared to its little brother except for users who really needed such a large display regardless of resolution. With the 2016 Blade Pro, Razer is changing up their strategy. When I think about gaming laptops, it seems to make sense to me that a larger model will have fewer power and thermal limitations, and so it should be even more powerful than the smaller versions. For example, a 13-inch MacBook Pro is less powerful than the 15-inch model. The 2016 Blade Pro follows that line of thinking, and pushes the performance of Razer's gaming laptops farther than ever before. I've outlined its specifications below. 2016 Razer Blade Pro CPU Intel Core i7-6700HQ 4C/8T 2.6-3.5 GHz 6MB Cache 45W TDP GPU NVIDIA GTX 1080 8GB 2560 CUDA Cores 1556 - 1733 (Boost) MHz Memory 32 GB 2133MHz DDR4 Display 17.3" 3840x2160 60 Hz w/G-SYNC Storage 512GB (2 x 256GB) M.2 PCIe SSD 1TB (2 x 512GB) M.2 PCIe SSD 2TB (2 x 1TB) M.2 PCIe SSD I/O 3 x USB 3.0 Ports 1 x Thunderbolt 3 1 x HDMI 2.0 SD Card Slot 1 x Headset Jack 1 x Killer E2400 Ethernet (10/100/1000Mbps) Dimensions 22.5mm x 424mm x 281mm (HxWxD) 0.88" x 16.7" x 11" (HxWxD) Weight 3.54 kg / 7.8 lbs Battery 99 Wh, 250W AC Adapter Wireless Killer Wireless-AC 1535 2x2:2 with Bluetooth 4.1 Price $3699.99 512GB $3999.99 1TB (Model tested) $4499.99 2TB As you can see, the Razer Blade Pro is quite the laptop. It's certainly not the bulky, heavy, tank-like device that you get when you buy a desktop replacement (DTR) from Clevo or MSI, but it doesn't compromise on performance in order to do so. Inside is NVIDIA's fastest GPU, the GTX 1080. There's also a pair of PCIe SSDs, Intel's i7-6700HQ CPU, 32GB of 2133MHz DDR4 memory, a UHD display with Adobe RGB color support, and an assortment of ports so you can connect all of your existing devices without issues.  With all that power in a relatively thin and light chassis, it's not a surprise that the Blade Pro comes at such a high price. The 2014 Razer Blade Pro launched at a price of $2299, although it was lacking in the spec department in many ways, and the 14-inch Blade, with better hardware, was cheaper at $2199. Now that the Blade Pro sits at the top of Razer's laptop line for both size and performance, a price gap is actually justified. For the model with 512GB of internal storage, the Blade Pro costs 3699.99 USD. Moving to 1TB brings the price up to 3999.99 USD, and the 2TB model is the most expensive at 4499.99 USD. As I mentioned before, the 2014 Blade Pro definitely had room for improvement. The 2016 Blade Pro also comes after two years of technological improvements, and it has great potential as both a gaming machine and a mobile workstation. To start things off I'll go over the Blade Pro's design, before moving on to performance testing.

POST A COMMENT 42 Comments View All Comments Eden-K121D - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Who'll buy this? Reply Ninhalem - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link From the article: "The 2016 Razer Blade Pro is a great gaming laptop. I certainly wish I could afford one for myself. My life right now is characterized by frequent moving due to work and university, and something like the Blade Pro would allow me to bring an incredibly powerful machine with me wherever I go. While the Blade Pro fulfills its role as a high performance gaming machine, it did let me down as a mobile workstation." The last sentence feels like an unintended scenario for this laptop. Mobile workstation to me says you need to do activities like CAD and/or purely business work, and requires a CAD card instead of the mainstream variant. This laptop's intended audience clearly isn't the business world. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link No $4,000 laptop should be usable ONLY for gaming, any other laptop in this price range is a jack of all trades sans military laptops. Reply Brandon Chester - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Yeah that was my point. I'm actually willing to shell out $3700 on a laptop if it can replace every other computer in my life. If it can only replace a gaming machine then it's going to be limited to the niche of users who can afford paying that much just to bring their games around with them. Reply DanNeely - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link From a few sentences later in the article it's clear that he's talking about a image/video editing workstation not a CAD box; for the former only the screen is really holding it back. Reply QuinRiva - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Mid level technical professionals... The business is buying it, so the price is pretty insignificant compared to salary and overheads. Sure, most of my workload is offloaded to a DB or compute node somewhere, but loads of prototyping and presentation workload is done on the laptop/client side. Quadcore is essential just to run things like Excel/Tableau, and a decent graphics card is useful for Illustrator, or running neural nets; or spending a bit of time relaxing playing a game on an international business trip. And if they want "pro" buy-in, it has to look like a professional tool - I can't turn up to a client meeting with a flashing garish "gaming laptop". The XPS 15 is a pretty good compromise on this front, it's just a pity it was limited to GTX 960M. Reply digiguy - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link One negative aspect seems to be unanimously mentioned by all reviewers: the keyboard is crap. Which, for a laptop, is a big negative. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link I just wanted to agree with the author on one point, I also have the deathadder and it is the greatest mouse I have ever used for any purpose. It has been beaten on relentlessly and still operates flawlessly. The rest of Razer's products are overpriced garbage (I say that from experience) but their mice are top notch. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link I hope the current model deathadder chroma lives up to all the hype. I'm buying one as a gift for a certain mmo addict living in my home that's used a cheap Dell mouse to the point where the left mouse button isn't working anymore. I'm genuinely surprised the Dell lasted for so long (5 years) considering how much rage-clicking, grunting, and anger it endured. Even my son wasn't as hard on his mice back in the day when he was young and prone to gamer outbursts. Reply colonelclaw - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Plus one for the Deathadder. I've been using them for, I think, over 7 years. In my office I let anyone choose any mouse they like, and over half the staff have gone for a Deathadder. Conversely, for keyboards, no two people have chosen the same (I went for a Corsair K70) Reply 1 2 3 4 5 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News Playing With Power: A Look At Nintendo Switch Power Consumption Meizu Unveils Super mCharge: Fast Charging At 55W ZTE Announces The Blade V8 Mini And Blade V8 Lite NVIDIA Unveils GeForce GTX 1080 Ti: Available Week of March 5th for $699 GeForce GTX 1080 Price Cut to $499; NVIDIA Partners To Begin Selling 10-Series Cards With Faster Memory AMD GDC 2017: Asynchronous Reprojection for VR, Vega Gets a Retail Name, & More MediaTek Announces Helio X30 Availability: 10 CPU Cores On 10nm BlackBerry KEYOne Announced: Snapdragon 625 with QWERTY, $549 Sony Launches Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs Phones For US Market Samsung Launches the 9.7-inch Galaxy Tab S3: Snapdragon 820 with 6000mAh and HDR Samsung Launch the Galaxy Book 10.6-inch and 12-inch: Windows Tablets with Kaby Lake Intel Announces Xeon D-1500 Network Series SoCs with QuickAssist, Four 10 GbE Ports TWEETS IanCutress: Don't see any benefit, don't want a non-financial relationship, don't want to dedicate resources, don't want to hand out licence @revertice IanCutress: I'd love to run commercial enterprise software e.g Fluent/Comsol for benchmarks, but I tend to get stonewalled by the software vendors IanCutress: Broadwell-E has TM3, allowing a core +500MHz, but disabled by default by mobo vendors.

No sooner have you spied the latest handset, then there's anticipation of something else, the next big thing. We've rounded up the best smartphones for 2017, those we consider to be the best across all platforms, and we've regularly updated that list as the smartphone world has evolved. You can find those in our Best smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy today feature. If your budget is a little smaller, there is also our Best budget smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy for under £250. Here we're looking at those phones that haven't yet launched, the best upcoming phones for 2017. We'll be updating this list on a regular basis, with those device rumours we think are credible and exciting, and devices just announced but yet to hit the shelves. We've also just had a glut of new smartphones at MWC 2017. Mobile World Congress 2017: All the announcements that matter Best upcoming phones 2017 Before we dive into the detail, here are some of the anticipated upcoming handsets for 2017: Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus HTC U/HTC Ocean Apple iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 8 Plus OnePlus 5 Google Pixel 2 @evleaks Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus Samsung had sure-fire hits with the Galaxy S7, especially in the S7 edge model. The company's standing in mobile might suffer a little following the Note 7's battery problems, so the Galaxy S8 might have to be extra special. Rumours have suggested that Samsung might drop the flat version of the S8, only offering curved devices in two sizes. There's also talk of increasing the screen resolution, perhaps with a move to 4K, and talk of 5.8 and 6.1-inch sizes, but with those big screens packed into more compact bodies. Samsung is sure to pack the S8 with its latest Exynos 8895 chipset for oodles of power, although we'd expect a Snapdragon 835 version too, and we'd expect to see a move to USB Type-C, following the move of the Note 7. On the software front, we'd expect the S8 to launch on Android Nougat with TouchWiz. Given Samsung's great experience, we'd not expect too many changes to Samsung's software experience. As the Samsung Galaxy S8 release date, it will be announced on 29 March 2017. Samsung Galaxy S8: Release date, rumours and everything you need to know Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus: Everything you need to know @evleaks HTC Ocean HTC's next flagship handset is thought to be going under the name of HTC Ocean. This name came from a video leak which showed off a concept handset, but supported by a leak via Twitter. HTC launched its first handsets for 2017 in the form of the U Play and U Ultra, but at the time said this wasn't the flagship and there was more to come. It's early days in the rumour cycle for this handset, but the focus of the video was on new methods of interaction, showing a phone with no buttons and using a mixture of voice, gestures and swipes to control it, so that's what we're expecting - as well as a Snapdragon 835 and a launch date at some point later in the year, perhaps April. One thing we do know for sure is that it won't be called HTC 11. HTC Ocean: What's the story on HTC's next flagship? Pocket-lint Apple iPhone 8 Yes, already. The paint has barely dried on the iPhone 7, but there's already talk of the iPhone 8, which is reported to shake things up completely. The iPhone 7, surprisingly, didn't make a huge change over the iPhone 6S, but the biggest hint at what to expect from the iPhone 8 might have come from Apple Watch. With the release of the Series 2 device, Apple introduced a ceramic version. This, paired with the jet black colouring for the iPhone 7, might point to future changes in materials for the iPhone 8.  Some are suggesting that the iPhone 8 will be mostly glass and introduce wireless charging, but there's expected to be a special edition ceramic version too. Taking it further, it's suggested that there will be an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus too, alongside this roaring iPhone 8. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint OnePlus 5 Wait, what? No, you're not going mad. There's a rumour that OnePlus will be skipping the 4 number and heading straight to OnePlus 5. The OnePlus 5 could land with a glass or ceramic body, moving on from the OnePlus 3T to present something a little different. It wouldn't be the first time that OnePlus has used something different, as it did in the OnePlus X. A 5.3-inch display might meet a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset for loads of power. This could all be heading your way in May or June. OnePlus 4/OnePlus 5: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint Google Pixel 2 The Google Pixel has received great acclaim for it's pure Google phone approach, with a lot of people really loving the camera experience.  Rumours are light on the Google Pixel 2 - we don't even have confirmation of the name - but it has been confirmed that there will be a new Pixel device in 2017. That was confirmed by Rick Osterloh, SVP of hardware at Google, i.e., the chap who will be responsible for it. Other details are light, but Osterloh also confirmed that the Pixel 2 would retain its premium positioning. That's about all we know so far, but you can expect Android O, and potentially another phone manufactured by HTC. We'd expect it to launch about October time, about a year after the original. Google Pixel 2: What do we want to see? Pocket-lint Nokia 8 Nokia made it's play at Mobile World Congress 2017, launching three Android devices. The lead device was the Nokia 6, but notably missing was a true flagship smartphone, colloquially dubbed the Nokia 8.  Originally leaking as the P1, and then finding itself levelled with the name Nokia 8, we're expecting a premium build, with an IP68 rating, a 5.5-inch display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. Most of the hardware rumours have said Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, but with plenty of mixed messaging coming from the flagship rumours and those wrapped up in the Nokia 6/5/3, we're going to be watching and waiting to see how the story of Nokia's flagship unfolds. Nokia 8 Android phone: Release date, rumours and specs facebook/designer Microsoft Surface Phone The Surface Phone is something of a Windows phone holy grail. With Nokia then Microsoft Devices producing plenty of Windows Phones, the spectre of the Surface Phone has been hanging around as the idea of the ultimate Windows mobile device. Given the recent sale of virtually all of its phone patents, and announcement that it's no longer focusing on Windows Phone development, the Surface Phone may never see the light of day. It's rumoured that the new premium device will be Surface branded and Intel powered, possibly coming in three different variants. Given the same team behind the Surface Tablets are said to be behind the Surface Phone, you can expect a solid build if it ever does appear. There's also the suggestion that Surface Phone will run a brand new update of Windows 10, aiming to capitalise on the branding and offer the ultimate experience. Launch originally wasn't expected until the latter half of 2016, but this has since shifted to 2017. That's if it appears at all. Microsoft Surface Phone: What's the story so far? Upcoming phones already announced... Pocket-lint LG G6 LG announced the LG G6 at MWC 2017, launching a phone with a 18:9 display. It's taller, narrower and designed to make it easier to use the 5.7-inch phone. It's a premium build, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and packing a pair of cameras on the rear, giving you regular and wide angle shots.  The LG G6 is going to be widely available, but there's no word on price or release date. We have used it, so you can read our full preview of this new handset. LG G6 preview: All screen, no frame Pocket-lint Huawei P10 and P10 Plus Huawei announced the P10 and P10 Plus at MWC 2017, delivering an update to the popular P9 handset. One of the visual changes is a range of interesting colours - it's not just black or grey, it's blue and green. There's a 5.1-inch display on the P10, a 5.5-inch display on the P10 Plus, packed into a metal body. The P10 offers Full HD, the P10 Plus makes a jump to Quad HD, with both being powered by the Kirin 960 chipset. There's a pair of Leica cameras on the rear, offering monochrome and colour capture separately, with optical image stabilisation. The Huawei P10 will be available from March 2017, costing around £550 for the smaller model, the larger is expected to be only £50 more. Read our previews for a little more information. Huawei P10 preview: The lean, green photo machine Huawei P10 Plus preview: Premium package, without a price hike Pocket-lint Nokia 6 The Nokia 6 is now a global device, offering a lovely build on mid-range specs. It has an aluminium body, fronted by a lovely 5.5-inch Full HD display. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset and offers a 16-megapixel camera on the rear, 8-megapixel on the front. Most attractive, however, is that it's pure Android, with no bloat at all - the only thing Nokia changes is the camera app. The Arte Black special edition (pictured) is only €299, the normal version is €229, meaning this is a serious bargain for Nokia's return to smartphones. There are also Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 handsets, which drop the specs down - the Nokia 6 is our star pick, however. Nokia 6 preview: A solid start for the new Android Nokia Pocket-lint Moto G5 and G5 Plus Motorola, now under the stewardship of Lenovo, pitched out the Moto G5 and G5 Plus at MWC 2017, updating it's affordable Android device. The Moto G5 now offers a metal body on both these devices, with a front fingerprint scanner. The G5 is a 5-inch device, the G5 Plus expands to 5.2-inches; the G5 Plus offers a more advanced camera and is the more powerful handset, with more storage too. That difference is also reflected in the price. The Moto G5 is £169, the Moto G5 Plus is £269. Both devices will be available in March. Moto G5 preview: The best budget phone, now dressed in a full metal jacket Moto G5 Plus preview: A big dose of premium, without the prohibitive price tag Pocket-lint BlackBerry KeyOne BlackBerry is now produced by TCL and the latest device is the BlackBerry KeyOne, formerly known as Mercury. This is a touch and type handset, offering the full glory of Android, with a BlackBerry keyboard on the bottom. This is a solidly-built handset with a premium finish, with a 3:2 display and powered by a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset. There's plenty of innovation here, like the fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Priced at £499, it's not hugely expensive for those looking for that keyboard fix paired with an Android experience. It will be available in April.

EPS for 2016 stood at NT$1.39, down from NT$2.09 of a year earlier. However, the company said it plans to hand out dividends of NT$2 in cash for 2016. The company reported earlier that its revenues for January 2017 were down 4.61% on year to NT$677 million due to seasonal factors. ASRock is expected to see its sales to start picking up in February-March due to the launch of Intel's Kaby Lake-based and AMD's Ryzen 7-based products, according to a Chinese-language Commercial Times report. The company's stock price rose NT$1.20 to finish at NT$43.30 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) during the March 6 session.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 March 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

Among the top 25 exporters from China to the U.S., more than 80 percent are owned by companies outside the mainland, according to a study by the Tokyo-based bank. While some manufacturing stocks face greater risk, the diversity of ownership means China itself isn’t as vulnerable as Japan was in the 1980s, when most of its big exporters were Japanese and Washington imposed curbs similar to those now being flagged by President Donald Trump, Nomura says. “A trade war between the U.S. and China could very well equally, if not more, impact stocks listed in Taiwan, Korea and the U.S.” wrote Nomura’s chief of China equity research Wendy Liu and analyst Erin Zhang. “China’s case is more complex than Japan’s experience in the 1980s.” Taiwan owns a majority of the biggest exporters to the U.S., which include Quanta Computer Inc.’s Shanghai-based unit, Tech-Com, and Pegatron Corp.’s Maintek Computer and Protek, the Nomura data show. Investors have been bracing for more information from Trump, who talked of boosting tariffs on imports into the U.S. and labeling China a currency manipulator while campaigning for the presidency. A majority of investors polled by Nomura expect some kind of spat over trade between the world’s biggest two economies, with companies in industries that have large trade surpluses with the U.S. likely to be the target of penalties, based on Japan’s experience.

Sign Up President Ronald Reagan slapped tariffs on Japanese items including motorcycles and TVs during the 1980s, and engineered a stronger yen via the Plaza Accord. His administration also lobbied to remove barriers in areas where the U.S. was competitive. China is currently the biggest source of U.S. imports, with its share of about 21 percent similar to Japan’s stake in the mid-1980s, Nomura said, citing International Monetary Fund data. “Trade volume between China and the U.S. is huge,” Chen Deming, China’s former commerce minister, told reporters Monday on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. “Both of us will be weakened and wounded by a trade war, and the global community will also be damaged.” Companies that make machinery and transport equipment are among those with the most to lose if trade tensions escalate, because China accounted for more than 20 percent of U.S. imports in 2016 in those sectors, according to Nomura. The bank flagged 18 stocks listed either on the mainland or in Hong Kong with more than 10 percent of sales coming from North America that chiefly manufacture outside of the U.S. They included Sichuan Chengfa Aero-Science & Technology Co., a Chengdu-based maker of aircraft parts, wigmaker Henan Rebecca Hair Products Co. and Intel Corp. supplier Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. Three Things Because American companies generally have greater access to China’s market today than they did to Japan’s in the 1980s, that means they have invested more in country and are “making good money” in China, the Nomura analysts wrote. That limits the chances of a damaging trade war. There are three key things to watch, in Nomura’s analysis -- U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s trade agenda, the April Treasury Department foreign-exchange report where the U.S. will decide whether to dub China a currency manipulator, and the future of the Sino-American framework for economic dialog, which under President Barack Obama saw annual meetings of top economic policy makers. “China’s case has more parties owning a stake than Japan in the ’80s, which means that the odds of a trade war are lower than otherwise,” the Nomura analysts concluded. Even so, “only a minority of investors in Europe and Asia believe that reconciliation between the U.S. and China is likely without a trade war,” they wrote. — With assistance by Emma O'Brien Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Guest IoT predictions for 2017 depend on helping developers Andreas Stavropoulos, DFJ@astavropoulos March 5, 2017 4:54 PM Image Credit: chombosan / Shutterstock The 20 to 50 billion new devices coming online over the next few years — estimates vary — represent a massive opportunity for businesses, and not just technology businesses. Smarter devices and troves of sensor data can improve existing business models and lead to the creation of entirely new ones. The device population explosion will lead to a data explosion that will spark the creation of businesses based on scalable, low-churn models in the coming year. Many of these businesses start with a hardware purchase, but none end there. For instance: Services that improve with individual usage. A security camera that learns to distinguish household members from strangers is much more likely to deliver context-sensitive alerts/recordings worth paying for, versus paying for hundreds of recordings of the mailman delivering a letter. Same goes for a fridge that can tell over time which brands to automatically replenish versus one-off items. The dossiers that devices build for their users are forms of lock-in. Nobody wants to retrain their devices. Services that improve with penetration density. There’s a network effect to smart devices. Shared learning (as in the self-driving car algorithms at Tesla and Google) and shared real-time data (like the Ring doorbell Neighborhoods feature, or the Tile Community Network) can make the value of a device on a network far greater than it is by itself. And again, this network effect leads to hardware and service lock-in. Devices that require higher-margin replacement parts. Think of a smart connected toothbrush (like the Oral-B Bluetooth connected model) that promotes frequent and proper brushing and orders brush replacements for you, or a smart water filtration system that orders its own parts and maintenance, or a smart thermostat that orders air filters. To succeed, these models depend on grabbing the consumer’s attention with ancillary data and analytics (tooth brushing reports and feedback, for example) to keep reinforcing the need for regular attention and replenishment. In contrast, devices that try to force a subscription for a minimal level of functionality, or with services that do not improve over time as competitors catch up, don’t stand a chance. The Internet of Things is going to kill static subscription services. But we are going to run into roadblocks unless we quickly embrace more modern development methodologies, security standards, and monitoring tools. There’s also the problem of a very small number of developers with experience in IoT devices and data structures, compared to the hordes of cloud and mobile developers. The easiest way to get developers working on IoT applications would be to give them familiar tools that abstract away the physical and low-level complexity of IoT. Enterprise developers are already using Linux container approaches (see Docker, CoreOS, and Apache Mesos). Containers will become important for the development of IoT systems as well. They open the door to virtualization, and bring benefits like failure containment and application isolation. These protections will make IoT systems more reliable, as well as easier to build. I predict significant strategic announcements in 2017 around support for container-based architectures for IoT from the likes of GE, Samsung, and Intel. Inevitably, IoT devices will get more powerful due to the falling costs of full system-on-chip architecture. It makes sense that they be treated as full-fledged, cloud-enabled network computing nodes. The more powerful they are, the easier it will be for developers to take their familiarity with existing developmental methodologies (including containers) and apply those skills directly to these devices. Developing the data architectures and analysis is a different skill set, but at least on the hardware side the future doesn’t look too alien. Security will improve alongside the drive to known development models, but we can also look forward to new standards that will constrain network traffic depending on what a device attests that it needs. Work that the Docker community is doing to implement signed images and attestation on the cloud side can transfer to the IoT domain. And for industrial IoT applications, we’ll see continued decentralization of intelligence: Nodes won’t connect to the cloud, but to edge or intermediate points. Mobile data bottlenecks, security concerns and physical limitations, coupled with the need for fast reactions between sensors and actuators, (e.g. automated factory sensors that predict failures locally and take preventative actions, like the platform Alluvium is building) all point in this direction. I expect to see machine-learning driven decision-making applications close to the edge (perhaps even on-chip), with gateway devices acting as relays to the cloud for backup, updating, network-effect sharing, and diagnostics. While these improvements would speed the connected device explosion, their interoperability and updateability are nowhere near where they need to be. Getting the development part of IoT right is a good first step. Andreas Stavropoulos is a partner at venture capital firm DFJ.

Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil CEO, speaks during CERAWeek at the Hilton Americas,Monday, March 6, 2017, in Houston. By CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is again citing corporate investments planned before he took office as evidence that his policies are growing jobs and business. "We are already winning again, America!" he tweeted Monday after Exxon Mobil announced the latest details of an expansion initiative that actually began in 2013. "Buy American & hire American are the principals at the core of my agenda, which is: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS," he said in another tweet thanking Exxon Mobil for the announcement. It's the latest in a string of corporate announcements about jobs and investments that date back to plans companies largely made when Barack Obama was president. The Exxon chairman and CEO, Darren Woods, said the company will spend $20 billion over 10 years on refineries, chemical and liquefied natural gas plants along the Gulf Coast in an investment plan that responds to the rising supply of natural gas. The work would create 12,000 permanent jobs and 35,000 temporary construction jobs. Woods replaced Rex Tillerson when he left the helm of the company to become Trump's secretary of state. Trump also tweeted a video giving himself credit. "This is something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration," he said in the video. "I said we're bringing back jobs. This is one big example of it." A statement released by the White House quoted Woods as telling a petroleum conference in Houston that private sector investment is "enhanced" by Trump's support for a "stable regulatory environment." But the statement also acknowledged that Exxon's "Growing the Gulf" program involves investments that started in 2013 and are expected to continue through 2022 at least. Trump has credited his policies for a variety of corporate announcements - by Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel and more - that reflect decisions made before his presidency. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd EDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The ThunderSync 16 speeds up situations needing large data transfer - such as video file uploading or operating system updates - when the data is required to be loaded in the fastest possible time. It is a finished solution in a compact, durable, easy-to-use form factor. The ThunderSync 16 supports universal, intelligent charging of USB ports at up to 2.4A simultaneously, and is not limited in the number of USB devices that can be attached due to each port having its own USB host controller.  For more than 16 ports, the ThunderSync16 can simply be daisy-chained via the dual Thunderbolt ports.  To give an idea of speed: a recent lab test scenario achieved a 10x reduction in transfer time; a 5GB file transfer to 16 devices took only 4 minutes compared to more than 40 minutes for a typical USB transfer scenario.  Thunderbolt transfer speeds are around 20Gb/s, while USB2.0 only offers 480Mb/s per port. The ThunderSync 16 allows the charging of multiple device types simultaneously, irrespective of manufacturer, such as tablets, ChromeBooks, mobile phones, MP3 players, e-readers, 3D Glasses, etc.  Whatever device is connected, the pre-programmed Very Intelligent Charging protocol insures the correct charging profile is used for the specific product, maintaining battery performance and extending battery life without risking damage to expensive technology products. The ThunderSync 16 is designed to operate with the complementary Cambrionix LiveView app which provides the user with complete control and monitoring.  This supplied software demonstrates the unique benefits of Cambrionix patented technology, and displays the charging status in detail.  It shows each port, if a device is attached, and how much energy it is using.  Individual ports can be configured for either Sync or Charge mode, or turned off.  An API is also provided for software automation scripting, essential for software QA and mobile phone remarketing companies. The ThunderSync 16  is perfect for use by manufacturers, defense, security, software QA, and wearable camera companies who perform large scale charging and data transfer. It is powered by an internal universal power supply, and is Intel Certified, CE Marked, UL Listed and EMC FCC tested. The ThunderSync 16  is designed and manufactured by Cambrionix Ltd (Cambridge UK) - leaders in mobile charging technology and connectivity.  It is available now from Saelig Company.

If you haven't been paying attention to the PC world lately, you might not have noticed that the lowly PC has seen a bit of a resurgence, with interesting designs and unique concepts. We saw this come to bear at CES just a couple of months ago, where PC makers such as Dell, Lenovo, and HP all trotted out interesting laptop designs. But the laptop isn't the only PC that's seen a design-focused revival. The lowly desktop PC has transformed from a boring beige or black box into a centerpiece of a modern desk space. An all-in-one computer in 2017 is both functional as a computer and beautiful to appreciate as a piece of design. This is only slightly related, but it's something that has been bugging me for years, and since I was confronted with it again this past weekend, I might as well get it out of my system: why is nobody innovating anymore in the field of building your own computer? So many aspects of building your own computer are completely crazy when you think about it, and it seems like nobody is really doing anything to fix them. For instance, why haven't we come up with a way to increase the power you can draw from a PCI-E slot, so that graphics cards don't have to be plugged into the PSU directly with unwieldy power cables, with connectors in the most boneheaded location on the graphics card? Why are we still using those horrible internal 9/10-pin connectors for USB, the front panel, audio, and so on? These are absolutely dreadful connectors, spread out all over the motherboard in illogical places forcing you to route cabling in unnatural ways, and the pins can easily bend. This is terrible 80s technology that we should've fixed by now. And the most idiotic connector of them all, which is huge, stiff, almost impossible to plug in, remove, or route properly: the ATX power plug from the PSU to the motherboard. This thing is probably one of the worst connectors you can possibly find inside any computer, and the slot on the motherboard is in an incredibly illogical place considering most case layouts. To make matters worse, the CPU power connector sits at the top-left (usually) of the motherboard, so that's another unwieldy connector and cable with an unnatural route that you have to deal with. It's just terrible. I like the inside of my computer to look as neat and tidy as possible - not only because it looks nice and is easier to clean, but also because it improves airflow, something quite important with today's processors and graphics cards. However, aging standards with terrible designs and horrible usability that wouldn't look out of place in a 1960s mainframe make that quite the challenge. We've seen some minor improvements already these past ten years or so, with the advent of modular PSUs and the death of the dreadfully terrible IDE cables and Molex connectors, but more work is definitely needed. We need a replacement for the aging ATX standard, which delivers enough power to the motherboard for the board itself, video cards, and the processors and fans, through a single cable with a modern, easy-to-use connector. It'd be great if a replacement for SATA could also carry power, so that we no longer need to route individual power cables to our hard drives. We need to get rid of 9/10-pin connectors for things like USB and the front panel, and replace them with easy-to-use USB-like connectors. And last but certainly not least: put all of these things in locations that make sense for the vast majority of cases in use today, so we can reduce the length of cables, save money in the process, and end up with cleaner, easier-to-use computers. Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, case makers, Microsoft, and whomever else is involved here - sit around a damn table for once, and hash this stuff out. ATX is outdated garbage, and needs a modern replacement. ATX was introduced in 1995 - do you still want to use Windows 95? OS/2 Warp? Version 1.2.0 of the Linux kernel? System 7.5.1? Floppies? CRTs? Of course you don't! Then why the hell are we still using ATX?

Barack Obama issued an order last year to public schools presuming that when Congress adopted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, its members intended to allow boys who “identify” as girls into girls’ restrooms and showers, and vice versa. In the case, a girl, Gavin Grimm, insisted on using the boys’ restrooms in the Gloucester school district in Virginia based on her “gender identity.” The school district resisted, the dispute went to court, and at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the judges granted the girl permission, based on Obama’s order. But President Donald Trump reversed the order, and the Supreme Court, which had accepted the school district’s appeal of the 4th Circuit ruling already, sent the case back to the lower court. “Outlasting the Gay Revolution” spells out eight principles to help Americans with conservative moral values counter attacks on our freedoms of religion, speech and conscience by homosexual activists “The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of the guidance document issued by the Department of Education and Department of Justice on February, 22, 2017,” the high court said in its only comment on the case. Obama’s order ignored the rights of millions of other students to not be unclothed in the presence of someone of the opposite gender. Obama’s move also would have opened up schools for liability should they, for example, require boys to room together on school field trips. Obama’s plan would have required a school to allow a boy to room with a girl. “The first duty of school districts is to protect the bodily privacy rights of all of the students who attend their schools and to respect the rights of parents who understandably don’t want their children exposed in intimate changing areas like locker rooms and showers,” said Kerri Kupec of the Alliance Defending Freedom, which fought the Obama administration over the issue. “President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and Education Secretary DeVos rightly rescinded the faulty directive that the Departments of Education and Justice had issued during the Obama administration. It only makes sense for the Supreme Court to vacate the 4th Circuit’s earlier decision and instruct it to reconsider this case,” she said. “The 4th Circuit should affirm the plain meaning of Title IX, which protects boys’ and girls’ privacy in locker rooms, showers, and restrooms. School officials should be free to protect their students’ privacy, safety, and dignity without federal government interference.” The term “sex” in the federal law, until Obama tried to change it, simply meant the gender at birth, male or female. WND reported last week that Gap, Lyft, Microsoft and dozens of other corporations endorsed the now-failed change forced on schools by Obama in a friend-of-the-court brief. “Big business shouldn’t be advocating for boys to share the girls’ locker rooms and showers – and vice versa – in our public schools, and yet that’s precisely what these 53 companies are doing,” Kupec said at the time. Kupec noted the companies say in their brief that they “recognize that employees cannot work as effectively when they are worried about how their children are being treated at school.” But the companies, Kupec said, are “completely unconcerned about the dad who knows his daughter has to change for gym with a boy in her locker room.” “Worse, the companies would characterize that dad as having a ‘lack of any reasoned justification’ for his concerns, as the brief puts it, or as having a lower ‘level of enlightenment,’ as some activists have revealingly stated. The first duty of school districts is to protect the bodily privacy rights of all of the students who attend their schools and to respect the rights of parents who understandably don’t want their children exposed in intimate changing areas.” “Outlasting the Gay Revolution” spells out eight principles to help Americans with conservative moral values counter attacks on our freedoms of religion, speech and conscience by homosexual activists The companies joining in the failed effort urging the Supreme Court to open restrooms nationwide include Affirm, Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Asana, Box, Codecademy, Credo Mobile, Dropbox, Ebay, Etsy, Fastly, Flipboard, Gap, General Assembly Space, GitHub, IBM, Intel, Kickstarter, Knotel, LinkedIn, Lyft, M Booth, MAC Cosmetics, Mapbox, Marin Software, Massachusetts Mutual, Microsoft, Mitchell Gold, MongoDB, NetApp, Next Fifteen, Nextdoor, Pandora, Paypal, Postmates, RetailMeNot, Salesforce, Shutterstock, Slack Tech, Spotify, OutCast Agency, WhiteWave Foods, Tumblr, Twilio, Twitter, Udacity and Warby Parker. Mathew Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, which has fought some of the transgender bathroom cases, said the move by Trump was significant. “Removing this lawless directive from the Obama administration will do a lot to get the federal government off the backs of these local schools,” said Staver, who says the Obama order put girls in vulnerable situations with biological males. He said the backlash by liberals and the media is unreasonable, as if “there is something horrible” that Trump did. “Frankly, he’s just following the law. The law does not include gender identity, or sexual orientation, or gender expression – or whatever you want to say – to the non-discrimination categories,” said Staver. “Outlasting the Gay Revolution” spells out eight principles to help Americans with conservative moral values counter attacks on our freedoms of religion, speech and conscience by homosexual activists   Click here for reuse options!

Romanski, who is also the country sponsor for South Africa and China, pledged to focus on accelerating the continent’s digital adoption rates, both at the consumer and business level. “Technology presents many opportunities and challenges for Africa as the fastest urbanising region in the world,” Romanski explains. “Cisco recognises the pipeline of African talent and we are deeply involved in enabling the widespread emergence of tech ecosystems across the continent.” Cisco Connect South Africa kicked off in Sun City today, and will run until Tuesday This is also appropriate in light of Africa’s projected growth within the next four years. According to Romanski, over a billion devices will be floating around the continent by 2020, presenting companies and Africa’s citizens with large growth possibilities. In addition to the keynote (and one particularly interesting surfing analogy), Romanski also touched on the Cisco Switch Board — the company’s smart whiteboard-cum-collaboration tool, as well as Cisco’s Innovation Centres — the company’s version of tech startup incubators. Other keynote speakers included South Africa’s minister of science and technology Naledi Pandor, Intel’s South Africa managing director and country manager Videsha Proothveerajh, and Cisco cloud security consultant Paolo Passeri. The two-day conference runs until Tuesday afternoon, and showcases a number of Cisco’s, and the company’s partners’ wares, offerings and solutions.

The request came from FBI Director James Comey, who disputed the claim because it falsely suggested that the FBI broke the law. Reopened hostilities President Trump’s accusations of wiretapping have reignited a long-simmering feud with former President Obama. Mr. Trump claimed Saturday that his predecessor engaged in McCarthyism and called Mr. Obama a “bad or sick guy.” The tweeted attacks broke an uneasy truce between the two men since the White House transition. The rift is upending presidential norms. Not so fast President Trump has often talked about working more closely with Russia in the fight against ISIS. But with his administration increasingly embroiled in questions about his advisors’ closeness with Moscow, an anti-ISIS alliance looks increasingly unlikely, experts say. Presidential spin? In his address to Congress last week, President Trump said 94 million Americans are out of the labor force. How accurate is that claim, and how well does it reflect the economic realities the White House inherited from the Obama administration? Penny-wise? Every time the United States Mint stamps a penny, it loses money. That’s because the total amount spent to make a cent exceeds its face value, costing the government millions of dollars every year. We look at the costs involved in making pennies and other coins. Success insight Airbnb is a growing force in the global lodging industry, with nearly 80 million guests booking stays last year. Women make up more than half the hosts. First on “CBS This Morning,” Airbnb’s founder and CEO talks about the role of women in his business and how he found success in Silicon Valley. Course correction While the stock market continues its bull run, even crossing the 21,000 level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, investors need to be working to protect the gains they’ve scored so far. That means it’s time to devise a “defensive” investing approach. The robust rally could well stay on course, but it’s also possible that prices could reverse more quickly than most investors might expect.

Q in the James Bond movies served up futuristic gadgets, and Q in Star Trek was omnipotent. A new quantum computing program called Q at IBM will be remarkable in its own right. In a few years, IBM plans to create a quantum computer with more than 50 qubits, which should push conventional computers one step closer to the trash heap. IBM Q will deliver paid quantum computing consulting and services to users. It's much like IBM's Watson, which uses conventional computers, but Q uses quantum computers. The 50-qubit quantum computer will be 10 times larger than a 5-qubit system already housed by IBM. And the new system will be able to do things that conventional computers can't do. It will accelerate drug discovery and make scientific discoveries, IBM said. Quantum computers are radically different than conventional PCs and could ultimately replace today's PCs and servers. They offer a way to advance computing as today's classical computer reach their limit, and as making smaller chips becomes challenging. IBM is building faster quantum computers to show such systems aren't theoretical dreams. IBM's ultimate goal is to build a universal quantum computer with thousands of qubits to run a wide range of computing tasks. The 50-bit quantum computer is a practical enough size to develop algorithms and start solving some real problems, said Scott Crowder, vice president and chief technology officer of quantum computing for IBM Systems. Faster computers will also help discover new uses for quantum computers that were previously unexplored, Crowder said. Quantum computers are good at solving problems in areas like drug discovery and molecular structures, where different angles to a particular problem, including those not immediately obvious, need to be taken into account, Crowder said.  It's difficult to tackle tasks like drug discovery and molecular-composition analysis on today's PCs and servers because of the amount of compute power needed. Today's computers are good at taking big sets of data and finding answers within them, Crowder said. It seems a bit early for IBM to launch a commercial service for quantum computing, which is still being researched. But the response to its 5-qubit quantum computer was amazing since it was launched last May, with about 40,000 users, more than 200,000 experiments, and 15 research papers written by the external community, said Jerry Chow, manager for IBM's experimental quantum computing group. The smaller quantum computer paved the way to expand the program and launch IBM Q. The bigger quantum computers being built will be hosted by IBM, given the machines require special cabinets and cooling mechanisms. IBM will work with early industry partners to help build the application use cases and the science to stabilize the computers. IBM's current 5-bit quantum computer is being offered through the public cloud as part of a program called the Quantum Experience, which will remain available for free. Building quantum computers has been a big challenge partly because the systems are highly unstable. Today’s computers store bits in the form of a one or zero, while qubits can achieve various states, like holding a one and a zero, simultaneously. This technique is called superposition and gives quantum computers the ability to vastly increase processing power over traditional forms of computing. But qubits can be notoriously fragile and could be upset by something as simple as electromagnetic radiation, which could wreck computational cycles. Quantum computers need to be stabilized so they can be used for tasks like genome sequencing, which needs the qubits to be reliable over a sustained period of time. IBM researchers have been working on the problems related to handling qubits, and the quantum computer will prove their success, company officials said. The focus for the 50-bit quantum computers will be on bringing them stability, including connectivity between qubits, as well as the gating and error correction. In addition to IBM, quantum computers are also being pursued by Intel and Microsoft, which is basing its research on a particle that exists only in theory. D-Wave offers a specialized US $15 million, 2000-qubit quantum annealing computer called 2000Q, which will ultimately be offered via the cloud. IBM has also developed a new type of computer based on brain-inspired chips like its experimental TrueNorth processor. The NS16e has come a long way and could also ultimately be offered via a specialized program. Those computers are designed more for tasks like machine learning, which today's computers can handle. IBM will also offer SDKs (software development kits) and APIs (application programming interfaces) so code written using popular programming interfaces can be exported to quantum computers.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.
