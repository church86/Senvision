Putin's press conference came amid controversy surrounding Trump's alleged disclosure of classified information to Russian officials last week.  Putin said the transcript could be provided, "if the US administration finds it appropriate," CNN reported. Read: Trump Denies Sharing Classified Intel To Russians In A Series Of Tweets Just a day after the Washington Post claimed Trump disclosed classified intel in a White House meeting about a planned Islamic State group (ISIS) operation, the New York Times claimed the information allegedly discussed came from Israel. On Tuesday, Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke over a phone call for over 20 minutes. However, officials claimed that there was no discussion of classified information during the call. Senior officials told Haaretz Tuesday night that Trump and Netanyahu talked about the upcoming Israel visit of the U.S. president.  Trump made the phone call to Netanyahu soon after talking with Jordan's King Abdullah II, after which the White House had released a statement. However, the call with Netanyahu was not publicized either by the White House or the Prime Minister's Office. Haaretz reported that Netanyahu's office confirmed the phone call took place. "The conversation dealt with a few issues that needed to be concluded regarding President Trump's visit to Israel," Haaretz quoted an anonymous source. Regarding the allegations in the New York Times report, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer said in an e-mailed statement: "Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump."  White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, refused to comment on whether Israel is the source of the classified information Trump is alleged to have shared with the Russian officials. However, he offered appreciation at the ambassador's comment on the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Spicer said during the press conference: "We appreciate the strong relationship that we have with Israel with respect to intelligence-sharing, and hope to continue to grow that bond.  But I'm not going to comment on specifically where it came from." On Tuesday, Trump defended himself over the alleged disclosure of classified intel saying that he shared information related to "terrorism" and "airline flight safety." On Monday, the Washington Post reported Trump did not disclose the exact source used for the intel, but he provided “code-word information,” apparently connected to an ISIS plot related to the use of laptops on board passenger aircrafts. Following the Post's report, the White House rejected the claims, with H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, saying the president and Russian foreign minister “reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation.” "The story that came out tonight as reported is false," McMaster told reporters at the White House Monday. "At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. I was in the room. It didn't happen." Meanwhile, Trump drew strong condemnation from Democrats as well as some Republican lawmakers.  "The disclosure of highly classified information has the potential to jeopardize sources and to discourage our allies from sharing future information vital to our security," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said. The president and the White House continue to deny the allegations.

Each of those chips comprises four eight-core Zen units, connects up to 8 memory channels, and has 128 lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity. Those specs are enticing enough on their own, but the first questions on every datacenter administrator's mind are how exactly do these CPUs perform and how exactly does AMD intend to fit them onto rack units. As it turns out, AMD isn't trying to aim cannonballs at top-end Xeon servers. Instead, the company wants to take a slice from the meaty middle of the two-socket (2S) server market, and is posing its Epyc offerings as single-socket alternatives that should hopefully deliver the same performance with much smaller boards—thereby potentially lowering cooling and power requirements. To illustrate the point, AMD offered a demonstration of a 2S Epyc system going against two high-end Xeon E5-2699A v4 CPUs, each with 22 cores and 55 MB of cache. AMD's machine had 256 GB of RAM thanks to its eight channels, while the Intel-powered server was rolling with 128 GB. The Epyc box finished a Linux kernel compilation in 15.7 seconds, around 43% faster than the 22.5 seconds it took the Intel system. Those figures may raise a couple eyebrows on their own, but AMD proceeded to point out that not a whole lot of systems are shipped with the mighty Xeon E5-2699A v4 onboard. According to the company, servers powered by Intel's Xeon offerings between the ES-262x and ES-265x series make up the bulk of shipments, and among those, the ES-264x series is the best seller among them. AMD proceeded to offer another demonstration, then: a single-socket Epyc system with 128 GB of RAM going up against a 2S box with Xeon ES-2650 v4 CPUs (12 cores each). For a Linux kernel compile, the Epyc system took 33.7 seconds, while the Xeon box did its work in 37.2 seconds. While this is but a single benchmark, it's nonetheless impressive and lends some credence to AMD's plan of going after two-socket systems with single-socket Epyc offerings. AMD offered some more figures to support its case. The company says that an Epyc 1S system has "significantly" lower power consumption versus a comparable 2S Intel-powered machine and can offer a 30% lower total cost of ownership (TCO). Taking a direct jab at Intel's world-famous and world-hated product segmentation, AMD says that all Epyc CPUs are "unrestrained," meaning that the entire lineup from the lower-end model to the fanciest CPU will offer the same PCIe connectivity, all eight memory channels, the same security stack, and the same set of chipset features. Finally, the company played up Epyc's I/O (namely those 128 PCIe lanes) as an advantage for machine learning applications (you thought you'd read an entire post without those words?) As a sample case study, AMD showed what it takes for an Intel system to drive six compute accelerator cards—two CPUs, a storage controller, two sets of eight DIMMs, and two PCIe switches. In comparison, an Epyc system would require a single CPU directly reaching out to the drives, 16 DIMM slots, and all six compute cards at once. Only time will tell whether AMD's Epyc moves in the server space will pan out, but we're at least cautiously optimistic. After all, I can barely even remember the days when I saw "Opteron" in a text console. Tags: CPUs Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

News & Analysis Intel's Flash Gambit Evolving Into 3-Pronged Strategy Majeed Ahmad 5/18/2017 00:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAHORE, Pakistan—After years of mostly covert development, Intel’s investment in flash memory is finally showing signs of bearing fruit in 2017, a year that some observers are calling “the year of NAND flash.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich claims that the company's non-volatile memory business will finally be profitable by 2018. It's worth noting that Intel announced record revenue of $866 million in the first quarter of 2017. At the same time, however, the world's largest chipmaker has vowed to raise the capex for its memory business. Intel, for instance, has been expanding the NAND flash capacity at its Fab 68 in Dalian, China. A closer look at Intel's non-volatile memory business reveals a three-pronged strategy. First and foremost, Intel plans to focus on differentiated products with higher ASPs, said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel is also investing heavily in much smaller 3D NAND flash chips while seeking opportunities in the planar-to-3D NAND transition. Intel is using floating-gate cells to bring significant improvements in the density of 3D NAND flash chips. Second, as a recent EE Times story points out, Intel is moving into solid-state drive (SSD) business in a bid to provide software-defined storage for datacenter and cloud computing applications. That also allows the chipmaker to protect its NAND flash margins while meeting the surge in SSD demand for servers. No wonder the majority Intel's flash revenues comes from the sale of its SSDs for the higher-end server market. It also lowers the reliance on NAND flash buyers like Western Digital, which dropped Intel a few years ago after acquiring SanDisk, Toshiba's NAND flash partner. Third, Intel is stepping up investment in 3D Xpoint, another non-volatile memory technology that promises to serve as a storage product as well as a DRAM replacement. The 3D Xpoint memory technology is said to offer vast improvements in speed and endurance when compared to NAND flash. Intel and its 3D Xpoint technology partner Micron Technology are years ahead when it comes to a viable flash replacement. However, as Krewell puts it, Intel hasn't been very transparent with details about the 3D Xpoint technology. And that makes it hard to verify Intel's claims. Krewell expects a gradual 3D Xpoint ramp in the near term. Intel—with a controlled supply—can match volume production of 3D Xpoint with demand and thus avoid over-supply that is intrinsically tied to the flash business. - Majeed Ahmad is a technology writer and historian who covers semiconductors for EE Times.  Related content: Intel Ramps up 3D NAND, NVMe SSDs Intel Boots Drives with 3D XPoint Intel Boosts CapEx 20% Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: AMD Shifts Toward Premium Products to Boost Profits The company is going after the lucrative high-end PC CPU market with its various Ryzen chips, including a 16-core monster launching this summer. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) May 17, 2017 at 3:05PM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) held its annual Financial Analyst Day event on May 16, providing an update on its strategy and its long-term financial targets. AMD expects to return to profitability this year, at least on a non-GAAP basis, along with double-digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion. It expects those trends to continue through 2020, producing non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75 in that year. A shift toward premium products will be a major driver of this growth. AMD has long been known, at least in the CPU market, as being a cheaper alternative to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company wants to shed that reputation. AMD has already launched Ryzen CPUs for desktop PCs, a vast improvement over the company's previous-generation chips, and a slew of other premium products are coming this year. Image source: AMD. Of course, Intel won't take kindly to AMD going after its lucrative premium products. Chipzilla will no doubt be launching new products and cutting prices if necessary to beat back AMD, making the company's financial targets no sure thing. AMD will be launching new Vega GPUs and its EPYC server processors later this year as well, but it will be going against similarly entrenched competition in those markets. A focus on profitability AMD expects to grow revenue by a low-double-digit percentage in 2017, a goal that may seem disappointing to investors considering all the new products set to launch this year. AMD is going after high-margin revenue, aiming to boost its non-GAAP gross margin to 34% this year, up from 31% in 2016 and 28% in 2015. By 2020, AMD expects its gross margin to exceed 40%. Along with boosting the gross margin, AMD expects to bring down operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, mostly by keeping costs in check as revenue grows. The non-GAAP EPS target of $0.75 by 2020 represents about $700 million of non-GAAP net income at the current share count, and it expects to produce at least some non-GAAP net income in 2017. In the PC market, AMD will be going after the premium segment. According to the company, 79% of revenue in the PC CPU market comes from the premium segment, along with 55% of unit volume. Prior to Ryzen, AMD was concentrated in the mainstream segment and below. With Ryzen, the focus shifts to gaining premium market share. More cores Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5, the high-end and mainstream lines of Ryzen CPUs, have already launched for desktop PCs, with the lower-end Ryzen 3 coming later this year. The key feature of Ryzen is the number of cores; the higher-end models have eight cores, double the number found in most Intel processors. Major PC original equipment manufacturers like HP and Dell are expected to launch Ryzen systems during the second quarter, boosting the total addressable market. The mobile version of Ryzen will be coming during the second half, featuring graphics based on the company's Vega GPU. The focus again will be on performance, with AMD promising big increases in CPU and GPU performance. AMD is also launching Ryzen Pro, aimed at the commercial market, during the second half. The headline product will be Threadripper, AMD's 16-core high-end desktop processor set to launch during the summer. Image source: AMD. Ryzen has so far received mixed reviews, mainly because AMD remains behind Intel in terms of single-threaded performance. Gaming performance has been particularly disappointing; Ryzen CPUs are certainly capable gaming chips, but the single-threaded performance deficit can't be offset with more cores in applications that don't scale well. Intel won't be sitting on its hands as AMD goes after the most profitable portion of the PC CPU market. There are rumors that the company plans to launch a new line of Core i9 processors featuring up to 12 cores to combat AMD, and it certainly has room to adjust its prices if necessary. With AMD focusing on boosting its margins, it won't have that much room to undercut Intel on price. Investors betting that AMD will hit its long-term goals should know that the stock already trades for 16 times the 2020 EPS target. The market is assuming AMD will succeed, a perilous situation for investors if the company falls short. Ryzen puts AMD in a much-improved competitive position compared to a few years ago, and both Vega and EPYC have a lot of potential. But it will still be a battle to pry away premium market share from Intel. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

We’re joined now by phone by John Carlin. He served as chief of staff and senior counsel to Robert Mueller. He’s now an attorney in private practice specializing in cyber-security and crisis management. Mr. Carlin, thanks for joining us. Tell us a little bit about your former boss. JOHN CARLIN, Former Assistant Attorney General for National Security: I can’t think of an American of higher integrity and experience. This is someone legendary who prosecutors and agents in the field, who — a former Marine, spent a career as a prosecutor, has been nominated by presidents, including President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama, for different positions, and, throughout his career, has earned respect on both sides of the aisle. JOHN YANG: And do — talk about his independence. There was — you talked about being legendary. There’s — one of the legends about Robert Mueller is his threat to resign, ironically, with then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey facing down the Bush administration. JOHN CARLIN: He’s someone who has a firm belief in what’s right and wrong and what the appropriate role of a government official should be. I think he’s someone who looks to — epitomizes the idea that you should just follow the facts and the law, and has done so in all the different steps of his — of his career. And, as you have referenced, he’s someone who, if something appears that it’s outside the law, he won’t do it, or, if it’s improper, he won’t do it. And it’s that type of firm backbone that earned the respect of so many people that have worked with him as FBI agents, worked with him as prosecutors, and observed him over the years. He’s also highly unusual in this age. He’s someone who hates the — and avoids the limelight. And he’s managed to stay out of most news stories and keep an unbelievably low profile, when you consider what he’s done over his career. JOHN YANG: Could you remind us of that episode? Recount for us that episode with the showdown with, I believe, as I recall, it was White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. They wanted to overrule a Justice Department finding regarding surveillance, as I recall. JOHN CARLIN: Yes. And according to public reporting about what occurred there, there was a surveillance program that the then attorney general — Attorney General Ashcroft was ill. So, and Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey had assumed the role of acting attorney general. And based on the advice he received from lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel, he found that the program, as it was currently being run, wasn’t lawful, and so had to be shut down. And he learned about a visit that was going to be made by members of the White House, including the White House counsel, to Attorney General Ashcroft in his hospital bed, and was concerned. And so he asked Director Mueller to accompany him to that hospital room. Director Mueller did so. Attorney General Ashcroft said that, as acting attorney general, it would be Comey’s decision as to what was lawful or not lawful. And I think Director Mueller, kind of consistent with his career, if the lawyers at the Justice Department say something is not lawful, then you can’t do it, until you work out a way that it’s within the confines of the law. No matter how important the program might be, the law is the law. JOHN YANG: Ironically, the careers of James Comey and Robert Mueller once again intertwined. John Carlin, thank you very much for joining us. JOHN CARLIN: Thank you. JOHN YANG: And now we turn to — continuing on this story, we turn to Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a Republican of Illinois. He called today for a special counsel. Representative Kinzinger, I presume your — well, what’s your reaction now to the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller? REP. ADAM KINZINGER, R-Ill.: Well, I was surprised. I was surprised in a good way. I think this is the right thing to do. The reason I called for it today, with the revelations of the supposed memo yesterday, the questions that have been arising, I just came to the realization — and I have always said from the beginning the American people deserve the facts, whatever they are, whoever they exonerate or whoever they indict. The American people deserve that. And this had become way too political. Any new story, any new piece of information that had come out, you know, the left screams — some on the left mention impeachment right away. Some on the right would say it’s fake news. And neither is true. So, we need to get to the bottom of it. We need answers, and we need them in a nonpartisan way. And my hope is, this is the beginning of the process of saying, let’s all tack a deep breath. Let’s aggressively find out the truth of everything and the facts, and then we can move ahead, and the American people can have faith again in the institutions of government. JOHN YANG: Do you think this is going to turn the temperature down a little bit on the Hill, sort of the boiling controversy that’s been going on for the past really couple of weeks now? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: It’s hard to tell. You know, truthfully, probably not a lot. You’re going to have now an outlet, I guess, for this. It’s — Congress can say — there will probably be these investigations continuing still in the Congress, but the majority of the focus will be with the special counsel’s office. But this is a very hot-button issue. And any new revelation that comes out, people are angry or people are happy about what they see or whatever. So, you’re going to continue to see that dynamic, I think. I think this is going to continue to drive news cycles and drive stories. But I think this is the right way to go for the American people, so they can say — you know, look, notoriously, have a very low faith in Congress to be able to do things in a nonpartisan way, because we’re a partisan body. But to be able now to move forward and say we want to get to the bottom with a very honorable American like Mr. Mueller, I think, is a good step. JOHN YANG: Is this any way an acknowledgment that the turmoil and sort of the back-and-forth that you saw with the House Intelligence Committee trying to investigate this, that they just could not handle this, that you had to turn to someone, an outsider like this? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I think, ultimately, it’s handleable. And whether it’s the House Intel or the Senate Intel Committee, they do this kind of stuff. They have access to the information. They go through the process. But there’s no doubt, a month or two ago, it got very heated, it got very personal. You can’t have that on the Intel Committee. I don’t necessarily know who to throw stones at on that, but you can’t have that on the Intel Committee. What you need is a calm, rational investigation. This, with this special counsel now, hopefully, we can get that. And, again, there will still be a lot of passion. Donald Trump is a very controversial president. People either love him or they don’t love him, and so you will continue to have that. But I think now people can hopefully rest assured that the work is going to be done. But they need to understand, everybody needs to understand this is going to be a slow and deliberate process. I guess I’m hearing it’s almost 60 days to even get a special counsel up and running. JOHN YANG: Let me talk you about the other controversies that have been around this week, the — not — this was topped obviously yesterday by the Comey memo. But, before that, we had the allegations about President Trump giving Israeli intelligence, what’s reported to be Israeli intelligence, to the Russians. What do you think about that? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: So, I was disappointed. So, I’m a military pilot. I still serve in the Guard and fly planes, and I have been in since basically after college. And we learned early that, when it comes to classified information — I have a military classification, as well as a congressional classification — you have to be very careful with that. Now, the president does have the right to declassify information whenever he wants to. Theoretically, a president could take everything Edward Snowden stole and release that himself. But it doesn’t make it wise. And so if you’re going to, especially with an adversary, talk about something that’s classified, you need to do two things. Number one, talk to the folks that provided that information to you and make sure it’s OK, and, secondly, I think put that through the brain trust of your national security group, H.R. McMaster, everybody else, to say, hey, I want to reveal this to the Russians because it may help us in our fight with ISIS or whatever reason. If we can go through that filter, I think it would have been very different. But it seems like — I wasn’t in the Oval Office — it seems like it was released willy-nilly. And I think that’s a very bad thing, very dangerous, and hopefully a lesson learned from all this. JOHN YANG: How has all of this affected your confidence and trust in the president? It’s a very early administration, and we have had all this turmoil, all these stories going on. Has this shaken your confidence at all? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Well, as I have always said, I think the policies — as a Republican, the policies coming out of this administration, the foreign policy, has been good. The strike on Syria was good, pushing back against North Korea. The words are not. You know, the tweets, the early morning kind of Twitter rampage and some of these other things aren’t. Does it shake my confidence? Look, I think that’s a pretty boisterous thing to say for a member of Congress to say whether or not their confidence is shaken. I have concerns. But I know he has a great team around him advising him, and I hope he takes that advice. This is, again — hopefully, this special counsel is the beginning of bringing the temperature down a little bit. It will always be pretty hot, but, hopefully, we can see that. JOHN YANG: Do you think — are you hopeful that you will and — you and your colleagues in the House will be able to focus more on the Republican agenda now than on the president’s tweets and other things? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Yes. I’m really hopeful. I have been hopeful for while that we can do that. Look, we can walk — I hate to use the term, but we can walk and chew gum out here. So, we can have these controversies going on, but, still, today, we just voted on a bill passed unanimously for sanctions against Syria. We can continue to do that work. But when you have all this basically dominating the news cycle, it doesn’t give us an opportunity to get our message out, whether it’s health care, tax reform. And, frankly, then the president of the United States is not out selling that agenda, too. So, it takes away some key pieces to getting this done. So, hope springs eternal, and I have it now. JOHN YANG: Adam Kinzinger, representative from Illinois, thanks so much for joining us. REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Any time. Take care. JOHN YANG: And now we are joined by Matt Zapotosky from The Washington Post to talk about this. Matt, thanks for joining us. I think I probably butchered your last name. And I apologize. (CROSSTALK) JOHN YANG: Matt, this — as recently as yesterday, the White House was saying there was absolutely no need for a special counsel in this case. From your reporting, what — what happened? How did this — what precipitated all of this? MATT ZAPOTOSKY, The Washington Post: I don’t know that the White House always knows what’s going on inside the Justice Department. And, for days now, Rod Rosenstein, who is the deputy attorney general, had just seen his reputation battered over his role in the Comey case. You know, pressure had been increasing on both sides, Democrat and Republican, for the Justice Department to appoint an attorney general. I’m sure conversations were going on that we’re still trying to report on between him and Bob Mueller, the former FBI director that they appointed to be special counsel. And those obviously came to fruition today, though it’s really late-breaking. We’re still trying to report out exactly what happened. JOHN YANG: But do you think — we know there was reporting that Rod Rosenstein had — was unhappy that the dismissal of Comey was put on him, that the White House was putting it on him, and that he may have even threatened to resign. Is this a way for him to try to sort of reclaim his reputation? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I think somewhat, you know? And, I mean, look, he maybe made some threats or said some things to express his unhappiness with the way this went down, but you can’t read his memo any other way than to see that he wanted Jim Comey gone. That was just a blistering critique of Jim Comey. I do think he saw a lot of the blowback and reacted in some ways, and maybe that is what led to us where we are right now. JOHN YANG: Let’s turn to this — the new development, Robert Mueller. What — remind us who he is, his background, and what he brings to this. MATT ZAPOTOSKY: He’s a former FBI director who is very well-respected in Washington. Just as I sat down, a former federal prosecutor I know was texting me saying, there just could not be a better pick. He has a reputation of fierce independence. I think he has some military experience in his background and, of course, led the FBI for a long time. So, you know, and what he will do now is just take over this investigation, take over what Rod Rosenstein would have done. He could bring in his own team. He could use FBI agents. Maybe he knows some from his time in the bureau, but just a very well-respected guy in Washington. JOHN YANG: Matt, you cover the Justice Department. What’s this done to the career prosecutors, the career officials, the career lawyers at Justice? What’s the morale been like, from what you can gather? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I think there’s some frustration. But, by and large, people are just putting their heads down and working. I mean, there’s a very small number of people, you know, a very tight circle, I guess I should say — I don’t know about small number — but on this Russia stuff. And the other business of the Justice Department is going on. Certainly, I don’t think anybody likes the hit that it’s given to the Justice Department’s reputation, but these are career people who are going to come in and do their jobs every day. JOHN YANG: And do you have any sense of where this investigation is, where it was before this announcement? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I would say now it has probably slowed down. I mean, Bob Mueller now has to come in, decide what he needs for a budget, decide who he’s going to keep on, and if he needs to bring in any new people. I don’t have a crystal-clear sense of exactly how far along they were. I think the FBI director — the former FBI director said that it had started in July, and that’s a pretty small amount of time for a counterintelligence case. And now, you know, Bob Mueller is going to have to come in and wrap his arms around this and decide where to go from here. JOHN YANG: The fact that it is a counterintelligence case and sort of the FBI and the Justice Department’s spy hunters, does that make it different? Or how does that make it different from a criminal investigation? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: Certainly, that adds sensitivities to this. You could be talking about clandestine sources and methods. You’re talking about FBI counterintelligence agents who have been involved in this. This is just a little more sensitive than, say, a bank robbery, which is something the FBI also investigates. But, at the end of the day, that’s not to say it could not produce criminal charges. Now, I’m not saying we’re there that — yet — excuse me. Even in making this announcement, Rod Rosenstein said, said explicitly, look, I am not saying this because I think we are ready for a prosecutor or this is ready for criminal charges. I’m just saying it’s in the public interest that someone outside the Justice Department oversee this thing. JOHN YANG: So, we are probably still months away? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I would guess, yes. JOHN YANG: Matt Zapotosky, who covers the Justice Department for The Washington Post, thanks for joining us. MATT ZAPOTOSKY: Thank you. JOHN YANG: And now we go back to Capitol Hill for a Democratic perspective this time, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Schiff, thanks for joining us. Your reaction to this news that the Justice Department has appointed Robert Mueller as the special counsel in this case? REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-Calif.: Well, I think it’s a very positive step, and I applaud the choice of Bob Mueller. I think he’s very widely respected by people on both sides of the aisle, immensely bright, capable person. And I think it’s the right call. This is not to say that there aren’t good career people at the Department of Justice that could do this. But, nonetheless, I think it will have that much more credibility in the public eye by appointing someone in the special counsel position that has that added degree of independence from the department, still not the full independence that you would have had under the old statute, independent counsel statute, but, nonetheless, I think a very solid decision. And I think it ought to help inspire confidence in what the department is doing. JOHN YANG: Now, how will this work with the investigations on the Hill? Will your committee investigation continue in parallel with Mr. Mueller’s? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Yes, absolutely. And it’s very important, I think, for people to understand just what this means and what it doesn’t mean. The House and Senate investigations will continue to go forward. We have very important oversight responsibility. And, obviously, if we uncovered facts that we think that prosecutors ought to know about, we would refer that now to the special counsel. In the sense that we may need to coordinate our activities, because we have parallel investigations running, we would now work with Mr. Mueller. So, none of this stops what’s going on in the House and Senate. Indeed, if we form an independent commission, that also is a completely separate mission than that by the special counsel. The special counsel will be overseeing the FBI agents who are working the investigation, and the special counsel will be making decisions, if it comes to that, whether charges ought to be brought and against whom. JOHN YANG: And what will your committee be asking for, with this disclosure that Mr. Comey appears to have kept contemporaneous memos of his conversations and dealings with the president throughout this? Will you be seeking those documents? Will you be seeking testimony from Mr. Comey? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: I think we will in Congress be seeking those documents. Indeed, many of the chairs have already asked for them. I also think it will be important for Director Comey to come and testify once again, I hope in open session, so that we can add context to whatever is in these written memoranda. If there are tapes as well, as the president has threatened, we ought to obtain those. Those, in fact, would be the very best evidence of the discussions that may have taken place along the lines of that New York Times report in which it’s alleged that the president asked Director Comey to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn. So, all of that work in Congress by the House Intelligence Committee, by the Senate Intelligence Committee and others will go forth. It’s just that the FBI investigation, the prosecutorial decisions will now be made by the special counsel, Bob Mueller. JOHN YANG: And on that question of the tapes, the — is there going to be any investigation to determine if there are tapes to ask for? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we do need to find out whether there are tapes. And so I think we need to use whatever compulsion, if necessary, to find out. The president has obviously stopped talking about the tapes, and we don’t know whether that was a — simply a hollow threat he was making against Director Comey or in fact it’s backed up by the existence of tapes, but we do need to find out. JOHN YANG: Where is this — can you give us an update on sort of where your investigation is, where the House committee’s investigation is, and where it’s likely to proceed in the immediate future? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we are where you would expect a large investigation of this kind to begin. And that is with a review of an extraordinary number of documents. A lot of them are intelligence assessments that underlie the intelligence community’s conclusion about Russian intervention, about the Russian motivations. Obviously, we’re also looking into the issues of collusions. Were U.S. persons involved associated with the Trump campaign? We’re inviting witnesses to provide us documents. We’re inviting witnesses to come before the committee. We’re scheduling open and closed hearings. And we should have more to say about that in the near future. But these are all the steps that we’re taking. And I think we’re working together very well in a nonpartisan way. JOHN YANG: Representative Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, thank you very much. REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

The rumor had pushed up AMD shares by 12% on Tuesday, only to see the stock come crashing down by that amount on Wednesday after AMD management did not offer any mention of such a deal. By Tiernan Ray May 17, 2017 7:48 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Chip giant Intel (INTC) tonight refuted rumors it is licensing graphics chip technology from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). In a statement sent to Tech Trader Daily by an Intel spokesperson, the company said "The recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue." A rumor had spread on Tuesday that AMD had won a deal to license its graphics technology to Intel, as related by Fuad Abazovic of Fudzilla, who wrote that an AMD-Intel deal was “confirmed,” without citing sources. When AMD failed to disclose any such deal yesterday, during its annual analyst meeting to discuss its technology and financial outlook, the AMD stock was punished Wednesday. I asked Intel if the company has any further detail on whether it has definitely decided not to license technology from AMD. The company said no further detail would be provided. AMD shares today closed down $1.55, over 12%, at $11.20, reversing a 12% climb yesterday on the Fudzilla rumor.

Virtually every modern CPU core from ultra-low power chips like the ARM Cortex-A5 to the highest-end Intel Core i7 use caches. Even higher-end microcontrollers often have small caches or offer them as options — the performance benefits are too large to ignore, even in ultra low-power designs. Caching was invented to solve a significant problem. In the early decades of computing, main memory was extremely slow and incredibly expensive — but CPUs weren’t particularly fast, either. Starting in the 1980s, the gap began to widen quickly. Microprocessor clock speeds took off, but memory access times improved far less dramatically. As this gap grew, it became increasingly clear that a new type of fast memory was needed to bridge the gap. While it only runs up to 2000, the growing discrepancies of the 1980s led to the development of the first CPU caches How caching works CPU caches are small pools of memory that store information the CPU is most likely to need next. Which information is loaded into cache depends on sophisticated algorithms and certain assumptions about programming code. The goal of the cache system is to ensure that the CPU has the next bit of data it will need already loaded into cache by the time it goes looking for it (also called a cache hit). A cache miss, on the other hand, means the CPU has to go scampering off to find the data elsewhere. This is where the L2 cache comes into play — while it’s slower, it’s also much larger. Some processors use an inclusive cache design (meaning data stored in the L1 cache is also duplicated in the L2 cache) while others are exclusive (meaning the two caches never share data). If data can’t be found in the L2 cache, the CPU continues down the chain to L3 (typically still on-die), then L4 (if it exists) and main memory (DRAM). This chart shows the relationship between an L1 cache with a constant hit rate, but a larger L2 cache. Note that the total hit rate goes up sharply as the size of the L2 increases. A larger, slower, cheaper L2 can provide all the benefits of a large L1 — but without the die size and power consumption penalty. Most modern L1 cache rates have hit rates far above the theoretical 50 percent shown here — Intel and AMD both typically field cache hit rates of 95 percent or higher. The next important topic is the set-associativity. Every CPU contains a specific type of RAM called tag RAM. The tag RAM is a record of all the memory locations that can map to any given block of cache. If a cache is fully associative, it means that any block of RAM data can be stored in any block of cache. The advantage of such a system is that the hit rate is high, but the search time is extremely long — the CPU has to look through its entire cache to find out if the data is present before searching main memory. At the opposite end of the spectrum we have direct-mapped caches. A direct-mapped cache is a cache where each cache block can contain one and only one block of main memory. This type of cache can be searched extremely quickly, but since it maps 1:1 to memory locations, it has a low hit rate. In between these two extremes are n-way associative caches. A 2-way associative cache (Piledriver’s L1 is 2-way) means that each main memory block can map to one of two cache blocks. An eight-way associative cache means that each block of main memory could be in one of eight cache blocks. The next two slides show how hit rate improves with set associativity. Keep in mind that things like hit rate are highly particular — different applications will have different hit rates. Why CPU caches keep getting larger So why add continually larger caches in the first place? Because each additional memory pool pushes back the need to access main memory and can improve performance in specific cases. This chart from Anandtech’s Haswell review is useful because it actually illustrates the performance impact of adding a huge (128MB) L4 cache as well as the conventional L1/L2/L3 structures. Each stair step represents a new level of cache. The red line is the chip with an L4 — note that for large file sizes, it’s still almost twice as fast as the other two Intel chips. It might seem logical, then, to devote huge amounts of on-die resources to cache — but it turns out there’s a diminishing marginal return to doing so. Larger caches are both slower and more expensive. At six transistors per bit of SRAM (6T), cache is also expensive (in terms of die size, and therefore dollar cost). Past a certain point, it makes more sense to spend the chip’s power budget and transistor count on more execution units, better branch prediction, or additional cores. At the top of the story you can see an image of the Pentium M (Centrino/Dothan) chip; the entire left side of the die is dedicated to a massive L2 cache. How cache design impacts performance The performance impact of adding a CPU cache is directly related to its efficiency or hit rate; repeated cache misses can have a catastrophic impact on CPU performance. The following example is vastly simplified but should serve to illustrate the point. Imagine that a CPU has to load data from the L1 cache 100 times in a row. The L1 cache has a 1ns access latency and a 100% hit rate. It therefore takes our CPU 100 nanoseconds to perform this operation. Haswell-E die shot (click to zoom in). The repetitive structures in the middle of the chip are 20MB of shared L3 cache. Now, assume the cache has a 99 percent hit rate, but the data the CPU actually needs for its 100th access is sitting in L2, with a 10-cycle (10ns) access latency. That means it takes the CPU 99 nanoseconds to perform the first 99 reads and 10 nanoseconds to perform the 100th. A 1 percent reduction in hit rate has just slowed the CPU down by 10 percent. In the real world, an L1 cache typically has a hit rate between 95 and 97 percent, but the performance impact of those two values in our simple example isn’t 2 percent — it’s 14 percent. Keep in mind, we’re assuming the missed data is always sitting in the L2 cache. If the data has been evicted from the cache and is sitting in main memory, with an access latency of 80-120ns, the performance difference between a 95 and 97 percent hit rate could nearly double the total time needed to execute the code. Back when AMD’s Bulldozer family was compared with Intel’s processors, the topic of cache design and performance impact came up a great deal. It’s not clear how much of Bulldozer’s lackluster performance could be blamed on its relatively slow cache subsystem — in addition to having relatively high latencies, the Bulldozer family also suffered from a high amount of cache contention. Each Bulldozer/Piledriver/Steamroller module shared its L1 instruction cache, as shown below: A cache is contended when two different threads are writing and overwriting data in the same memory space. It hurts performance of both threads — each core is forced to spend time writing its own preferred data into the L1, only for the other core promptly overwrite that information. Steamroller still gets whacked by this problem, even though AMD increased the L1 code cache to 96KB and made it three-way associative instead of two. This graph shows how the hit rate of the Opteron 6276 (an original Bulldozer processor) dropped off when both cores were active, in at least some tests. Clearly, however, cache contention isn’t the only problem — the 6276 historically struggled to outperform the 6174 even when both processors had equal hit rates. Caching out Cache structure and design are still being fine-tuned as researchers look for ways to squeeze higher performance out of smaller caches. There’s an old rule of thumb that we add roughly one level of cache every 10 years, and it appears to be holding true into the modern era — Intel’s Skylake chips offer certain SKUs with an enormous L4, thereby continuing the trend. It’s an open question at this point whether AMD will ever go down this path. The company’s emphasis on HSA and shared execution resources appears to be taking it along a different route, and AMD chips don’t currently command the kind of premiums that would justify the expense. Regardless, cache design, power consumption, and performance will be critical to the performance of future processors, and substantive improvements to current designs could boost the status of whichever company can implement them.

The company’s emphasis on HSA and shared execution resources appears to be taking it along a different route, and AMD chips don’t currently command the kind of premiums that would justify the expense. I guess AMD will use some kind of stacked memory (HBM) to implement an L4 cache it wouldn’t be used to minimise latency but it will be used to maximise bandwidth for the GPU. more cache means less GPU on an APU so the balance will have to be reset onto these new designs. i think cache will get smaller use less levels when we start using HMC and other faster memory types. look at most of consumer chips they do not have an L3 cache because it doesn’t really offer more performance for the standard computer workload.while it helps on the server variant. please note that the L4 cache increases the latency for larger files compared to the L3 cache variant this might give a negative performance impact on some workloads. Dozerman Well first, AMD needs to get an L3 in their currently shipping processors. massau actually they don’t it helps for there CPU workload but it increases cost or it will replace GPU units. L3 is good for a server workload but it isn’t great when you look at consumer low midrange space. hence the new balance in modern APU processors. piledriver almost 1/3 is L3: http://images.bit-tech.net/content_images/2012/11/amd-fx-8350-review/piledriver-3b.jpg APU kaveri: orange part is the GPU ~47% http://cdn2.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AMD-Kaveri-Die-Shot1.jpg Hasswell the cache is rather big but intel has better cache densities and a smaller node. http://cdn4.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Intel-Haswell-Core-635×395.jpg the broadwell L4 cache looks like it is on package it can be compared to the ram stacked in the future. Dozerman Apologies. I had just skimmed through your comment and thought you were referring to some kind of L4, not shrinking caches with new memory types. That makes more sense. Joel Hruska Massau, I doubt that HBM will do anything to change the use of cache, though it’s certainly possible that AMD will choose to use HBM instead of an L4. Look at the adoption of on-die memory controllers. When AMD implemented an IMC for Opteron / Athlon 64, it slashed memory latency and gave the chip’s performance a huge upward kick — but AMD didn’t fundamentally alter its caching policies because of it. At most, it helped them use a little less L2 than they might have otherwise. HBM is great for die shrinking and bandwidth but its latency will still be much higher than conventional SRAM. But HBM might be a better fit for HSA applications than trying to integrate a giant L4, so in that sense yes — I agree that it could be a better road for AMD. massau may i turn the question around , what if the industry did not integrate the memory controller wouldn’t the caches be much larger and deeper than today? Maybe the HBM keep it possible to not use an L3 like they do today on there APU. it will just be a rebalancing of the amount and depth of the cache. Joel Hruska I mean, they would have to be, yes. It’s hard to imagine a future in which the controllers weren’t integrated, though. Intel proved that you could do quad-cores with good performance while relying on an old FSB (Core 2 Quad) but then Nehalem arrived and smoked C2Q performance pretty thoroughly. I do not recall if the old Northbridge memory controllers had their own caches. I think they could do some speculative prefetching, but I’m not sure they had full cache structures. massau i looked at the power 8 it is a modern design with a separate memory controller and it has its own cache. the cache of Intel’s processors looks far more complex than the ones of AMD at the time. but i cannot find any real lower level details of the intel’s north bridge at the time. http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Core_2/Intel-Core%202%20Duo%20E6700%20HH80557PH0674M%20%28BX80557E6700%29.html http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/K8/AMD-Athlon%2064%20X2%205000+%20-%20ADA5000IAA5CS%20%28ADA5000CSBOX%29.html massau may i turn the question around , what if the industry did not integrate the memory controller wouldn’t the caches be much larger and deeper than today? Maybe the HBM keep it possible to not use an L3 like they do today on there APU. it will just be a rebalancing of the amount and depth of the cache. Dozerman Why couldn’t a company use a very large L3 coupled with a very fast L2 and even faster L1 instead of having to scale out to a fourth level? Joel Hruska Well, they could — but remember, the point is cost savings. The EDRAM design that Intel uses for Haswell is a 1T (one transistor part). That saves both die space and power consumption. Typical L3 uses 6 or 8 transistors. So to do an eight-transistor cache (128MB of cache like Crystal Well) you’d need to dedicate about 8.6 billion transistors to *just* the cache. Even if Intel used a 4T design you’re still talking about 4.2B transistors. Doing it EDRAM with a 1T design lets you get away with maybe a billion transistors. I’m not sure Intel has revealed anything more about exact transistor counts on Crystal Well. massau maybe an other reason for using a separate chip is to use a specialised fabrication process which is optimised for EDRAM or a larger node and thus lowers the power consumption , improve density or lower costs. Joel Hruska That’s also a good possibility. massau to bad non of the reviewers have higher technology like a electro microscope to look at the chip and decide which technology is used. massau an other reason is larger caches means slower caches every memory block (4kb for x86) requires an address thus your selecting logic becomes bigger and slower. otherwise you would just have one gigantic L1 cache. Matt Menezes I remember this being noted in school when people asked why L1 and L2 running at the same speed as the core performed differently. massau yea i learned this in school as the main reason but our teachers look a bit from the old age and miss the cutting edge stuff like power gating, clock gating etc to improve speed or performance. Matt Menezes It’s amazing how an authority on tech such as a prof can be so behind the curve. I always thought I was more tech literate than my profs merely because I actually kept up with the latest where they just rehashed the same, old fundamentals. Not to say I’m smarter, merely more up to date… massau the latest tech is based on the old tech but some parts need to be updated. we even saw circular registers but i do not see any cores using it anymore. these small things makes me suspicious. but at least i will have the official piece of paper in one year. for example higher clocks gives a higher power consumption it is true, but if you can finish your job faster and go to deep sleep then you could use less energy than the slower core. Antoine de Champlain Thank you so much for clearing this up for me! I never fully understood how cache worked and the impact of cache in a CPU but thanks to your awesome explaination know I understand it! Thanks Joel! jburt56 VRAM will change this. Mark Nelson The description of direct-mapped and n-way associative caches is wrong. In a direct-mapped cache a block of memory can only be stored in one particular cache block. In an n-way associative cache, a block of memory can only be stored in one of n cache blocks. Jonathan Abbey Absolutely. This: “A 2-way associative cache (Piledriver’s L1 is 2-way) means that each cache block can map to one of two memory locations. An 8-way associative cache means that each block of cache can contain information from eight different memory blocks.” Should instead be: “A 2-way associative cache (Piledriver’s L1 is 2-way) means that each memory location can be mapped to one of two cache blocks. An 8-way associative cache means that each location in memory could be cached in any one of eight cache blocks.” It’s worth noting as well that high set associativity makes it slower to put new memory locations into the cache as well as to retrieve it.. You can’t write to an associative cache line without making sure that the memory location isn’t already present in one of the n blocks. Joel Hruska You’re right. That was a flip-flop on my part. Fixing it. Jonathan Abbey You rock. Kudos++. Joel Hruska Just dropping a note to say this has been corrected. bmwman91 Interesting article. It clears up a lot of questions I had in the back of my mind, like “if L1 is so critical to performance why has it remained relatively small?” The “closest” I have gotten to the silicon is writing assembly code for PIC and DSP controllers. The Lx caches on modern processors sound a lot like the working-registers on the microcontrollers that I have used…you can execute operations directly on the data stored in them, rather than having to go fetch data from RAM (or program memory) and put it into the working-reg’s in order to manipulate them. Curious Hi, First of all, thank you for this very informative article. It cleared up a lot of things I did not know. I am not a electronics engineer and hence do not have any idea about it. But I am an engineer and do understand a bit of the tech stuff posted on here and am curious to understand/know more. I might sound a bit naive or a bit “noobish” to ask this, but, can someone please explain to me how this-> http://goo.gl/Za35BD and http://goo.gl/NTwlfb translates into this ->http://goo.gl/xJK6Yr If it cannot be explained so easily, can someone please direct me to somewhere where I can get a better understanding of it. http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Hello! How do you mean ‘translates’? Underneath that square in the middle of the package there is a die. The reason the package itself is so much larger is to accommodate all of the pins — there will be wires that connect from the die to the pins. The picture here might help fill in the gaps: http://www.extremetech.com/computing/105107-4004-to-sandy-bridge-40-years-of-intel-cpus/6 Curious Thank you for the reply. I said ‘translates’ since I did not know which part of the chip had that die or if the whole chip had the die underneath or somewhere. The link you gave to that image cleared that issue. nty the first picture is the die, the second is the electrical contact points, the third is the site through a microscope, possibly a special one such as scanning. Asdf Ghjk More articles like this! Enjoyed this one even though I took a course on computer architecture last year. NoldorElf Joel, great article. I wonder how things are going to go now that Moore’s Law has peaked. L1 – very small per core; very fast L2 – small per core; fast L3 – shared amongst all cores; larger, but slow L4 – eDRAM; shared amongst the entire SOC; only somewhat faster than RAM I don’t see there being an L5 cache any time soon. It would be not much faster than the RAM itself. My guess for the future is that: 1. L3 will probably get bigger 2. L4 will also become truly huge 3. HBM may make some changes in L4 If we are stuck with existing processes, 28nm being the cheapest for the foreseeable future in cost per transistor (perhaps it’s 22nm for Intel?), then I could see very large dies being developed to try to squeeze the every last drop of performance. At that point, performance per mm^2 takes a second seat to absolute performance or performance per watt. We might see larger, faster L3s on big dies. Because 22 and 28nm ought to continue to mature allowing for either higher yields of existing sized chips or perhaps larger chips at comparable yields. Hmm … could a reticle sized CPU be made (>700mm^2)? Can L1 and L2 be made faster? How many transistors do they currently use? massau the L 4 is on a different chip onto the package so the L4 in the future will be TSV memory stacked directly onto the die so L4 becomes HBM. mores law will probably evolve to TSV and later on to real 3D vertical transistors. so first we have 1 die than 2 etc all stacked but larger dies is not an option because it decreases yields while increasing costs. maybe the 450mm wafers could drop the cost of existing nodes but it is still in its infancy. a gpu is easier to harvest the bad cores that’s the reason why they are larger. ps a 700mm^2 chip gives 76 dies per wafer @300mm. Joel Hruska Every cache save L1 began life as an off-die package. If you look back, the first consumer L2 caches were on the motherboard. L3 caches began life as on-motherboard (hence the term “Backside cache” and “Backside bus” to refer to the interface). Now that doesn’t mean TSV and HBM interfaces couldn’t replace and function as L4, but the fact that first-generation L4 is integrated off-die doesn’t say anything about the likelihood of that outcome. massau its seems like i’m not old enough to know the history of the cache levels. but thanks for telling me :) . Rich Actually, L1 did too, at least for x86. Intel had a 82385 memory controller, which could cache 32K of memory for the 386. That was the L1 cache, and could be read in two clock cycles although external to the processor(ironic that’s twice was fast as the miserably slow L1 cache in Haswell and Steamroller, despite being internal). Other companies came up with other controllers for the 386, some did direct mapping. Others did none, and simply used interleaving or page mode memory to lower the average wait states. The difference was dramatic. I used a PS/2 Model 80, with a 20 MHz 386 with Page Mode Memory, and then got a Model 80 with 64K cache, and the difference was very noticeable, far more than one would expect from a 25% clock speed increase. The 486 introduced the internal L1 cache, and also the L2 cache. The internal was initially only 8K, and shared Data/Instruction but could be read in one clock cycle. Many machines only came with it (the processor costed 1K, and many considered it a bargain because you didn’t need the FPU, or the cache controller/memory), but many companies first started adding SRAM on the motherboard, giving it a L2 cache. I had a PS/2 Model 90, and the L2 cache could be plugged into the processor daughterboard. I didn’t notice the difference to near the extent I did with the SRAM cache on the Model 80. When Intel went with the DX4(typically running at 100/33), they increased the L1 cache to 16K, and made it write-back. This helped quite a bit, as these chips were clock tripled, and going through the slow memory bus was carrying a heavy penalty. AMD’s 133MHz 486 made this even more important. Joel Hruska Haswell and Steamroller have 1ns, 4-cycle L1 caches. Since one of the points of an OOOe engine is to hide latency, the difference between a four-cycle and three-cycle cache is minimal (according to AMD, building a 3-cycle L1 improved performance by only about 3%). Latency hits only matter when they leave the processor with nothing to do. If the core can work on something else, it’s not a problem. This is also why I prefer to measure my latencies in nanoseconds, not clock cycles. Two clock cycles at 25MHz is hundreds of clock cycles at 4.4GHz. Good point on the 386, though. I hadn’t realized that there were chips that used an external L1; I thought the 486 was the first widespread chip with an L1 cache. Rich Intel also said 3%, and said they chose 4 clocks not because they had to, but because it would save energy over something timed more aggressively. I remember them saying it the type of transistors needed were more power hungry. I never trust blanket numbers though, because they always reflect certain scenarios, and if yours doesn’t fall into that, well, the number might be considerably different. Even so, 3% is still something. If you consider how people get upset their Pentium goes to 4.6, while someone else’s reaches 4.8, you see it is something. I wonder how much more power Intel would have needed to do 3. I suspect AMD, being designed for high clock speeds, would not have been able to do so with the same size and associativity. I’m still a bit amazed Willamette and Northwood had two clock latency, although the L1 was tiny. Still, they had some serious clock speeds for their processes. Itanium with 1 clock was pretty amazing too. Jaguar is still three clocks. Processors have always tried to hide latency, that’s nothing new. Even the 8086/88 had a pre-fetcher than worked independently. Joel Hruska Rich, Sure, on blanket numbers, but I think the larger point is that you can design a chip that’s better at hiding latency you can also get away with designing different cores. That’s one reason HT was invented in the first place — but the P4’s design fundamentally depended on that low latency L1 cache because it lacked some of the capabilities that Haswell has for keeping execution units filled. It’s true that the P4’s two-cycle L1 latency was better than Haswell’s, even accounting for the difference in clock speed — but I suspect Intel would answer that the other improvements and adjustments it has made to core design allowed it to *use* a slower L1 design without a catastrophic impact on performance. Intel’s new philosophy, put in place over the last few cycles, is that every core change has to pay for itself double. In the old days, the company pursued a 1:1 to policy — a 1% performance improvement couldn’t draw more than 1% power. Now, Intel has shifted to something along the lines of 2:1 — a change must improve performance by 2% in order to draw 1% more power. Or at least, that’s the high-minded design goal. szatkus Yes. Keyword: memristors Bannerdog ” A direct-mapped cache is a cache where each cache block can contain one and only one block of main memory.” That is INCORRECT. With a direct-mapped cache, a block of main memory is associated with exactly one cache block. In other words, with direct-mapping, if a particular block of main memory is cached, the cache block to be used it determined solely by the memory address (there is only one possible cache block that may be utilized to cache that particular block of main memory). You have your mapping transposed. Joseph Taylor Just gonna say you’ve been posting some good content lately Joel Bert Tweetering I really liked this article although I’m just beginning to scratch the surface for learning this complex topic. Re the part about cache contention, I’m thinking this may be more because of the shared L2 cache than the shared L1 instruction cache, where I wouldn’t expect much if any writing. The L1 data cache, where you expect plenty of writing, is not shared. “…the Bulldozer family also suffers from a high amount of cache contention. Each Bulldozer/Piledriver/Steamroller module shares its L1 instruction cache, as shown below… A cache is contended when two different threads are writing and overwriting data in the same memory space. It hurts performance of both threads — each core is forced to spend time writing its own preferred data into the L1, only for the other core promptly overwrite that information.” Maybe the L2 cache contention issue is an area that got improved greatly from Piledriver to Steamroller to Excavator. The latter had the size of its cache shrunk by 1/2, although the cache system as a whole is said to perform much better. Roger Smith Hi Bert This may give you a more simple explanation of caching and benefits and frustrations it causes http://www.forgeonline.co.nz/caching-explained-can-frustrating-helpful-time/ Felix Gill This reminds me of – actually i not so fondly remember goin over all this in computer architecture class in undergrad. Had to run the math and tell how long CPU instructions took from fetch to execute based on different cache assumptions. Felix Gill could do a series of these type articles RISC vs CISC reverse engineering, decompilers, and you J̶a̶v̶a̶ Python virtual Machine Hunh!, What is it good for… Instruction sets and why they matter My command line, your command line: the return to dumb terminal in the workplace The risks of using open source code in the workplace.. warning EULAS ahead Joseph Taylor Pretty sceptical that hit rate doesn’t increase with size in L1 cache, how is that even logically possible? Joel Hruska Joseph, If you’re thinking about a cache as a 1:1 system in which one main memory location can only be mapped to one L1 cache location, you’d be absolutely right. The only way to improve the hit rate would be to increase the cache size. But the situation is more complex than that. The first thing to know is that all hit rates depend on instruction mix. The goal when performing these kinds of evaluations is to try to capture a variety of instruction mixes and model a best-fit scenario. You can write code that will exhibit better or worse hit rates. So the graph above is an example of hit rates in one particular type of code, not a total example for every type of code. There are multiple factors that determine the miss rate on a cache. The set-associativity is a significant factor, as is the cache block size (how much data is fetched from cache at one time) and the total size of the cache. Smaller blocks mean that you take less advantage of spacial locality, large blocks mean that you don’t have as many blocks within the cache in which data can be stored. The goal of the L1 cache is to have the data the CPU is looking for 95-99% of the time. Many CPUs use architectures that push old data into the L2 or L3, so that data *not* found in the L1 can be found in one of the lower cache levels. The longer answer to your question is that yes, there *are* ways to continue to push the hit rate of the L1 higher, including increased cache sizes — but if you can get 95% of the way there with a 64K L1 and you need a 1MB L1 to finish off the last 5%, it makes a lot more sense to use the 64KB option and then back it up with L2 caches. Ninja Squirrel I have a question. Why cache memory on CPUs use so much space to store such small 8MB, but you can find one small memory chip on a DRAM module or graphic card PCB can be stored 512MB? I mean like this http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/t-EAAMXQfvlSnn8V/s-l1600.jpg http://fudzilla.com/images/stories/2015/Reviews/Graphics/Nvidia/Maxwell/GTX_980_Ti/evga_gtx_980_ti_sc_pcb4.jpg Ext3h SRAM cache used for on-chip cache consists of up to 6 transistors per bit (there are different designs), plus passive electric components, plus additional logic for providing associativity. In comparison, a DRAM cell only consist of a capacitor and a single transistor per cell – all other components are shared across whole blocks of DRAM cells. DRAM comes at a cost over SRAM in return, as the only way of “reading” from a DRAM cell, is to release the charge, translate the (varying) voltage levels into binary, and finally recharge the capacitor again. You can’t even read the same address twice in a row, if you tried, you would have to wait for the recharge to complete. In addition, you always have to read or write a full row of cells in DRAM. Reading from and writing to SRAM is trivial, as the output line of an SRAM cell is constantly active and can be accessed at will without side effects. Writing to an SRAM cell is also just a matter of applying a voltage to the SET or UNSET inputs. Besides the access times and size, DRAM and SRAM also differ in power consumption. A DRAM cell does not require power to keep information stored (slow self-discharge from leak-currents aside), while an SRAM cell actually stores the information by keeping an bi-stable circuit constantly powered. FSRed94 “A DRAM cell does not require power to keep information stored” Umm, yes it does. Unless I’m not thinking right today. Ext3h It’s suffering from a constant discharge from leak currents, but the information is stored inside the charge – not by maintaining a constant flow of current or keeping an external voltage level applied. So no, keeping(!) the information stored does not require power in an ideal system (assuming proper insulation). In a real world systems, leak currencies, possibly even amplified by a row hammer attack or something alike, obviously do require cyclic refreshes, but that’s just a result of having made a trade off between density and ideal insulation. wownwow DRAM is volatile memory, not NVM. Wussupi83 Does anyone else remember the Pentium M? Basically analogous IMO to a big battle that turned the tide of the war. It showed Intel the light they used to find their way out of the Pentium 4 furnace that was unfortunately-for-us-all being fueled by illegal business practices against AMD’s superior Athlon 64. Joel Hruska The Pentium M was the warning shot that AMD should’ve heeded, and different. It was obvious by the winter of 2004 that Intel had a potent competitor on its hands — and if AMD had been paying attention to the problem, they could’ve had a response ready by the middle of 2006. FSRed94 One of many mistakes made by AMD. That company seemed to suffer from quite a bit of bad management over the years. I would like to think K7 was the warning shot Intel should’ve noticed, with K8 being probably the last major evolution of CPU’s (x86-64, integrated memory controller, hypertransport instead of FSB). Joel Hruska “I would like to think K7 was the warning shot Intel should’ve noticed.” Intel *did* notice. That’s why they started putting the squeeze on vendors not to allocate shelf space to AMD. That’s why AMD had so little luck winning mobile SKUs. When Intel decided to kill the Pentium 4 altogether and switch to the Pentium M, it was because they knew AMD’s K8 was going to clean their clock for the next 12-18 months. They used their marketing muscle to do what their CPU couldn’t, and they locked AMD out of critical market share in the process. With that said, however, AMD really did take its eye on the ball. I remember testing Dothan in a DFI desktop board. The chip was tiny and mounted a custom heatsink with a 40mm fan. Overclocking options were limited. And yes, on the whole, the Athlon 64 family was still much faster than the little Pentium M. Dothan wasn’t very good at multimedia encoding, for example. The thing was, you could overclock that Pentium M up to around 2GHz — and once you did, there were benchmarks where it started matching the Athlon 64 processors at the same speed, while drawing a fraction of the heat. I told my contacts at AMD that when Intel finished refining this design, it was going to cause them a serious headache if they didn’t have something better in the pipeline. 18 months later, Core 2 Duo debuted, and while AMD kept up reasonably well for awhile (Phenom II was C2D competitive), they never regained the lead again. FSRed94 Marketing muscle, and some rather shady business practices as you are very well aware. I’m not sure what was going on at AMD. I’ve read they were working on some other design but canned it and improved on K8 to make K10. Or they were too busy cashing in on K8 to realize what Intel was doing with the Pentium M. I also happen to think they were busy preparing to purchase ATI and perhaps didn’t have the resources they needed. Maybe they figured K8/K10 would be enough until they had their first “fusion” product after acquiring ATI. Who knows for sure what really happened, but they sure dropped the ball. I am very interested in seeing what becomes of Zen, as it may be the last exciting thing to happen in high end x86 for awhile. I’m editing this as I just had another thought about the Pentium M. It was certainly excellent at integer code, but as I recall it was fairly modest at floating point math. AMD could have figured integer would be close enough but that they would still have a much better FPU. That turned out not to be the case at all. Joel Hruska I can tell you what I was told happened and what I’ve pieced together. Once Hammer started rolling out, AMD started hitting its stride like never before. At first, Intel fans confidently predicted that Prescott would counter AMD by hitting insane new clock speeds. After all, the P4 was still beating the Athlon 64 in many professional workloads thanks to Hyper-Threading. HT also gave it an edge in desktop “smoothness” and multi-tasking. Then Prescott actually dropped. It was a disaster. It melted plastic motherboard stands. It blew out small form factor power supplies that were supposedly Prescott-ready. I could walk by my testbeds and tell if a system was running Prescott or Northwood just by touching the power supply — that’s how large the difference was. Meanwhile, AMD is launching Socket 939 and ramping up the Athlon 64. By mid-2005, the dual-core Athlon 64 4800+ has arrived on the scene and completely eaten Intel’s lunch. Intel is staggering on the ropes, AMD is sweeping the workstation workloads that were Intel’s last strength. And then AMD gets distracted by ATI, like you said. They weren’t *wrong* to see combined graphics and CPU as the future of the company, but they end up paying 2x what they should’ve for ATI and it takes years to integrate the companies. They probably should’ve sucked it up, bought Nvidia, and let Jen-Hsun be CEO. They do a 65nm die shrink on Athlon 64, but it doesn’t buy them as much clock speed as they would need to catch up to Core 2 Duo. This is where things start to go south. If Phenom had been Phenom II, AMD would’ve had a serious competitive position established against Intel in 2007 and into 2008. But by then, they were dealing with the ATI acquisition and numerous other market challenges. FSRed94 Why did AMD end up paying so much for ATI? Or at least the best guesses we have as to why they overpaid. Has there ever been any accurate speculation as to what they would have paid for NVIDIA? NVIDIA probably would have made more sense anyway, as they had already developed several successful chipsets for K7/K8 (well, except maybe nforce 3). A rock solid, in house chipset may have helped in the corporate market. I have read AMD’s chipsets improved quite a bit as a result of acquiring ATI. Llano came too late. I almost said Bobcat as well but that was very competitive even if late. I think it’s very possible they didn’t have the money they needed for R&D because of overpaying for ATI and Conroe eating into their sales. GloFo didn’t help. I think it’s very likely Apple would have went with Llano if they could have produced enough. If Zen is good enough, and if an APU variant can be produced in sufficient quantities soon enough (2017), I could see Apple taking another serious look at them. Or at least “looking” at them to get a better deal from Intel. I think that would be AMD’s best shot at making some money again. That’s a lot of “ifs” though, and I’ll believe it when I see it. http://soylents-brain-droppings.blogspot.com/ Soylent The pentium M itself was just a tweaked pentium 3, whose lineage in turn goes all the way back to the P6 core (pentium pro). The 1.4 GHz tualatin core pentium 3’s would spank 1.8 GHz pentium 4’s at most things people cared about (basically anything not heavily using SSE2). wownwow Thanks for the article. It will be nice to have a similar table for Intel’s caches instead of just showing the AMD’s inferior caches. About AMD’s L1 caches, SHARED, THREE-way, and 3-4 clock LATENCY, were they designed by engineers with brains that: On the left side, there is nothing right, and on the right side, there is nothing left? Joel Hruska Intel hasn’t changed its cache structure since Nehalem, as far as I know. All Core processors since the Core 2 Duo use the following system: 64KB L1 cache per core (32KB instruction / 32KB data, 8-way associative) 256KB L2 cache per core (8-way associative) And then a varying amount of L3 cache, 16-way associative if I recall. The 3-4 cycle latency on L1 is not AMD’s problem. In fact, that’s firmly in-line with what Intel achieves on L1 latency. AMD’s L2 cache latencies are substantially higher than Intel’s, as is the L3 latency on Piledriver CPUs. This is a much larger problem. Finally, I suggest you use nanoseconds to measure cache latency, not clock cycles. An L1 cache with a 3-cycle latency on a CPU clocked at 4GHz is faster than an L1 cache with a 3-cycle latency clocked at 3GHz. Nanoseconds are an absolute measure of time, clock cycles are relative. wownwow Joel, thanks again for the information. Per test results, at least 4-way is needed be competitive, will Zen have at least 4-way, or any good link for the details of Zen if you have it handy? Joel Hruska The current rumor is that the L1 is 64KB split between 32KB instruction and 32KB data and eight-way associative. The cache sizes have been at least backed up by software patches that reference them, the associativity is not backed up, but is a reasonable “best guess.” If Carrizo were inserted into the table above, it would look somewhat different. The L1 data cache increased to 32KB, from 16KB, and is eight-way associative, up from four-way. AMD’s L2 and L3 caches have historically been 16-way associative. The problem with the BD line of chips is that the L2 latency wasn’t very good (this was somewhat fixed in Piledriver, but never completely addressed). Zach Acox Were this a post about specific SKUs and clock speeds, nanoseconds would be the appropriate way to describe relative speed. Although this post calls out several different CPU SKUs, it aptly defines latency in terms of clock cycles. Example: A 5 GHz CPU has a clock cycle time of 200 picoseconds, while a 2.5 GHz CPU cycle time is 400 picoseconds, yet if the 5 GHz CPU has 10-cycle latency and the 2.5 GHz CPU has 5-cycle latency, both will access the cache in the name number of nanoseconds. Joel Hruska Zach, Sure, I agree that nanoseconds are most important when comparing between CPUs, but wow&wow explicitly identified a 3-4 clock latency as AMD’s problem as compared to Intel’s superior caches. Because the vast majority of the work I do when discussing these issues *is* comparative, I tend to prefer nanoseconds over cycles. For my purposes, nanoseconds tends to be more accurate. The big picture, of course, is that both AMD and Intel have said that reducing L1 latency from 4-cycles to 3-cycles doesn’t get them very much performance. FSRed94 I read somewhere, Anandtech I think, that Intel purposely moved from a 3 cycle to 4 cycle L1 as it allowed for a higher clock speed, which was of much more benefit than one cycle. FSRed94 About the L1, is it being write through a problem? Joel Hruska It was definitely a theoretical issue, in that it could slow down performance in certain cases. I am not certain if it was a real-world cause of BD’s low performance. tektel This article was already published about a year/year and a half ago. Joel Hruska That’s correct. We occasionally resurface stories like this after updating them if necessary. While the vast majority of what we publish is new content, stories like this one remain relevant even after several years. wownwow Thanks for resurfacing the useful information and updating it if needed. It still benefits people who didn’t read it before, like myself. Tom You could find out how greatly the cache affected performance pretty easily back in the day. Lots of computers let you disable the cache in the BIOS. It absolutely CRIPPLED performance. We’re talking Windows 95/98 going from booting in a minute or two to taking the better part of an hour. An astounding difference for what amounted to a couple hundred kilobytes of memory (if that) being switched on or off. FSRed94 “In the real world, an L1 cache typically has a hit rate between 95% and 97%….”. I’ve always wanted a little more elaboration on this. Are we talking instruction, data, or both? Instruction is easy enough to believe. Since we are talking about the relative speed of cache vs DRAM here though, it seems we must be talking about data. L1 is very fast and low latency. It is also fairly small. I’m sure it can hold a good amount of what is needed (for loops come to mind). Seeing how far away main memory is though, the CPU must have a very good idea of what it will need next so it can load it into cache before it needs it. Is this where data prefetch comes into play? Joel Hruska Prefetch and branch prediction both come into play here, but I am honestly not sure how to characterize the precise difference between what information is stored in the L1D cache vs. what is stored in the L2 cache — meaning I am not certain if this is strictly a difference in *likelihood* of needing data or if the system preferentially puts different kinds of data in different locations. I’m fairly certain it’s the former. One thing I do know is that the difference between 95% and 97% is huge because of the sheer number of cycles that a CPU performs per second. Those last few % points can dominate your overall performance because the penalty if you go out to main memory is just so huge compared to L2. Bert Tweetering Do SMT processors carry two sets of L1 instruction and data caches per physical core? (assuming dual thread like in the intel i-cores with HT) yumri Intel tried L4? i guess 128MB is to little maybe if they had a better GPU and only used it for the GPU side it would have done better. I still see many games that only need 32MB or 128MB if graphics RAM but all of them are indie games. Unless Intel wants to compete with AMD and nVidia for low end gaming they won’t try L4 again. Joel Hruska Intel continues to use L4. That’s what Crystal Well is — an L4 cache running at 1600MHz. kritikl HARD WARE REQUIREMENT QUESTION: What wouuld be the least number of cores required on a gaming pc to play very fast games?

(AMD) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks The 5 Most Vulnerable Stocks in the Market Right Now Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Isn’t Worth the Headache View All Posts Wednesday’s session ended up being the market’s worst performance for stocks since September. Chatter about a federal government scandal was cited as the reason, though the market has been ripe for a pullback anyway. This is also around the time of year when the “Sell in May” effect truly takes hold. The nature of the reason, however, is irrelevant. The S&P 500’s close of 2,357.03 was 1.82% less that Tuesday’s close, dragging the index below some key technical support levels. But, that was nothing compared to the pain American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders suffered on Wednesday. Here’s the deal. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) On Tuesday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices was one of the market’s hottest stocks, rallying 11% on rumors that it had inked a key deal with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and would be confirming it during its meeting with analysts after Tuesday’s close. As it turns out, the rumor was nothing more than a rumor — Advanced Micro Devices hadn’t signed a deal with Intel (at least not one that it could divulge yet), sending AMD to a loss of 12.1% on Wednesday as disappointed investors shed their shares. The idea was first floated by tech-news website Fudzilla, with contributor Fuad Abazovic claiming, “We can now confirm the rumours that Intel has given up on Nvidia because it has written a cheque to license AMD’s graphics.” Although the licensing deal between Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ended in March and AMD is working with Intel on some other projects, AMD hasn’t been named as a successor to Nvidia yet. Bank of America Corp (BAC) All stocks were hit hard today, but banks took on more than their fair share of water. The SPDR KBW Bank ETF (NYSEARCA:KBE) fell to the tune of 4% on Monday. Leading the charge lower, however, was Bank of America. BAC shares logged a loss of 6% for the session. The prod for the pullback was turmoil in Washington D.C. While investors are no stranger to controversy from the White House, the latest round of it was particularly alarming in that it implicates Trump in what could possibly amount to an obstruction of justice charge. Although most investors don’t see the matter being taken to that extreme, most investors do think the matter could be so distracting to President Trump that he’ll be unable to implement his deregulation and tax-cut agenda anytime soon. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) Finally, American Eagle Outfitters reminded the market today that retailing is presently a miserable business to be in. In its first fiscal quarter of 2017, American Eagle earned an operating profit of 16 cents per share on sales of $761.8 million. The revenue tally topped estimates of $743.6 million, though the profit reading misses estimates by a penny per share. The bulk of the 14.7% tumble AEO took today, however, likely stemmed from the retailer’s disappointing second-quarter outlook. American Eagle Outfitters is looking for a profit of between 15 and 17 cents per share for the quarter currently underway, versus analyst estimates for income of 23 cents per share of AEO. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Announces 2018 Server Chip Plans Chipzilla confirms this Fool's hypothesis. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 17, 2017 at 5:15PM This summer, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to launch its next-generation server processor family, code-named Skylake-SP (for "Scalable Performance"). These chips promise to deliver substantially improved performance, power efficiency, and platform features compared to the current Broadwell-EP/EX products that Intel currently has in the marketplace. Those improvements are expected to be due to a combination of a brand-new processor architecture (changes to the CPU cores and the technologies that surround those cores) as well as a migration from the company's first-generation 14-nanometer manufacturing technology to its more efficient second-generation 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, called 14-nanometer+. Image source: Intel. What was unclear until a recent Intel announcement is what the company planned to launch for the server market in 2018. Earlier leaks indicated that Intel had planned to follow up Skylake-SP (then referred to as Skylake-EP) with Cannon Lake-EP, built on the company's 10-nanometer technology. However, considering that Intel is likely facing substantial manufacturing yield challenges with its 10-nanometer technology, large, complex server processors built using the technology in 2018 don't appear to be likely. I had previously speculated that Intel would take its Skylake-SP chips and reimplement them in the company's 14-nanometer++ technology. A recent announcement from the company appears to confirm that this is, in fact, what the company plans to do (credit goes to user witeken on social media for spotting it). Improved efficiency, support for 3D XPoint memory Intel says that the new chips (referred to as a "refresh") go by the code-name of Cascade Lake and will launch next year. Intel did not explicitly say that these chips would be manufactured using its 14-nanometer++ technology, but considering that the company's playbook in the personal computer market has recently consisted of delivering performance improvements via manufacturing technology enhancements, it's clear that the company will apply this strategy to its server processors, too. The move to 14-nanometer++ should allow Intel to deliver higher-performing chips at roughly the same power consumption levels as what it will deliver with its upcoming Skylake-SP chips. Additionally, Intel says that the Cascade Lake chips will include support for the company's 3D XPoint memory modules. Support for 3D XPoint memory modules was originally planned for Skylake-SP, but delays in the technology have led the company to push support for the technology out to a refreshed processor/platform. Implications for consumer market Intel is expected to launch its next-generation high-end desktop platform for PC enthusiasts/prosumers later this month, based on the same technology that underpins the company's upcoming Skylake-SP products for servers. Since Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be refreshing the Skylake-SP lineup in 2018, this almost certainly means that Intel will be refreshing its high-end desktop product line next year, too. One of the problems that Intel has faced with its high-end desktop lineup is that the company doesn't update them regularly, which leads them to become stale after a while. If Intel can commit to annual processor refreshes in the server market, then Intel should also be able to refresh its high-end desktop processors as well. The high-end desktop processors tend to carry much higher average selling prices than the mainstream desktop parts that Intel sells, and those chips are sold to customers that are much more enthusiastic than the typical PC-buying population, often buying systems/chips out of want rather than simply out of need. The more exciting Intel can keep its server and high-end desktop product lines, the better it should be for both its large and highly lucrative data center business, as well as for one of the better parts of its personal computer business.

Owens Published: May 17, 2017 4:19 p.m. ET Share Chip maker aims to compete in servers and high-end PCs, but success is not guaranteed Jeremy Owens/MarketWatch AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su explains how premium products will help the chip maker's finances grow Tuesday at the company's Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is going for broke with its new strategy. If the plan doesn’t play out well, it may be investors who go broke instead. AMD AMD, -12.16% which has long struggled in the shadow of Intel Corp. INTC, -2.18% outlined its long-term strategy at a Financial Analysts Day event Tuesday afternoon, including breaking back into the market for servers and high-end personal computers. Chief Executive Lisa Su and AMD’s other top executives promised a return to profitability, with revenue increasing by double-digit percentages on an annual basis. Now, they just have to prove it. In the executives’ estimation, AMD is playing with house money, as the company currently has no market share in the data center and little to speak of in high-end PCs, after backing out of those markets years ago. The company showed off its new CPU offering for servers, unveiling the name Epyc for the chips that will rival Intel, as well as a graphics-processing unit for servers called Vega Frontier Edition that will seek to challenge Nvidia Corp.’s NVDA, -6.64%  offerings. “We have very little to lose and a tremendous amount to offer,” Su said in a Q&A session, and data-center head Forrest Norrod concurred, stating “We have nothing to lose.” AMD investors do have something to lose, however, as much of AMD’s planned gains are already baked into its stock price. AMD shares have more than tripled in value in the past year, as the chip maker’s launch of the Ryzen platform for PCs and excitement for the return to the server market have lured a new generation of investors. Tellingly, analysts who attended the event were not upgrading the stock or changing price targets en masse Wednesday morning, as many have lived through the many cycles of optimism and disappointment for AMD. Instead, most wrote that they must see the company execute its plan before believing its valuation will continue to increase. “Though we think AMD’s product lineup is improved compared to a few years ago, strong execution will be key amidst a likely strong competitive response (especially from Intel),” wrote J.P. Morgan analysts, who maintained a neutral rating and $11.50 price target. AMD has long trailed Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, and is again challenging the bully on the block with its server chips. It is also challenging Nvidia’s booming data-center business with its GPU offering, though Nvidia has quite a head start. See also: Nvidia’s $3 billion chip sends stock to yet more records With Intel entrenched as the leader in CPUs for servers, and Nvidia’s fast rise in GPUs for the data-center market, AMD is seeking to position itself as the provider who can offer both components built to work together. While it may not help AMD defeat either rival, it could allow it to at least find a unique place in the market. “While AMD’s competitors clearly have established leadership positions throughout the data-center ecosystem, we believe that a second source will be welcomed,” wrote Ruben Roy of MKM Partners, who has a neutral rating and fair value estimate of $13 for the stock. “AMD’s differentiated approach to its server products, along with initial performance specifications, suggest that the company will finally be back in the discussion with top-tier customers.” AMD now laying out why it will win in machine intelligence - control of CPU AND GPU, with "some accelerators".$AMD pic.twitter.com/h7G7Hfk5h2— Jeremy C. Owens (@jowens510) May 16, 2017 But if AMD does get in the room with large server customers, it will likely face big pushback from Intel. “Any share gains by AMD will likely be met with aggressive pricing actions by Intel, which could severely limit AMD’s margin expansion hopes,” Macquarie Research analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote. Macquarie maintained an underperform rating and 12-month price target of $10. While the company must still show the ability to execute on its server effort, AMD’s Ryzen family for PCs is already rolling out. The company said PCs with Ryzen will be launched by the top five PC manufacturers by the end of next month, and showed off high-end Ryzen-based offerings like Threadripper that give it a larger potential for revenue. “The ongoing Ryzen product family rollout is expected to lead to a $9 billion [serviceable addressable market] expansion in the premium desktop market and a $10 billion SAM expansion in the premium mobile market, in addition to helping AMD achieve OEM wins and premium segmentation,” Pacific Crest Securities analysts wrote, while maintaining a sector weight rating and $12.75 price target. AMD had mostly eschewed the higher end of the market in recent years to take lower-end offerings in which Intel and Nvidia were not interested, hurting gross margins and potential for profitability. “We believe AMD Ryzen 7 and Threadripper systems could quickly regain meaningful market share (10%+) in price and margin tiers of the desktop market the company has been absent from in recent years,” wrote Canaccord Genuity analysts. Canaccord is one of AMD’s biggest bulls, and retained a buy rating and $17 price target on the stock. Canaccord was not put off by AMD’s target of 75 cents a share in adjusted earnings in 2020, despite modeling for $1 a share in non-GAAP earnings for that year. “Given the product portfolio discussed, we believe the EPS target remains conservative,” they wrote. There are issues beyond the product road map, as well. AMD shares plunged more than 11% in Wednesday trading despite mostly neutral reports from AMD’s investor day and a decline of about 1.5% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, -1.82% Those losses nearly matched large gains ahead of the presentation Tuesday, after a sketchy report that Intel and AMD had struck a licensing deal after Intel’s similar contract with Nvidia expired. “Heading into the investor event, mainstream media reports suggested AMD’s largest competitor, Intel, may license AMD’s graphics [intellectual property],” J.P. Morgan analysts noted. “However, during the prepared remarks and meetings post-event, we came away with a view that AMD would not likely license core IP to a competitor.” Canaccord was more bullish on the chances AMD will make more money off its patent trove, however, maybe just not with Intel. “We believe AMD management remains focused on further monetizing its IP and anticipates one or two new deals per year going forward,” they wrote. Uncertainty around AMD’s intellectual property is just one of many unknowns surrounding AMD’s plans, though they are mostly focused on execution of the product road map that was laid out Tuesday. If AMD can execute on all fronts, it could live up to its increased valuation, but any missteps could cause a loss for investors that have bet on a rosy future.

The colorful, lightweight bangle also bypasses phone-owning men – feeding information directly to expectant mothers – and is built to withstand the rigors of village life. “In rural areas, mobile connectivity – and mobile access for women – is an issue, as phones are controlled by men,” said Pavel Hoq, chief operating officer at Intel Social Business, which developed the new device. “While we had also developed mobile apps for maternal health, we realised a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Made of durable plastic, the bangle is water-resistant and has a long-lasting battery that does not require charging throughout the duration of a pregnancy. Nor does it not need an internet connection to work. Coel, or carbon monoxide exposure limiter, was created by Intel Social Business Ltd., a joint venture of Intel Corporation, and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust. The device can be recharged and reused many times, Hoq said. New jewels It will join a woman’s regular array of bracelets, with most married women in South Asia wearing bangles made of glass, plastic or gold. The decorative finish differentiates the bangle from many other wrist-worn fitness devices or smart watches. Coel, which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor. An alarm also sounds if high levels of carbon monoxide fumes are generated when cooking with firewood, charcoal or dung, warning the wearer to move away.  Every day, about 830 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly a third of these deaths are in South Asia. Maternal mortality is higher among women living in rural areas and poorer communities, where access to healthcare is often forbidden or curtailed due to a lack of female medics. In Bangladesh, where more than 70 percent of babies are born at home, about 5,000 maternal deaths and nearly 77,000 neonatal deaths are reported annually, according to WHO. In neighboring India, where Coel has been tested in Uttar Pradesh – among the poorest states in the country – maternal and neonatal deaths are nearly 10 times higher. At the same time, wearable devices including smart watches, shoes and glasses, are increasingly used for remote healthcare, such as to monitor a patient’s cholesterol or insulin levels. It is a growing market: about 2.5 million such wearable devices were sold in India last year, most priced under $50, according to research firm International Data Corporation. Coel, which will be priced initially at about $12-$15, will be sold in India and Bangladesh first, then in Nepal, said Hoq. “Easy access to knowledge is crucial in these countries, particularly for first-time mothers,” he said.  “We want this device to be a tool of empowerment for women.”–Reuters This article was published on 17/05/2017 Most Read 'Kaifi, ana Kuwaiti' MP calls to cut expat students in Govt schools Oil companies post billions of dollars in losses Kuwait Airways appoints Khuzam carrier's new CEO The worst is yet to come Hypocrisy Traffic police officer thrashed for issuing traffic ticket 72 projects to resolve traffic woes The Honorable Policeman Trump to give speech on Islam during Saudi visit Business Cartoon E-Paper Health Kuwait Legal Clinic Lifestyle Opinion Sports Technology Top Stories World About Us Contact Us Rate card 2017 RSS © 2017, ↑ Kuwait Times

The German automaker is working with Intel, Mobileye and Delphi on autonomous vehicles. (ZUMAPRESS.com/Newscom) APARNA NARAYANAN 5:06 PM ET Reprints Autonomous driving is too complicated and too important to do it yourself. At least that's the logic behind automakers and technology firms such as General Motors (GM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Intel (INTC) that are carpooling their self-driving efforts in one or more alliances. Tesla (TSLA) continues to forge its own path, however, while no one is sure what Apple (AAPL) plans to do. Over the weekend, Alphabet's autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo teamed up with Lyft. On Tuesday, BMW Group, Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) announced Tuesday that they will partner with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to bring autonomous driving solutions to multiple automakers. The Delphi partnership may especially benefit smaller car companies lacking resources to build their own systems. Delphi shares fell 2% on the stock market today. "It's the most exciting time in automotives going back 100 years," said Brian Collie, a partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and leader of its North America automotive sector. In Collie's view, technological innovations, such as autonomous driving, and new mobility services, such as the ride-hailing services Lyft and Uber, are starting to "profoundly impact" both the auto industry and society at large. "Automotive companies are in a race to figure out how best to evolve their business models to thrive in this rapidly evolving ecosystem" he added. "There are a host of questions to work through for which there are no easy answers." Autonomous and partially autonomous cars will account for 12% to 13% of global vehicle sales by 2025, representing a market for those features of roughly $42 billion, according to BCG. That market opportunity has led to an intricate tango among the players with a stake in the game, as automobile makers, equipment suppliers, ride-sharing services and technology giants figure out where they need one another to fill in gaps in expertise. Here is a rundown of key autonomous driving alliances: BMW-Intel-Mobileye-Delphi Under the alliance announced Tuesday, Delphi will play a key role in integrating the solution delivered by BMW, Intel and Mobileye into OEM (original equipment manufacturer) vehicle architectures, they said in a joint news release. It also may provide components such as sensors and help with customizations to help vehicle brands differentiate themselves, the statement added. In July 2016, Mobileye, which produces camera-based driver-assistance systems, joined forces with Intel and BMW to make self-driving cars a reality by 2021. A month later Delphi and Mobileye teamed up to make turnkey autonomous systems for auto and truck makers. Then this March 2017, Intel decided to acquire Mobileye in a $15 billion deal, capitalizing on the Israeli tech firm's driver-assistance and anti-collision expertise. Confused already? Just know that Intel also acquired a 15% ownership stake in digital mapping service Here — co-owned by BMW and other German automakers — earlier this year. But Mobileye got there first, seeing an opportunity to collaborate with Here on mapping services in pursuit of its self-driving goals. Tuesday's enhanced alliance may serve as a chassis for the many moving parts in these relationships — and perhaps bring Delphi-Mobileye's self-driving kit expertise in-house. Delphi stock shot up May 3 amid news that it would spin off its powertrain unit to focus more aggressively on autonomous driving. Alphabet-Lyft, General Motors-Lyft On Sunday, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google-parent Alphabet, said it would partner with Lyft. Details of the tie-up are sketchy, but it threatens a ride-sharing rival to Lyft — Uber. Waymo is, in fact, engaged in a legal spat with Uber. The evolving relationships among ride-sharing services, technology firms and automotive companies also are a study in intricacy. Uber has partnered with German automaker Daimler and Japanese automaker Toyota Motors (TM) in the quest for new mobility solutions. It has also reportedly chased self-driving deals with Tesla (TSLA), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Ford Motors (F) and others. Meanwhile, General Motors and Lyft buddied up to deploy self-driving electric cars in test fleets. Waymo-Alphabet courted Fiat Chrysler to build and test self-driving minivans. And Ford in February said it would invest $1 billion in a previously obscure startup, Argo AI, to build fully self-driving cars. Qualcomm-NXP Late last year, Qualcomm (QCOM) said it would acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), the largest automotive chip supplier, for $47 billion. The deal between two fabless chip leaders is expected create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving. Baidu-Nvidia Also in 2016, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Chinese search giant company Baidu (BIDU) agreed to build a computing platform for self driving cars. The open-source platform was touted as one that would be available for purchase by automakers for their own self-driving vehicles. Tesla The logic between Detroit-Silicon Valley alliances is straightforward. Automakers know how to mass produce, distribute and market vehicles and manage tens of thousands of factory workers, whereas tech giants have the edge on electronics, crunching data and rapid innovation. Tesla, however, is trying to do both. Tesla is trying to move from a niche maker of luxury electric vehicles to a mass market producer with the introduction of the Model 3 later this year. Tesla touts its vehicles, including the Model 3, as having the hardware needed for full self-driving capability. It has been testing the technology on the roads, too, with plans to take it mainstream. Tesla counts Nvidia as a chip supplier and had a very public falling-out with Mobileye. But he is largely on his own as far as self-driving goals go, combining auto-manufacturing expertise and technological savvy into one enviable package. Apple Apple has not officially acknowledged the existence of its self-driving car efforts, code-named Project Titan. But last month it received got the green light to test self-driving cars from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Apple reportedly has downshifted its ambitions from building its own self-driving electric vehicles to producing the autonomous systems. If true, it's unclear if Apple would ally with a specific automaker to produce self-driving or offer a turnkey system for any automaker to use. There also has been speculation that the cash-flush Apple could target Tesla (TSLA) for a takeover — but Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently dismissed the idea as highly unlikely.

Well then this afternoon’s giveaway should be just what you need. Today Gigabyte is providing a trio of their Z170 gaming motherboards: the Z170X-Ultra Gaming, the Z170X-Gaming 5, and the Z170X-Gaming. As an added kicker, they’ve also thrown in some swag: Gigabyte motherboard-themed building block kits. Gigabyte Z170X-Ultra Gaming Mobo + Gigabyte Building Blocks Kit + T-Shirt Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 5 Mobo + Gigabyte Building Blocks Kit + T-Shirt Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 7 Mobo + Gigabyte Building Blocks Kit + Hoodie Gigabyte Building Blocks Kit (#1) Gigabyte Building Blocks Kit (#2) The AnandTech 20th Anniversary Celebration – Gigabyte Technology Giveaway Gigabyte Z170X-Ultra Gaming Leading the pack of today’s prizes is Gigabyte’s Z170X-Ultra Gaming motherboard. The LGA 1151 motherboard sports 3 PCIe x16 slots (2 off of the CPU, one x4 off of the chipset), 3 PCIe x1 slots, a single full-feature M.2 slot, and unique for Gigabyte’s lineup, a U.2 connector for high performance 2.5” SSDs. In terms of third party controllers, we’re looking at a Realtek ALC 892 for audio, and an Intel I219-V GigE LAN controller, and, most significantly, an Intel “Alpine Ridge” controller for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) and Thunderbolt 3 support. Particularly interesting here, Gigabyte is one of a handful of vendors to support the highest USB Power Delivery 2.0 states, meaning the board is capable of delivering 100W of power over its Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. Gigabyte Z170X Gaming 7 The second motherboard among today’s prizes is Gigabyte’s Z170X Gaming 7. The layout of this board is quite similar to the Z170X-Ultra gaming, relying on the same 3 PCIe x16 slot + 3 PCIe x1 slot configuration. However the board features two M.2 slots, both of which support both SATA and PCIe drives. For third party controllers, as this is a more high-end gaming focused board, Gigabyte has equipped the board with a Creative Sound Core audio controller for audio, both Intel and Killer E2400 controllers for dual NIC functionality, and like its Ultra counterpart, an Intel “Alpine Ridge” controller for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) and Thunderbolt 3 support. Gigabyte Z170X Gaming 5 Our final motherboard prize of the day is Gigabyte’s Z170X Gaming 5. The smaller sibling to the Gaming 7, this board has the same triple PCIe x16 (2 CPU, 1 PCH) slot layout, but with 4 PCIe x1 slots and a single M.2 slot. For third party controllers Gigabyte is using a Realtek ALC 1150 for audio, both Intel and Killer E2201 controllers for dual NIC functionality, and an Intel controller for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) support. Gigabyte Building Blocks Last among our prizes, Gigabyte has also thrown in some outright swag with their building blocks kit. The kit lets you build – you guessed it – a toy motherboard, complete with Gigabyte and Intel logos. No word on what kind of CPU it supports though. Finally, as with our other giveaways, this afternoon’s giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so be sure to enter soon. However please note that for legal reasons, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. Good luck to everyone! And be sure to check in tomorrow for our next giveaway.

This week, shares of Advanced Micro Devices were buffeted by investors buying on a rumor and selling on no news. Or perhaps not quite the news investors wanted to hear. The excitement started Tuesday morning, when tech news site Fudzilla reported that it had confirmed the widespread rumor that Intel (intc) would license graphics processor technology from AMD after a previous licensing deal with Nvidia (nvda) expired in March. That sent AMD shares soaring 12%. After the market closed, AMD CEO Lisa Su and other top executives made a presentation for analysts. Su and her team outlined a strategy to push the company's newly developed Ryzen central processing chip that runs at the heart of PCs into additional markets, as well as a forthcoming a new graphics chip known as Vega. AMD also announced a new super-charged version of Ryzen called Threadripper, which could be an early volley against Intel's anticipated Core i9 chip for computers, as well as a Ryzen variant for servers called EPYC. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. But AMD did not announce a deal with Intel. In fact, it highlighted its graphics capabilities as a strategic advantage in the chip wars against Intel and Nvidia. Having both chips for running PCs as well as graphics chips "really allows us to bring this together for the best of both worlds and really optimize the system," Su told the analysts as she sought to convince them of AMD's unique position in the market. Intel is strong in making central processors to run PCs and servers, while Nvidia makes the most popular graphics chips. But only AMD makes both parts. The lack of a deal announcement tripped up AMD's stock in after market trading, and by Wednesday afternoon, in a weak overall market, its shares were down 9%. Still, the stock has held most of its huge gain over the past year—it's up more than sixfold from last February—as investors have become increasingly confident in Su's turnaround plan. The CEO junked products that didn't compete well against Intel's chips and put all of AMD's resources behind developing significantly redesigned chips with capabilities that could beat the competition. That has paid off so far, as the Ryzen line started with chips that could match or beat Intel's performance at half the price. Also likely hurting the stock in the short term on Wednesday was Su's announcement that the company was shooting for annual adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents. AMD's (amd) stock price boom came on the hopes that Ryzen and Vega would ignite an earnings boom, too. Some analysts were expecting $1 a share or more. "A path to (at least) $1/EPS remains critical for long-term investors to see sufficient risk/reward in AMD shares, despite the much improved management team and product roadmap," Matthew Ramsay, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, wrote on Wednesday.

Latest: sources claim Apple is considering an update at WWDC 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 17 May 17 Contents > When is the MacBook Air 2017 coming out? > Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? > When was the MacBook Air last updated? > How much will the MacBook Air 2017 cost? > in, 15in & 17in? > Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air? Or is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article, we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. For buying advice related to the current Apple laptop range, read our Best MacBook buying guide and Best cheap MacBook deals articles. When is the MacBook Air 2017 coming out? New Apple laptops will be unveiled at WWDC 2017, according to a report from Bloomberg - and these may include a new Air. The site based its predictions on anonymous sources referred to only as "people familiar with the matter", who said that the 12-inch MacBook, the MacBook Pro and even the long-neglected MacBook Air could see a refresh at June's keynote event. The MacBook Pro, updated as recently as autumn 2016, will be refreshed again but less radically, getting a processor bump to the Kaby Lake chipset. Read more: New MacBook Pro release A new model of the 12-inch MacBook will be announced, again getting faster Intel processors. Read more: New MacBook release But the most surprising forecast concerns the MacBook Air, a line-up which most of us had assumed was dead and buried. "The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong," writes Bloomberg. We'd previously felt that the MacBook Air line was being quietly wound down, however, and remember that Bloomberg's sources only say that Apple is considering an update. This may or may not be significant, but in February 2017 the US retailer Best Buy dropped the price for the cheapest MacBook Air to just $800. Price cuts often precede the launch of a new model, as retailers try to clear their store of the older machine, but this could just as easily indicate that Best Buy thinks a new MacBook Air is on the way (or the old one is going to be discontinued) as it could indicate that it's got wind of some inside information. You'll recall that late in 2016 Best Buy accidentally published a spec of a new iMac on its site, which some of us thought might indicate an upcoming launch, but we're still waiting on that one. Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leapt past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out anymore," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst foresees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. How much will the MacBook Air 2017 cost? The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry-level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line-up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. Screen size: 13in, 15in & 17in? If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that sometime in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. MacBook Air 2017: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic Update 08/02/2017: It's not just the CPU that's getting an upgrade either, as a recent Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on a processor that's meant to improve the battery life of its laptop range. According to the report, the chip is said to handle basic tasks like checking for email and installing updates while the computer is asleep. Apple's current way of working relies on the MacBook's main processor to handle the tasks, but by implementing a dedicated low-power processor, Apple can further reduce battery consumption and provide a longer battery life.   Those with knowledge of the subject claim that the chip is similar to that used by Apple in the MacBook Pro to manage the Touch Bar, and that the new chip may make an appearance in the 2017 MacBook Pro, along with other laptops. It makes sense, as Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticised since launch for its poor battery life. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air. Read more: What is a Retina display? New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

When will Apple release the new MacBook Pro for 2017? And what UK prices, tech specs and new features should we expect from the new MacBook Pro 2017? New MacBook Pro models were released in October 2016, but we're already looking ahead to the next update of the MacBook Pro for 2017. In this article we round up and analyse all the rumours related to the new MacBook Pro 2017: its release date, specs, design, likely pricing and new features. So far we've heard calls for the new MacBook Pro models to have an option for 32GB RAM and reports that Apple is looking at the option of hooking an iPad Pro up to to the MacBook Pro so that designers can use it like a Cintiq, while sources close to the matter predict that Apple will announce an update Pro model at WWDC 2017. Read on for more rumours and expectations. If you're interested in the latest MacBook Pro update you can read more here: New MacBook Pro 2016 review. And if you want to buy one, read our Mac buying guide and the Best cheap MacBook Pro deals. When is the MacBook Pro 2017 UK release date? The current lineup of MacBook Pro models was introduced in October 2016, and Apple doesn't tend to update its Macs more often than once a year, so we wouldn't ordinarily expect Apple to update the range before October 2017. But sources claim something is coming sooner than this: new Apple laptops will be unveiled at WWDC 2017, according to Bloomberg. The site based its predictions on anonymous sources referred to only as "people familiar with the matter", who said the Pro, as well as the 12-inch MacBook and even the long-neglected MacBook Air could see a refresh at June's keynote event. The MacBook Pro, updated as recently as autumn 2016, will be refreshed again but less radically, getting a processor bump to the Kaby Lake chipset. A new model of the 12-inch MacBook will be announced, again getting faster Intel processors. But the most surprising forecast concerns the MacBook Air, a line-up which most of us had assumed was dead and buried. "The company has also considered updating the ageing 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong," writes Bloomberg. Updating the Pro with Kaby Lake chips this summer might be a good idea. Competing pro laptops coming from Dell and HP will offer newer Kaby Lake Intel processors long before October 2017, including the Dell Precision 5520, which is available now. For business people looking for a stylish laptop this may not matter, but for creatives looking for a new Mac a move away from Apple may start to look attractive if Apple makes them wait too long. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted an update to the entire range in 2017. In October 2016 he told clients that he expected Apple to launch updated MacBooks Pros in the second half of 2017 including support for 32GB of RAM, with the proviso that Intel would launch the required processors in time. However, at that time he referenced Cannonlake processors, in February 2017 he published a new note claiming that the new MacBook Pro models will feature Kaby Lake processors and that the 13in and 15in versions of the MacBook Pro will see an update towards the end of 2017, with mass production of these models beginning in the third quarter of 2017. However, those hoping for a 32GB RAM update to the 15in MacBook Pro model in 2017 may be disappointed. The high-end MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM will not enter mass production until the fourth quarter of 2017 so its launch isn't expected until 2018. (Incidentally the Dell Precision 5520 does have a 32GB RAM configuration.) How much will the 2017 MacBook Pro cost in the UK? Shortly after Apple announced the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in October 2016, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published a note to clients indicating that he expects Apple to drop prices in subsequent updates to the range. He observed that Apple tends to overprice new generations of Mac before gradually lowering prices in the following year. The pricing for the 2016 13in and 15in new MacBook Pro models begins at £1,749/$1,799 for a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and starts at $2,399/£2,349 for the 15in model. The most expensive MacBook Pro now costs £2,699/$2,799. The version of the MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar costs from $1,499/£1,449. This is the model most likely to see a price drop, potentially coinciding with an update to the 12in MacBook and the discontinuation of the MacBook Air. Processor: Will the new MacBook Pro have a Kaby Lake, Cannonlake or Apple designed processor? When they launched in October 2016 the new range of MacBook Pro models ran on Intel's Skylake processors, the processor microarchitecture that first launched in August 2015 as a successor to Broadwell. This was a disappointment to some as the Skylake chips can only support up to 16GB of RAM (to offer a 32GB option Apple would need to use battery-hungry desktop-class RAM). Given that the MacBook Pro is pitched as a professional machine there have been calls for the next model to offer the option of 32GB RAM and naturally attention has turned to Intel's roadmap for clues as to what processor might make this update feasible. Back in October 2016 Apple analyst Kuo had suggested that the MacBook Pro could adopt Intel's Cannonlake processors, or should that not appear in time, Intel's Coffee Lake processors (although that would limit the models to 16GB RAM). However, it appears that the usually accurate analyst had his chips somewhat muddled, as there are apparently no plans to design MacBook Pro-class Cannonlake chips, and Coffee Lake is not scheduled until 2018. In a note published in January 2017 Kuo predicted that the new MacBook Pro line up would feature Kaby Lake chips. Kaby Lake is the successor to Skylake. That line of processors debuted in the spring of 2016, but the processors suitable for future MacBook Pros (as suggested by beta code in macOS Sierra 10.12.4) weren't announced until the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. This beta code discovered in Sierra by Pike's Universum references the following Kaby Lake processors: The 13in MacBook Pro could gain the i7-7660U 2.5 GHz Kaby Lake chip; The 13in MacBook Pro with Touch bar could gain the Kaby Lake 3.1 GHz i5-7267U, 3.3 GHz i5-7287U, and 3.5 GHz i7-7567U processors; The 15in MacBook Pro could gain i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz, i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz, and i7-7920 3.1 GHz Kaby Lake processors. These new Kaby Lake processors offer better power efficiency and more advanced on-board GPU capabilities, but the processor power doesn't see a marked increase. Dell's Precision 5520 laptop includes Kaby Lake chips and is directly comparable to the MacBook Pro. There's another possibility, Apple could move away from Intel chips and look at what's on offer from AMD. According to an Archtosh report, AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel's i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. We think such a transition is unlikley however, given the fact that Apple had to rewrite the operating system to prepare for the Intel switch. Perhaps more likely is the idea that Apple will design its own chips (although we think all rumours about this pointed to the processor that powers the Touch Bar in the 2016 MacBook Pro. Will the new MacBook Pro 2017 have an Apple designed processor? The chip that powers the Touch Bar in the MacBook Pro may not be the only low power chip coming from Apple. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has predicted that the 2017 MacBook Pro will feature an Apple-designed chip to handle simple tasks such as email and updates while the laptop is asleep, citing "people familiar with the matter". "The chip, which went into development [in 2016], is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard's Touch Bar feature," Gurman writes. "The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer's low-power mode functionality." By building a dedicated low-power processor, Apple could reduce battery consumption for the 2017 MacBook Pro. RAM: Will the new MacBook Pro 2017 have 32GB RAM? As we mention above, a big disappointment with the 2016 MacBook Pro line up was the RAM limitations, with the models maxing out at 16GB RAM. Pro customers, such as video editors, were so disillusioned with the 2016 update that in November 2016 Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller spoke out in defence of Apple's decision not to offer more RAM, saying that to offer more RAM would be detrimental to battery life because higher amounts of RAM would require a power-hungry memory controller unsuitable for use in portable machines. Schiller said: "To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life." The problem lies with the Intel Skylake CPUs used in Apple's MacBook Pro. These processors support up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM at 2133MHz. There are processors capable of addressing more than 16GB of memory, but these rely on less efficient DDR4 RAM and are usually deployed in desktops because they can be plugged into mains power. Understandably Apple does not wish to hinder the battery life of its laptops in this way.   Schiller has also indicated that using 32GB of RAM would require a different logic board design that would limit space for other components, including the battery. In an email to MacDaddy's Ben Slaney, Schiller wrote: "To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life." So, as you can see, the calls for a 32GB RAM version of the MacBook Pro are loud enough for Apple to make a statement regarding it, but this doesn't mean that a RAM update is immanent. A Kaby Lake processor upgrade for the MacBook Pro will not increase in the RAM cap of 16GB because the Kaby Lake processor doesn't support LPDDR4 RAM and Apple is not expected to engineer a new RAM controller that does any time soon. An Intel processor capable of supporting LPDDR4 RAM isn't expected before 2018. Kuo still has some hope however, he predicts that Apple will start to manufacture a 15in MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM in the fourth quarter. And he thinks that Apple will adopt desktop RAM due in order to do so. Dell's Precision 5520 laptop is directly comparable to the MacBook Pro and has a 32GB RAM build-to-order configuration.  Amid calls for Apple to update the MacBook Pro, which some feel is hampered by its standard 8GB RAM (upgradable to just 16GB), Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that Apple still considers the professional creative market to be important. Comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the separation between 'creative' and 'professional' in Cook's comments could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer. Regarding Cook's comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He considers that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Graphics: What graphics card will the new MacBook Pro 2017 offer? The 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar currently offers Intel Iris Graphics 540 while the 13in model with Touch Bar offers Intel Iris Graphics 550. The 15in model offers a duel graphics card set up, with the Radeon Pro 450, or a Radeon Pro 455, alongside the Intel HD Graphics 530. The Radeon Pro 400 series launched in October, so they were new graphics processors at the time the Macs launched. The Radeon RX 500 series is expected to launch this year and could be destined for the new MacBook Pro models. Screen: What improvements might Apple make to the screen on the new MacBook Pro? The current model has an impressive 4K screen but this is still few pixels than some of the competition. The 2016 MacBook Pro can output the full DCI P3 colour space used for films for digital cinema output, however, as our colleague on Digital Arts notes in his review: "It's the Adobe RGB colour space that really matters as this is what's used internally by tools from Photoshop to Illustrator to Premiere Pro – and again here the MBP is lacking. In our tests with a DataColor Spyder5Elite colorimeter, we found that the MacBook Pro's screen can output 91 percent of the colours in the Adobe RGB." In their tests Dell's Precision 5510 and the Wacom MobileStudio Pro could output 91 percent of the colours in the Adobe RGB. In the next version of the MacBook Pro we'd like to see an improvement here. Another desirable addition to the screen would be touchscreen capabilities, something much of the competition also shares. While Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs said that he felt that touch screens were a bad idea (because they would make your arm ache) there is some value in being able to touch a screen rather than use a mouse or track pad when you are in cramped conditions, such as those in which our colleague on Digital Arts wrote his review. Apple may have a solution to the touch screen wishes in mind. Apparently the company is looking at hooking an iPad Pro up to a Mac to use it as a Cintiq-like device, according to OSnews. Battery: Is 10 hours battery life enough for the new MacBook Pro? With Apple pointing to battery life as the reason it won't offer more RAM in the MacBook Pro you might be wondering whether there is room for improvements to battery life in the next model, or if battery life could (or should) suffer if Apple is to offer a truly pro-level machine. The 2016 machine offers 10-hours of battery life, as did earlier models. There was some question about the accuracy of this claim earlier in 2017 when Consumer Reports tested the battery life and found that is was less. However, Consumer Reports battery life tests had been influenced by a bug in Safari's developer mode that consumers wouldn't be using. Ports: Could the new MacBook Pro lose the headphone jack? When Apple launched the new MacBook Pro many of the familiar ports disappeared replaced by USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. The headphone jack remained despite being lost from the iPhone and iPad. Will it remain in the next version of the MacBook Pro? Possibly, although it seems likely that Apple will swap it for Lightning or another Thunderbolt 3 port in the future. Touch Bar: Will Apple add the Touch Bar to more Mac models? The Touch Bar on the high-end MacBook Pro was the biggest change to the range when it was updated in 2016. It's a customisable strip-screen that allows for slicker fingertip control in certain software. It supports multi-touch gestures, which is handy when photo editing or using DJ applications, to name a couple of examples. The Touch Bar is customisable, and you can click and drag preferred commands/functions into the bar, somewhat like the way you drag app icons into the dock on a Mac or iPhone. When the Touch Bar first launched it was limited to Apple applications, however over the months it has gained functionality with many other apps including Spotify and Photoshop, and it now offers additional functionality for Microsoft Office features. You can expect more software to offer Touch Bar support in the future. For more on this, see our guide to the Touch Bar: How to use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro | Touch Bar tips. And if you'd like to get some Touch Bar action on other Macs, have a read of our Apple keyboard with Touch Bar release date rumours and How to get Touch Bar on any Mac. Apple is actually said to be exploring additional Retina MacBook Pro models without the Touch Bar, according to OSnews sources. Currently there is one 13in model that ships without the Touch Bar. This is because following the launch of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, orders for refurbished MacBook Pros went through the roof, and this took Apple completely by surprise. There may be some security issues with the Touch Bar. A report on BGN outlines that Hackers at the Pwn2Own competition have exploited a security hole in Safari and take over the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar gaining root control of the MacOS on a MacBook Pro. The hackers have sent details of the attack to Apple so the company is likely to have patched it already. Colour: Who wants a Gold MacBook Pro? The MacBook Pro series currently comes in two colour finishes: silver and Space Grey, while the MacBook series is available in Gold and Rose Gold as well. It the MacBook Pro ever likely to adopt the gold colour? We think that Apple will continue to offer gold as an option on it's consumer focused laptops, but it will keep the more business-like silver and grey for the professional machines. &nbsp; Tags: Mac , Rumour , MacBook Pro with Retina display Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

By John Morris for Laptops & Desktops | May 17, 2017 -- 16:38 GMT (09:38 PDT) | Topic: Processors The launch earlier this year of the first Zen processors was a big step to make AMD relevant again. It demonstrated that the company could produce a competitive CPU design manufactured on an advanced process. But AMD knows it needs to do more to win back business from Intel and Nvidia. At its analyst day, the company announced more new products and a roadmap to remain competitive for years to come. The most significant news is the confirmation that the Zen server chips code-named Naples will ship in June under the new Epyc brand (RIP, Opteron). Epyc has up to 32 cores (64 threads) and is designed for mainstream single- and dual-socket servers -- the bulk of the market and an area that AMD has largely surrendered in recent years because it lacked a competitive product. Each processor has 8 memory channels and 128 lanes of PCI-Express 3.0; a two-socket server with two Epyc processors connected using its Infinity Fabric can hold up to 32 DIMMs or 4TB of memory. The first images of the Epyc showed how AMD managed to produce a 14nm 32-core processor by slicing it up into four chips with higher yields packaged into a single chip -- a direction that Intel has also been discussing lately. Also: AMD makes its data center move: Will it be EPYC? | AMD is making PCs and servers exciting again | AMD's Ryzen 5 threatens Intel's grip on the mainstream PC market | The new design should make AMD more competitive in two-socket servers, but the real strategy seems to be to undercut some of these higher-cost Xeon E5 systems with cheaper single-socket Epyc servers. Forrest Norrod, the head of the server business noted that AMD has 0 percent market share in the mainstream two-socket market, so there's nothing to cannibalize with lower-cost systems. Some of these customers currently purchase a two-socket server with only one Xeon E5 chip in order to get certain memory or I/O features. AMD argues that an Epyc single-socket server can provide more cores, the same memory capacity and bandwidth, and more PCI-Express 3.0 lanes than the current Broadwell two-socket systems. "We have, let's call it very little to lose, and a lot to offer," AMD CEO Lisa Su said. "The datacenter will look very different in a few years." The company has a relatively modest goal with Naples of getting back to double-digit market share -- though that would still represent a significant increase in units and revenue. But AMD also showed a long-term Epyc roadmap that included Rome, a 7nm chip based on the Zen 2 architecture, and Milan, based on an enhanced 7nm process and the Zen 3 design, while offering few details. AMD is already shipping the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors for desktops, and it said systems based on these chips will be available from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo by the end of the quarter. The company announced a new high-end chip, dubbed Threadripper, which will have 16 cores (32 threads) and greater memory and I/O bandwidth. It will be demonstrated next month at Computex in Taiwan. Intel is rumored to be preparing a Core i9 processor, which could also be announced at Computex, to compete head-to-head with Threadripper and the fastest Ryzen 7 chips. The issue with these chips is that there are relatively few consumer applications that really take advantage of so many cores and threads. In the second half of the year, AMD plans to release Ryzen 3 low-end processors as well as Ryzen Mobile APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) that also include new Vega on-die graphics. These will deliver 50 percent better CPU performance, 40 percent better graphics performance and longer battery life than laptops based on AMD's current mobile platform. Ryzen Pro processors for business desktops will also be out later this year, followed by the mobile versions in the first half of 2018. Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial AMD's current Polaris graphics is targeted at low- and mid-range cards, but the company is expected to release Vega, a new architecture designed to compete head-to-head with Nvidia's fastest GPUs, any day now. The first Vega card, called the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, will be available in late June and targeted at deep learning rather than high-end gaming -- an indication of just how important this market has rapidly become. AMD did not provide full specifications, but we know it will have 64 Compute Units and 16GB of HBM2 stacked memory with 480GBps of throughput, and deliver 12.5 teraflops (trillions of floating-point operations per second) at single-precision and 25 teraflops at 16-bit for deep learning applications. That's enough to edge out the Nvidia P100 at 9.3TF single-precision and 18.7TF at half-precision (AMD showed the Frontier Edition besting the P100 on Baidu's DeepBenchBaidu's DeepBench, for example), but it will fall well short of the new V100 announced at last week's GPU Technology Conference, which will deliver 15TF single-precision and up to 120TF at mixed-precision (16- and 32-bit) for deep learning because of its specialized Tensor Cores. Raja Koduri, the head of the Radeon graphics group, said Vega will be competitive but he was "not declaring victory here over Nvidia or anyone else." AMD also announced a Radeon Pro Vega SSG (Solid-State Graphics) card with both 16GB of high-bandwidth memory and an on-board 2TB NVMe solid-state drive for professional visualization. Overall AMD emphasized how a more competitive lineup and a predictable roadmap will help it claw back market share from Intel and Nvidia over time. CTO Mark Papermaster talked about how the company was using two "leapfrogging" teams to work on two designs simultaneously and the AMD showed an x86 roadmap, though this didn't reveal much except that there will be a 7nm "Zen 2" and a 7nm+ "Zen 3" with steady improvements in performance per watt by 2020. On the graphics side, the roadmap includes two generations of Vega (on 14nm and 14nm+) followed by a 7nm Navi family and eventually a "next-generation GPU" on an enhanced 7nm process -- again with no details. AMD did state this it will use both GlobalFoundries and TSMC to manufacture its 7nm chips.

Bulls defended the outlook, saying there could be further upside. By Tiernan Ray May 17, 2017 11:16 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are down 79 cents, or 6%, and $11.94, after the company yesterday discussed forthcoming products at its analyst day meeting with Wall Street, but failed to produce the licensing deal with Intel (INTC) that some had been expecting. In addition, some were disappointed with a financial target for 75 cents EPS that was offered for 2020, assuming all goes as planned. Some walked away shaking their heads. John Pitzer of Credit Suisse, who’s Neutral on the stock, wrote that the day was "mostly neutral” versus what he had thought would be "neutral/positive." The financial model doesn’t make clear, he writes, "what share targets/competitive response they embed and would imply profitability levels to which the Company has rarely executed.” And while 75 cents is better than he the 50 cents to 60 cents he had been modeling, "even against the higher number, upside to current valuation is questionable." Still, he writes, there’s "scarcity value of AMD core IP in compute and graphics,” which is valuable. Another bear, Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein, who has a Market Perform rating, writes that it was a “hopeful but not bold” event. As far as the forecast, “perhaps they are being conservative,” which is wise, “but so far they have yet to demonstrate any inflection vs expectations." Bulls defended AMD’s forecasts. One, Matthew Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity, has specifically pegged his Buy rating on a dollar or more by that time. Today, Ramsay reiterates a $17 price target, writing that he came away from the event “impressed” with the “much-improved roadmap.” His “conviction” remains unchanged in the company’s ability to return to profit “and generate strong shareholder returns." Ramsay writes that "a path to (at least) $1/EPS remains critical for long-term investors to see sufficient risk/reward in AMD shares, despite the much improved management team and product roadmap." Today he reiterates his thinking on how they can get there: Our bull-case published estimates model this scenario precisely but with only modest share gain assumptions in each critical end market, we believe those estimates could prove conservative should roadmap execution be consistent. Further, we believe these estimates of market share and gross margin by product segment are both conservative and realistic, fully acknowledging the very strong competitive positions of Intel and NVIDIA balanced against AMD’s solid engineering teams, improved foundry partnerships and customers’ needs for competition. Hitting a dollar or more, writes Ramsay, could boost the stock to $20 or more: Should AMD hit our targets of $1.00 to $1.35 in EPS by 2020, how should we value AMD shares? While our published price target of $17/share represents 3x 2018E EV/sales for AMD, we believe delivering significant upside to consensus estimates more consistent with our long-term model would yield upside to our price target more consistent with 15-20x earnings. Setting a midpoint of $1.20 in EPS in our long-term range, we believe AMD shares could appreciate to $20+ as investors get more confidence in the product roadmap and potential margin/earnings power of the franchise. As such, we remain confident in our BUY rating and more conservative $17 price target. Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital, who has an Outperform rating, writes that the event had “more details than we are accustomed to from such events, both in terms of the product road map, as well as a little more granularity on the financials." There's bound to be some disappointment with the 75 cents EPS target, he writes, but the company is trying to be “reasonable," he thinks: While there is likely going to be some disappointment with the $0.75 EPS target the company laid out for the longer term (2020), our sense is that the company is not going over its skis and trying to set a target that seems more reasonable at this stage. While skepticism around AMD to execute will and should remain, we have all seen the leverage a model can have if the company begins to show success in the datacenter, both on the GPU, as well as the server side. Additionally, we believe there is a high likelihood that the company has additional IP licensing opportunities in the pipeline that could potentially materialize and that are not captured in the long-term EPS target.

 Delphi joins up with BMW, Intel for self-driving cars Nicholas Shields May 17, 2017, 11:47 AM 646 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also THE INTERNET OF THINGS 2017 REPORT: How the IoT is improving lives to transform the world Microsoft brings IoT to the Edge THE IoT PLATFORMS REPORT: How software is helping the Internet of Things evolve This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Legacy automotive supplier Delphi agreed to join BMW and Intel to work together on the sensors, cameras, software, and visualization for self-driving cars. The agreement is aimed at accelerating the development of the vehicles by leveraging each company's strengths. Intel and BMW have been working together on self-driving cars since last year, as had Intel and Delphi through a separate agreement, so adding Delphi to this agreement is a natural extension of the companies' existing partnerships. The agreement will help the companies put a vehicle on the roads quicker and gain a competitive advantage in the market. Here's how: Companies are rushing to get self-driving cars on the road as soon as they can to gain a crucial early-mover advantage. Self-driving cars are coming — BI Intelligence forecasts that 2.4 million fully autonomous vehicles will be on the roads around the world by 2025. Automakers, tech companies, and ride-hailing services are all angling to earn a share of the market since it'll be lucrative. By getting into the market early, companies have a chance to carve out a large market share before competing firms get into the space. Bringing Delphi into the fold should help BMW and Intel get that advantage. Delphi is adapting for the autonomous age, forging several partnerships to get a share of the market. As a result, it has a background in both the auto industry and in self-driving tech that it can leverage to accelerate BMW and Intel's existing self-driving car projects, helping it get that early-mover advantage. The self-driving car is no longer a futuristic fantasy. Consumers can already buy vehicles that, within a few years time, will get software updates enabling them to hit the road without the need for a driver. This autonomous revolution will upend the automotive sector and disrupt huge swaths of the economy, while radically improving energy efficiency and changing the way people approach transport around the world. Automakers and tech companies are racing to develop the technology that will power self-driving cars in the coming years. That tech is advancing, but leaves observers with a bigger question: will consumers trust driverless car tech, and will they want to use autonomous cars? Peter Newman, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on self-driving cars that analyzes the market, and forecasts vehicle shipments and market penetration. It also profiles the players expected to take on a prominent role in the autonomous future, examines the barriers to autonomous car development and adoption, and reviews developments in technology, regulation, and consumer sentiment. Finally, it analyzes the impact the introduction of autonomy will have on various industries and transport trends.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: Self-driving cars are coming; there will be fully autonomous cars on the roads in the US in 2018, and adoption will just take off from there. The technology is developing swiftly to allow fully self-driving vehicles, while the regulatory environment is adapting to the anticipated changes that this new technology will bring. We conducted a survey asking our exclusive BI Insiders panel about their thoughts on self-driving cars, the future of the automotive industry, and the impact autonomous vehicles will have on their purchasing habits moving forward. The results provide a picture of consumer sentiment at the precipice of the autonomous era. In full, the report: Sizes the current and future self-driving car market, forecasting shipments and projecting installed base. Explains the current state of technology, regulation, and consumer perception. Analyzes how the development of autonomous cars will impact employment and the economy.

We wrote about Naples in March, when we said it featured: A scalable, 32-core System on Chip (SoC) design, with two threads per core Up to 16 DDR4 DIMMs on 8 memory channels and up to 2TB of memory capacity Support for up to 32 DIMMs of DDR4 on 16 memory channels, delivering up to 4TB of total memory capacity in a 2-socket server Complete SoC with fully integrated IO supporting 128 lanes of PCIe 3 Cache structure for high-performance, energy-efficient compute Infinity Fabric coherent interconnect for Naples CPUs in a 2-socket system Dedicated security hardware It still does, underneath the EYPC brand, but we know more about its performance now. At the 2017 AMD Financial Analyst Day, a single EPYC processor was shown beating a Xeon E5-2699A v4 with 45 per cent more cores1, 60 per cent more IO capacity2, and 122 per cent more memory bandwidth3. We don't know how this translates into application speed improvements. Well, tough diddly, AMD, as Intel has its Xeon SP coming and so these comparisons will have to be rerun against the Xeon SP Bronze and Silver CPUs. The results should be most interesting to read. We now know the high-end Platinum Xeon SP runs SAP HANA 1.6x faster than a Xeon E7-8890 v4. If – big if – the other Xeon SPs have similar performance boosts over other Xeon E7s and E5s then AMD might have a marketing problem on its hands. AMD must be hoping that they don't. IDC SVP Matthew Eastwood gave out a neat canned quote: "Today's single-socket server offerings push buyers toward purchasing a more expensive two-socket server just to get the memory bandwidth and IO they need to support the compute performance of the cores... EPYC [offers] a single-processor solution that delivers the right-sized number of high-performance cores, memory, and IO for today's workloads." The first EPYC-based servers will launch in June, with AMD promising widespread support from OEMs and channel partners. Dropbox is evaluating using EYPC CPUs. ® 1 EPYC processor offers up to 64 PCI Express high speed IO lanes per socket, versus the Xeon E5-2699A v4 processor at 40 lanes per socket. 2 EPYC processor includes up to 32 CPU cores versus the Xeon E5-2699A v4 processor with 22 CPU cores. 3 EPYC processor supports up to 21.3 GB/s per channel with DDR4-2667 x 8 channels (total 170.7GBps), versus the Xeon E5-2699A v4 processor at 19.2GBps with max DDR4-2400 x 4 channels (total 76.8GBps).

The colourful, lightweight bangle also bypasses phone-owning men - feeding information directly to expectant mothers - and is built to withstand the rigours of village life. "In rural areas, mobile connectivity - and mobile access for women - is an issue, as phones are controlled by men," said Pavel Hoq, chief operating officer at Intel Social Business, which developed the new device. "While we had also developed mobile apps for maternal health, we realised a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Made of durable plastic, the bangle is water-resistant and has a long-lasting battery that does not require charging throughout the duration of a pregnancy. Nor does it not need an internet connection to work. Coel, or carbon monoxide exposure limiter, was created by Intel Social Business Ltd., a joint venture of Intel Corporation, and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust. The device can be recharged and reused many times, Hoq said. NEW JEWELS It will join a woman's regular array of bracelets, with most married women in South Asia wearing bangles made of glass, plastic or gold. The decorative finish differentiates the bangle from many other wrist-worn fitness devices or smart watches. Coel, which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor. An alarm also sounds if high levels of carbon monoxide fumes are generated when cooking with firewood, charcoal or dung, warning the wearer to move away. Every day, about 830 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly a third of these deaths are in South Asia. Maternal mortality is higher among women living in rural areas and poorer communities, where access to healthcare is often forbidden or curtailed due to a lack of female medics. In Bangladesh, where more than 70 percent of babies are born at home, about 5,000 maternal deaths and nearly 77,000 neonatal deaths are reported annually, according to WHO. In neighbouring India, where Coel has been tested in Uttar Pradesh - among the poorest states in the country - maternal and neonatal deaths are nearly 10 times higher. At the same time, wearable devices including smart watches, shoes and glasses, are increasingly used for remote healthcare, such as to monitor a patient's cholesterol or insulin levels. It is a growing market: about 2.5 million such wearable devices were sold in India last year, most priced under $50, according to research firm International Data Corporation. Coel, which will be priced initially at about $12-$15, will be sold in India and Bangladesh first, then in Nepal, said Hoq. "Easy access to knowledge is crucial in these countries, particularly for first-time mothers," he said. "We want this device to be a tool of empowerment for women."

Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. And for buying advice related to the current MacBook crop, read our Best MacBook buying guide and Best cheap MacBook deals UK articles. When is the new 12in MacBook coming out? Apple launched the 2015 version of the 12in MacBook at a spring event that year, and the 2016 MacBook was quietly introduced in April 2016; but things are evidently different this year. It looks like June, and WWDC 2017, is the most likely launch date. A report from Bloomberg claims that new Apple laptops in multiple lines will be unveiled at WWDC 2017. The site based its predictions on anonymous sources referred to only as "people familiar with the matter", who said that the 12-inch MacBook, the MacBook Pro and even the long-neglected MacBook Air could see a refresh at June's keynote event. A new model of the 12-inch MacBook will be announced, equipped with faster Intel processors. The MacBook Pro is also expected to get a processor bump to the Kaby Lake chipset. But the most surprising forecast concerns the MacBook Air, a line-up which most of us had assumed was dead and buried. "The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong," writes Bloomberg. This fits in with dependable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's earlier predictions (as reported by MacRumors in January 2017) that a new 12in MacBook was set to go into production in early Q2 2017 - April or thereabouts, which meant a June or July launch was feasible. Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? Possibly not: if the Bloomberg report quoted above is correct, Apple is at least considering giving the Air a comeback refresh at WWDC 2017. If so, it would be a massive surprise. After its October 2016 event Apple removed the 11in MacBook Air from sale along with the legacy MacBook Pro with SuperDrive, which had been lurking in the Apple Store for some years. While the 13in MacBook Air remained, it hasn't been significantly updated since March 2015, apart from Apple's decision to offer as standard, 8GB RAM for all MacBook Air models (given that the range was so hampered by its 4GB RAM that we recommended anyone purchasing the computer to upgrade the RAM at point of purchase, this update was rightfully celebrated and long overdue). Another point in favour of ditching the Air is design: it's just not as groundbreaking now as it was eight years ago when it launched. When the MacBook Air first arrived, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name, but the MacBook and MacBook Pro now outshine it in those areas. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. In terms of weight the MacBook Air weighs 1.35kg while the MacBook Pro now weighs only a fraction more at 1.37kg and the MacBook weighs just 0.92kg. If Apple continues to sell the MacBook Air maybe it should drop Air from it's name. It's not all bad, though. The MacBook Air is both more powerful and £300 cheaper than the MacBook. It is the only Mac laptop that is available for less than £1000. For that reason we do still recommend it, although you might do better buying a refurbished MacBook Pro if you need a Mac that costs less than £1000. Given that the MacBook Air is Apple's lowest cost Mac laptop you'd think it would be its most popular model, and yet, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (back in 2015), the 12in MacBook is Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro. See more MacBook Air rumours here. So we think that the 13in MacBook Air will be replaced, but we don't think that will happen before the price of the MacBook and potentially the entry-level MacBook Pro, is reduced. History indicates that this will be the case: the last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was when the MacBook Air launched alongside the old white and black MacBooks. Those models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. We hope that the same will happen, with new 12in MacBook models being priced lower than they are currently and replacing the 13in MacBook Air as the entry level MacBook, while the more advanced specs will be provided by the 13in MacBook Pro. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive and underpowered. How much will the new MacBook cost? While we're still some way ahead of the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it's a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. However, there is a possibility that Apple will reduce the price of the MacBook in 2017, especially if it discontinues the MacBook Air. With the demise of the 11in MacBook Air came a hike to the point of entry for consumers wishing to buy a Mac laptop. The entry price of Apple's MacBook Air laptop is now £949 (thanks in part to Apple's post-Brexit £100 increase, the model had previously cost £849). Before Apple discontinued it, an 11in MacBook Air had been priced at £749. In comparison, the entry-level MacBook Pro, with 2.0GHz dual-core processor and 256GB SSD costs £1,449, while the entry-level 12in MacBook with 1.1GHz m3 chip is £1,249. There is certainly a place for a lower cost Mac laptop and it would seem that for now the MacBook Air will fulfil that role. However, a reduction in price for the MacBook is possible, bringing it into line with the price of the MacBook Air currently. It's interesting to note here that the US prices, less influenced by currency fluctuations, are as follows:  12in MacBook - from $1,299 (£1,249) 13in MacBook Air - from $999 (£949) 13in MacBook Pro - from $1,499  (£1,449) If you ignore the somewhat confusing currently translations (it's not entirely fair to convert dollars to pounds as there is also VAT to add to the US prices, and there are other 'costs of doing business' to take account of - at least that's Apple's excuse) the price differences are roughly the same, with the MacBook being £300/$300 more than the Air, and the Pro being £200/$200 more than the MacBook. Reduce the MacBook price by £300/$300 and you have a new entry-level price that's below the magic £1000/$1000 mark. We don't expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air from the line up until it is willing to shave this much off the price of the MacBook. If it was to do so expect the entry-level MacBook to offer much slower processors and probably less storage than it does currently. New MacBook 2017 specs: Processors The new MacBooks are likely to have Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Kaby Lake is the generation of chips after Skylake, and it offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. There is another interesting possibility with regards to processors. Back in September 2016 Dutch-language site Techtastic spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. The discovery was thought to indicate that Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its MacBooks. As it happens that's exactly what it did a month later with the launch of the MacBook Pro. In that case the chip powers the Touch Bar, but future ARM chips are being developed to look after other functions. The rumours continue: a Bloomberg report from February 2017 claims that Apple is working on a chip, codenamed T310, that will handle the "Power Nap"  functionality and improve the battery life of MacBooks. Whether this chip will end up in the MacBook remains to be seen. We think it's unlikely to make its debut on the next model as Apple is likely to save it for the next model of MacBook Pro. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook 2017 Specs: RAM Currently the MacBook ships with 8GB RAM as standard. There is no option to increase RAM at point of sale, and the Mac is not user upgradable. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the new MacBooks will offer a 16GB of RAM option, up from 8GB of RAM in the 2016 models. Apple could upgrade the two current models to 16GB RAM and keep a 8GB option as a lower-priced model. What will the new MacBook 2017 look like? Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won't be seeing huge physical changes in 2017. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to sit alongside the Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Apple seems intent on marketing the MacBook alongside the iPhone and iPad, given the matching colour choices. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don't expect that to change dramatically in future. New MacBook 2017 features: Bigger Screen One possible change that we might see concerns the screen size. At present the MacBook is available in one size: 12 inches, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that a 15-inch model will be unveiled later this year. In a research note Kuo mentions a 15in MacBook that he believes will go into production in quarter four of 2017. However, this model is likely to be a MacBook Pro as it is said to feature 32GB RAM, so is definitely not the MacBook. Nevertheless, adding a bigger model to the range would make sense if Apple is planning to phase out the MacBook Air. Then Apple would offer 13in and 15in MacBook Pro models as well as 12in and 15in MacBook models (or perhaps 12in and 14in MacBook models as it used to do). New MacBook 2017 specs: Ports Will the new MacBook support Thunderbolt? When the MacBook launched in 2015 it featured USB Type-C and little else. While USB Type-C now supports Thunderbolt type 3 (which as exactly the same port), this early port didn't. Described by many as the one port to rule them all, the USB Type-C port and the Thunderbolt 3 port is identical, so any device using either standard can be plugged into it. Rather than suggesting that USB-C means death to Thunderbolt, it rather suggests that the standard has been given new life, indeed, now in addition to the MacBook Pro, many PCs support Thunderbolt too. There's good reason to support Thunderbolt 3. The standard allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of Thunderbolt 2 (and it's backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 2). Whether a MacBook user really needs Thunderbolt is another question though, with it being a standard utilised in video production and other high power applications.  Nevertheless, we expect that the new MacBook will feature the new USB Type-C port and therefore it will support Thunderbolt 3. Given Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since Thunderbolt's introduction in 2011 it is unlikely to fall out of favour with the company. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. Another reason Apple could turn it's back on Thunderbolt is if it stopped using Intel processors in its Macs. Intel is the company behind Thunderbolt and it requires an Intel processor to work... It's not a completely crazy idea, there have been rumours that Apple could ditch Intel in favour of its own chip production. Indeed, the company is already said to be working on its own chips with ARM, these chips would take care of certain functions, just like the Apple T1 chip in the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does. New MacBook 2017 specs: LTE Will the 2017 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if this patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satellite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it would tie the user down to a particular carrier.  New MacBook 2017 features: Keyboard Will the 2017 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? According to a 9to5Mac report in October 2016, Apple has been in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. New MacBook 2017 features: Trackpad Will the 2017 MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if another patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was approved in May 2016, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad. Thinking of buying a Mac? Read our Which Mac? Best Mac buyers guide.

The company has historically used these events to forecast its performance over the next few years and is riding high after the successful launch of Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5. Investors, however, have been jittery about the manufacturer’s stock performance so far this year and AMD was also looking to calm the waters as it rolls out new hardware. We’ve known the codename for AMD’s Ryzen server CPUs, Naples, but the company unveiled the actual brand name today. Henceforth, AMD’s server CPUs will be sold under the Epyc brand. It’s pronounced like the ordinary word, and as brand names go…maybe it’ll grow on people? That’s pretty much the best we’ve got right now. Opteron was a stronger product name in our personal opinion, but ultimately, customers aren’t going to care what it’s called, they’ll care how it performs. One point AMD made from the beginning of the event is that it focused on data centers when it brought Zen to market. We haven’t seen much in the way of server benchmarks on the core yet, but Ryzen 5 and 7 have been at their strongest when competing against Intel in workstation workloads like video editing and 3D rendering. Server workloads tend to be their own unique animal, but AMD enjoyed tremendous success with Opteron when it aimed Athlon 64 at the data center first, consumer workloads second. It’s not surprising to see company doubling down on this strategy again. Diving into data centers AMD’s argument for its own reentry into the data center acknowledges that the company’s market share is effectively 0 percent today. The company’s position is that while it’s been driven out of the market in recent years, it has previously established its chops as a provider of server solutions from single-socket blade servers to multi-socket systems. The company’s Epyc processors will offer up to 32 cores with 128 lanes of PCI Express 3.0 connectivity and eight memory channels. This combination of massive memory bandwidth and core counts could give AMD a leg up on Intel in three key areas. First, AMD can offer an enormous amount of memory bandwidth on a single-socket system with all eight of its memory channels. Intel, in contrast, is limited to just four channels. Granted, Intel’s memory controller efficiency might prove to be higher than AMD’s, but eight channels is hard to argue with, particularly in a one-socket system, and the two-socket comparison is pretty strongly tilted for AMD. Second, AMD is purposefully eschewing Intel’s habit of locking off certain capabilities to specific SKUs. Intel’s Xeon lines are subdivided by capability — some SKUs are for single-socket systems, some support two sockets, some range up to four sockets. AMD is simply declaring that all versions of all Epyc chips will have the same I/O, the same memory channels, and the same capabilities. Third, AMD wants to position Epyc as an ideal match for machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. To that end, it’s built a single-socket CPU with enough I/O connectivity to handle multiple Radeon Instinct cards. AMD noted that in other servers, customers are required to buy multi-socket systems simply to have enough connectivity to run a full complement of GPUs in them, as shown above. The 128 lanes of PCI Express connectivity that Epyc offers, in contrast, can drive six cards (16 lanes each) from one socket, with 32 lanes of PCI Express 3.0 left over for intra-chip communication. One point of clarification here: Unlike Intel, which offers 40 PCI Express 3.0 lanes in a single socket and 80 lanes in a dual socket, AMD offers 128 lanes in both a 1S and 2S configuration. In the two-socket system, 64 lanes of PCIe 3.0 are dedicated to intra-chip communication, with each CPU offering 64 lanes of chipset I/O. It’s going to take time for AMD to build any kind of market share in server, where it’s basically starting from scratch, but the company seemed bullish on the prospects for its CPU architecture and where Zen will take it in the data center space. But the company appears determined to retake share in a market where its 1S and 2S platforms are going to compare quite well against what Intel is fielding. If Naples is as strong in server workloads as Ryzen has been in workstation and desktop work, Intel could have a serious fight on its hands. AMD’s new platform could also win fans from companies building deep learning and AI platforms that want to field the maximum number of cards per socket without paying a premium for multi-socket solutions.

In addition to the ongoing CPU war between AMD and Intel, and a GPU showdown between AMD and NVIDIA, we're going to witness a mobile computing scuffle between Apple and Microsoft. This will take place starting in June when Apple will reportedly introduce upgraded 12-inch MacBook and MacPro laptops with faster processors. Both the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro family are getting bumped up to Kaby Lake, which is Intel's latest processor architecture. As it stands, Apple's 12-inch MacBook and MacBook models feature CPUs based on Intel's previous generation Skylake architecture underneath the hood. By bumping up to Kaby Lake, Apple's laptops will see better performance and might also see longer battery life.   Apple also considered updating its 13-inch MacBook Air, but despite being a bit long in the tooth at this point, it continues to sell really well. That being the case, Apple is seemingly content to leave well enough alone. Part of the motivation with these upgrades is to remain competitive with Microsoft and its newly introduced Surface Laptop, a sleek system with a 13.5-inch PixelSense display and Kaby Lake underneat the hood. The Surface Laptop also sports up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. When unveiling the Surface Laptop, Microsoft noted that it's thinner than the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, faster than either system, and offers superior battery life. While the Surface Laptop presents a viable alternative to the MacBook Air, there seems to be optimism from Apple that refreshing its 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro models could limit the Surface Laptop's appeal. Whether or not that is truly the case remains to be seen. Apple's bread and butter continues to be its iPhone line, though it still rakes in billions of dollars from its Mac products. Specifically, it collected $5.8 billion in revenue from Mac sales during the second quarter of 2017. That works out to around 11 percent of Apple's total revenue. Look for the upgraded 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro models to debut at Apple's WWDC event in June.

Shares of AMD plummeted 12%, or $1.55 per share, on Wednesday after the chipmaker gave earnings guidance that largely fell short of analysts' expectations in a meeting with analysts. Shares had risen about 11% on Tuesday.  AMD said it expects to see earnings of more than 75 cents per share by 2020, as well as low double digit revenue growth and 34% gross margins in 2017. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients on Wednesday that he believes most analysts were guiding for EPS of more than $1 by 2018, so AMD's forecast was likely viewed as disappointing by most. "Perhaps they are being conservative (this might be frankly wise; we remember well the negative pre-announcement that followed only a few weeks after the last analyst day)," Rasgon wrote. "But so far they have yet to demonstrate any inflection vs. expectations (the tone of the day was perhaps hopeful, but not certainly bold)." The semiconductor giant also declined to comment on reports of a licensing agreement reached with Intel that would give it access to AMD's graphics intellectual properties. Intel may be looking to work with AMD because its seven-year licensing agreement with Nvidia (NVDA) ended in March. But Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees said on Wednesday that she doesn't think the deal will come to fruition. Van Hees on Wednesday downgraded AMD's stock to Hold from Buy, citing the company's in-line long-term financial model. "We believe with Intel having 106,000 employees vs. AMD's 8,200 (as of December 2016) and rights in perpetuity (i.e. forever) to every one of Nvidia's GPU patents...that Intel does not need AMD's GPU IP and think it's very unlikely Intel will strike a licensing deal with AMD," Van Hees explained.  Other analysts weren't as deterred by the earnings forecast, however, believing that AMD's strong product pipeline could lead to earnings upside and higher gross margin targets in the near term. AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the company's upcoming Epyc CPU, aimed at unseating Intel's controlling hold on data centers, a market that Su described as being "the single biggest growth opportunity in chips." Epyc is expected to be released in June.  The company also provided some benchmarks on how its Ryzen desktop products have been shipping since being launched in March, a product that Rasgon believes will help AMD re-enter the premium market and expand its margins.  "While skepticism around AMD to execute will and should remain, we have all seen the leverage a model can have if the company begins to show success in the data center, both on the GPU, as well as the server side," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava. "Additionally, we believe there is a high likelihood that the company has additional IP licensing opportunities in the pipeline that could potentially materialize and that are not captured in the long-term EPS target."

Putin's press conference came amid controversy surrounding Trump's alleged disclosure of classified information to Russian officials last week.  Putin said the transcript could be provided, "if the US administration finds it appropriate," CNN reported. Read: Trump Denies Sharing Classified Intel To Russians In A Series Of Tweets Just a day after the Washington Post claimed Trump disclosed classified intel in a White House meeting about a planned Islamic State group (ISIS) operation, the New York Times claimed the information allegedly discussed came from Israel. On Tuesday, Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke over a phone call for over 20 minutes. However, officials claimed that there was no discussion of classified information during the call. Senior officials told Haaretz Tuesday night that Trump and Netanyahu talked about the upcoming Israel visit of the U.S. president.  Trump made the phone call to Netanyahu soon after talking with Jordan's King Abdullah II, after which the White House had released a statement. However, the call with Netanyahu was not publicized either by the White House or the Prime Minister's Office. Haaretz reported that Netanyahu's office confirmed the phone call took place. "The conversation dealt with a few issues that needed to be concluded regarding President Trump's visit to Israel," Haaretz quoted an anonymous source. Regarding the allegations in the New York Times report, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer said in an e-mailed statement: "Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump."  White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, refused to comment on whether Israel is the source of the classified information Trump is alleged to have shared with the Russian officials. However, he offered appreciation at the ambassador's comment on the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Spicer said during the press conference: "We appreciate the strong relationship that we have with Israel with respect to intelligence-sharing, and hope to continue to grow that bond.  But I'm not going to comment on specifically where it came from." On Tuesday, Trump defended himself over the alleged disclosure of classified intel saying that he shared information related to "terrorism" and "airline flight safety." On Monday, the Washington Post reported Trump did not disclose the exact source used for the intel, but he provided “code-word information,” apparently connected to an ISIS plot related to the use of laptops on board passenger aircrafts. Following the Post's report, the White House rejected the claims, with H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, saying the president and Russian foreign minister “reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation.” "The story that came out tonight as reported is false," McMaster told reporters at the White House Monday. "At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. I was in the room. It didn't happen." Meanwhile, Trump drew strong condemnation from Democrats as well as some Republican lawmakers.  "The disclosure of highly classified information has the potential to jeopardize sources and to discourage our allies from sharing future information vital to our security," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said. The president and the White House continue to deny the allegations. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Take That, Intel: AMD Unveils 16-core Ryzen ‘Threadripper’ Enthusiast CPU Take That, Intel: AMD Unveils 16-core Ryzen ‘Threadripper’ Enthusiast CPU By Joel Hruska on May 17, 2017 at 7:39 am Comment AMD’s Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors have already punched holes in Intel’s product lines. The Ryzen 5 1600X is a six-core / 12-thread CPU at $250, compared with over $400 for its Intel counterpart, and the eight-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 1800X ($500) compares well with Intel’s Core i7-6900K at $1,100. AMD’s financial analyst day yesterday wasn’t just a discussion of data center and deep learning workloads — enthusiasts got some serious love as well. Now, AMD is prepping a new, workstation-class CPU to take Intel on at the top of its market. Ryzen Threadripper will debut on an all-new motherboard platform with support for up to 16 cores, 32 threads, four memory channels, and (we suspect) a price point that’ll give Intel heartburn once again. In fact, some of the rumors we’ve heard about Skylake-X, such as Intel’s rumored 12-core Core i9, make sense if evaluated against Threadripper and AMD’s competitive positioning at this price point. With that said, AMD is probably going to play with luxury pricing a bit more this time around. Desktop users who need 32 threads of CPU performance are few and far between, and the workstation users who can make use of a chip like this are more likely to have deep pockets. This also isn’t going to be a gaming play — or at least, not primarily a gaming play. Rumors also suggest a 3.1GHz base clock and 3.6GHz boost with a 150W TDP. That’s pretty reasonable for a 16-core chip, and while we’re not confirming that clock speed, anything from 2.8GHz – 3.2GHz base clock would be reasonable. AMD’s SenseMI technology may give the company more freedom to turbo boost the core depending on how many threads are in any given workload. The days of paying $1,800 for a ten-core CPU are numbered. Beyond that, we’ll have to wait and see how everything lands, and what the capabilities of this new high-end enthusiast platform are. Chips like the Threadripper are important primarily as halo products — they may not sell in large quantities, but they demonstrate the capabilities of the platform and set consumer expectations for what lower-end hardware can provide. From that perspective, AMD’s decision to make a play for the highest end of the market is noteworthy for what it reveals about the company’s self-perception. When AMD revived the FX brand for its Bulldozer processors, its marketing department was writing checks that the engineers couldn’t cash. Now, AMD is aggressively taking a leadership position in defining what kind of CPU performance consumers will be able to buy at a given price point. Intel will answer that challenge — if there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that Intel won’t sit back and risk AMD impinging on its data center and enthusiast gaming markets without a fight. But at least for now, AMD is enthusiastically taking the lead.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Adam Patrick Murray More like this Is MacBook Pro the future of the Apple desktop? Apple ARM’s for battle When will Apple put Intel’s Kaby Lake chips inside new Macs? Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple plans to announce upgraded Mac notebooks with Kaby Lake processors at WWDC 2017, a report claims. Regular readers will know we’ve been expecting Apple to migrate to the new chip, but Intel has only just begun shipping suitable processors, hence the delay. What is Kaby Lake? Kaby Lake is the seventh generation of the Core series chips. It’s a 14-nanometer processor which has been designed to deliver high quality graphics without a GPU. The smaller processor die and GPU advantages should make for battery life/performance advantages. Other enhancements within these chips include: Fully integrated support for USB-C Generation 2, (G2 USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3 support) Native HDCP 2.2 support 4K video support. We had hoped Apple would stow one of these new processors inside of the recently-introduced MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models, but this didn’t happen. It has previously been reported that Intel could only ship suitable versions of these processors starting earlier this year. Upgrading the range Speaking earlier this year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Apple would update its MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of desktop-class RAM. He promises this would be “the most significantly redesigned product this year”.  The analyst also said these processors would be introduced in new model MacBooks. Bloomberg seems to have confirmed the speculation, reporting that Apple will introduce a new MacBook Pro model with Kaby Lake, along with Kaby Lake powered MacBooks.  In a surprising twist, it looks like the company has decided to keep the MacBook Air in its line-up. “The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong,” it said. It makes sense to predict USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 will be deployed in these machines, so it’s a shame if you failed to exploit Apple’s generous USB-C accessories deal while it was available. New Mac Pros aren’t expected until 2018 at the earliest, with an upgraded iMac scheduled for before then. Good for business? There’s little doubt these powerful new Macs will deliver the kind of horsepower professional users need. At the high end, Kaby Lake MacBook Pro models will be able to handle anything the most demanding user wants to throw at them. They will also like it that the Touchbar on the MacBook Pro is a real productivity boost. (I use it a lot when working with Microsoft Office applications, as the system makes it so much easier to get to the tools I need.) Lower down the scale, the upgraded MacBook Air will provide enterprise users with a compelling alternative to Surface devices. Not only will these be compatible with existing iOS deployments, but they will provide all the power and features of a notebook Mac – including the capacity to run a real version of Windows, and to run Windows apps that are not made available through Microsoft’s store, such as internally-developed enterprise software. Holding the fort Apple’s apparent decision to introduce these new Macs at WWDC is probably intended to reassure developers that the company remains deeply invested in the Mac. It last introduced new Macs to WWDC in 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and an updated MacBook Air. WWDC 2017 seems set to be a busy one. We expect the company to demonstrate new versions of iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. We also anticipate numerous big announcements around services, Apple Pay and AR at the show, which kicks off with a keynote June 5.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffDems walk tightrope on impeachment Intel panels: House, Senate Russia probes to proceed Special prosecutor appointment gets bipartisan praise MORE (D-Calif.) on Wednesday warned that Democrats should not rush into impeachment talks despite swirling controversies around President Trump. "That's not something that we should be rushing into or rushing to suggest,” Schiff told CNN’s “New Day.”  Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the impeachment process would be “a wrenching experience” for the country, advocating instead to “get to the bottom” of what took place before such talks come about. "What was the president's intent? Was he trying to shutdown a legitimate prosecution? Was he doing it because he was worried the trail may lead back to him? These are profound questions we need to answer before we get too far down the path of what are the consequences if the proof turns out to be there.” ADVERTISEMENT The New York Times on Tuesday reported that Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to ends the FBI’s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, citing a memo written by Comey. Trump fired Comey last week and acknowledged days later it was because he wanted the FBI to end its probe into Russian election interference. The move has stirred impeachment calls over possible obstruction of justice. The White House, which denies the contents of Comey's memo, has pointed to the testimony acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe gave before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week, when he said “there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.” Other Democrats, however, are saying Trump is in impeachment territory.

Only yesterday, BMW announced a partnership with Delphi for the development of autonomous driving systems, joining its existing deals with Intel and Mobileye. Only Intel and Mobileye were already working with Delphi on another projects of their own. Oh, and did we mention Mobileye is owned by Intel? You see? It's like a South American soap opera where it's almost impossible to keep track of all the connections between the characters. Some characters, though, have a greater importance than others, and if Tesla and Uber were two join hands in the quest for self-driving cars, that surely wouldn't have gone unnoticed. Two of the most resounding names in their respective area of influence coming together would have been the headline of the month ("of the year" would be pushing it). According to an excerpt from a book called "Wild Ride" written by Adam Lashinsky (of "Fortune" magazine), we very nearly had that last year. The fragment, as pointed out by Bloomberg, quotes a conversation between Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO, and Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, as recalled by the former. “I said, ‘Look man, we should partner.’ Elon spent the rest of the call convincing me that it’s too far out, and it’s not realistic, that I should just stick to what we do best and be focused, or I’m going to f--- it all up. That’s when I knew Tesla was competing.” Indeed, hearing Musk say something is too far out (particularly something so not far out) is a clear indication that the man is lying. After all, it's the same guy that's talking about traveling at 1,000 mph and going to Mars. And sure enough, only a few days later, Musk published the Tesla Master Plan part Deux, in which he refers to the Tesla Network. The Bloomberg piece notes that, according to "a person close to Musk," the Tesla CEO admitted to declining the partnership but insists he never tried to convince Kalanick from venturing into the autonomous driving business. Uber is now working with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz on developing the self-driving technology it so desperately needs to stay relevant, assuming its adoption is indeed imminent at some point in the future. However, it might be up for a bumpy ride considering the lawsuit filed by Google claiming Uber's program took advantage of some stolen trade secrets.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kulbhushan Jadhav Kapil Mishra Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Donald Trump News Technology News Smart bangle delivers pregnancy tips to Asian wrists Shares1 Wed, 17 May 2017-06:25pm , Reuters By Rina Chandran MUMBAI, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A high-tech bangle that alerts pregnant women to toxic fumes and issues audio tips promises to boost maternal health in South Asia, as smart devices deliver ever more services to remote communities. The colourful, lightweight bangle also bypasses phone-owning men - feeding information directly to expectant mothers - and is built to withstand the rigours of village life. "In rural areas, mobile connectivity - and mobile access for women - is an issue, as phones are controlled by men," said Pavel Hoq, chief operating officer at Intel Social Business, which developed the new device. "While we had also developed mobile apps for maternal health, we realised a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Made of durable plastic, the bangle is water-resistant and has a long-lasting battery that does not require charging throughout the duration of a pregnancy. Nor does it not need an internet connection to work. Coel, or carbon monoxide exposure limiter, was created by Intel Social Business Ltd., a joint venture of Intel Corporation, and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust. The device can be recharged and reused many times, Hoq said. NEW JEWELS It will join a woman's regular array of bracelets, with most married women in South Asia wearing bangles made of glass, plastic or gold. The decorative finish differentiates the bangle from many other wrist-worn fitness devices or smart watches. Coel, which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor. An alarm also sounds if high levels of carbon monoxide fumes are generated when cooking with firewood, charcoal or dung, warning the wearer to move away. Every day, about 830 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly a third of these deaths are in South Asia. Maternal mortality is higher among women living in rural areas and poorer communities, where access to healthcare is often forbidden or curtailed due to a lack of female medics. In Bangladesh, where more than 70 percent of babies are born at home, about 5,000 maternal deaths and nearly 77,000 neonatal deaths are reported annually, according to WHO. In neighbouring India, where Coel has been tested in Uttar Pradesh - among the poorest states in the country - maternal and neonatal deaths are nearly 10 times higher. At the same time, wearable devices including smart watches, shoes and glasses, are increasingly used for remote healthcare, such as to monitor a patient's cholesterol or insulin levels. It is a growing market: about 2.5 million such wearable devices were sold in India last year, most priced under $50, according to research firm International Data Corporation. Coel, which will be priced initially at about $12-$15, will be sold in India and Bangladesh first, then in Nepal, said Hoq. "Easy access to knowledge is crucial in these countries, particularly for first-time mothers," he said. "We want this device to be a tool of empowerment for women."

Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system. At last year’s conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall. For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast: Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Mark Walton (UK) - May 17, 2017 12:44 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 129 Share this story 16-core, 32-thread versions of AMD Ryzen CPUs codenamed Threadripper will launch this summer, the company revealed at its Financial Analyst Day yesterday. Further ReadingRadeon Vega Frontier Edition: First AMD Vega GPU is for the prosWith one of the gnarliest CPU codenames we've ever seen, the Threadripper multicore monsters will go head to head with Intel's Broadwell-E and upcoming Skylake-E High-End Desktop (HEDT) CPUs alongside a new motherboard platform that promises expanded memory support and I/O bandwidth. That's likely to take the form of quad-channel RAM and more PCIe lanes, similar to Intel's X99 platform, but AMD is saving further details for its press conference at Computex at the end of May. In addition to Threadripper, AMD also teased Ryzen APUs that pair four cores and eight threads with a Vega-based GPU. AMD claims a "50 percent increase in CPU performance and over 40 percent better graphics performance, at half the power of its previous generation." Once again AMD is saving further details for Computex, but it noted that Ryzen APUs will appear in ultra-portables and premium 2-in-1s in the second half of 2017. Meanwhile, Ryzen Pro desktop and mobile chips, which offer "enterprise-class support and top-to-bottom manageability," will launch in H2 2017 and H1 2018 respectively. Enlarge / The Epyc chip is, er, massively epic. Finally, AMD unveiled the new Epyc (yes, really) data centre processor. Epyc is the new name for the Naples data centre SoCs that AMD announced earlier this year. Presumably the marketing department went out for a few celebratory beers after coming up with "Threadripper" before returning to work on the data centre part. Further ReadingFrom Paintbox to PC: How London became the home of Hollywood VFXThe physically massive Epyc chip sports 32 cores and 64 threads, 128 PCIe 3.0 lanes, and eight memory channels per socket for a total of 16 DDR4 channels and 32 DIMMs in a two-socket server. That's a potential maximum of 4TB of memory, which will come in handy for places like VFX render farms where a single frame of a film can consume gigabytes of memory. The launch of Threadripper follows weeks of rumours surrounding Intel's upcoming Skylake-E processors. The follow-up to Broadwell-E, Skyake-E, is rumoured to sport an all-new Core i9 moniker alongside a new X299 chipset, with the top-end Core i9-7920X part featuring 12 cores and 24 threads. Intriguingly, the rumours also point to Intel launching Kaby Lake-X processors with just four cores and eight threads in the Core i7-7740K and four-cores and no hyper-threading in the Core i7-7640K. [Update: This is probably an i5 rather than an i7, but someone reporting on the rumour made a typo.] Further ReadingRyzen 5 review: AMD muscles in on Intel’s i5 sweet spot Kaby Lake-X would be similar to the Devil's Canyon chips Intel produced for its Haswell architecture, which were a refined version of existing chips. However, Kaby Lake-X is rumoured to use the new X299 chipset, which would be a dramatic change in tack for Intel. Like AMD, Intel should reveal more about its plans at Computex, which takes place in Taipei from May 30 to June 1.

Follow Us subscribe OEM UAV Survey Mapping GNSS Defense Mobile Machine Control/Ag Transportation More The Almanac Antenna Survey Buyers Guide Digital Edition Archive Events Innovation Opinions Receiver Survey Seen & Heard Upcoming GNSS satellite launches Webinars White Papers Drones swarming indoors only one highlight of AUVSI Xponential May 17, 2017  - By GPS World staff Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn 0 Comments The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International‘s annual Xponential show, which took place May 8-11 in Dallas, Texas, seemed to be at least as large as last year’s in New Orleans, Louisiana. According to the Intel CEO Brian Krzanich’s keynote address, I was among more than 7,000 attendees and 650 exhibitors. Krzanich and the Intel folks dazzled us with live indoor drone flying and a demonstration of highly detailed bridge inspection using the Intel Falcon 8+ drone. Then we had a few Shooting Star light drones flying around in a small swarm — all before the show really got cooking. Management of big data was Intel’s pitch for the keynote, but all we nav guys wanted to know was how they flew those things inside. Intel shows off its light drones in October 2016. (Source: Intel) Attempts later in the show to establish their guidance recipe were met with a wall of silence from Intel. We know both drone types carry inertial. The Falcon 8+ has three and more than one GNSS receiver, and the light drone has inertial and GNSS, but Intel’s secret is that they use “wireless.” So something to determine where they are and in relation to the inspection article, and to others in the swarm, hooked up to inertial? Intel will tell us sometime later, they say. In the meantime, Intel promoted the Falcon 8+ heavily at its booth, with its configurable payload capability. Intel indicated that it hopes also to sell light-show swarms for event providers. The show was indeed huge, and it was impossible to touch base with everyone, so in no particular order and without any leanings towards anyone, I’ll try and capture some flavor of what went down at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center at the AUVSI Xponential show. Duro – Piksi enclosure. Swift Navigation/ Carnegie Swift released the rugged Duro enclosure for its Piksi Multi dual-band GNSS receiver. It’s yellow with lots of heat fins, and looks like it would survive being driven over. With dual-frequency real-time kinematic (RTK), Swift claims an all-time low price for board-level RTK. VectorNav Based in Dallas, VectorNav took advantage of home turf with a significant presence at the show. VectorNav released a number of use-case studies to illustrate the varied customer applications for its VN series of miniature, high-performance MEMS-inertial and GPS/INS modules. Applications include: ground robotics for highly accurate, high-speed attitude data a  medium-range UAV with GPS/INS for primary navigation integrated lidar for mapping capabilities autonomous ground vehicle module waypoint navigation with a number of system functions high-precision antenna pointing camera pointing with a gyro-stabilized gimbal. Gryphon Sensors Drone detection and prevention systems had a significant presence at AUVSI. Gryphon Sensors combines radar, RF direction finding and optical sensors in a integrated “intelligent drone detection system.” Gryphon has been around for some time, using technologies from military applications to also provide vehicle-mounted drone security and UAS traffic management (UTM) capabilities. Gryphon Skylight drone security system. RF Spectrum Sensor Fortem Technologies Compact TrueView Radar Fortem has gone one step further with drone detection — its Dronehunter flies a drone within feet of an intruder, fires a net at the unwanted vehicle and takes it down. The company’s video encounter was at low altitude and the intruder was undamaged — for higher, larger vehicle take-downs, they have a net with a parachute. Other components of the system include a compact airborne radar for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) and a ground-based radar detection system. Countries Several country pavilions exhibited at the show, including China, Spain, France, UK, Denmark and Canada. Highlights included Drone Hopper, a Spanish firefighting drone concept; Chinese UAV antennas and avionics; a French “cluster” of drone-related companies; and Canada, which included a multi-rotor drone dealer and introduced the Foremost drone test range. Aeronix and Rajant Secure radios are key to any drone operations. Aeronix displayed a secure software-defined datalink product for providing data, video and voice onto and off drones. The company also introduced significant radio and interface capability for military and secure commercial operations. Rajant featured mesh radio systems, providing the wireless backbone in UAV applications in mining and on mine trucks. Once again, U.S. Department of Defense technology developed over many years has been spun off into commercial operations. Aeronix software-defined datalink. Rajant Breadcrum RJ2. Trimble It was good to see Trimble in force again at a trade show; the company had a nice booth with lots of people. We talked with Chris Wheeler about Trimble’s approach of providing an antenna with down conversion, integrated with an RTK software API on existing on-board computing hardware – it’s a good way to potentially reduce costs for UAVs. Sold through a software license, this reduced-hardware solution could be a new way to get high performance at much reduced prices for larger UAV fleets. It might be significant for lots of other OEM solutions too. AsteRx-m2 UAS receiver. Septentrio The recently released AsterRx-m2 receiver has an optional UAS interface board with record-and-store capability so that real-time images can be readily geo-coded. It directly connects to an on-board autopilot. Self-interference issues coming from existing UAV control electronics are minimized by further enhanced AIM interference mitigation processing on the –m2 receiver. NovAtel NovAtel’s military business group continues to make headway with the GAJT integrated anti-jam antenna with more than 600 sold to date. Other applications include the use of the anti-jam electronics processing solution in the GAJT anti-jam Antenna Electronics unit. If you were not convinced that these are rugged units designed for difficult outdoor applications, they were recently evaluated under firing conditions by the Canadian forces mounted on an M777C1 Howitzer — “No problem,” said Peter Soar, business development manager, Military and Defence. The anti-jam antenna electronics unit is well suited for UAV applications in signal-rich environments where GPS tracking might otherwise be untenable. The NovAtel GAJT-700ML. NovAtel’s GAJT-AE-N antenna electronics. Aspen Avionics As the FAA makes progress toward integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS), the interest in using ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance) for UAV location awareness seems to be growing. ADS-B equipment on both manned and unmanned vehicles provides an output signal containing position, velocity and altitude which can be used by other similarly equipped aircraft and terrestrial/satellite tracking systems. Aspen Avionics supplies FAA-approved ADS-B equipment for manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as approved GPS navigation receivers for selected classes of certified navigation and landing. Rockwell Collins/Harris BVLOS demonstration work under the FAA Pathfinder program with BNSF Railway has continued, with significant technical contributions by both Rockwell Collins and Harris. Monitoring and control of the UAV during inspection flights along the BNSF track test-section in Clovis, New Mexico, was achieved through the deployed Rockwell radio network and CNPC-1000 datalink transceiver installed on a Latitude Engineering UAV. Reliability is now well established, and BNSF is able to operate without visual observers during regular inspections for bad track. Latitude UAV, similar to those flown on BNSF program. Rockwell CNPC-1000 datalink. Harris has also provided extended ADS-B coverage throughout the BNSF test section and provided an aircraft-tracking feed from its FAA flight database, to ensure there are no manned aircraft conflicts during UAS track inspection flights. Insitu Insitu has conducted very successful business with military and government for many years with its ScanEagle, Blackjack and Integrator UAS. The company is now approaching the commercial world through a turnkey inspection service that it will now offer as its INEXA Solutions. The intent is not to just offer data collection by flying UAVs for customers, but to first put together the best business case, then collect and process data and deliver the information required. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin also is approaching the commercial market with a services offering: Commercial Aviation Inspection Services. LM’s UAS capability extends beyond the Stalker fixed-wing surveillance drone, the quadcopter Indago and the military-looking Fury heavy-payload fixed-wing vehicle, to include an autopilot, a vision-processing unit and a dual-sensor gimbal. The LM Hydra-Fusion Geospatial toolset provides post-processing capability for applications including construction, surveying, agricultural, inspection and tactical. AeroVironment AeroVironment is another company offering turn-key flight services, from UAS operations through to data processing and custom results. AeroVironment had two new product announcements to add to its extensive UAS capability: the Mantis electro-optical/infrared gimbal sensor suite, and the Snipe man-carried UAS. The Mantis is designed for installation on the AeroVironment Puma fixed-wing UAS to provide enhanced imaging capabilities, while the 5-ounce Snipe is small enough to be worn by an operator and can be rapidly deployed for close-in surveillance/reconnaissance. Snipe UAS. Lightweight man-carried Snipe. …And More Other news on the show floor: Airbus Aerial is being established in the U.S. and Europe to provide imagery services for commercial industries, such as insurance, agriculture, oil and gas, and utilities as well as state and local governments. Spirent promoted its GSS6450 portable GNSS record-and-playback simulator for UAV systems testing and verification. Multi-rotor drone manufacturer DraganFly indicated that it has been in the UAS business since 1998, so it has lots of capability and experience. Canadian UAV autopilot supplier MicroPilot continues to do well, and now claims to have 1,000 customers in 85 countries. Looking to future requirements for onboard systems that will make possible UAS integration into manned airspace, MicroPilot is now working toward airborne (RTCA DO-178C) software qualification. The 2017 AUVSI Exponential convention measured up to all its expectations and pre-show hype. The atmosphere was energetic and positive, with almost every booth getting the attention of attendees & the whisper of deals was everywhere in the many corridors and rooms of the huge Dallas convention center. The UAS industry didn’t only come to show off its wares, but also to do business. Several UAS flight centers were represented, each with the strong backing of its own home State and vying to attract test center users and to establish new UAS businesses. The industry is apparently ready and able to create those local jobs that have been forecast to grow out of new UAS applications. While attention has previously been on flying small UAS (sUAS, and there is now a set of FAA rules allowing controlled commercial operations to get underway, there did seem to be an growing expectation that work towards getting larger, longer endurance drones into commercial operations was coming into focus. Many fixed wing applications currently operate under FAA Certificates of Authorization (CoAs), so their scale of operations is limited. But on-going efforts to develop Sense & Avoid and BVLOS solutions are hopefully leading towards the next phase of larger UAS applications in the US National Airspace System.

We look at the best devices in the market   Subscribe to our newsletter. Abhijit Ahaskar Lenovo Legion Y720. While the PC market has been shrinking overall, PC gaming has been growing. According to numbers released in January by Jon Peddie Research, a consultancy firm, the worldwide PC gaming market exceeded $30 billion (around Rs1.9 trillion) in 2016 and is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through to the year 2019. The study attributes this to an entrenched PC gaming culture, and the absence of significant console traction in the Asia-Pacific region. India is one of the fastest growing markets in the entry-level (sub-$1,000) gaming segment, while North America and Western Europe lead in the high-end segment (over $1,800). PCs are no longer the bulky rigs they used to be a few years ago; both PCs and laptops are more powerful today, with better graphics and components . Here are some of the best Windows 10-based gaming laptops and desktops. Lenovo Ideacentre Y710 Cube PC Lenovo Ideacentre Y710 Cube PC’s design is inspired by a spaceship. $1,299 (around Rs83,135) This gaming desktop’s design is inspired by a spaceship. With a red and black colour scheme, it is quite compact— but don’t let the size fool you. It weighs 7.4kg. At its heart is Intel’s 3.4 GHz 6th Generation Core i7 6700 chip with 16 GB RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8 GB) graphics. It has 256 GB SSD and 2 TB HDD. It supports 4K resolution for TVs and monitors, and is powerful enough for VR gaming. Asus ROG G501VW Asus ROG G501VW’s biggest draw is the 15.6-inch 4K display (3,840x2,160p). Rs99,990 At 20.6mm and 2.06kg, the Asus ROG G501VW is one of the slimmest and lightest gaming notebooks we have come across. For a slim notebook, its vitals are pretty powerful. It has Intel’s 6th Generation Core i7 6700 processor with 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 960M (4 GB) graphics and 512 GB SSD. Its biggest draw is the 15.6-inch 4K display (3,840x2,160p), a rarity at this price point. Asus has used two independent fans and copper heat sinks to keep the device cool under stress. Lenovo Legion Y720 Lenovo Legion Y720 offers 128 GB SSD to boot-up apps faster and 1 TB for your game and other files. Rs149,990 The Legion Y720 belongs to Lenovo’s new breed of powerful gaming notebooks. It is driven by the powerful Intel 7th Generation Core i7 7700 processor with 8 GB RAM and Nvidia GeForce 1060M (6 GB) graphics. It offers 128 GB SSD to boot-up apps faster and 1 TB for your game and other files. The two JBL speakers are placed on either side of the hinges. The 15.6-inch IPS display has a resolution of 1,920x1,080p, while the anti-glare coating reduces eye stress. It is 29mm thick and weighs 3.2kg. Alienware Alpha PC Alienware Alpha is a powerful gaming desktop with the form factor of a gaming console. $799 Alienware Alpha is a powerful gaming desktop with the form factor of a gaming console. It is just 55mm tall, 200mm wide and weighs 1.8kg. It has a minimalistic design and most of the connectors are placed at the back to minimize clutter. It is powered by Intel’s 6th Generation Core i5 processor, has 8 GB RAM and uses Nvidia GeForce GTX960 (4 GB) graphics. It offers 1 TB HDD and comes with Alienware’s multimedia keyboard and gaming mouse. Acer Predator 15 G9 593 The Predator G9 593 tips the scales at 3.7kg, so it’s hefty. Rs1.59 lakh The Predator G9 593 is a typical gaming notebook, made of glass and plastic fibre. It tips the scales at 3.7kg, so it’s hefty. The thick form factor can be attributed to the presence of a removable fan, Predator FrostCore, for better cooling performance. The main cooling fans are made of ultra-thin aero-blade metal that keeps both heat and dust at bay. The notebook is powered by Intel’s 7th Generation Core i7 7700 processor with 16 GB RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX1060 (6 GB) graphics. It comes with 15.6-inch Full HD (1,920x1,080p) display. It has ample muscle power to run most existing and forthcoming games. *Prices may vary.

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds BMW, Delphi, Intel, and Mobileye Form Autonomous Driving Super-Group   17 May 2017, 9:59 UTC · by Vlad Mitrache / Home / News / Industry Forget about EVs - the real race in the automotive world right now is that to develop a system capable of driving a car around on its own with minimal or no driver intervention at all. We see partnerships being stricken all the time, resulting in a closer than ever tie between the car and the tech industries. The two are so intertwined right now that it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins anymore. The landscape is also changing all the time. Up to last summer, Mobileye used to be the main partner of Tesla's Autopilot program, but the Californian company decided to part ways in the wake of the Joshua Brown incident (even though it has always denied a direct connection for its decision with the crash). Since then, the Israeli firm has been acquired by chip-making giant Intel, but continued to develop its work further in the autonomous driving field. In July 2016, both Intel and Mobileye announced their partnership with BMW in the development of a "scalable [self-driving] architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers." Now, Delphi is officially becoming directly involved in the other three companies' efforts to develop a self-driving vehicle by 2021. The parts specialist is seen as "a development partner and system integrator" for the autonomous driving platform which, the four hope, will be of interest to other companies as well. The statement released makes it very clear that the engagement between Delphi and BMW, Intel, and Mobileye is not exclusive, meaning it is free to pursue similar projects with other brands or groups as well. “This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale. Our close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success,” said Kevin Clark, President and CEO of Delphi. We remind you that earlier this month Delphi announced it would split the company in two with the new branch to focus solely on the development of electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology. This new partnership can only underline the increased weight this part of the company's business has and give us an idea of where things are going. bmw vision next 100 BMW Delphi Mobileye autonomous self-driving partnerhip load press release   Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 An Ode to Embracing the Metric System DIY: How to Setup An Email Address In a BMW - An Easy Guide Five Lightest All-Wheel-Drive SUVs Available In Europe in 2017 The End of Sedans is Nigh!

Sources told the site the MacBook Pro range will "get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel", while an update to the 12ins MacBook is expected to house "a faster Intel chip". The MacBook Air "could get a faster processor as well", reports The Verge, although there's no mention whether Apple's cheapest laptop will be fitted with a higher resolution screen like the rest of the MacBook range. The Cupertino company faced criticisms after launching its radical MacBook Pro with Touch Bar last year, with Gismodo saying the decision to fit year-old Intel processors into their new device was "astounding and annoying". The Verge says "it’s encouraging to see that Apple is taking at least some of the criticism of its latest MacBook Pros to heart and updating the laptop line with Intel’s newest processors". There's no word of the company's desktop range, which haven't been updated since October 2015, adds MacRumors.  Apple's cheapest desktop, the Mac Mini, was last updated at the end of 2014. However, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, told TechCrunch the company was "in the process of what we call completely rethinking the Mac Pro". Although he did not disclose when a new version of the firm's flagship desktop would appear, he confirmed to TechCrunch the final product would "take longer than this year" to develop, meaning it won't appear at next month's conference.

Three New Laptops Planned To Fight Back Against Microsoft 17 May 2017, 7:13 am EDT By Aaron Mamiit Tech Times Apple is planning to unveil three new MacBook models at the upcoming WWDC 2017, according to a Bloomberg report. Among the planned updates are a new 13-inch MacBook Air, which has not been redesigned for almost seven years.  ( Apple ) Apple is planning to unveil MacBook upgrades at the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June, according to the latest report related to the annual event. So far, there have been several product announcements tied to WWDC 2017, but the new MacBook models could be the most important for Apple, as it moves to fight back against tougher competition from rivals such as Microsoft. Apple To Unveil Three New MacBook Models According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is planning to announce three new MacBook models at WWDC 2017. Apple is said to be developing a new 12-inch MacBook, which has not been updated since spring 2016, powered by a faster Intel chip. While specific details on what else will change with the laptop is not yet known, possible additions include a second USB-C port and the usage of the better keyboard on the recent MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro, meanwhile, will also receive a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, as the laptops were shipped with Skylake CPUs. In addition to improved CPU options, a new MacBook Pro may also offer increased RAM and bigger storage. The 13-inch MacBook Air, the cheapest MacBook of Apple that continues to sell well despite not having been redesigned for almost seven years, could also receive an update, Bloomberg's sources said. This comes as a surprise, as Apple itself said that the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with no touch bar was positioned as the replacement for the MacBook Air. If Apple does indeed refresh the 13-inch MacBook Air, fans of the laptop should not expect dramatic additions such as a Retina Display or a touch bar. An updated MacBook Air would likely only mostly receive maintenance upgrades with newer processor options. Both Apple and Intel have declined to comment on the rumors. The Importance Of MacBooks To Apple Apple's Mac business only accounts for 11 percent of Apple's annual sales compared to the iPhone division, which rakes in almost two-thirds of the amount. However, Macs and MacBooks are important for Apple to retain business with creative industries and loyal users. The reported upgrades will show that Apple remains committed to the MacBook line of products, even if the updates do not present massive changes. New MacBook models would also help Apple to be better equipped at dealing with tougher competition in the computer industry. Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled the Surface Laptop, with the new Windows 10 S operating system and considered a MacBook Air killer. Apple Products At WWDC 2017 While the focus of the annual Worldwide Developers Conference is traditionally on software, Apple has used the event to announce new products. This year, there have so far been many reports on new devices that Apple is planning to unveil at WWDC. It has been rumored that Apple will be announcing a premium smart speaker, powered by digital assistant Siri and coming with a touchscreen, to challenge the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. Apple may also unveil a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC 2017, according to famed Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo. The announcement is expected at the annual event because Apple is believed to be ramping up production of the device by the end of the current quarter.

(Bloomberg/David Paul Morris) Apple Inc. plans to announce an update to its laptop lineup at an annual conference for app developers in early June, a move that could help offset new competition from Microsoft Corp. as well as declining iPad sales. Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. Read also: Microsoft says cyberattack should be wake up call for governments The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future. Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system. At last year’s conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall.

El Reg thinks these are Skylake mills. There are four Xeon SP brand variants in reverse order of performance: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. Platinum version of Xeon SP They offer a new core, cache, on-die interconnects, memory controller and optimised features for compute (duh!), storage and networking. Intel reckons they are suited for, amongst other things, the demands of big-data, and in-memory workloads. At the SAP Sapphire NOW event, Intel said SAP had certified HANA to support up to 6x greater system memory - for OLAP Processing - on the new Intel platform for 4- or 8-socket configurations over the representative installed base of systems available four years ago. That’s up to 3TB of memory for 4-socket systems and 6TB for 8-socket ones. The "representative installed base" means Xeon E7 CPUs with support for 0.5TB to 1TB (8-socket) of DRAM. It’s a whacking great jump in maximum memory. Optane Intel also demonstrated 3D XPoint Optane persistent memory in a DIMM form factor at the SAP event. Use of this memory in SAP HANA systems should increase system performance further, by bringing data within the low-latency Optane access arena from the longer latency NAND drive storage tier. Intel said its Optane memory will be available in 2018 as part of a Cascade Lake refresh of Xeon SP. We understood Kaby Lake server CPUs with 200 Series chipsets would support Optane memory. Now we know about Cascade Lake, which is a Xeon supporting Optane NVDIMMs, and think the refresh could refer to a Skylake SP to Kaby Lake upgrade. We’re told software developers can accelerate their readiness for Intel persistent memory today with the libraries and tools at www.pmem.io. ® * Based on SAP HANA internal S-OLTP workload (internal testing) with the baseline config being: one-node, 4S Intel Xeon processor E7-8890 v4 with 1,024 GB total memory on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 12 SP1 vs estimates based on SAP internal testing on one-node, 4S Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family system.

AMD's master plan: Crack the data center via its EPYC server processor, simplify architecture with its GPUs and then grab machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | May 17, 2017 -- 10:00 GMT (03:00 PDT) | Topic: Cloud AMD is plotting a June launch for its EPYC server processor, formerly code-named Naples, as it aims to become a data center leader to go along with its desktop and graphics chips. For AMD, the data center is it's most promising--and tough to crack--market. Intel dominates the data center, but AMD is betting its architecture and a move to software defined approaches can give it momentum. Now AMD's immediate future is tied to attacking the PC market with its Ryzen processors and Vega graphics processors. Vega will also be a data center play as AMD outlined machine learning benchmarks. The catch for AMD in the GPU market is that Nvidia has also staked out the artificial intelligence and machine learning use cases. Cloud v. Data Center: Key trends for IT decision-makers Infographic: Cloud use is growing, but the data center isn't dead yet Has IT's default setting switched from data center to cloud? Understanding the pros and cons of five different cloud types Multi-cloud is a messy reality, but there's hope Six reasons why companies hang on to their data centers Five major pitfalls to avoid in a cloud migration How hybrid cloud is strengthening Fitness First Add it up and AMD runs into Intel in two areas (PCs and data centers) and Nvidia in the other (GPUs). Why could the data center market be different this time? Here's AMD's argument: EPYC delivers the Zen x86 processing engine and can scale to 32 cores. AMD will have one-socket servers, but aim to use EPYC in two-socket too. This combination will offer better performance, flexibility and ultimately total cost of ownership. In addition, 91 percent of the x86 server market is single or dual socket based on IDC data. 8 channels of memory per EPYC device. High-performance virtualization. Software defined data centers mean EPYC could play in the storage, server and networking markets. Dedicated security hardware. And a server market driven by cloud providers who are into experimentation with everything from ARM systems, do open hardware approaches to newfangled designs. Dropbox was cited as a customer evaluating EPYC processors. At AMD's financial analyst day, Forrest Norrod, general manager of enterprise, embedded and semi-custom products, highlighted the following slides: Now you can see where this is headed. AMD is hoping to go after machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. Should EPYC be integrated well with AMD's Radeon GPUs it can have a stack that can compete with an Intel-Nvidia real-world combination. See: AMD's Ryzen 5 threatens Intel's grip on the mainstream PC market | AMD meets Q1 expectations due to strong demand for Ryzen CPUs | AMD unleashes high-performance Ryzen 5 desktop chips | AMD's new Vega graphics architecture goes far beyond gaming | AMD prepares for a datacenter comeback with 'Naples' Will this master plan work? Who knows. But one thing is clear. Enterprises and cloud giants want more suppliers to drive costs down. If EPYC can win over a few big names with solid use cases, AMD can gain some traction simply because tech buyers will want a counterweight to Intel and increasingly Nvidia. And AMD is the only provider of high-performance compute and graphics processors.

While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported.  The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor.  Apple last updated the 12in MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold colour option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future.  Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system.  At last year’s conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Kremlin says Ukraine's accusation of cyberattack ‘groundless’ Facebook faces EU fine over misleading WhatsApp data The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Stamping their 100th year mark Check out Sungai Buloh's Valley of Hope ‘I thought Balamurugan was faking it,’ says cop advertisement Latest News Trexit?

Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015.

From Tom Lehrer’s ballad of Wernher von Braun From MAD to Madness: Inside Pentagon Nuclear War Planning is the enlightening memoir by Paul Johnstone, a man who worked in the “department” that decided where “they” would come down.  Johnstone labored there during WWII and then from 1949 to 1969, the initial period of the Cold War and the period covered by this book.  On August 29, 1949, the USSR caught the world flat-footed when it set off its first nuclear bomb.  Thus began the years when frightened children scrambled under their desks by day and were tormented with mushroom cloud nightmares by night.  The U.S. and the USSR stood on The Brink over the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Berlin Crisis when The Wall went up.  Those years were the initial period of nuclear standoff called MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). What Johnstone saw as he went about his duties horrified him – and it should also horrify us.  For it is the thesis of the Afterword, by the author’s daughter, the prominent political commentator Diana Johnstone, that after the demise of the Soviet Union, the U.S. moved quickly from “MAD to Madness.”  Madness refers to plans for a knockout nuclear first strike on Russia, aided and abetted by the latest missile defense boondoggle.    That was a favorite fantasy of the generals in the post-WWII era.  Whether we now live in another era of Madness, when a disabling first strike again dances in the heads of the Elite, or once again in an era of MAD is an open question in my mind.  But Paul Johnstone’s memoir is a work of great importance in either case. Paul Johnstone started out in Henry Wallace’s Dept. of Agriculture during the New Deal, but was moved to the Department of War after Pearl Harbor.  His job was to pick targets for conventional bombs in Japan, although not the targets for the first atom bombs.  When the Cold War commenced, he studied how targets for nuclear weapons should be selected and how much damage The Bomb would do when dropped on various corners of the USSR.  He also assessed the damage of Russian nukes landing in various corners of the U.S.  He worked at the most august levels of US intelligence:  Air Force Intelligence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of Secretary of Defense. Some of Johnstone’s studies became part of the Pentagon Papers, and Daniel Ellsberg.  Johnstone gave the manuscript for this memoir to his daughter, Diana Johnstone, when he was on his deathbed in 1981. A central message of the book is the inevitable failure of intelligence.  This aspect of the memoir is hard to apprehend in all its facets without actually reading it.  Why can “intelligence” not be trusted?  First the intelligence agencies lie – and do so quite consciously when it suits those who command them or the desires of those who command their commanders.  Anyone who does not recognize this by now has not been paying attention.  Intel did this most notoriously in recent years in the case of the non-existent WMD that led the US to a multitrillion dollar war on the innocent people of Iraq – which we fight to this day even though Barack Obama declared the war “officially” over. But even when the Intel agencies are trying to make honest estimates, they face other obstacles.  This is the major lesson that Paul Johnstone delivers.  Let us take a few examples.  On the topic of trying to assess the damage done by nuclear weapons either on the USSR or on the US, he writes: “They (the effects of nuking a target, jw) would be researched, and in time – much time – a lot would be learned about them, although not enough ever to provide the basis for predictive measurements.  So men do what men always do.  They calculated what was calculable as best they could, and generally ignored, or dismissed with mere mention by name, the factors that, however relevant and crucial, were incalculable.  Or they would just make a wild guess.  One problem was that whatever the uncertainties, those utilizing the information were rarely in a position to understand its degree of reliability. “(p. 39 of From Mad to Madness, hereafter FMTM) So the “decision makers” for nuclear war could well be acting on intel that is “a wild guess,” and they would not know it! And here is Johnstone writing on the way that the “wild guesses” and other intelligence estimates come to be made, most notably about enemy capabilities – an essential if one plans to start a nuclear war: “I believe that, to anyone who has been deeply immersed in it and then has had the privilege of viewing it with some measure of detachment, military intelligence must seem a world of flickering light, dark shadows, mood music and whispered rumors, half heard against trumpeted accompaniment proclaiming dire threats that imperil us from outer darkness.  Shapes are partly perceived at best, most commonly merely implied, often not seen at all, and often what you think you see is really not there at all.  There are always some things you know you know, but you never know how many things there are that you have no evidence even to suspect.  You do not know how much of what you see is deliberately staged to mislead you. What is seldom realized is that there is always a dominant mood that determines, more than the sharpest senses or the most acute reasoning, what you decide is out there and what is going on.  Like all the world and all experience, it is kaleidoscopic; and the bits and pieces that flit before your eyes are what you thought you’d see before you looked. Always of course there are the true believers.  The images immediately before their eyes are God’s own truth.  It’s a matter of right or wrong, bright sunlight or utter darkness.  Then there are those not fully convinced nor deeply caring, who find it least troublesome to see what others say they see.  Like herded sheep they may once in a while say “baa,” but though they may distrust the direction they are driven in, they feel reassured following the path forced on them by the pressure of the bodies next to them.” (FMTM, p. 63) In other words, in the end the data and analysis do little more than to confirm pre-existing sentiments and prejudices. Then there were the “experts” who had their own agenda.  A striking example is the “Special Studies Group” set up in the early 1950s in the Air Force Directorate of Intelligence.  Johnstone writes: “It was headed by Steve Possony, a Hungarian émigré who professed to be an expert on Communism in general and the Soviet Union in particular.  Steve was the first of several Central European émigrés I met in the next few years who passed as experts on Communist Europe….Others were Stausz-Hupé, Kissinger, Brzezinski and many lesser lights such as Leon Gouré and Helmut Sonnenfeldt.  In every case I felt that they were thinking, consciously or otherwise, as representatives of a lost cause in their native land, and I always believed that they were used by the military because their ‘obsessions’ were so useful.” (FTFM, p.80) Of course it is not clear who was using whom here.  But we can think of a latter day equivalent in Bush 2 time when neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz dominated the Pentagon.  As they ginned up the War on Iraq, it was all too clear that their loyalty to Israel came into play.  For while the wars in the Middle East and North Africa did little to advance the interests of the US, costing it blood, treasure and new enemies like ISIS, those wars left in ruins potential adversaries of Israel in its neighborhood.  There can be little doubt that the interests of Israel were served by these American “strategic thinkers.” Johnstone goes on: “The one product of Possony’s group that I most distinctly remember was an annual appraisal of the strategic situation.  And the reason I remember it, perhaps, is that every year that appraisal forecast a massive Russian land attack on Western Europe the following year.  Several of us began to laugh about it after a while, but the forecast was always intoned awesomely and with superficial plausibility.  I do not know whether many people who heard the briefings really believed the forecasts.  I suspect many doubted it would really be next year, and thought it more likely the year after or even later.  But even doubters approved the forecast because, they reasoned, it was better to err in this direction than to minimize the danger.  Above all, it was good to say things that emphasized the need for strong defenses.” (And I might add big military budgets, jw) (FTFM, p. 80) The issues that Johnstone raises are relevant not only for scholars, but for each and every one of us since our very existence hangs by a thread increasingly frayed by the incessant anti-Russia drumbeat in our media. That drumbeat has reached a neo-McCarthyite crescendo in these days of Kremlin Gate where politicians crazed by hatred of Putin like John McCain or hatred of Trump like nearly every last Democrat hold sway. The relevance of the memoir is inescapable, and this is laid out with considerable insight in a preface and a postscript by Johnstone’s daughter, Diana.  Diana Johnstone, a journalist residing in Paris and a frequent commenter on French and U.S. Politics is also the author of The Politics of Euromissiles (1984), Greens in the European Parliament – A New Sense of Purpose for Europe (1994), Fool’s Crusade: Yugoslavia, NATO and Western Delusions (2003), and Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton (2015) – this last published right here at CounterPunch Press.  She is careful of the conclusions she draws.  In addition, Paul Craig Roberts’s Foreword adds a further dimension to the book since he worked with some of Paul Johnstone’s colleagues and also inside the Reagan cabinet when the first Cold War finally came to an end.  (Regrettably here we are again – in Cold War 2.0.) I remain unconvinced only by one conclusion of the book and that lies in Diana Johnstone’s Afterword.  One thesis of the Afterword is that we went from the era of MAD back to the era of Madness, that is an attempt at a nuclear first strike, after the demise of the USSR.  That may well have been true in the first decade of the Century when Russia was still on its back and China was relatively weak.  (Diana Johnstone cites literature from this period to make her case.  See also “The End of Mad”.)  Bush was in power then, and the neocons were in the driver’s seat.  Bush withdrew from the ABM treaty in June, 2002, which opened the door to developing the ever elusive anti-missile system that would make possible a first-strike on Russia and/or China.  (At times first strike capability is called “nuclear primacy”.)  Those ABM plans persisted and have been implemented right up to the present with their deployment in Eastern Europe nominally against Iran and in South Korea nominally against the DPRK.  They are in fact aimed at Russia and China, and no one is fooled by other claims, least of all Russia and China. But we are now 15 years out from 2002 and Russia’s economy and military are much stronger under Putin.  Moreover, China’s GDP was only about 18% of the US GDP in Purchasing Power Parity terms in 2002; it is now in 2017 about 120% that of the US., and the gap grows daily.  And of course military power grows out of economic power.  Things have changed.  Certainly, the US maintains a vast edge in its military capability, but is it enough for the neocons and neoliberalcons to realistically dream any longer of a nuclear first strike?  I doubt it, but the grave danger is that they are living in the past and that their “intel” is telling them that nuclear primacy is still theirs.  Why?  Because the intel agencies might feel that is what their bosses want to hear.  After all, who wants to abandon past glory.   Empires do not have a great track record when it comes to accepting decline.  Living in the past is one of the things that might concern us after reading Paul Johnstone’s work.  So it is a book of considerable importance for the moment.  It warns us of the perilous age in which we live, and it tells us that the need to create a structure of peace in a multipolar world is urgent.

It’s a battle fought mostly between Intel and AMD, with Intel often considered slight better, but also more expensive.  AMD is not that far behind in the performance stakes. That could change though, as a new leak has revealed some specs on a new Intel i9 processor, which is likely to blow current CPU performance out of the computer generated water. Intel’s plans have been leaked through to AnandTech and while they are certainly not official, the person who posted has provided  lot of detail that sounds completely plausible. The source is a post which includes details of the new processing range along with a screenshot of a presentation (which appears to be in German) to back it up. The details reveal some interesting details about the possible future range of i9 processors that we could see in the near future. The most powerful option, in particular, looks incredibly exciting with 12 cores (yes, a full 12 cores!), 16.5MB of L3 cache, 44 PCIe lanes and a power consumption of 140W which should offer an almost stupid amount of processing power. If you suffer from techno-lust, I suggest you read through the below details with extreme caution: Exclusive: Skylake-X (Core i9) Lineup and Specifications Core i9-7920X 12C/24T 16.5MB L3 44 PCIe lanes Clocks TBD (August Launch) Core i9-7900X 10C/20T 13.75MB L3 44 PCIe Lanes 3.3Ghz Base 4.3Ghz Turbo 2.0 4.5Ghz Turbo 3.0! Core i9-7820X 8C/16T 11MB L3 28 PCIe Lanes 3.6Ghz Base 4.3Ghz Turbo 2.0 4.5Ghz Turbo 3.0 Core i9-7800X 6C/12T 8.25MB L3 28 PCIe Lanes 3.5Ghz Base 4.0Ghz Turbo 2.0 Core i7-7740K 4C/8T 8MB L3 16 PCIe Lanes 4.3Ghz Base 4.5Ghz Turbo 2.0 Core i7-7640K 4C/4T 6MB L3 16 PCIe Lanes 4.0Ghz Base 4.2Ghz Turbo 2.0 L2 cache = 1MB (Skylake-X), 4x as much as Core i7-7700K Dual DDR4-2666 for Kaby Lake-X / Quad DDR4-2666 for Skylake-X 112W for Kaby Lake-X / up to 140W for Skylake-X Apparently all Core i9 parts support AVX-512 (TBC) Launch in June, except 7920X (August) The top of the range i9 processors are likely to require home loans for the average person to afford at his point, but definitely point to an exciting future for the processing power we can expect for the future, For the rest of us, it will probably just mean that the current range of i7 processors is going to become a little cheaper. There are some newer i7 models coming out as well though, so fear not if you were still hoping to get your hands on a new model CPU that doesn’t break the bank. It will likely be a while before we see processors like this at retail, but the moment they do, expect PC performance to get a lot better for the rich and the gap between PC and console grows even more. But can it run Crysis? Yes – probably in 8k and still giving out a smooth 60fps while you run a few other processes in the background.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     WWDC 2017: New MacBook Pro, MacBook And MacBook Air Rumored Posted: May 17 2017, 2:06am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple is reportedly unveiling updated laptops at the WWDC 17. Apple CEO Tim Cook and his executive team are expected to unveil new versions of iOS and macOS during the WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5. For the first time in years, Apple is reportedly announcing new hardware at the WWDC 17. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 Apple is according to Bloomberg unveiling an update its laptop line at the WWDC. "Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said, " says Mark Gurman in the new rumor report. This is not too exciting, but the timing is right as Microsoft just announced the Surface Laptop. I would personally rather like to get a first look at the 2017 iMac at the WWDC 2017. This is the 28th annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Each year during WWDC, millions of talented developers around the world learn about Apple's breakthrough platform technologies ranging from programming languages like Swift to breakthrough developer APIs like SiriKit, HomeKit, HealthKit and CarPlay.  Located just minutes from Apple’s new headquarters in Cupertino, WWDC 2017 will give developers access to more than 1,000 Apple engineers with opportunities to meet and engage with them throughout the conference. The McEnery Convention Center will be the hub for thousands of attendees with hotel, restaurant and entertainment options, all within walking distance. In addition to the keynote address, get-togethers, sessions and labs for developers, Apple is working with the city of San Jose and local businesses to celebrate the return of WWDC with special experiences around San Jose throughout the week.

(Source: Bloomberg) Apple Inc. plans to announce an update to its laptop lineup at an annual conference for app developers in early June, a move that could help offset new competition from Microsoft Corp. as well as declining iPad sales. Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries — the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. (Source: Bloomberg) The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future.

By Mark Gurman and Alex Webb. Added by Agency Staff on 17 May 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Apple, Intel, Microsoft, Steve Jobs Tweet Apple plans to announce an update to its laptop line-up at an annual conference for app developers in early June, a move that could help offset new competition from Microsoft as well as declining iPad sales. The company is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac line-up generates just 11% of the company’s US$216bn in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries — the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone maker. This month, Microsoft debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4,2m desktops and laptops and generated 14% more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode.

 10 things in tech you need to know today Sam Shead May 17, 2017, 1:43 AM 2,421 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Wednesday. 1. Apple is preparing three new laptops expected to launch next month, Bloomberg reported. New versions of the MacBook Pro with faster Intel chips are planned for launch, as is a refreshed version of the 12-inch MacBook with a new Intel chip. 2. The 22-year-old Brit who stopped the global cyberattack is donating his $10,000 reward to charity. "I don't do what I do for money or fame," he told Business Insider. "I'd rather give the money to people who need it." 3. Twitter cofounder Biz Stone is rejoining the company after almost six years away. The company's stock is up. 4. Microsoft is finally fixing a notorious Outlook emoji problem that's plagued users for seven years. It relates to the letter "J. 5. Elon Musk's $1 billion AI startup has developed a system that trains robots in virtual reality. The system is underpinned by two neural networks, which can be thought of as computer systems based on the human brain. 6. Amazon has started paying out cold hard cash to the developers making apps for Alexa, the virtual assistant built into the company's Echo smart speakers. It's not clear how much developers can expect to make. 7. Google plans to announce a new virtual reality headset at its annual I/O developers conference Wednesday. Unlike Google's current Daydream View headset that requires a phone to work, this will be a standalone device similar to what we've seen with Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. 8.

Processed and transmitted by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. -- Better Hearts Better Cities is a Novartis Foundation initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension. -- Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, are a growing health crisis with 75% of NCD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries; this is compounded by rapid urbanization. -- The innovative approach is being tested on three continents: in Mongolia, Senegal, and Brazil. -- Better Hearts Better Cities brings together multisector partners, including a technology advisor partnership with Intel Corporation, to co-design and implement interventions beyond healthcare. Basel, May 17, 2017 - On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75% of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.[1] The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners - from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners - to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. "To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people's quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided," said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. "Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce" said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative's global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. "Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability." Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. "The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there," said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. "We're excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality." Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country's population, around 1.4 million people.[2] In this capital city, also one of the world's most polluted cities,[3] more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension[4] and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.[5] Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,[6] and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission. Everything we do is grounded in evidence and innovation, and our work is a continuous cycle of evaluation, adaptation and application. In 2016, the operational budget for the Foundation was CHF 15 million and our programs reached 8.9 million people.

Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. "The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there," said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. "We're excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality." Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country's population, around 1.4 million people.[2] In this capital city, also one of the world's most polluted cities,[3] more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension[4] and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.[5] Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,[6] and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission. Everything we do is grounded in evidence and innovation, and our work is a continuous cycle of evaluation, adaptation and application. In 2016, the operational budget for the Foundation was CHF 15 million and our programs reached 8.9 million people.

Intel's groundbreaking 8008 microprocessor was first produced 45 years ago.1 This chip, Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor, is the ancestor of the x86 processor family that you may be using right now. I couldn't find good die photos of the 8008, so I opened one up and took some detailed photographs. These new die photos are in this article, along with a discussion of the 8008's internal design. Die photograph of the 8008 microprocessor The photo above shows the tiny silicon die inside the 8008 package (click the image for a higher resolution photo). You can barely see the wires and transistors that make up the chip. The squares around the outside are the 18 pads that are connected to the external pins by tiny bond wires. You can see the text "8008" on the right edge of the chip and "© Intel 1971" on the lower edge. The initials HF appear on the top right for Hal Feeney, who did the chip's logic design and physical layout. (Other key designers of the 8008 were Ted Hoff, Stan Mazor, and Federico Faggin.) Inside the chip The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks of the chip. On the left is the 8-bit Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU), which performs the actual data computations.3 The ALU uses two temporary registers to hold its input values. These registers take up significant area on the chip, not because they are complex, but because they need large transistors to drive signals through the ALU circuitry. Die of the 8008 microprocessor showing major components. Below the registers is the carry look ahead circuitry. For addition and subtraction, this circuit computes all eight carry values in parallel to improve performance.2 Since the low-order carry depends on just the low-order bits, while the higher-order carries depend on multiple bits, the circuit block has a triangular shape. The triangular layout of the ALU is unusual. Most processors stack the circuitry for each bit into a regular rectangle (a bit-slice layout). The 8008, however, has eight blocks (one for each bit) arranged haphazardly to fit around the space left by the triangular carry generator. The ALU supports eight simple operations.3 In the center of the chip is the instruction register and the instruction decoding logic that determines the meaning of each 8-bit machine instruction. Decoding is done with a Programmable Logic Array (PLA), an arrangement of gates that matches bit patterns and generates the appropriate control signals for the rest of the chip. On the right are the storage blocks. The 8008's seven registers are in the upper right. In the lower right is the address stack, which consists of eight 14-bit address words. Unlike most processors, the 8008's call stack is stored on the chip instead of in memory. The program counter is just one of these addresses, making subroutine calls and returns very simple. The 8008 uses dynamic memory for this storage The physical structure of the chip is very close to the block diagram in the 8008 User's Manual (below), with blocks located on the chip in nearly the same positions as in the block diagram. Block diagram of the 8008 microprocessor, from the User's Manual. The structure of the chip What does the die photo show? For our purposes, the chip can be thought of as three layers. The diagram below shows a closeup of the chip, pointing out these layers. The topmost layer is the metal wiring. It is the most visible feature, and looks metallic (not surprisingly). In the detail below, these wires are mostly horizontal. The polysilicon layer is below the metal and appears orange under the microscope. A closeup of the 8008 die, showing the metal layer, the polysilicon, and the doped silicon. The foundation of the chip is the silicon wafer, which appears purplish-gray in the photo. Pure silicon is effectively an insulator. Regions of it are "doped" with impurities to create semiconducting silicon. Being on the bottom, the silicon layer is difficult to distinguish, but you can see black lines along the border between doped silicon and undoped silicon. A few vertical silicon "wires" are visible in the photo.4 Transistors are the key component of the chip, and a transistor is formed where a polysilicon wire crosses doped silicon. In the photo, the polysilicon appears as a brighter orange where it forms a transistor. Why an 18 pin chip? One inconvenient feature of the 8008 is it only has 18 pins, which makes the chip slower and much more difficult to use. The 8008 uses 14 address bits and 8 data bits so with 18 pins there aren't enough pins for each signal. Instead, the chip has 8 data pins that are reused in three cycles to transmit the low address bits, high address bits, and data bits. A computer using the 8008 requires many support chips to interact with this inconvenient bus architecture.5 There was no good reason to force the chip into 18 pins. Packages with 40 or 48 pins were common with other manufacturers, but 16 pins was "a religion at Intel".6 Only with great reluctance did they move to 18 pins. By the time the 8080 processor came out a few years later, Intel had come to terms with 40-pin chips. The 8080 was much more popular, in part because it had a simpler bus design permitted by the 40-pin package. Power and data paths in the chip The data bus provides data flow through the chip. The diagram below shows the 8-bit data bus of the 8008 with rainbow colors for the 8 data lines. The data bus connects to the 8 data pins along the outside of the upper half of the chip. The bus runs between the ALU on the left, the instruction register (upper center), and the registers and stack on the right. The bus is split on the left with half along each side of the ALU. Die photo of the 8008 microprocessor. The power bus is shown in red and blue. The data bus is shown with 8 rainbow colors. The red and blue lines show power routing. Power routing is an under-appreciated aspect of microprocessors. Power is routed in the metal layer due to its low resistance. But since there is only one metal layer in early microprocessors, power distribution must be carefully planned so the paths don't cross.7 The diagram above shows Vcc lines in blue and Vdd lines in red. Power is supplied through the Vcc pin on the left and the Vdd pin on the right, then branches out into thin, interlocking wires that supply all parts of the chip. The register file To show what the chip looks like in detail, I've zoomed in on the 8008's register file in the photo below. The register file consists of an 8 by 7 grid of dynamic RAM (DRAM) storage cells, each using three transistors to hold one bit.8 (You can see the transistors as the small rectangles where the orange polysilicon takes on a slightly more vivid color.) Each row is one of the 8008's seven 8-bit registers (A, B, C, D, E, H, L). On the left, you can see seven pairs of horizontal wires: the read select and write select lines for each register. At the top, you can see eight vertical wires to read or write the contents of each bit, along with 5 thicker wires to supply Vcc. Using DRAM for registers (rather than the more common static latches) is an interesting choice. Since Intel was primary a memory company at the time, I expect they chose DRAM due to their expertise in the area. The register file in the 8008. The chip has seven 8-bit registers: A, B, C, D, E, H, L How PMOS works The 8008 uses PMOS transistors. To simplify slightly, you can think of a PMOS transistor as a switch between two silicon wires, controlled by a gate input (of polysilicon). The switch closes when its gate input is low and it can pull its output high. If you're familiar with the NMOS transistors used in microprocessors like the 6502, PMOS may be a bit confusing because everything is backwards. A simple PMOS NAND gate can be constructed as shown below. When both inputs are high, the transistors are off and the resistor pulls the output low. When any input is low, the transistor will conduct, connecting the output to +5. Thus, the circuit implements a NAND gate. For compatibility with 5-volt TTL circuits, the PMOS gate (and thus the 8008) is powered with unusual voltages: -9V and +5V. A NAND gate implemented with PMOS logic. For technical reasons, the resistor is actually implemented with a transistor. The diagram below shows how the transistor is wired to act as a pull-down resistor. The detail on the right shows how this circuit appears on the chip. The -9V metal wire is at the top, the transistor is in the middle, and the output is the silicon wire at the bottom. In PMOS, a pull-down resistor (left) is implemented with a transistor (center). The photo on the right shows an actual pull-down in the 8008 microprocessor. History of the 8008 The 8008's complicated story starts with the Datapoint 2200, a popular computer introduced in 1970 as a programmable terminal. (Some people consider the Datapoint 2200 to be the first personal computer.) Rather than using a microprocessor, the Datapoint 2200 contained a board-sized CPU build from individual TTL chips. (This was the standard way to build a CPU in the minicomputer era.) Datapoint and Intel decided that it would be possible to replace this board with a single MOS chip, and Intel started the 8008 project to build this chip. A bit later, Texas Instruments also agreed to build a single-chip processor for Datapoint. Both chips were designed to be compatible with the Datapoint 2200's 8-bit instruction set and architecture. The 8008 processor was first described publicly in "Electronic Design", Oct 25, 1970. Although Intel claimed the chip would be delivered in January 1971, actual delivery was more than a year later in April, 1972. Around March 1971, Texas Instruments completed their processor chip, calling it the TMC 1795. After delaying the project, Intel finished the 8008 chip later, around the end of 1971. For a variety of reasons, Datapoint rejected both microprocessors and built a faster CPU based on newer TTL chips including the 74181 ALU chip. TI tried unsuccessfully to market the TMC 1795 processor to companies such as Ford, but ended up abandoning the processor, focusing on highly-profitable calculator chips instead. Intel, on the other hand, marketed the 8008 as a general-purpose microprocessor, which eventually led to the x86 architecture you're probably using right now. Although TI was first with the 8-bit processor, it was Intel who made their chip a success, creating the microprocessor industry. A family tree of the 8008 and some related processors. Black arrows indicate backwards compatibility. Light arrows indicate significant architecture changes. The diagram above summarizes the "family tree" of the 8008 and some related processors.10 The Datapoint 2200's architecture was used in the TMC 1795, the Intel 8008, and the next version Datapoint 220011. Thus, four entirely different processors were built using the Datapoint 2200's instruction set and architecture. The Intel 8080 processor was a much-improved version of the 8008. It significantly extended the 8008's instruction set and reordered the machine code instructions for efficiency. The 8080 was used in groundbreaking early microcomputers such as the Altair and the Imsai. After working on the 4004 and 8080, designers Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima left Intel to build the Zilog Z-80 microprocessor, which improved on the 8080 and became very popular. The jump to the 16-bit 8086 processor was much less evolutionary. Most 8080 assembly code could be converted to run on the 8086, but not trivially, as the instruction set and architecture were radically changed. Nonetheless, some characteristics of the Datapoint 2200 still exist in today's x86 processors. For instance, the Datapoint 2200 had a serial processor, processing bytes one bit at a time. Since the lowest bit needs to be processed first, the Datapoint 2200 was little-endian. For compatibility, the 8008 was little-endian, and this is still the case in Intel's processors. Another feature of the Datapoint 2200 was the parity flag, since parity calculation was important for a terminal's communication. The parity flag has continued to the x86 architecture. The 8008 is architecturally unrelated to Intel's 4-bit 4004 processor12. The 8008 is not an 8-bit version of the 4-bit 4004 in any way. The similar names are purely a marketing invention; during its design phase the 8008 had the unexciting name "1201". If you want more early microprocessor history, I wrote a detailed article for the IEEE Spectrum. I also wrote a post about TI's TMC 1795. How the 8008 fits into the history of semiconductor technology The 4004 and 8008 both used silicon-gate enhancement-mode PMOS, a semiconductor technology that was only used briefly. This puts the chips at an interesting point in chip fabrication technology. The 8008 (and modern processors) uses MOS transistors. These transistors had a long path to acceptance, being slower and less reliable than the bipolar transistors used in most computers of the 1960s. By the late 1960s, MOS integrated circuits were becoming more common; the standard technology was PMOS transistors with metal gates. The gates of the transistor consisted of metal, which was also used to connect components of the chip. Chips essentially had two layers of functionality: the silicon itself, and the metal wiring on top. This technology was used in many Texas Instruments calculator chips, as well as the TMC 1795 chip (the chip that had the same instruction set as the 8008). A key innovation that made the 8008 practical was the self-aligned gate—a transistor using a gate of polysilicon rather than metal. Although this technology was invented by Fairchild and Bell Labs, it was Intel that pushed the technology ahead. Polysilicon gate transistors had much better performance than metal gate (for complex semiconductor reasons). In addition, adding a polysilicon layer made routing of signals in the chip much easier, making the chips denser. The diagram below shows the benefit of self-aligned gates: the metal-gate TMC 1795 is bigger than the 4004 and 8008 chips combined. Intel's 4004 and 8008 processors are much denser than Texas Instruments' TMC 1795 chip, largely due to their use of self-aligned gates. Shortly afterwards, semiconductor technology improved again with the use of NMOS transistors instead of PMOS transistors. Although PMOS transistors were easier to manufacture initially, NMOS transistors are faster, so once NMOS could be fabricated reliably, they were a clear win. NMOS led to more powerful chips such as the Intel 8080 and the Motorola 6800 (both 1974). Another technology improvement of this time was ion-implantation to change the characteristics of transistors. This allowed the creation of "depletion-mode" transistors for use as pull-up resistors. These transistors improved chip performance and reduced power consumption. They also allowed the creation of chips that ran on standard five-volt supplies.13 The combination of NMOS transistors and depletion-mode pull-ups was used for most of the microprocessors of the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the 6502 (1975), Z-80 (1976), 68000 (1979), and Intel chips from the 8085 (1976) to the 80286 (1982). In the mid 1980s, CMOS took over, using NMOS and PMOS transistors together to dramatically reduce power consumption, with chips such as the 80386 (1986), 68020 (1984) and ARM1 (1985). Now almost all chips are CMOS.14 As you can see, the 1970s were a time of large changes in semiconductor chip technology. The 4004 and 8008 were created when the technological capability intersected with the right market. How to take die photos In this section, I explain how I got the photos of the 8008 die. The first step is to open the chip package to expose the die. Most chips come in epoxy packages, which can be dissolved with dangerous acids. The 8008 microprocessor in a ceramic package Since I would rather avoid boiling nitric acid, I took a simpler approach. The 8008 is also available in a ceramic package (above), which I got on eBay. Tapping the chip along the seam with a chisel pops the two ceramic layers apart. The photo below shows the lower half of the ceramic package, with the die exposed. Most of the metal pins have been removed, but their positions in the package are visible. To the right of the die is a small square; this connects ground (Vcc) to the substrate. A couple of the tiny bond wires are still visible, connected to the die. Inside the package of the 8008 microprocessor, the silicon die is visible. Once the die is exposed, a microscope can be used to take photographs. A standard microscope shines the light from below, which doesn't work well for die photographs. Instead, I used a metallurgical microscope, which shines the light from above to illuminate the chip. I took 48 photographs through the microscope and then used the Hugin stitching software to combine them into one high-resolution image (details). Finally, I adjusted the image contrast to make the chip's structures more visible. The original image (which is approximately what you see through the microscope) is below for comparison. Die photograph of the 8008 microprocessor Conclusion I took detailed die photos of the 8008 that reveal the circuitry it used. While the 8008 wasn't the first microprocessor or even the first 8-bit microprocessor, it was truly revolutionary, triggering the microprocessor revolution and leading to the x86 architecture that dominates personal computers today. In future posts, I plan to explain the 8008's circuits in detail to provide a glimpse into the roots of todays computers. I announce my latest blog posts on Twitter, so follow me at kenshirriff. Or you can use the RSS feed. Notes and references 1. According to the oral history of the 8008, photos of the 8008 were obtained in October / November 1971 (page 6). Chip designer Federico Faggin mentions that toward the end of 1971, "everything was working except for a few errors." Faggin then debugged a problem with the dynamic memory losing data, making it ready for production (page 9). ↩ 2. Using the carry look ahead circuit avoids the delay from a standard ripple-carry adder, where the carries propagate through the sum. ↩ 3. The 8008's ALU supports eight operations: add, subtract, add with carry, subtract with carry, AND, OR, XOR, and compare. It also implements left and right shift and rotate operations. The 8008 also has increment and decrement instructions, extending the Datapoint 2200's instruction set. ↩ 4. Because silicon has higher resistance than polysilicon, most chips use the polysilicon and metal layers for wiring, not the silicon layer. The 4004 and 8008 chips are unusual in that they prefer to use the silicon layer for wiring rather than polysilicon. I expect this was due to the recent introduction of polysilicon: before polysilicon, routing needed to be done in the silicon layer and perhaps the chip designers were sticking with the older layout techniques. ↩ 5. The 8008 required 20 support chips according to chip architect Federico Faggin. In contrast, the 4004 and earlier MOS computers such as the Four Phase and CADC were designed with a small number of MOS chips that worked together without extra "glue chips". In this sense, the 8008 was a step backwards architecturally, saying "here's the CPU, you figure out how to make a computer out of it." ↩ 6. For details on Intel's insistence on 16 pins, see Oral History of Federico Faggin, page 55-56. It was only when the 1103 memory chip required 18 pins that Intel reluctantly moved beyond 16 pins. And that was treated by Intel like "the sky had dropped from heaven," resulting in "so many long faces". ↩ 7. If two metal lines need to cross, one of them can be routed under the other by using the polysilicon layer. To be low resistance, this cross-under must be relatively wide, so cross-unders are avoided if possible. ↩ 8. The 8008 registers use the "3T1C" cell: three transistors and one capacitor (details). The circuit doesn't physically contain a separate capacitor, but uses the gate capacitance of the transistor. One unusual feature of the 8008 cell is it uses one wire for both reading and writing the bit, while the typical 3T cell has separate wires for reading and writing. The 4004 had separate wires, but the design changed slightly in the 8008. ↩ 9. Pull-up resistors in later chips such as the 6502 were implemented using depletion-mode NMOS transistors. These yielded more faster, more efficient logic. They were also wired differently, with the gate connected to the output rather than the power rail. ↩ 10. The 8008 architecture and the evolution of Intel's microprocessors are discussed in detail in Intel Microprocessors: 8008 to 8086. ↩ 11. The second version of the Datapoint 2200 had a totally new implementation of the processor, still built from TTL chips. While the first version had a serial ALU (processing one bit at a time), the second version operated in parallel using 74181 ALU chips. As a result, the second version was much faster. ↩ 12. The extensive 4004 Anniversary Project has reverse-engineered the 4004 processor. The 4004 schematic is here. ↩ 13. The Motorola 6800 microprocessor originally used enhancement-mode transistors. To operate off a single +5V supply, it had a voltage-doubler circuit on the chip. ↩ 14. Interestingly, in 2007 Intel started using metal gates again in order to scale transistors further (details). In a way, semiconductor technology has gone full circle, back to metal gates, although now unusual metals such as hafnium are used. ↩ 8 comments 282 interactions Share this article: User Comments: 8 Got something to say?

Image courtesy of Sprint Sprint unveils open source NFV/SDN reference solution dubbed C3PO 0 By Sean Kinney on May 16, 2017 Carriers, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software-defined networks (SDN) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Developed with Intel Labs, Sprint says C3PO combines open source software with off-the-shelf hardware to drive network efficiencies The ever-increasing complexity of evolving telecommunications networks is forcing operators to quickly virtualize and automate network management and operational processes to keep up with the flexibility and scale demanded by consumers. The push to network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) has prompted a shift away from proprietary equipment and software control to the use of open source software and less expensive, off-the-shelf data center hardware. One of the most visible examples is AT&T’s ECOMP, which was recently joined with Huawei’s Open-O into the Linux Foundation-managed ONAP. Now, Sprint, in partnership with Intel Labs, has entered the mix with C3PO. Let’s unpack this acronym within an acronym. C3PO stands for Clean CUPS Core for Packet Optimization. CUPS stands for Control and User Plane Separation. While it’s not clear if Sprint’s C3PO is “fluent in over six million forms of communication,” the new reference, contributed to OpenDaylight, covers seven network functions Sprint described as “applicable to essentially all user traffic.” Those are: Serving gateway Packet gateway Deep packet inspection Child protection filtering Carrier-grade network address translation (NAT) Static firewall Service function chaining classification (ISC) Sprint VP of Technology Ron Marquardt described the impetus for C3PO in a company blog post: “Over the past few years while preparing to move from proprietary hardware to virtualized solutions, it became increasingly important for us to understand how to best optimize our network applications for provisioning on an Intel processor-based server.  When our work with Intel Labs developing C3PO first began, CUPS was just a nascent concept, and the industry work being done on NFV was still theoretical.  For simplicity, the latter was often depicted as individual software elements conceptually interconnected in a manner that would require significant compute overhead.  NFV and SDN were both defined in their own contexts, with little attempt yet to marry these concepts in a performance-optimized manner.  It was the early days of the industry’s march to virtual implementations.” Now, Marquardt said the carrier is working to harden C3PO and expand into new use cases, particularly the internet of things. “As operators scale IoT, low-cost solutions will be vital to drive viable economics when connected devices grow to 10s and 200s of billions in number. We believe a commercial version of C3PO to be a potential solution well-targeted for low-cost, large-scale applications such as this.” He also said Sprint will use information from 3GPP and IETF to help develop 5G compatibility. Sprint has been working on this project with Intel for four years. Lab tests used Dell EMC DSS 9000 rack scale infrastructure running dual socket 14-core Intel Xeon processors.     Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Posts Related Posts Linux Foundation NFV Open Daylight Open Source SDN Sprint About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

Startseite > News & Analysen > Finanzmarkt Press Release: Novartis Foundation and partners launch initiative to tackle hypertension and its root causes in low-income urban communities 17.05.2017 - 07:15 | Quelle: Dow Jones Newswire Web === Novartis International AG / Novartis Foundation and partners launch initiative to tackle hypertension and its root causes in low-income urban communities . Processed and transmitted by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. -- Better Hearts Better Cities is a Novartis Foundation initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension. -- Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, are a growing health crisis with 75% of NCD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries; this is compounded by rapid urbanization. -- The innovative approach is being tested on three continents: in Mongolia, Senegal, and Brazil. -- Better Hearts Better Cities brings together multisector partners, including a technology advisor partnership with Intel Corporation, to co-design and implement interventions beyond healthcare. Basel, May 17, 2017 - On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75% of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.[1] The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners - from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners - to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. "To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people's quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided," said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. "Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce" said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative's global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. "Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability." Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. "The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there," said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. "We're excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality." Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country's population, around 1.4 million people.[2] In this capital city, also one of the world's most polluted cities,[3] more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension[4] and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.[5] Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,[6] and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission. Everything we do is grounded in evidence and innovation, and our work is a continuous cycle of evaluation, adaptation and application. In 2016, the operational budget for the Foundation was CHF 15 million and our programs reached 8.9 million people.

Processed and transmitted by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Better Hearts Better Cities is a Novartis Foundation initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, are a growing health crisis with 75% of NCD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries; this is compounded by rapid urbanization. The innovative approach is being tested on three continents: in Mongolia, Senegal, and Brazil. Better Hearts Better Cities brings together multisector partners, including a technology advisor partnership with Intel Corporation, to co-design and implement interventions beyond healthcare. Basel, May 17, 2017 - On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75% of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.[1] The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners - from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners - to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. "To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people's quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided," said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. "Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce" said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative's global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. "Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability." Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. "The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there," said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. "We're excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality." Progress in UlaanbaatarImplementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country's population, around 1.4 million people.[2] In this capital city, also one of the world's most polluted cities,[3] more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension[4] and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.[5] Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,[6] and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission. Everything we do is grounded in evidence and innovation, and our work is a continuous cycle of evaluation, adaptation and application.

Ronen Zvulun / Reuters Opinion Mobileye-Intel: The good, the bad and the ugly Opinion Israel, the Driverless Nation Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli startups In an unprecedented move, the tax windfall Israel expects to reap from Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of the self-driving-car company Mobileye will be paid in dollars rather than shekels under an agreement with the U.S. semiconductor giant announced Tuesday. The Bank of Israel is loath to have Intel convert the tax money into shekels – a figure that experts predict between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. The central bank has been fighting a mostly losing battle to stem an appreciating shekel for fear it will make Israeli exports uncompetitive and hurt economic growth. It has acquired some $4 billion in foreign currency this year and doesn’t want Intel undoing all that work by buying hundreds of millions of dollars in shekels to pay its tax bill. The agreement to pay the tax bill in greenbacks was reached between Intel and the Israel Tax Authority, the Finance Ministry accountant general and the Bank of Israel. “This is a historic event. The decision means the treasury, even if it’s not saying so officially, has decided to intervene in the forex market,” said Yossi Fraiman, CEO of Prico Risk Management & Investments. “The treasury is doing this intervention through the Tax Authority, and we can assume it will be making deals like this going forward.” Keep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email* Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Close The treasury has basically intervened in the forex market before through hedging deals, but this time it is acting far more decisively, Fraiman said. “The Finance Ministry understands that the Bank of Israel can’t act alone and that a shekel appreciation would be fatal for domestic industry, not just the export sector, because it would also mean cheaper imports and competition for factories that employ the weakest segments of the labor market,” he said. Actually, the shekel’s strengthening hasn’t done much this year to worsen Israel’s trade picture. The Central Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday exports of goods and services climbed at a preliminary 8% annual rate in the first quarter while imports were down 8.9%. The dollar fell below 3.60 shekels twice in the last two days, but it turned higher and its Bank of Israel rate was 3.6060 on Tuesday. Intel’s March announcement that it was buying Mobileye was celebrated in Israel. If approved by Intel shareholders next month, as expected, it will be the biggest purchase of an Israeli company ever − one that has been lauded as yet another seal of approval from a leading global tech company of Israel’s high-tech prowess. Also, the proceeds will help fill the government’s already overstuffed coffers and were reportedly a factor in Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon’s decision to unveil a series of tax cuts and other help for young working families. Now that the government will be receiving the Intel taxes in dollars, the proceeds will either be deposited at the Bank of Israel as foreign exchange reserves or spent abroad by Israel on arms or other items. As the buyer of Mobileye, Intel itself doesn’t owe any taxes – it’s the sellers that are liable. But under the acquisition terms, the U.S. company will assess their tax liability, pay it and transfer the net amount owed to Mobileye shareholders.

Intel’s deal with Nvidia ended on March 17, 2017. The two companies apparently disagreed over licensing the nForce chipset—a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia—which resulted in a $1.5 billion settlement that Intel agreed to pay for five years, said Fudzilla. While the report was short on detail, Fudzilla did say that the agreement will now allow Intel to access AMD’s graphics Intellectual Properties, as well as most things dealing with AMD’s Radeon technology. It is still unclear, however, when the deal will be formally announced. Over the past year, AMD has gained over 211%, and this deal with Intel will likely boost its value even more. AMD is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘C.’ Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

That answer is essentially a single massive pool of memory, with a single address space. A prototype version of The Machine the company introduced Tuesday has 160 terabytes of memory across 40 physical nodes interconnected by a high-performance fabric. Importantly, The Machine is not powered by Intel processors, which dominate the data center and high-performance computing market, but by an ARM System-on-Chip designed by Cavium. While nobody can predict the future of computing, Intel’s role in HPE’s version of that future appears to be a lot smaller than it is today. The core idea behind HPE’s new architecture – “the largest R&D program in the history of the company” – is replacing focus on the processor with focus on memory. From the press release: “By eliminating the inefficiencies of how memory, storage and processors interact in traditional systems today, Memory-Driven Computing reduces the time needed to process complex problems from days to hours, hours to minutes, minutes to seconds – to deliver real-time intelligence.” The philosophy is similar to the one behind in-memory computing systems for Oracle or SAP HANA databases. Holding all the data in memory theoretically makes computing faster because data doesn’t have to be shuffled between storage and memory. This means one of the biggest engineering challenges in creating these systems is designing the fabric that interconnects CPUs to memory in a way that avoids bottlenecks. It’s a similar challenge to the one that faces engineers who work on another answer to the reportedly looming disconnect between data volume and processing muscle: offloading big processing jobs from the CPU to a big pool of GPUs. The Machine prototype uses photonics to interconnect components. HPE expects the size of shared memory to scale in the future “to a nearly limitless pool of memory – 4,096 yottabytes,” which is 250,000 times the size of all digital data that exists today, according to the company: “With that amount of memory, it will be possible to simultaneously work with every digital health record of every person on earth; every piece of data from Facebook; every trip of Google’s autonomous vehicles; and every data set from space exploration all at the same time.” Previous Article NVIDIA CEO: AI Workloads Will “Flood” Data Centers Next Article Microsoft Faulted Over Ransomware While Shifting Blame to NSA Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

That rumor is now reaffirmed and getting stronger. It might just be a cross-license agreement so that Intel will be enabled to use some of AMD patents. It also might be that AMD could fab the IGP that is to be paired with Intel CPU dies. According to Fudzilla both companies have finalized the deal. In the end we do not see that last part happening, but Intel is hungry for a GPU patent license, and we all know that AMD can use some additional positive cash-flow. So at this stage, it does not seem unlikely anymore. To date, neither company has confirmed any of this. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Truth be told though we have not seen a new APU in years. If Summit Ridge rumors are true, then we will see some good performance coming out of their igpu's soon enough. But even if the hardware is capable Intel compared to AMD, drivers for IGPU on the Intel side are horrible. 2 pages 1 2 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

The BMW Group, Intel Corporation and Mobileye N.V. announced Tuesday their intention to onboard Delphi as a development partner and system integrator for their state-of-the-art autonomous driving platform. While Delphi, headquartered in Gillingham, Kent, United Kingdom, issued a short news release about the move, the other three companies, which joined force in July 2016 to deliver a fully automated driving system for serial production by 2021, released a more detailed statement. As one of the world's largest automotive parts manufacturers, "Delphi has already provided a prototype compute platform to the BMW Group and is working together with Intel and Mobileye in the areas of perception, sensor fusion and high performance automated driving computing," according to the statement. BMW, headquartered in Munich, Germany, is the world's leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles with one of four brand names, namely BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. Intel Corporation, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the United States, is the world's leading integrated circuit chipmaker. Mobileye N.V., headquartered in Jerusalem, is a leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver-assistance systems. These three companies, as Cooperation Partners, claimed they have developed "a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state-of-the-art designs and create differentiated brands." System integrators, such as Delphi, are critical for the go-to-market strategy of the joint solution to reach multiple automotive OEMs quickly, they said in the statement. And "a key role for Delphi will be the integration of the solution delivered by BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye into OEM vehicle architectures." In addition, they expected that Delphi might provide required hardware components such as sensors as well as specific customization efforts and applications for differentiation. "The partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye continues to break new ground in the auto industry," said Intel Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich. "In less than one year the joint teams have made substantial progress to deliver a scalable platform for autonomous driving... Adding Delphi as an integration partner will help to accelerate the introduction of autonomous cars on the streets from multiple carmakers and offer differentiation to customers." Krzanich said the alliance is "on path to deliver 40 pilot cars in second half of this year." In his statement, Kevin Clark, president and CEO of Delphi, said his company's "close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success." Noting that the engagement between Delphi and the Cooperation Partners is "non-exclusive," BMW, Intel and Mobileye noted they are "in the process of onboarding additional integration and development partners to support future OEM customer needs." OEM, short for original equipment manufacturer, refers in the auto industry to the manufacturer of the parts assembled during the construction of a new vehicle.

The BMW Group, Intel Corporation and Mobileye N.V. announced Tuesday their intention to onboard Delphi as a development partner and system integrator for their state-of-the-art autonomous driving platform. While Delphi, headquartered in Gillingham, Kent, United Kingdom, issued a short news release about the move, the other three companies, which joined force in July 2016 to deliver a fully automated driving system for serial production by 2021, released a more detailed statement. As one of the world's largest automotive parts manufacturers, "Delphi has already provided a prototype compute platform to the BMW Group and is working together with Intel and Mobileye in the areas of perception, sensor fusion and high performance automated driving computing," according to the statement. BMW, headquartered in Munich, Germany, is the world's leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles with one of four brand names, namely BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. Intel Corporation, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the United States, is the world's leading integrated circuit chipmaker. Mobileye N.V., headquartered in Jerusalem, is a leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver-assistance systems. These three companies, as Cooperation Partners, claimed they have developed "a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state-of-the-art designs and create differentiated brands." System integrators, such as Delphi, are critical for the go-to-market strategy of the joint solution to reach multiple automotive OEMs quickly, they said in the statement. And "a key role for Delphi will be the integration of the solution delivered by BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye into OEM vehicle architectures." In addition, they expected that Delphi might provide required hardware components such as sensors as well as specific customization efforts and applications for differentiation. "The partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye continues to break new ground in the auto industry," said Intel Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich. "In less than one year the joint teams have made substantial progress to deliver a scalable platform for autonomous driving... Adding Delphi as an integration partner will help to accelerate the introduction of autonomous cars on the streets from multiple carmakers and offer differentiation to customers." Krzanich said the alliance is "on path to deliver 40 pilot cars in second half of this year." In his statement, Kevin Clark, president and CEO of Delphi, said his company's "close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success." Noting that the engagement between Delphi and the Cooperation Partners is "non-exclusive," BMW, Intel and Mobileye noted they are "in the process of onboarding additional integration and development partners to support future OEM customer needs." OEM, short for original equipment manufacturer, refers in the auto industry to the manufacturer of the parts assembled during the construction of a new vehicle.

Prepping MacBook Updates for WWDC Three of Apple's portable Mac products are reportedly getting upgrades next month. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 16, 2017 at 7:30PM Per a fresh report from Bloomberg, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) "plans to announce an update to its laptop lineup at an annual conference for app developers in early June." Or, in other words, at Apple's World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC). Image source: Apple. Bloomberg says that the Mac maker plans to refresh three of its MacBook products. The company's MacBook Pro "will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel" (NASDAQ:INTC), and its 12-inch MacBook will also get a "faster Intel chip." Perhaps most interestingly, Bloomberg says that Apple "has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor" because sales of the device "remain surprisingly strong." The MacBook Pro updates Apple currently sells its MacBook Pro computers in two screen sizes -- 13 inches and 15 inches. Both current models incorporate Intel's Skylake processor family (marketed as sixth-generation Core), and both lack features available in Kaby Lake chips (marketed as seventh-generation Core), and are less efficient, to boot. Image source: Intel. The move from sixth-generation Core to seventh-generation Core isn't going to deliver a groundbreaking improvement in user experience, but higher performance, more features, and better power efficiency are always good things -- especially since Apple's competitors are already shipping systems based on those superior chips. The MacBook update The current 12-inch MacBook also includes a sixth-generation Core processor (though technically the chips are marketed under the now mostly phased-out "Core m" branding, they are sixth-generation Core processors in terms of design and capabilities). I suspect that the "faster Intel chip" that Bloomberg mentions is simply a seventh-generation Core (Kaby Lake) processor. The chips found in the current 12-inch MacBook are quite a bit zippier than the chips used in the first iteration of the 12-inch MacBook, but substantially faster chips (and the Kaby Lake chips suitable for the 12-inch MacBook are noticeably faster than the current Skylake ones) would probably significantly improve the user experience, given the very tight power constraints on the chips inside such slim/fan-less devices. One more thing... Apple's current 13-inch MacBook Air includes a fifth-generation Intel Core processor (based on the Broadwell architecture), which means that in terms of the processor inside of it, it is woefully out of date. Intel delivered substantial performance/feature improvements in moving from its fifth-generation Core product line to its sixth-generation Core products, and it did so again when it moved from its sixth-generation Core to its seventh-generation Core products. A two-generation improvement in performance/efficiency should be quite a nice shot in the arm for the 13-inch MacBook Air. The Bloomberg article didn't make clear what other enhancements, if any, Apple plans to bring to the faster 13-inch MacBook Air, but here are two features that could help make the device more competitive in the marketplace: Better display: The display found on the current 13-inch MacBook Air is simply not acceptable for anything close to resembling a premium laptop. An upgrade to a higher-resolution, IPS display (though support for wide color isn't necessary) would be most welcome for this product. More modern look: The current 13-inch MacBook Air is based on an ancient (in tech terms) design, with the most prominent sign of this being the huge bezels around the display. These bezels need to be shrunken, at a minimum. If the current 13-inch MacBook Air is still selling reasonably well given all of its deficits, then one with new processors and the changes outlined above could do really well in the marketplace, potentially enabling Apple to accelerate share gains against Windows-based notebooks.

By Matthe Rosenberg and Mark Mazzetti New York Times  May 18, 2017 WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Donald Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Flynn of the inquiry, Trump made Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Advertisement Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported. His legal issues have been a problem for the White House from the beginning and are at the center of a growing political crisis for Trump. Flynn, who was fired after 24 days in the job, was initially kept on even after the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that he might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to Washington.

Sign up for more newsletters here After Flynn’s dismissal, Trump tried to get James B. Comey, the FBI director, to drop the investigation — an act that some legal experts say is grounds for an investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He fired Comey on May 9. The White House declined to comment on whether officials there had known about Flynn’s legal troubles before the inauguration. Flynn, a retired general, is one of a handful of Trump associates under scrutiny in intertwined federal investigations into their financial links to foreign governments and whether any of them helped Russia interfere in the presidential election. Advertisement In congressional testimony, the acting FBI director, Andrew G. McCabe, has confirmed the existence of a “highly significant” investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s associates and Russian operatives to sway the presidential election. The pace of the investigations has intensified in recent weeks, with a veteran espionage prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, now leading a grand jury inquiry in Northern Virginia that is scrutinizing Flynn’s foreign lobbying and has begun issuing subpoenas to businesses that worked with Flynn and his associates. The New York Times has reviewed one of the subpoenas. It demands all “records, research, contracts, bank records, communications” and other documents related to work with Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group, the business he set up after he was forced out as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The subpoena also asks for similar records about Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and is chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. There is no indication that Alptekin is under investigation. Signed by Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, the subpoena instructs the recipient to direct any questions about its contents to Van Grack. Van Grack, a national security prosecutor based at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, has experience conducting espionage investigations. He prosecuted a businessman for illegally exporting thousands of sensitive electronics components to Iran and a suspected hacker in the Syrian Electronic Army. In 2015, he prosecuted a Virginia man for acting as an unregistered agent of Syria’s intelligence services. According to people who have talked to Flynn about the case, he sees the Justice Department’s investigation as part of an effort by the Obama administration and its holdovers in the government to keep him out of the White House. In his view, this effort began immediately after the election, when President Barack Obama, who had fired Flynn as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Trump that he would have profound concerns about Flynn’s becoming a top national security aide. The people close to Flynn said he believed that when that warning did not dissuade Trump from making him national security adviser, the Justice Department opened its investigation into his lobbying work. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Justice Department or White House officials. The investigation stems from the work Flynn did for Inovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Alptekin, the Turkish businessman. On Aug. 9, Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group signed a contract with Inovo for $600,000 over 90 days to run an influence campaign aimed at discrediting Fethullah Gulen, an reclusive cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a failed coup in Turkey last summer. When he was hired by Alptekin, Flynn did not register as a foreign agent, as required by law when an American represents the interests of a foreign government. Only in March did he file a retroactive registration with the Justice Department because his lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, said that “the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Trump campaign officials first became aware of a problem with Flynn’s business dealings in early November. On Nov. 8, the day of the election, Flynn wrote an op-ed in The Hill that advocated improved relations between Turkey and the United States and called Gulen “a shady Islamic mullah.” “If he were in reality a moderate, he would not be in exile, nor would he excite the animus of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government,” the op-ed said. Days later, after an article in The Daily Caller revealed that the Flynn Intel Group had a contract with Inovo, a Trump campaign lawyer held a conference call with members of the Flynn Intel Group, according to one person with knowledge of the call. The lawyer, William McGinley, was seeking more information about the nature of the group’s foreign work and wanted to know whether Flynn had been paid for the op-ed. McGinley now works in the White House as Cabinet secretary and deputy assistant to the president. The Justice Department also took notice. The op-ed in The Hill raised suspicions that Flynn was working as a foreign agent, and in a letter dated Nov. 30, the Justice Department notified Flynn that it was scrutinizing his lobbying work. Flynn hired a lawyer a few weeks later. By Jan. 4, the day Flynn informed McGahn of the inquiry, the Justice Department was investigating the matter. Kelner then followed up with another call to the Trump transition’s legal team. He ended up leaving a message, identifying himself as Flynn’s lawyer. According to a person familiar with the case, Kelner did not get a call back until two days later, on Jan. 6. Around the time of Flynn’s call with McGahn, the FBI began investigating Flynn on a separate matter: phone conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Current and former U.S. officials said that, on the calls, Flynn discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia for disrupting the November election. After news of the calls became public, Flynn misled Pence about what he had discussed with Kislyak, telling him that the two had only exchanged holiday pleasantries. Days after the inauguration, Yates, the acting attorney general, spoke with McGahn at the White House, telling him Justice Department lawyers believed that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Since the Russians knew that Flynn had lied to the vice president, she said, they might have leverage over him. Loading comments...

Miller May 17, 2017 10 Comments At this week's financial analyst meeting, AMD unveiled a 16-core, 32-thread desktop processor called Ryzen Threadripper. At this week's financial analyst meeting, AMD unveiled a 16-core, 32-thread desktop processor called Ryzen Threadripper—its new Epyc brand for server chips—and introduced its first graphics board aimed at the machine learning market. But I was also glad to see the company unveil a roadmap of successive generations in its CPU, GPU, and server lines, with migration to 7nm and 7nm+ process nodes through 2020, which is crucial for the firm to regain credibility with business buyers. At this point, competitors Intel and Nvidia dominate their markets, particularly on the server side, and business buyers need to be convinced that AMD will be a long-term player in order for it to land on the consideration list. "Immersive and instinctive computing will transform all of our daily lives," AMD CEO Lisa Su said at the conference when defining the company's vision for the future. Immersive computing with high-end graphics is all around us, but instinctive computing—which involves using huge amounts of data and machine learning algorithms—is just beginning to evolve. All of this requires "high-performance computing," she said, a term she used to describe all sorts of high-end computing and graphics, not just the HPC or supercomputing market. Su talked at length about investing for "multi-generational leadership" in x86 CPUs, graphics for both PCs and integrated, and software—a big change for a company whose primary products have targeted the mainstream or low-end markets. AMD will now focus on premium products, she said, and noted that while the mainstream accounts for most of its units, the premium part of the market accounts for most of its revenue and profits. Her biggest announcement was probably Epyc, the branding for the new line of server chips, which had been codenamed Naples. Su said that the Zen architecture, which debuted in the Ryzen desktop chips was "created with the new data center in mind." And while she is enthusiastic for what Zen can bring in the desktop and laptop markets, she is even more excited about what Zen can do in the data center market. She talked about how AMD has also targeted the data center market through Radeon Instinct, a version its next-generation graphics architecture known as Vega—which will provide 25 teraflops of performance—and how these would work together in a vision of heterogeneous computing. "Today's data center really requires heterogenous computing to be successful," she said, describing AMD as the only provider of both high-performance computing and graphics. CTO Mark Papermaster gave more detail about the glue that will hold the new chips together, as well as the firm's process for designing new chips in a way that will "provide sustained innovation going forward." Papermaster described the major features of the Zen and Vega architectures for CPUs and GPUs, most of which had been described previously, and said the firm has to design "not only for performance, but also for efficiency." Tying the chips together is the firm's new Infinity Fabric, which connects CPUs, GPUs, memory controllers, and other features within a chip and between chip sockets. Papermaster called Infinity Fabric a "hidden gem," and explained how it includes a control fabric that manages sensors on the chip; can regulate performance and security; and can also work as a data fabric, moving data between the various parts of the system. He said this allows for "near perfect scalability" through 64 CPU cores. AMD is also supporting some new industry standard interconnects between systems, known as Gen-Z & CCIX, as it pushes for open standards (since it doesn't have the heft of Intel in the market). Papermaster said that one big challenge for the firm over the next few years will be "defying the slowing of Moore's Law." He said that through integration, software, and system design it would be able to stay at the pace of generational performance improvement, even without frequency improvements. To that end, he showed roadmaps for both the graphics and CPU lines through 2020, saying that the team was not only rolling out the current generation of products, but working on the next two. The plans show moving to 7nm and 7nm+ production modes, with continuing improvements in both raw performance and performance per watt. While these weren't detailed, they were great to see. A 16-core, 32-Thread CPU and a GPU Aimed at Machine Learning Jim Anderson, General Manager of the Computing and Graphics group, said that in addition to the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 products already announced, a lower-end Ryzen 3 will ship in the third quarter. More importantly, all five of the top PC OEMs (Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo) will have Ryzen desktops available for consumers in the market by the end of the quarter. Commercial desktops should follow in the second half of this year, he said. For those interested in the "absolute highest performance," Anderson announced a new version called Ryzen Threadripper with 16 cores and 32 threads coming "this summer." Anderson said that a mobile version of the Ryzen processor, with on-die Vega graphics, will be available for consumer systems in the second half of 2017. A commercial version should follow in the first half of 2018. He said the mobile chip will offer 50 percent more CPU performance and 40 percent more GPU performance while using 50 percent less power compared to the company's current seventh-generation APU. Meanwhile, in the graphics world, Raja Koduri, Chief Architect for the Radeon Technologies Group, discussed the company's plans for a new series of graphics boards based on the new Vega architecture. Koduri noted that the company's current Polaris architecture GPUs mostly address the mainstream and mid-market segments of the graphics market (with graphics boards under $300), and acknowledged that the company didn't play at the top end. This will change with the new Vega architecture. Among the features Koduri described were a new high-bandwidth cache controller (which can double or quadruple the available memory), a new programmable geometry pipeline, Rapid Packed Math (for 16-bit floating point), and an advanced pixel engine. He showed demos featuring much smoother motion in high-end gaming and said Vega will support 4K 60 Hz gaming. For the professional market, Koduri talked about getting more certifications and supporting SSG, which will allow for a 16GB high-bandwidth cache and up to 2TB of on-board SSG NVME flash memory. He showed demonstrations of this working in real-time ray-tracing and on producing 8K video clips in Adobe Premiere. Koduri then turned his attention to machine learning, where competitor Nvidia has made huge inroads in deep learning with its GPU-based products and its CUDA architecture. He acknowledged that "AMD is not even in the conversation today," but emphasized the company's heterogenous computing approach and what it calls the Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm), which supports running machine learning applications on all of the leading frameworks, including TensorFlow and Caffe. Koduri demonstrated the new product, which will be called Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, and showed that it is very competitive on Baidu's DeepBench machine learning training benchmark. He said this will offer 13 teraflops of performance at 32-bit, 25 teraflops at 16-bit, as well as up to 16GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM2), which is four times that of AMD's current Fury X board. This is due out in late June. One would assume other Vega-based boards will follow shortly. Koduri said that he believes Threadripper and Naples will be disruptive, in part because the CPU bottlenecks will go away, leaving more room for GPU performance. AMD Promises 'A New Day for the Datacenter' Forrest Norrod, SVP and General Manager for the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Business Group, gave details on the Epyc server ship. He said "datacenter leadership" is the company's No. 1 priority, despite having what he described as "a rounding to zero percentage market share." Norrod said the company's previous achievements in server technology—which include having created the first 64-bit x86 cores, high-speed coherent interconnects, and integrated memory controllers—are what make it "plausible… predictable… inevitable" for it to again compete in this market. Norrod said that Epyc will include 32 Zen cores, 8 memory channels, 128 lanes of high bandwidth I/O, and a dedicated security engine. But while that sounds like a huge chip, Norrod explained that the Infinity Fabric Papermaster described earlier enables the chip to actually be built from four 8-core die, which makes it much easier and less expensive to produce. Norrod said that in a two-socket configuration, the chip could offer 64 cores, 4TB memory, and 128 PCI Express lanes, thus giving it 45 percent more cores, 122 percent more memory bandwidth, and 60 percent more I/O than the Xeon E5-2699A v4 (Broadwell). And he presented a couple of demos that showed it outperforming the Xeon in tasks such as compiling Linux. I was more impressed with a demo of how a single-socket version of the chip could outperform a middle of the market dual-socket Intel configuration, which he said accounts for most of the market. (As always, I take vendor benchmarks with a grain of salt, and suggest you do as well.) Epyc will offer the "best value for end users," he said. AMD is looking for leadership in specific segments of the market; Norrod noted it's likely to get traction at first from the bigger datacenter customers who write their own software. One big difference between AMD and Intel's approach, he said, is that every Epyc will be "unrestrained, with all of the I/0, memory channel, high-seed memory, security stack, and integrated chipset features supported on all models. (Intel offers certain features only on higher-end models). Norrod said Epyc offers a simpler architecture compared to Intel, and made a big deal about combining Epyc and the Radeon Instinct platform for machine learning. Norrod said Epyc is scheduled to be launched in late June, with more than 30 server models expected to be shipped this year. Norrod also stressed that this is the first in a series of chips, and presented a roadmap with versions called "Rome" and "Milan" (to follow "Naples") between now and 2020, using 7nm and 7nm+ processes. He emphasized that it isn't all about core performance, but rather continuous innovation. Following a financial presentation, CEO Lisa Su returned to close the event, and told the financial analysts that while the numbers are important, "this company is all about the products." It's certainly good for the industry to have more competition in CPUs, graphics, and especially in the data center market. After all, the periods when we've seen the most competition have also been the periods when we've seen the most innovation.

Before Trump selected him, Flynn told lawyers for Trump’s transition team weeks that he was under investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case Sam Hodgson/The New York Times Politics May 17, 2017 10:17 PM Trump’s transition team knew Flynn was under federal investigation before hiring him By Matthew Rosenberg and Mark Mazzetti New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Donald Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Flynn of the inquiry, Trump made Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported. His legal issues have been a problem for the White House from the beginning and are at the center of a growing political crisis for Trump. Flynn, who was fired after 24 days in the job, was initially kept on even after the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that he might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to Washington. After Flynn’s dismissal, Trump tried to get James B. Comey, the FBI director, to drop the investigation — an act that some legal experts say is grounds for an investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He fired Comey on May 9. The White House declined to comment on whether officials there had known about Flynn’s legal troubles before the inauguration. Flynn, a retired general, is one of a handful of Trump associates under scrutiny in intertwined federal investigations into their financial links to foreign governments and whether any of them helped Russia interfere in the presidential election. In congressional testimony, the acting FBI director, Andrew G. McCabe, has confirmed the existence of a “highly significant” investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s associates and Russian operatives to sway the presidential election. The pace of the investigations has intensified in recent weeks, with a veteran espionage prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, now leading a grand jury inquiry in Northern Virginia that is scrutinizing Flynn’s foreign lobbying and has begun issuing subpoenas to businesses that worked with Flynn and his associates. The New York Times has reviewed one of the subpoenas. It demands all “records, research, contracts, bank records, communications” and other documents related to work with Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group, the business he set up after he was forced out as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The subpoena also asks for similar records about Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and is chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. There is no indication that Alptekin is under investigation. Signed by Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, the subpoena instructs the recipient to direct any questions about its contents to Van Grack. Van Grack, a national security prosecutor based at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, has experience conducting espionage investigations. He prosecuted a businessman for illegally exporting thousands of sensitive electronics components to Iran and a suspected hacker in the Syrian Electronic Army. In 2015, he prosecuted a Virginia man for acting as an unregistered agent of Syria’s intelligence services. According to people who have talked to Flynn about the case, he sees the Justice Department’s investigation as part of an effort by the Obama administration and its holdovers in the government to keep him out of the White House. In his view, this effort began immediately after the election, when President Barack Obama, who had fired Flynn as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Trump that he would have profound concerns about Flynn’s becoming a top national security aide. The people close to Flynn said he believed that when that warning did not dissuade Trump from making him national security adviser, the Justice Department opened its investigation into his lobbying work. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Justice Department or White House officials. The investigation stems from the work Flynn did for Inovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Alptekin, the Turkish businessman. On Aug. 9, Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group signed a contract with Inovo for $600,000 over 90 days to run an influence campaign aimed at discrediting Fethullah Gulen, an reclusive cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a failed coup in Turkey last summer. When he was hired by Alptekin, Flynn did not register as a foreign agent, as required by law when an American represents the interests of a foreign government. Only in March did he file a retroactive registration with the Justice Department because his lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, said that “the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Trump campaign officials first became aware of a problem with Flynn’s business dealings in early November. On Nov. 8, the day of the election, Flynn wrote an op-ed in The Hill that advocated improved relations between Turkey and the United States and called Gulen “a shady Islamic mullah.” “If he were in reality a moderate, he would not be in exile, nor would he excite the animus of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government,” the op-ed said. Days later, after an article in The Daily Caller revealed that the Flynn Intel Group had a contract with Inovo, a Trump campaign lawyer held a conference call with members of the Flynn Intel Group, according to one person with knowledge of the call. The lawyer, William McGinley, was seeking more information about the nature of the group’s foreign work and wanted to know whether Flynn had been paid for the op-ed. McGinley now works in the White House as Cabinet secretary and deputy assistant to the president. The Justice Department also took notice. The op-ed in The Hill raised suspicions that Flynn was working as a foreign agent, and in a letter dated Nov. 30, the Justice Department notified Flynn that it was scrutinizing his lobbying work. Flynn hired a lawyer a few weeks later. By Jan. 4, the day Flynn informed McGahn of the inquiry, the Justice Department was investigating the matter. Kelner then followed up with another call to the Trump transition’s legal team. He ended up leaving a message, identifying himself as Flynn’s lawyer. According to a person familiar with the case, Kelner did not get a call back until two days later, on Jan. 6. Around the time of Flynn’s call with McGahn, the FBI began investigating Flynn on a separate matter: phone conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Current and former U.S. officials said that, on the calls, Flynn discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia for disrupting the November election. After news of the calls became public, Flynn misled Pence about what he had discussed with Kislyak, telling him that the two had only exchanged holiday pleasantries. Days after the inauguration, Yates, the acting attorney general, spoke with McGahn at the White House, telling him Justice Department lawyers believed that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Since the Russians knew that Flynn had lied to the vice president, she said, they might have leverage over him.

Before Trump selected him, Flynn told lawyers for Trump's transition team weeks that he was under investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. (Sam Hodgson/The New York Times) By The New York Times WASHINGTON -- Michael T. Flynn told President Donald Trump's transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Flynn of the inquiry, Trump made Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Flynn's disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team's chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Flynn's lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported. His legal issues have been a problem for the White House from the beginning and are at the center of a growing political crisis for Trump. Flynn, who was fired after 24 days in the job, was initially kept on even after the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that he might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to Washington. After Flynn's dismissal, Trump tried to get James B. Comey, the FBI director, to drop the investigation -- an act that some legal experts say is grounds for an investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He fired Comey on May 9. The White House declined to comment on whether officials there had known about Flynn's legal troubles before the inauguration. Flynn, a retired general, is one of a handful of Trump associates under scrutiny in intertwined federal investigations into their financial links to foreign governments and whether any of them helped Russia interfere in the presidential election. In congressional testimony, the acting FBI director, Andrew G. McCabe, has confirmed the existence of a "highly significant" investigation into possible collusion between Trump's associates and Russian operatives to sway the presidential election. The pace of the investigations has intensified in recent weeks, with a veteran espionage prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, now leading a grand jury inquiry in Northern Virginia that is scrutinizing Flynn's foreign lobbying and has begun issuing subpoenas to businesses that worked with Flynn and his associates. The New York Times has reviewed one of the subpoenas. It demands all "records, research, contracts, bank records, communications" and other documents related to work with Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group, the business he set up after he was forced out as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The subpoena also asks for similar records about Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and is chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. There is no indication that Alptekin is under investigation. According to people who have talked to Flynn about the case, he sees the Justice Department's investigation as part of an effort by the Obama administration and its holdovers in the government to keep him out of the White House. In his view, this effort began immediately after the election, when President Barack Obama, who had fired Flynn as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Trump that he would have profound concerns about Flynn's becoming a top national security aide. The people close to Flynn said he believed that when that warning did not dissuade Trump from making him national security adviser, the Justice Department opened its investigation into his lobbying work. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Justice Department or White House officials. The investigation stems from the work Flynn did for Inovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Alptekin, the Turkish businessman. On Aug. 9, Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group signed a contract with Inovo for $600,000 over 90 days to run an influence campaign aimed at discrediting Fethullah Gulen, an reclusive cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a failed coup in Turkey last summer. When he was hired by Alptekin, Flynn did not register as a foreign agent, as required by law when an American represents the interests of a foreign government. Only in March did he file a retroactive registration with the Justice Department because his lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, said that "the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Trump campaign officials first became aware of a problem with Flynn's business dealings in early November. On Nov. 8, the day of the election, Flynn wrote an op-ed in The Hill that advocated improved relations between Turkey and the United States and called Gulen "a shady Islamic mullah." "If he were in reality a moderate, he would not be in exile, nor would he excite the animus of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government," the op-ed said. Days later, after an article in The Daily Caller revealed that the Flynn Intel Group had a contract with Inovo, a Trump campaign lawyer held a conference call with members of the Flynn Intel Group, according to one person with knowledge of the call. The lawyer, William McGinley, was seeking more information about the nature of the group's foreign work and wanted to know whether Flynn had been paid for the op-ed. McGinley now works in the White House as Cabinet secretary and deputy assistant to the president. The Justice Department also took notice. The op-ed in The Hill raised suspicions that Flynn was working as a foreign agent, and in a letter dated Nov. 30, the Justice Department notified Flynn that it was scrutinizing his lobbying work. Flynn hired a lawyer a few weeks later. By Jan. 4, the day Flynn informed McGahn of the inquiry, the Justice Department was investigating the matter. Kelner then followed up with another call to the Trump transition's legal team. He ended up leaving a message, identifying himself as Flynn's lawyer. According to a person familiar with the case, Kelner did not get a call back until two days later, on Jan. 6. Around the time of Flynn's call with McGahn, the FBI began investigating Flynn on a separate matter: phone conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States. Current and former U.S. officials said that, on the calls, Flynn discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia for disrupting the November election. After news of the calls became public, Flynn misled Pence about what he had discussed with Kislyak, telling him that the two had only exchanged holiday pleasantries. Days after the inauguration, Yates, the acting attorney general, spoke with McGahn at the White House, telling him Justice Department lawyers believed that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Since the Russians knew that Flynn had lied to the vice president, she said, they might have leverage over him.

Aaeon’s Nano-002N follows its Intel 5th Gen “Broadwell” based Nano-001N, which has an identical 150 x 125 x 55mm footprint, and is similarly powered from a Nano-ITX mainboard. The fanless mini-PC, which runs on dual-core, 15W 6th Gen Core “Skylake” U-Series processors, also has many of the same features. However, it breaks out with a pair of M.2 slots, among other changes. Nano-002N, front and back (click images to enlarge) Like the Nano-001N, the Nano-002N has two video ports, but it changes from DisplayPorts to similarly 4K ready HDMI ports. The previous two USB 2.0 ports are gone, but you still get 4x USB 3.0 ports, and the RS-232 header has morphed into a DB9 port for easier accessibility. The biggest change, however, is the replacement of the earlier mini-PCIe slot with two M.2 expansion slots. One defaults to mSATA, and is supported with optional 64GB or 128GB SSDs, and another defaults to PCIe, and is backed up with 4x antenna connectors. Nano-002N detail views (click images to enlarge) Once again, you can load up to 16GB RAM, and the Nano-002N advances to faster DDR4. The mini-PC is further equipped with dual GbE ports, audio jacks, a watchdog, and various buttons and LEDs. The VESA-mountable system again features a 12V-19V DC input.

Not always, but in this case they are with a 48 hour coupon slashing 20% off from select eBay sellers. Coupon code P20FINDYOURTECH doesn’t make great discounts for every category of items we see, but for desktop processors like the latest Intel Core i7-7700K 7th gen quad core processor, we’re seeing excellent discounts. The new i7-7700K is hitting a new low by $5 after coupon with a price drop to $295 (its first time under $300). Other new lows on Intel 7th generation processors include the i7-7700 and the i5-7400. AMD Ryzen processors are also hitting new lows with the eBay coupon. The highest end Ryzen 7 1800x and 1700x are both slashed to $429.99 and $319.99 respetively, which are the lowest prices since their March 2017 debut. The cheapest Ryzen 7 1700 is also at a new low after coupon, but at a different retailer Jet – dropping to $279 (the first time under $290). If you like to game on your iPad, Apple TV, or even iPhone with a wireless controller, a rare Amazon coupon code showed up today on a SteelSeries Nimbus.

The meeting came after the crown prince’s inaugural meeting. (DOD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Brigitte N. Brantley)    ‘We’ve Received No Questions:’ Mattis Says Allies Haven’t Brought Up Trump’s Intel Disclosure Saagar Enjeti Reporter 6:34 PM 05/17/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Secretary of Defense James Mattis pushed back against the assertion that President Donald Trump’s intelligence sharing with Russian officials jeopardized U.S. allied relations, in a series of comments to reporters. Mattis comments follow reports that Trump disclosed an Islamic State plot to down a commercial airliner during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The disclosure drew widespread criticism because Israeli intelligence agencies shared the plot with the U.S. after learning of it from a spy within an ISIS cell somewhere in Iraq or Syria. Israel did not give the U.S. permission to share the intelligence with anyone, and it was considered so sensitive it was not distributed to key U.S. allies like the U.K. The disclosure drew widespread condemnation from U.S. lawmakers and speculation that American allies would no longer share sensitive intelligence with the Trump administration. Former Obama national security council official Ned Price hysterically lamented Tuesday that allies “will think once, they will think twice, or maybe they will stop sharing information with us to begin with if they cannot be confident that we can safeguard their information.” Mattis strongly pushed back against this assertion saying, “We have always safeguarded information from allies … we’ve received no questions at all from anyone.” He elaborated Tuesday that in multiple discussions with U.S. allies the issue “never even came up,” adding that he was “not worried” about Trump’s discussions. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster similarly defended Trump saying “what the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he’s engaged.” Follow Saagar Enjeti on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

This coupon only works with the retailers on this list and has a max savings of $50. It also requires you to use PayPal as your payment method. That's still a lot of savings when you're talking PC hardware that can be tough to find discounts for. All Ryzen 7's and Intel i7's listed below are at or making new price lows.   The savings don't stop at desktop processors, but also extend to a few hot gaming monitors. The HP Omen 32-inch 1440p Freesync, for instance, released in August of 2016 for $430. The price has barely budged since release at HP still garnering a $400 price mark, but today refurbished units on eBay are selling for a record low of $259.99, free ship after coupon.

Share via Email: Israeli startups are driving the car technology revolution. Here’s how. TEL AVIV (JTA) – Israeli startups are revving their engines ahead of the country’s largest-ever “smart transportation” event. Over 200 local companies working in transportation technology will be at the EcoMotion Conference on Thursday at the Peres Center for Peace in Jaffa. The plan is to give auto industry giants a look under the hood of “Startup Nation.” “Companies from around the world want to see what’s happening in Israel,” said Lior Zeno-Zamasky, the executive director of EcoMotion, a networking group for transportation technology companies in Israel that is organizing the conference. “The idea is ultimately to make deals, and I can tell you we’ve had a lot of success stories in the past.” Israel in recent years has become an unlikely center for automotive innovation – it has no car manufacturing to speak of, and the country is notorious for its bad drivers. It started with the electric car company Better Place, which in spite of its high-profile bankruptcy in May 2013 is credited with putting Israel’s automotive tech scene on the map. The next month, Google bought the Raanana-based mapping company Waze for $1 billion. And in March of this year, Intel agreed to acquire the self-driving car technology powerhouse Mobileye, located in Jerusalem, for a record $15 billion. BMW, Ford, General, Honda, Motors, Uber, Volkswagen and Volvo have also invested in Israeli technology since 2016. Now that they have the world’s attention, Israeli entrepreneurs have shifted into overdrive. According to Zeno-Zamasky, at least 550 startups now work in the country’s transportation technology industry. Here are some of the revolutionary things those attending the fifth annual EcoMotion conference are trying to make cars do. Run on electricity with little or no charging The era of the electric vehicle has officially arrived. A couple million plug-in cars are now whirring along roads across the globe, consuming a third as much energy as their gasoline-powered counterparts. Pulling over to recharge them, however, is a buzzkill. So Israeli startups are working on ways to make the pit stops faster and less frequent – or even unnecessary. Tel Aviv-based StoreDot claims to be developing an electric vehicle battery that can be recharged in five minutes — that’s compared to the hours that are typically required today. The company says a single charge would run a car for about 300 miles — farther than almost any electric vehicle now on the market and nearly as much as a gasoline-powered car. StoreDot recently demonstrated proof of the concept on a single battery cell, and previously recharged a smartphone in 30 seconds. Electroad thinks its can do away with plugs altogether. At its headquarters in Caesarea, the company has developed an under-the-pavement wireless technology that recharges electric vehicles while they drive. With “inductive charging,” vehicles can carry lighter, less expensive batteries — and never have to stop to recharge. Israel’s government is working with Electroad to build a half-mile public bus route in Tel Aviv using its technology. If the planned 2018 launch goes well, there are plans for more routes, starting with an 11-mile shuttle between the city of Eilat and the Ramon International Airport in the south. Navigate by ‘sight’ Mobileye provides most of the world’s driver-assistance technology. That includes the sensors — mainly cameras, lidar lasers and radar — and computing power that cars need to “see” the road. And the company is working with Intel and others to roll out a test fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles later this year. But car vision is still far from 20/20, and some Israeli startups apparently think they can do better. Innoviz Technologies, located in Kfar Saba, and Vayavision, from Or Yehuda, are both developing their own lidar laser systems, which use light and radar to determine distance. Meanwhile, Oryx Vision promises “nano antenna” sensors that perform 50 times better and cost much less than the technologies used by Mobileye. Last October, the Petach Tikvah-based startup raised $17 million in its first round of funding. If all goes well, it anticipates seeing its product on the road by 2020. By then, some analysts predict, there will be 10 million self-driving cars in operation. The Mobileye group has set the following year, 2021, as the target for its technology to take the wheel. Talk to each other and the world The cars of the future will communicate to avoid crashes and ease traffic jams. Experts predict some cars will have this ability within a year or two, and the technology will be commonplace in self-driving cars within a decade. Headquartered in Kfar Netter, Autotalks is making chip sets that can link vehicles not just to each other but also to infrastructure and people. The semiconductor company has collaborated with Audi on “smart antennae” and started selling to car equipment manufacturers. In March, it raised $30 million in funding, touting its chips’ compliance with a rule proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation in December that would mandate the use of vehicle-to-vehicle communication in new cars. The department estimated the rule could prevent more than half a million accidents and a thousand U.S. deaths every year. As cars become more connected, Herzliya-based otonomo wants to bring driver and passenger services — from apps to roadside help — via its cloud-based marketplace. It has deals with nine automakers, but as usual, consumers will pay with their data, which otonomo allows automakers to sell. While Autotalks and otonomo provide their own security, Argus Cybersecurity designs systems to protect the electronics that control a vehicle’s basic functions from hackers. The Tel Aviv company does this by analyzing the data that come in and out of a vehicle’s communications systems, which is otherwise highly vulnerable. Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon came up with the idea while serving in Israel’s elite 8200 intelligence unit. For those attached to their regular old car but fed up with driving it, IVO Driver Robot has a solution: a robot that can drive for you. So far, the robot has mostly driven a golf cart-style buggy around a parking lot at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, where it is being developed. But a new and improved version is in the works.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—The first standalone virtual reality headsets based on Google's Daydream design go on sale later this year, Google announced at its I/O developers conference here on Wednesday. The new headsets, from HTC and Lenovo, will come with the built-in positional tracking that smartphone-based models currently lack, and Google promised simplicity: just pick them up and put them on. Qualcomm and Intel have been working on their own reference designs for standalone headsets. Intel teased its Project Alloy set last year, and Qualcomm showed off a model based on the Snapdragon 835 processor at CES in January. The Snapdragon 835 platform apparently impressed Google, and the standalone Daydream headsets will feature Qualcomm processors alongside Google's own tracking technology, which is also found in the Tango augmented reality smartphone platform, first seen on the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. In the race to broaden virtual reality's appeal beyond hardcore video gamers, it is standalone designs that recently emerged as frontrunners, because they can deliver immersive VR experiences complete with motion tracking without being attached to a high-end gaming PC or laptop. Google's current VR headset, the $79 Daydream View, is one of several affordable sets on the market that rely on smartphones to function. It went on sale last fall, and competes against the second-generation Samsung Gear VR, a collaboration between the Korean tech giant and Facebook-owned Oculus. Both headsets require special apps and a narrow range of compatible smartphones to function, however, limiting their appeal among the everyday users their makers keenly want to attract. The Daydream and Gear VR also can't track their wearers' positions relative to the room in which they're standing, a key requirement for immersive VR games and other experiences. Related Hands On: Acer's Windows 10 Mixed Reality Headset Hands On: Acer's Windows 10 Mixed Reality Headset Their alternatives are expensive headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, which cost several hundred dollars and require both external tracking sensors and a cable connection to a PC with a powerful dedicated graphics card. A standalone set like the Daydream reference design announced today combines the best of both worlds: untethered from a computer but with all the tracking and other sensors required to run the most immersive apps. Oculus is working on a standalone headset, too. Its Santa Cruz prototype made a brief debut last fall, but appears to be far from ready to hit store shelves and online shopping carts. If you prefer smartphone-based AR, Google said Lenovo's next flagship smartphone, expected later this year, will support the Daydream platform. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ will also get Daydream support this summer.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Google to offer new AI `supercomputer' chip via cloud 2017-05-17 22:35 - Mark Bergen, Bloomberg News Post a comment 0 share: Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers the keynote address at the Google I/O 2017 Conference at Shoreline Amphitheater. (Pic: Justin Sullivan, AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Google's AlphaGo AI takes on China Speed of AI advancements 'surprise' Google co-founder Microsoft boss doesn’t want AI to ‘replace’ people San Francisco - At the I/O developer conference last year, Google debuted its first chip. The company kept the component mostly for internal artificial intelligence needs. Today, version two arrived - and Google is selling this one. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced the new chip on Wednesday during a keynote address at the Alphabet unit’s annual I/O event. Normally, the gathering focuses on mobile software. This year’s spotlight on hardware underscores Pichai’s effort to transform the search giant into an "AI-first" company and a real cloud-computing contender. Companies will be able to purchase the hardware, called Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), through a Google Cloud service. Google hopes it will quicken the pace of AI advancements. And despite official statements to the contrary, it may also threaten Intel and Nvidia, the main suppliers of powerful semiconductors that run large processing tasks. "This is basically a supercomputer for machine learning," Urs Hölzle, Google’s veteran technical chief, said. Machine learning, a method for deciphering patterns in reams of data, is behind Google’s recent progress on voice recognition, text translation and search rankings. But the approach cost a lot, and sucked up computing time in Google’s data centres. The latest chip was designed to address these issues, and executives said they saw dramatic improvements after putting the component to work on these internal tasks. Google wouldn’t divulge the chip’s price, what company manufactures it, or when the related cloud service goes on sale. Google still purchases processors from Intel and Nvidia. But by relying more on in-house designs, Google could trim its multi-billion-dollar annual computing bill. Google plans more chips like this, and sees the components as essential for success in the cloud - a key part of Alphabet’s push to make money beyond digital advertising. "The field is rapidly evolving," Hölzle said. "For us, it’s very important to advance machine learning for our own purposes and to be the best cloud." During his morning keynote, Pichai also introduced a flurry of machine learning updates for Google’s products, including a photo-editing tool and new features for its digital assistant. He also unveiled a new web portal housing all of the company’s artificial intelligence efforts. Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers the keynote address at the Google I/O 2017 Conference at Shoreline Amphitheater.  (Pic: Justin Sullivan, AFP) Google’s cloud business grew by more than 80% last year, according to estimates from Synergy Research Group. But Amazon Web Services still has over 40% of the public cloud market, and continues to expand at a steady clip. Google is third, according to industry estimates.  To gain share, Google is leaning on its AI prowess. The Cloud TPU chip won’t be sold to Dell and other makers of servers that power traditional corporate data centers. To get the benefits, customers will have to sign up for a Google cloud service and run their software tasks and store their data on Google’s equipment. If companies get on board, Google insists, they can plumb their own data for unseen efficiency gains and profit.  AWS and no. 2 player Microsoft, make similar cases. So Google’s pitch stresses performance. A single Cloud TPU device, composed of four chips, is nearly 12 000 times faster than IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer, the famous chess victor from 1997, Hölzle said. Google is stringing 64 of the devices into "pods" that sit in its data centres. Google unveiled its chip at last year’s I/O conference, so why does it need another? First, the company is going up against rivals that develop and deliver faster processors on an annual cadence. To lock in customers, it must match that pace. Mathematical models In addition, the original chip only worked for "inference," processing data that’s already packaged in mathematical models. It’s akin to compressing large photos into tiny digital formats. For instance, a company could turn an algorithm for voice recognition into an app using inference chips.  To create an algorithm from just raw voices, you need lots of data to train AI software. That takes massive computing power, forcing coders to wait days or weeks to see results. Google’s second chip speeds up the training process. In internal tests, it cut the time in half compared to commercially available graphic processing units, known as GPUs. Nvidia, the dominant GPU manufacturer, recently announced a new chip, called Volta, that handles training data like Google’s Cloud TPU. An eight-chip Volta module will sell for $149 000 starting in the third quarter. Google is less experienced at selling chips, so it’s being cautious about commercial deployment. "When you have something that’s really new, some of the tools occasionally break. You want to reach a certain level of maturity," Hölzle said. "We’re probably going to have a lot more demand than we can satisfy." Excessive demand inspired the creation of TPUs in the first place, according to company lore. Six years ago, Google saw an uptick in voice searches on phones. Just three minutes of conversation a day, per Android phone user, would have doubled the number of data centres Google needed, based on its technology at the time. TPUs were designed to handle the extra volume more efficiently. The second-generation chip accelerated Google’s own research. For its translation efforts, Google previously ignored more than eighty percent of its data at the training stage, according to Jeff Dean, who leads a Google AI research unit called Brain. With its new chip, they can use all the information. That means better trained and potentially more accurate AI software. High computing costs The new chip may let researchers use image data that currently sits unused because of high computing costs, according to Fei-Fei Li, an AI expert who runs a machine learning group inside Google’s Cloud business division. Image classification is one of the machine learning tools Li’s team is offering cloud clients, and the new chip will make this more accessible and usable. EBay used Google’s cloud to develop ShopBot software that identifies items snapped on smartphone cameras. Today’s image-recognition systems have around 10% accuracy, said RJ Pittman, eBay’s Chief Product Officer. The new Cloud TPU, which eBay has not yet tested, could eventually increase accuracy to more than 90%, he added. Companies like eBay want AI to tag every physical good in existence. Li imagines businesses that may want to map every square inch on earth or each minute part of a human cell. Amazon and Microsoft have their own AI-powered cloud services too though, and both have committed to buy Nvidia’s Volta chips. "Nvidia is not standing still," said Pittman from eBay, which also buys Nvidia GPUs. Hölzle dismissed a direct rivalry. Nvidia’s chips are built for more general-purpose tasks, he said, while Google’s focus solely on machine learning. That won’t calm Intel and Nvidia investors, who worry about in-house chipmaking efforts by their largest customers - data centre operators like Google. Analysts are concerned that revenue and profitability at the two companies, both at historically high levels, may be dented. Even if Google doesn’t succeed in commercialising its own chips, it’s in a better position to negotiate on price. Google isn’t restricting cloud customers to its own chips. It has Intel and Nvidia processors running inside its data centres. Google’s pushing a Lego-like model - corporate customers can choose their combination of software and hardware, and rent storage and computing power by the minute. It has to be flexible if it’s going to catch AWS and Microsoft. "Down the road, we make actually pick the hardware for you that minimises your cost or maximises your turnaround time or whatever you tell us is important to you," Hölzle said. "It becomes invisible to you."Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: google  |  artificial intelligence  |  computing share: More In This Category SABC exec: Aguma sick but not out as acting CEO Rwanda fines MTN R111.5m over licence duties Telkom subsidiary CEB-Africa to strike over lay-offs James Aguma no longer acting SABC CEO Most Popular Read James Aguma no longer acting SABC CEO Here's how to protect yourself against WannaCry and other malware SABC advertises Hlaudi’s old job as hearings set to begin SABC exec: Aguma sick but not out as acting CEO Rwanda fines MTN R111.5m over licence duties Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

REUTERS/Alexander Zemlianichenko    Russian Spies Are ‘High-Fiving One Another’ After Trump’s Intel Leak, Says Former CIA Chief Russ Read Pentagon/Foreign Policy Reporter 3:42 PM 05/17/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Russia’s spies are “high-fiving each other” in response to President Donald Trump’s disclosure of classified intelligence to Russian diplomats, according to a former CIA director. The revelation is yet another example of Russia’s successful “covert influence campaign” against the U.S., Michael Hayden told The Cipher Brief in an interview published Wednesday. He acknowledged that Trump certainly had the right to disclose the information as president, but the information coming from a foreign ally could harm existing intelligence sharing relationships. “I think they’ll be high-fiving one another again for the success of their covert influence campaign from last summer, which is apparently continuing,” said Hayden, when asked about the Kremlin’s response. “What they have done is to create chaos inside the American political system with little cost to themselves.” The intelligence was given to Trump by Israel, according to a New York Times report. Two Mossad chiefs have claimed Israeli intelligence should reconsider sharing future classified information with the U.S. as a result of Trump’s actions. “If tomorrow I were asked to pass information to the CIA, I would do everything I could to not pass it to them. Or I would first protect myself and only then give it, and what I’d give would be totally neutered,” said former Mossad head Sabtai Savit in an interview with The Times of Israel published Wednesday.

Hayden noted that, historically, one state does not pass on the intelligence information of another without permission. “It’s a hard and fast rule within the intelligence profession that you do not pass information onto a third party without the permission of the original source of the information,” said the former CIA director. Now that U.S. allies have seen Trump disregard the historical precedent, they may hesitate to cooperate with the U.S. on intelligence matters, according to Hayden. “Now can I measure that? No. Can we get over that over the long-term? Probably. But there’s a reason there’s a third party rule. And there are consequences when you decide to disregard it,” he added.

Nvidia’s chips are built for more general-purpose tasks, he said, while Google’s focus solely on machine learning. That won’t calm Intel and Nvidia investors, who worry about in-house chip-making efforts by their largest customers — data centre operators like Google. Analysts are concerned that revenue and profitability at the two companies, both at historically high levels, may be dented. Even if Google doesn’t succeed in commercialising its own chips, it’s in a better position to negotiate on price. Google isn’t restricting cloud customers to its own chips. It has Intel and Nvidia processors running inside its data centres. Google’s pushing a Lego-like model — corporate customers can choose their combination of software and hardware, and rent storage and computing power by the minute. It has to be flexible if it’s going to catch AWS and Microsoft. “Down the road, we make actually pick the hardware for you that minimises your cost or maximises your turnaround time or whatever you tell us is important to you,” Hölzle said. “It becomes invisible to you.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 11Trevor Manuel blasts Eskom board 7Gov’t reverses course on TV encryption 5State won’t appeal nuclear ruling 5Telkom rockets higher on earnings 5Samsung replaces ADH for S8, S8+ Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The New York Times on Tuesday reported that President Trump asked Comey to end the federal probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn in February. Comey wrote in a memo shortly after the Feb. 14 meeting that Trump told him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” the report said. The Trump administration is scrambling to contain the fallout from Trump’s unexpected firing of Comey last week. Comey’s ouster has stirred fierce controversy as it came during the FBI’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race, including possible ties between Russia and Trump’s campaign.

"[The Committee] today called on FBI to provide all memos relating to former FBI Director Comey's interactions with his superiors in both the Trump and Obama administrations," the release posted by the committee stated. "They also called on the White House to provide records of interactions with Comey, including any audio recordings."

Other US lawmakers, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, have urged Comey to testify as soon as possible before various congressional committees. Flynn resigned in February after media reports revealed he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. ...

REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/Lucas Jackson/Abir Sultan/Pool/File Photo    Former Mossad Chiefs: Israel Should Hold Off On Sharing Intel With US After Trump Leak Russ Read Pentagon/Foreign Policy Reporter 1:52 PM 05/17/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Two former Israel intelligence chiefs have suggested Israel should consider holding back intelligence from the U.S. in light of President Donald Trump’s recent disclosure to Russia. “If tomorrow I were asked to pass information to the CIA, I would do everything I could to not pass it to them. Or I would first protect myself and only then give it, and what I’d give would be totally neutered,” Shabtai Shavit, who headed Mossad in the 1990s, told The Times of Israel in a phone interview published Wednesday. “If some smart guy decides that he’s allowed to leak information, then your partners in cooperation will be fewer or just won’t be at all.” Shavit’s comments follow reports that Trump divulged highly classified intelligence to Russian diplomats during a meeting earlier this month. The New York Times has claimed Israel provided the information, which ABC then reported came from a spy inside the Islamic State terrorist group. Israel has not acknowledged it is the source of the intelligence, while the president defended his decision in a series of Tweets Tuesday, claiming that he shared the information in order to get Russia to bolster its efforts in the fight against ISIS. Israel and the U.S. have a long history of intelligence sharing, which has become increasingly important in the face of the threats posed by Iran and ISIS. But for former Mossad Chief Danny Yatom, Trump’s actions were a step too far.

Trump’s disclosure was hardly the first time a president has declassified information, nor is it the first time a U.S. leader has failed to keep shared intelligence secret. “It is amazing how countries continue to deal with us even after all kinds of leaks but it is because they are so dependent on our intelligence,” Joseph Wippl, a former CIA officer and current Professor of Practice at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “I’ve heard senior U.S. government promises of secrecy but compromised as soon as it became politically expedient.” Follow Russ Read on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11% of the Cupertino, California-based company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14% more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future. Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system. At last year’s conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall. -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.  BREAKING NEWS NEDA statement on Q1 GDP data PHL Q1 GDP eases to 6.4%, below gov't target band ...more    MORE STORIES Apple plans laptop upgrades as Microsoft enters market HPE unveils computer made for era of Big Data’ Snapchat encourages UK millennials to vote WannaCry ransomware attack eases, hacking group threatens to sell code Eleven-year-old stuns experts showing toys can be ‘weapons’ Amazon adds touchscreen to new Alexa speaker Cell phones ring changes for Nigeria’s music industry Banks worldwide see growing cyber threat New particle accelerator at CERN may help both doctors and art sleuths Switch to online shopping is hurting Coke -- CEO    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

The Partnership on AI adds Intel, Salesforce and others as it formalizes Grand Challenges and work groups Posted yesterday by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story As technology lends you its ear, these technologies will determine what it hears Intel, Salesforce, eBay, Sony, SAP, McKinsey & Company, Zalando and Cogitai are joining the Partnership on AI, a collection of companies and non-profits that have committed to sharing best practices and communicating openly about the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence research. The new members will be working alongside existing partners that include Facebook, Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Apple. Collectively, the partners will be hosting a series of AI Grand Challenges to incentivize researchers to contribute to key roadblocks in the field and to address some of the social and societal ramifications of artificial intelligence research. The group is also announcing a best paper award for the greatest contribution to “AI, People, and Society,” to aid in addressing a similar goal. In addition to the paper awards and challenges, the Partnership on AI will also be establishing topic and sector-specific work groups to make good on the group’s promise to generate a list of best practices for researchers. The success of these projects depends on being able to build a community around the partnership, independent from larger partners. A new Civil Society Fellowship program will provide resources to anyone who feels they can help improve the impact that AI research has on the world, helping to kickstart outside involvement. In addition to the new corporate partners, the group also announced that fourteen non-profits would be contributing to the organization. This group includes non-profits with an interest in promoting continued research in AI and ensuring equality of access to its benefits. The full list of new non-profit partners includes the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, the AI Forum of New Zealand, the Centre for Democracy & Technology, the Centre for Internet and Society – India, Data & Society Research Institute, the Digital Asia Hub, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Future of Humanity Institute, the Future of Privacy Forum, the Human Rights Watch, the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, UNICEF, Upturn, and the XPRIZE Foundation. The Partnership on AI is currently hunting for an Executive Director who will help to manage the organization’s operations. The team says it is still open to new partners so it would be reasonable to expect the list to continue to grow in the coming months.

Apple reportedly will announce its latest MacBook and MacBook Pro, and is also considering updating the MacBook Air, which hasn’t been upgraded in years. Read: MacBook Pro Touch Bar Problems: Apple Users Complain Of 'Popping' Sound Coming From Laptop The MacBook Pro reportedly will come with a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel. Apple is also working on a new 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip, the report said.  As for the MacBook Air, the company will update the 13-inch laptop with a new processor. The new MacBook Pro will look much like the previous model and will mostly differ in internal architecture. Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro that manages the laptops low-power mode, but it’s unclear whether it will be included in the June’s lineup. The current MacBook Pro was released last fall and featured the Touch Bar. However, the laptop faced hurdles with its battery. Consumer Reports declined in December to recommend the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar because of “highly inconsistent” poor battery life tests. In Febraury, users reported experiencing problems with the MacBook Pro’s keyboard, and other users said they were hearing a “popping” noise coming from their units. The new lineup could win back disappointed MacBook fans. Apple’s new laptops could also help against competition from Microsoft, which recently introduced the Surface Laptop. Read: Surface Laptop: Why The Windows 10 S MacBook Clone May Struggle - Price, Specs & More The new MacBook lineup also could help Apple with its declining iPad sales. A recent report said Apple could phase out the iPad Mini. Apple already discontinued the iPad Mini 4 32GB model earlier this year and previously dropped the iPad Air. Apple is expected to introduce the iPad Pro 2 at the upcoming WWDC, which will take place next month in San Jose, California. What Else Will Be Announced In WWDC? Along with the MacBook lineup, Apple is also expected to announce an update to macOS at WWDC, as well as tvOS and watchOS. The company could give the work a preview of iOS 11 for iPads and iPhones. The update is supposed to boost Siri capabilities and introduce Theater Mode for devices. iOS 11 is also rumored to revamp the Music App to push Apple’s original video content. The company is also expected to announce another device: a Siri speaker. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said there is an "over 50 percent chance” the speaker will be revealed at WWDC. The Siri speaker will compete with Amazon’s multiple Alexa-powered devices and Google Home. Amazon already debuted two Echo devices this spring, the Echo Look, which acts like a style assistant, and the Echo Show, which comes with a built-in display. Apple is also expected to announce developments in Apple Pay.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / AMD unveils ‘Threadripper’ 16C/32T and ‘EPYC’ 32C CPUs AMD unveils ‘Threadripper’ 16C/32T and ‘EPYC’ 32C CPUs Matthew Wilson 21 hours ago CPU, Featured Tech News Last night, AMD held its Financial Analyst Day meeting, all with the purpose of clearly outlining its product roadmaps and unveiling the rest of its 2017 release plans. Not only did we hear about AMD’s future GPU plans, but the company also unveiled its upcoming ‘Threadripper’ and ‘EPYC’ CPUs. Threadripper will be part of AMD’s HEDT platform, offering 16 cores and 32 threads, meanwhile ‘EPYC’ is a 32-core SoC aimed to take on the data centre world. Let’s start of with Threadripper. This 16C/32T CPU is going to be the flagship of AMD’s Zen HEDT platform. This new platform will include expanded memory and I/O bandwidth and will go head to head against Intel’s upcoming Skylake-X offerings, which we caught wind of a few days ago. Not many technical details were given for Threadripper but given that the Ryzen 7 1800x aimed to tackle the Core i7 6900K, I would assume that these HEDT CPUs will tackle Intel’s highest end ‘Extreme Edition’ chips, like the 6950x. For more information on AMD’s upcoming HEDT platform, we did receive some leaked information back in March, going over the X390 chipset. Now let’s talk about EPYC. This is AMD’s big Xeon competitor, which we previously knew as ‘Naples’. AMD first began previewing this new CPU back in March, with the goal of re-asserting itself in the datacentre and high-performance server markets. The first EPYC-based servers will be launching in June with support from OEMs and channel partners. According to AMD, EPYC succeeds over its ‘closest competing platform’ by offering 45% more cores, 60% more input/output capacity (I/O), and 122% more memory bandwidth. Here are the key features AMD has listed for EPYC: A highly scalable, 32-core System-on-a-chip (SoC) design, with support for two high-performance threads per core. Industry-leading memory bandwidth, with 8 channels of memory per EPYC device3. In a dual-socket server, support for up to 32 DIMMS of DDR4 on 16 memory channels, delivering up to 4 terabytes of total memory capacity. Complete SoC with fully integrated, high-speed I/O supporting 128 lanes of PCIe® 3, negating the need for a separate chip-set. Highly-optimized cache structure for high-performance, energy-efficient computing. Infinity Fabric coherent interconnect for two EPYC CPUs in a dual-socket system. Dedicated security hardware. Aside from that, we can expect AMD’s Ryzen PRO offerings in the second half of 2017, with ‘mobile’ versions of these CPUs landing in the first half of 2018. Ryzen 3 processors will be arriving in Q3 and finally, Ryzen mobile APUs with Zen CPU cores and Vega graphics are on the way. These are the ‘Raven Ridge’ APUs we have seen in recent leaks. KitGuru Says: The Ryzen 7 launch was really just the beginning for AMD, there is still plenty more to come in the high-end desktop and datacentre markets, as we have seen today. What do you guys think of AMD’s next wave of Zen-based chips?  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags AMD EPYC news Threadripper Previous AMD updates GPU roadmap, announces Radeon Vega ‘Frontier Edition’ Next The Witcher is getting a Netflix series Check Also Qualcomm is now suing Apple’s suppliers too, including Foxconn The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is continuing to get uglier, with the chip maker … Domaldel Well, that’s impressive. Looking forwards to the results of benches and to see the prices. =) Nikolas Karampelas I hope they do good and gain back some market, it is better for all of us to be some healthy competition in the hardware space. Rocky40 Yep looks good it also will cost a lot too but hopefully cheaper than Intel offerings. If it is cheaper they have a chance to gain back some market share for sure. To bad Intel decided to take mainstream CPU’s such as the 7700K & 7600K and put them on the 2066 socket and rename them to i7 7740K & i7 7640K. These 2 CPU’s will be the ones the reviewers will pit the new AMD beasts up against in the games and everyone will once again say oh AMD sucks at gaming like they did when R7’s were pitted up against much higher clocked i7 7700K’s at 5ghz. Intel knew AMD was gonna release these massive high core count CPU’s hence the reason the lowly i7 & i5 quads were photocopied over to the big boy platform in such a rush. I call it down & dirty tricks and the review websites play right into Intel’s hands. Well most websites do I am happy KitGuru at least tried to keep a somewhat level playing field..Thanks Polls Likely cost of your next earphones (not headphones)?

However, the MacBook looks set to make is WWDC return this year, Bloomberg claims, having heard from "people familiar with the matter" that claim Apple is planning to launch three new laptops during its typically software-focused keynote.  First up, the report claims, is a new MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake internals. It's unclear if both 13in and 15in models, which are currently offered with Intel's 6th-gen Skylake processor, will be updated.  Bloomberg notes that Apple's rumoured homegrown ARM-based chip, which will reportedly work alongside the Intel CPU to manage low-power tasks, could make its debut inside the new MacBook Pros, although adds that it's "unclear if it's ready for this generation".  Beyond that, the new MacBook Pro "would look much the same as the latest model", which means you can expect to find Apple's secondary 'Touch Bar' display, a Touch ID sensor and USB-C connectivity. WWDC will also see a refresh of Apple's 12in MacBook, which will also come with a new Intel chip, and an update to the 13in MacBook Air, which hasn't seen an upgrade since 2015.  Bloomberg notes that we, unsurprisingly, won't be seeing the launch of a new Mac Pro. Earlier this year, Apple apologised for its last crack at the desktop PC, and has promised that it's working on a replacement. However, it said that it wouldn't be arriving this year. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Laptops Apple MacBook Laptops wwdc Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

See related  Intel creates autonomous car division BMW 5-Series saloon and Touring: Prices, specs and reviews Waymo offers public rides in self-driving cars In a statement, BMW said the British automotive technology company would be a "system integrator" for the group's "state-of-the-art autonomous driving platform". The partnership aimed to "develop solutions" for the automotive market and "potentially other industries", it added. Delphi is expected to "work directly with Intel and Mobileye on sensor fusion and highly automated driving software", TechCrunch reports. It has already provided a prototype of the system. Chief executive Kevin Clark, said: "This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale." However, the collaboration is "not exclusive", says BMW, leaving Delphi free to continue developing systems for other manufacturers and suppliers. Delphi and Intel have already previously partnered on developing autonomous vehicle technology, says TechCrunch, resulting in a self-driving Audi SQ5 SUV which appeared at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, offering autonomous rides around Las Vegas. BMW says it and its three technology partners aim to to release its first autonomous vehicle "by 2021".

The tech major has been dragging its feet when it comes to upgrading its laptops, but this state of affairs could come to an end at its WWDC event which kicks off on June 5. 3 of Apple’s notebooks will be getting revamped. First up on the docket is the MacBook Pro. The device is probably going to look just like its 2016-era variant. Changes will likely be internal thanks to specs like a faster Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple has apparently been toiling away at an in-house ARM-based chipset for a future MacBook Pro that could be focused on managing the laptop’s low-power mode. However, it’s not clear whether the SoC will make its way to the 2017 MacBook Pro. Also See: Apple patent transforms your iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Next up is the 12-inch MacBook. The offering was last updated in Spring 2016 with the addition of a new rose gold model. The new version is all set to get a faster Intel CPU. Even the 13-inch MacBook Air will probably be at the receiving end of a new processor. Apple’s been pretty negligent when it comes to the MacBook Air, having last upgraded it with a speed boost in 2015. Moreover, the razor-thin notebook’s design hasn’t seen much change in 7 years. This doesn’t appear to have affected its popularity though, since the product’s sales are still going strong, perhaps buoyed by the fact that it’s the brand’s cheapest laptop. All-in-all, the upcoming MacBook refresh don’t come across as major upgrades. Apple’s motivation in revamping the series may have something to do with Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop. The device is generally seen as a worthy rival to the MacBook Air. Announcing new notebooks would therefore serve to undercut that competition by presenting consumers with new options and continue the Mac lineup’s recent momentum. On the software side of things, Apple is probably going to announce a fresh version of macOS.

An upgraded MacBook Air lineup is also being considered. tech Updated: May 17, 2017 15:40 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times Apple’s MacBook laptops’ impressive sales over the years have been fuelled by their consistent performance and build quality. And to keep the momentum going, Apple could be upgrading their MacBook lineup at WWDC — a developer conference focused on Apple’s software platforms. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple will be upgrading the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook with newer and faster processors from Intel. An upgraded MacBook Air lineup is also being considered. Mac computers set up Apple to become one of the most influential companies in the world. Even though iPhones overshadow Macs in revenue and sales, it’s an important part of their legacy. So, it’s important for Apple to update its lineup and keep up with the evolving Windows devices. Windows has taken a much more radical route by making the OS and hardware like the Surface lighter and faster. While Apple only introduced touch on their laptops in the form of Touch Bar, Microsoft has been trying to bridge the gap between laptops and tablets with the entire screen being touchsceen. The report also states that the new device will be more of an inside overhaul than cosmetic. The company already started omitting the lit-up Apple logo in favour of sleeker screens and with the new range, they might be aiming at making them more power efficient and cooler during peak performance. Even though Apple’s MacBooks have sustained their popularity, the company must be feeling the pressure since the Surface lineup is targeting the creative community. Whether the internal improvements bring the competitive edge back to Apple, only time will tell. more from tech Facebook to refund advertisers overcharged by a bug May 17, 2017 14:38 IST PayTM sold 40 kg gold through Digital Gold product in 2 months May 17, 2017 14:29 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Even the core (no pun intended) numbers match! Now AMD is training its guns on its other big rival in the desktop computing space: NVIDIA and its graphics cards. The company has finally announced the high-end graphics monsters its fans have been clamoring for. But more than just trying to appeal to the usual gaming and creator crowds, AMD is aiming for one of NVIDIA’s new favorite audience: machine learning enthusiasts. Graphics processing units or GPUs have been designed to excel at number crunching, sometimes exponentially better than CPUs. While that primarily was intended for, well, graphics processing, recent trends have exploited those capabilities for other number-crunching uses, like machine learning. NVIDIA has been trying to corner that market, especially with its latest Pascal graphics architecture. It has been pushing its silicon to anything from AI research to self-driving cars. With the Radeon Vega, AMD is pushing back. With 64 compute units, the Frontier, the first graphics card based on this new architecture, boasts of 13 teraflops of single-precision performance. AMD claims it offers 30% more performance than “today’s most powerful machine learning GPU, referring to NVIDIA’s recently unveiled Tesla P100. Unlike that, however, the AMD Radeon Vega Frontier Edition is being marketed to the public, be they gamers or computer scientists. With that much power, the Radeon Vega Frontier is also billed to be perfect for VR workloads. You’ll have to wait sometime later this quarter before you can put that to the test, however. Availability and pricing for the Frontier have yet to be announced. In addition to its big GPU announcement, AMD also revealed more CPU plans for this year. The more budget-friendly Ryzen 3 CPUs are still on track for a Q3 2017 launch. AMD is also planning to launch new “Raven Ridge” mobile processors in the second half of the year to target 2-in-1 tablets, ultraportables, and even gaming devices.

Morgan Stanley defended IBM against Warren Buffett's comments, Apple got multiple price target increases, and Variety said Google this week will show off its latest virtuality reality headset. By Tiernan Ray May 17, 2017 1:17 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Here are some things going on today in your world of tech: IBM (IBM) stock closed up 2.17, or 1.4%, at $153.68, after Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty told investors not to worry about Warren Buffett's recent statements that he is unwinding his position in the stock. To Huberty, IBM’s transformation into a new a cloud company is proceeding, which means it’s just not the kind of boring dividend payer that Buffett was interested in. Shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) declined 42 cents, or 3%, to $12.33, in late trading, as the company’s chief executive, Lisa Su, and her team discussed forthcoming products at their analyst day meeting with Wall Street. Su unveiled branding for a server chip, “Epyc,” and a “high-end” PC chip, “ThreadRipper." But the event had been preceded by a rumor that AMD had won a deal to license its graphics technology to Intel (INTC), something Fuad Abazovic of Fudzilla wrote Tuesday morning was “confirmed,” without citing sources. When AMD didn’t announce any deal at this afternoon’s event, it obviously disappointed some who had bid up the stock by 12% during the regular session. Among early responses from those attending, Oppenheimer & Co.’s Rick Schafer, who has a Perform rating on the stock, writes that the new server part, and a graphics chip called “Vega” are facing "uncertain demand,” and so "we remain in wait-and-see mode before modeling significant sustainable profitability." Shares of Apple (AAPL) closed down 23 cents, or $155.47, despite Canaccord Genuity's Mike Walkley reiterating a Buy rating and raising his price target to $180 from $165, after raising estimates for next year, based on pent-up demand for the presumed forthcoming “iPhone 8.” Walkley wrote that Apple is still taking home almost all the profits in the smartphone business, something he thinks will continue. The stock got yet another price target hike this evening, from BMO Capital’s Tim Long, who reiterated an Outperform rating, and raised his target to $170 from $160, given that he thinks the stock multiple will rise to match the broader market, at 16 times next year’s earnings, because that’s what Apple stock did when the iPhone 6 came out. In the latest development in the spat between Western Digital (WDC) and Toshiba (6502JP), Reuters’s Ami Miyazaki and Taiga Uranaka reported that Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said during a briefing that “it's very important for Toshiba and Western Digital to cooperate,” though he said the government wouldn't intervene. That follows Western Sunday saying it had requested arbitration to block Toshiba’s selling the joint-venture chip unit they run to an outside bidder. In response, RBC Capital’s Amit Daryanani wrote today that "Toshiba minister comments validate our base line – WDC eventually ends-up with Toshiba Memory (or gets controlling interest), which should unlock sizable accretion." Shares of Alphabet’s (GOOGL)rose by $5.39, or half a percent, to close at $964.61, in advance of Google’s “I/O” developer conference. Among things you may see, Variety’s Janko Roettgers wrote Tuesday that the company will unveil its "next-generation virtual reality headset,” citing multiple unnamed sources. It’s a "standalone mobile VR device,” writes Roettgers, something that wouldn’t need a PC like Facebook’s (FB) “Oculus Rift." Shares of online marketplace Etsy (ETSY) soared $2.41, or 21%, to close at $13.73, after activist investors Dragoneer and TPG Capital ganged up on online crafts marketplace Etsy on Monday evening, announcing they would like to discuss "strategic alternatives" for the company, after taking a combined 8% position in the stock.

Over 200 local companies working in transportation technology will be at the EcoMotion Conference on Thursday at the Peres Center for Peace in Jaffa. The plan is to give auto industry giants a look under the hood of “Startup Nation.” “Companies from around the world want to see what’s happening in Israel,” said Lior Zeno-Zamasky, the executive director of EcoMotion, a networking group for transportation technology companies in Israel that is organizing the conference. “The idea is ultimately to make deals, and I can tell you we’ve had a lot of success stories in the past.” Israel in recent years has become an unlikely center for automotive innovation – it has no car manufacturing to speak of, and the country is notorious for its bad drivers. It started with the electric car company Better Place, which in spite of its high-profile bankruptcy in May 2013 is credited with putting Israel’s automotive tech scene on the map. The next month, Google bought the Raanana-based mapping company Waze for $1 billion. And in March of this year, Intel agreed to acquire the self-driving car technology powerhouse Mobileye, located in Jerusalem, for a record $15 billion. BMW, Ford, General, Honda, Motors, Uber, Volkswagen and Volvo have also invested in Israeli technology since 2016. The Mobileye logo on a car in Jerusalem, March 14, 2017. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) Now that they have the world’s attention, Israeli entrepreneurs have shifted into overdrive. According to Zeno-Zamasky, at least 550 startups now work in the country’s transportation technology industry. Here are some of the revolutionary things those attending the fifth annual EcoMotion conference are trying to make cars do. Run on electricity with little or no charging The era of the electric vehicle has officially arrived. A couple million plug-in cars are now whirring along roads across the globe, consuming a third as much energy as their gasoline-powered counterparts. Pulling over to recharge them, however, is a buzzkill. So Israeli startups are working on ways to make the pit stops faster and less frequent – or even unnecessary. Tel Aviv-based StoreDot claims to be developing an electric vehicle battery that can be recharged in five minutes — that’s compared to the hours that are typically required today. The company says a single charge would run a car for about 480 kilometers (300 miles) — farther than almost any electric vehicle now on the market and nearly as much as a gasoline-powered car. StoreDot recently demonstrated proof of the concept on a single battery cell, and previously recharged a smartphone in 30 seconds. Electroad thinks its can do away with plugs altogether. At its headquarters in Caesarea, the company has developed an under-the-pavement wireless technology that recharges electric vehicles while they drive. With “inductive charging,” vehicles can carry lighter, less expensive batteries — and never have to stop to recharge. Israel’s government is working with Electroad to build a half-mile public bus route in Tel Aviv using its technology. If the planned 2018 launch goes well, there are plans for more routes, starting with an 11-mile shuttle between the city of Eilat and the Ramon International Airport in the south. Navigate by ‘sight’ Mobileye provides most of the world’s driver-assistance technology. That includes the sensors — mainly cameras, lidar lasers and radar — and computing power that cars need to “see” the road. And the company is working with Intel and others to roll out a test fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles later this year. But car vision is still far from 20/20, and some Israeli startups apparently think they can do better. Innoviz Technologies, located in Kfar Saba, and Vayavision, from Or Yehuda, are both developing their own lidar laser systems, which use light and radar to determine distance. Meanwhile, Oryx Vision promises “nano antenna” sensors that perform 50 times better and cost much less than the technologies used by Mobileye. Last October, the Petach Tikvah-based startup raised $17 million in its first round of funding. If all goes well, it anticipates seeing its product on the road by 2020. By then, some analysts predict, there will be 10 million self-driving cars in operation. The Mobileye group has set the following year, 2021, as the target for its technology to take the wheel. Talk to each other and the world The cars of the future will communicate to avoid crashes and ease traffic jams. Experts predict some cars will have this ability within a year or two, and the technology will be commonplace in self-driving cars within a decade. Headquartered in Kfar Netter, Autotalks is making chip sets that can link vehicles not just to each other but also to infrastructure and people. The semiconductor company has collaborated with Audi on “smart antennae” and started selling to car equipment manufacturers. In March, it raised $30 million in funding, touting its chips’ compliance with a rule proposed by the US Department of Transportation in December that would mandate the use of vehicle-to-vehicle communication in new cars. The department estimated the rule could prevent more than half a million accidents and a thousand US deaths every year. As cars become more connected, Herzliya-based otonomo wants to bring driver and passenger services — from apps to roadside help — via its cloud-based marketplace. It has deals with nine automakers, but as usual, consumers will pay with their data, which otonomo allows automakers to sell. While Autotalks and otonomo provide their own security, Argus Cybersecurity designs systems to protect the electronics that control a vehicle’s basic functions from hackers. The Tel Aviv company does this by analyzing the data that come in and out of a vehicle’s communications systems, which is otherwise highly vulnerable. Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon came up with the idea while serving in Israel’s elite 8200 intelligence unit. For those attached to their regular old car but fed up with driving it, IVO Driver Robot has a solution: a robot that can drive for you. So far, the robot has mostly driven a golf cart-style buggy around a parking lot at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, where it is being developed. But a new and improved version is in the works.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Novartis Foundation and Partners Launch Initiative to Tackle Hypertension and Its Root Causes in Low-Income Urban Communities Better Hearts Better Cities is an initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension SOURCE: Novartis DESCRIPTION: Better Hearts Better Cities is a Novartis Foundation initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, are a growing health crisis with 75% of NCD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries; this is compounded by rapid urbanization. The innovative approach is being tested on three continents: in Mongolia, Senegal, and Brazil. Better Hearts Better Cities brings together multisector partners, including a technology advisor partnership with Intel Corporation, to co-design and implement interventions beyond healthcare. BASEL, Switzerland, May 17, 2017 /3BL Media/ – On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75% of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.1 The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners – from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners – to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. “To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people’s quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided,” said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. “Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce” said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative’s global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. “Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability.” Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. “The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs  actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there,” said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. “We’re excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality.” Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country’s population, around 1.4 million people.2 In this capital city, also one of the world’s most polluted cities,3 more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension4 and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.5 Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,6 and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission.

The company is expected to announce an upgraded version Macbook Pro and the 12-inch Macbook with faster processors. As per the report, the MacBook Pro will be powered by a faster Kaby Lake Intel processor while the upgraded 12-inch MacBook will also come with a faster Intel chip. Moreover, it is said that Apple might also consider updating the 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor owing to stronger laptop sales. With new laptops in the works, Apple is all set to compete again with rival Microsoft who recently announced the Surface laptop with touchscreen. “The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years”, said the report. Apple has not launched new hardware for a long time at WWDC and it will be interesting to see what company has to offer. Last year in October, the company had launched new MacBook Pros with a touchscreen integrated into the keyboard. WWDC 2017 is scheduled to take place from June 5th to June 9th.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Asus VivoBook Flip 12 is an Apollo Lake convertible with pen support 05/16/2017 at 1:56 PM by Brad Linder 5 Comments Asus has quietly added a new convertible laptop to its website. The Asus VivoBook Flip 12 is a notebook with an 11.6 inch touchscreen display, a 360-degree hinge that lets you use the computer as a tablet, and support for writing or drawing with a pressure-sensitive Asus Pen. The notebook will be available in a few different configurations, but each model features a 1366 x 768 pixel display and Intel Apollo Lake processor, suggesting that these will be relatively affordable machines. The Asus VivoBook Flip E12 E203NA supports Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core or Pentium N4200 quad-core processor options, 2GB or 4GB of DDR3L-1600 memory, and Windows 10 Home or the Linux-based Endless OS. It comes with 32GB, 64GB, of 128GB of eMMC storage, and each model has 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, a microSD card slot, and HDMI port. It also has a fingerprint sensor and features a 38 Wh battery. Te notebook measures 11.5″ x 7.8″ x 0.67″ and weighs about 2.4 pounds. Asus also recently added a non-convertible VivoBook E12 E203NAH laptop to its line of compact, low-power notebooks. That model has 500GB and 1TB hard drive options, weighs about 2.6 pounds, and measures 0.85 inches thick. But it lacks pen support.     via WinFuture Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 5 Comments on "Asus VivoBook Flip 12 is an Apollo Lake convertible with pen support" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest sportniik Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    EXCLUSIVE: Clapper’s Intel ‘Reforms’ Helped Rice ‘Unmask’ Americans Richard Pollock Reporter 8:51 PM 05/16/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper’s creation of a cloud-computing platform in 2013 made it far easier for officials like former White House National Security Advisor Susan Rice to ‘unmask’ individual Americans without creating a digital paper trail leading back to her, The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group has learned. Clapper’s system enabled tens of thousands of government officials to share previously off-limits intelligence information, according to knowledgeable officials who tracked the cloud-computing initiative of the former DNI under President Barack Obama. Commander Jennifer E. Dyer, a 21-year naval intelligence officer, told TheDCNF that Clapper’s effort dramatically altered the rules that previously barred access to phone records of U.S. citizens unless there was prior approval following rigorous National Security Agency (NSA) review. NSA can compile phone records of American citizens talking to foreign officials under Section 702 of the USA Patriot Act. It allows the spy agency to legally eavesdrop on innocent American citizens who are inadvertently swept up in telephone conversations with foreign officials. NSA can keep the records for as long as five years. The 702 provision expires at the end of the year unless Congress reauthorizes it. Citizens normally are referred to as “American A” or “American B” in the 702 reports. The names are “masked” from intelligence officials. Dyer says that all changed after Clapper’s cloud computing system was put into place. “After the technology had changed and the workplace policies had changed, basically that access was based on ‘user permissions’ that would allow you to look into the database itself. You didn’t have to ask anyone at NSA to retrieve the information,” Dyer said. “As long as the permissions on your user account were such that you were certified to have access to that information, then you could go in and get it yourself,” Dyer said. “A key aspect of cloud technology is that to do that retrieval, you don’t have to set up the whole line of an ‘audit-able’ chain.” Clapper served as Obama’s DNI from 2010 to 2017, and in 2011, he set into motion wide-ranging “reforms” that sought the creation of a cloud computing platform tied to Intelligence Community IT Enterprise, or ICITE. “IC Research,” another Clapper innovation, also permitted greater intelligence agency collaboration within the cloud. Clapper justified his move in the name of improving information-sharing among intelligence officials and breaking down barriers between agencies, a policy encouraged following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But Clapper’s changes lowered security standards for sharing NSA and CIA intelligence data. Many top intelligence officials were enabled to access raw intelligence about U.S. citizens as a result. Obama also pushed for more aggressive information sharing in the final days of his administration when he authorized all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to access raw NSA data through Executive Order 12333. He amended the Reagan era executive order Jan. 3. Auditing unmasking actions to determine who received individuals’ names is also made more difficult with cloud computing, according to Dyer. Earlier this year, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was unmasked, and his name was leaked to the media. He briefly served as President Donald Trump’s national security advisor before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. The number of Section 702 American citizen “targets” since Clapper’s system began in 2013 has surged from 89,000 to 106,000 in 2016, a 19 percent increase according to a 2016 report from the former DNI’s office. Similarly, the number of intelligence community employees who share information now exceeds 50,000, compared to only 9,000 in 2014, according to Kendrea DeLauter, IC Desktop Environment Joint Program Manager at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Ashley Gorski, an ACLU staff attorney for its National Security Project, told TheDCNF the standards for surveillance and unmasking of private citizens are too low. “Seventeen different agencies shouldn’t be sifting through Americans’ emails without ever obtaining a warrant,” Gorski said. “The standard for unmasking someone’s identity in these intercepted communications is a low one, and the risk of abuse is real.” Do You Think The Standards For Surveillance, Unmasking Of Private Citizens Are Too Low?   Yes         No        Login with your social identity to vote Thanks for participating in this survey, in order to vote you must register with your email address.

James Waurishuk, who twice served on the National Security Council, told TheDCNF security precautions under the Clapper system were “diluted because more people now had more access.” Waurishuk believes it will be difficult to trace Rice’s unmasking requests as she sought the information from subordinates. “Susan Rice is not going to be sitting there, reading thousands of intercepts,” he said. Dyer agreed, saying “Susan Rice is not going to have any literal IT involvement. I’m sure it’s the worker-bee who did the actual work.” Waurishuk, who is the vice president of OPSEC, an advocacy group for former Special Forces and intelligence officials, believes Rice was emboldened given that the cloud system reduced a digital paper trail. “Because they knew they were doing illegal stuff, the last thing they want to do is have a paper trail.  I think they never believed they were ever going to get caught,” he told the DCNF. Clapper’s new system of “collaboration” for intelligence officials met resistance from some within the intelligence community. Gregory Treverton, who was National Intelligence Council chairman under Clapper, conceded in a January 2016 report that many intelligence officials believed some of the information-sharing went too far. He said many intelligence officials complained there were “too many,” attempts at collaboration. Clapper’s $600 million contract for the new system met fierce opposition from other high-tech companies when it was awarded to Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Web Services. The rivals charged that Bezos received preferential treatment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld a protest IBM and another unnamed firm submitted in 2013, and the agency ordered the bid reconsidered. Clapper failed to evaluate prices comparably, and he waived a bidding requirement only for Amazon, according to Ralph O. White, managing associate general counsel for procurement law at GAO. AT&T and Microsoft also filed complaints about the Amazon win. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of Amazon’s request for judgment in October 2013. The activist group, RootsAction.org, collected 15,000 signatures in a petition drive, complaining “Amazon’s offer wasn’t the low bid, but it won the CIA contract anyway.” Bezos is a well-known liberal who owns the Washington Post. He hired former Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney as a top executive in his company.

Apple typically uses its mostly-annual developers conference to announce new software updates to existing products, giving developers a chance to become acquainted with the changes and maybe get their third-party integrations, tie-ins, services, and apps ready. However, this year, Apple will also announce hardware updates. It will refresh its laptop lineup at WWDC 207 in June, according to Bloomberg. Apple is planning three new laptops: the MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip, and the 13-inch MacBook Air will get a new processor. Bloomberg noted Apple wants to keep its MacBook laptop line fresh for customers, especially due to recent hardware pushes from rivals, such as Microsoft, as well as declining iPad sales. Apple's Siri speaker: What's the story so far? iPad Pro 10.5-inch could be launched in June following case leak The updated MacBook Laptops will apparently still look the same; they're only getting different internal architecture. In other words, none of the updates are major changes. The MacBook and MacBook Air are definitely due for an update, considering they were last updated in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Check out Pocket-lint's WWDC round-up to see what else Apple may announce at its 5 June keynote. Keep in mind Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for future MacBook Pro models, which would manage their low-power mode, but it's unclear if that chip will be ready in time for WWDC 2017.

McMaster defended President Donald Trump's decision to share sensitive intelligence with Russian officials during last week's visit as "wholly appropriate" amid a firestorm of criticism Tuesday. The White House was in damage control mode over media reports Monday that Trump disclosed highly classified information from an ally with Russia. NBC News confirmed Tuesday that Israel was the key partner that provided the ISIS-related intelligence, according to three government officials with knowledge of the matter. Related: LIVE BLOG: White House Scrambles After Trump's Gives Russia Intel McMaster said the president shared the information in "context of the conversation" with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, saying it was "wholly appropriate to that conversation" and "consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leader with whom he's engaged." McMaster would not confirm if that information was classified. "I was in the room, the Secretary of State was in the room, as you know, the deputy adviser for national security, Dina Powell, and none of us felt in any way that conversation was inappropriate," McMaster said. During those conversations, Trump also disclosed the city in ISIS-held Syria from which that intelligence emanated, McMaster confirmed.

The president "wasn't aware of where this came from. He wasn't briefed on the source of this information," McMaster said. Two U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News that many people inside the U.S. intelligence community dispute McMaster's characterization that Trump's sharing of sensitive terrorism intelligence with the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador was "appropriate." Normally, when the U.S. government wants to share intelligence with Russia, there is an elaborate vetting process, current and former officials told NBC News. Sometimes the reports are marked "REL Russia," for "releasable Russia." RELATED: Trump Defends 'Right' to Share Info With Russia After Classified Intel Reports "There is a process for sharing releasable intelligence with the Russians," Eric Pelofsky, a former National Security Council senior director, told NBC News. "For the president, it could take a few hours — and it would be sanitized in a way that would be respectful of the risk. And, likely as part of that process, our intelligence community would engage our intelligence partner so that we would not jeopardize the continuing flow of intelligence from them." Following Trump's conversations with the Russians, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert reached out to the CIA and the National Security Agency likely out of "an overabundance of caution," McMaster said. He added he has not spoken with Bossert about why he reached out. The intelligence community, the two officials told NBC News, feels Bossert alerted them because Trump shared intelligence about the laptop bomb threat derived from a partner country. They added that U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that the disclosure could compromise the source of the information, will lead the partner to stop sharing, and will make other countries reluctant to share intelligence with the U.S. McMaster on Tuesday said that he was not concerned that allies would stop sharing information with the U.S. as a result of Trump's conversations with the Russians. Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, while not confirming his nation as the source of intelligence, said in a statement that his country "has full confidence in our intelligence sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump." On Monday, McMaster denied that Trump shared "sources or methods" with the Russians — notable wording considering the story first reported by The Washington Post did not report that Trump shared sources or methods, only classified information.

But a series of Trump tweets Tuesday morning flew in the face of those denials, seemingly corroborating the Washington Post's reporting that information was shared. "I wanted to share with Russia…facts pertaining…to terrorism and airline flight safety," the president tweeted. Trump's sharing information with the Russian officials is the latest turn in a saga that has put the spotlight on campaign and former administration officials and questions into any possible relationship with Moscow. President Trump may not have violated a law in revealing or discussing classified information, a former senior national security lawyer told NBC News. A president has the ultimate authority in the government to decide what's classified — even if they blurt out or otherwise reveal classified information without a deliberate declassification process. This is not the first time President Trump has put forth statements that contradict his White House surrogates and spokespeople. Last week, in an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, Trump said he would have fired former FBI Director James Comey "regardless" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's recommendation — the opposite explanation offered by chief White House officials, Vice President Mike Pence, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the immediate aftermath of the firing. On Tuesday, the White House reiterated that they felt "real issue," in information sharing was that national security was being compromised by leaks — a complaint the Trump White House has often voiced. McMaster said "those violating confidentiality" by releasing information to the press could "make American citizens and others more vulnerable."

In response to questions, McConnell said that he has not lost confidence in the president and that he still trusts him with classified information. "I think it would be helpful to have less drama emanating from the white house," McConnell told reporters, not directly responding to the latest controversy flowing out of the executive branch.

An exasperated Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who is facing a difficult re-election in 2018, said that he's still waiting for more information about what actually happened, but is hoping for a break from the near-daily barrage. "It would be nice to have a drama-free week," Flake said. When asked if he thinks that's likely, he said, "I don't know." Sen. Susan Collins expressed similar sentiments just minutes after the news broke Monday night. "Can we have a crisis-free day? That's all I'm asking," she said. RELATED: Follow Live as White House Scrambles After Trump Gave Russia Intel While Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the latest wasn't a factor in his decision, he told the Trump administration on Wednesday that he was withdrawing his name from consideration for FBI director. "I've informed the Administration that I'm committed to helping them find such an individual, and that the best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U.S. Senate," Cornyn wrote in a statement. Still, key members of Congress have been waiting to hear from the White House on questions they have pertaining to Trump's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Servey Kislyak. Republican leaders are the only members to have heard from the White House on the topic so far. House Speaker Paul Ryan's office confirms that they have talked to the White House while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office would neither confirm nor deny that a conversation took place. Democratic leaders, however, said they have not heard from administration officials, according to aides. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is expected to brief the House Intelligence Committee in a pre-scheduled briefing Tuesday evening. And the Senate Intelligence Committee is also meeting for a regularly-scheduled weekly briefing, which was supposed to be on a different topic but has devolved into a discussion on the latest controversy. "My hope is we may get some level of update at Intel (Committee meeting) later today," Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told reporters. Many Republicans have been reluctant to comment, saying that they want to learn more. "I'm going to wait until I get briefed on it. I don't know the whole story," Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley said when asked for a response. Others, however, have weighed in, like Sen. John McCain, who called the reports "deeply disturbing." "Reports that this information was provided by a U.S. ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America's allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future," McCain said. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who was a contender to be Trump's secretary of state, was one of the first Republicans to react to the news, saying the reports were "worrisome." "The chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline," Corker said, is creating a "worrisome environment." Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., described the entire episode as "weird" but cautioned that the president appeared to have operated within his authority. "It's very difficult for a president to break laws related to classification," Sasse said Tuesday on Fox News. "But the debate about imprudence, that's a really important debate," he said. "It's not helpful that this was with the Russians. Right? I mean this was just weird," Sasse added.

"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration," said House Speaker Paul Ryan spokesman Doug Andres in a statement Monday night. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., made the case for an all-senator briefing on the meeting. "If it is in fact true that information that shared with the Russian ambassador, it seems to me it can be shared with United States senators," Tillis said. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, also a member of the Intelligence Committee, said that he's asked the White House for more information. The White House is expected to reach out to members of Congress today to brief them on the developments. "I'm not disputing it, I'm not admitting it I just want to know more," he said. Some Republicans have remained mum. When asked if he had any reaction to the reports, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., simply said "none." He refused to answer any follow up questions and proceeded to walk into the Finance Committee room to attend a hearing on Medicare. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the White House to release the transcripts from the Lavrov and Trump meeting to the Congressional intelligence committees. "Producing the transcripts ... is the only way for this administration to categorically prove the report's untrue," Schumer said.

I don't expect Intel to follow tit for tat, thread to thread, but rather on other merits like single core performance".   I totally agree, especially with Patrick's comments for AMD hitting the $1000+ price point with ThreadRipper. It will push Intel to react, which is probably why we're hearing about Intel's upcoming Core i9 range with up to 12C/24T of performance at up to a blistering 4.5GHz with their purported Turbo Boost 3.0 technology. It's an exciting time to be a technology enthusiast, that's for sure.

Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email President Trump’s decision to share highly classified intelligence about an ISIS plot with Russian officials last week endangered the life of an Israeli spy embedded within the terror organization, ABC News reported Tuesday. The information, which was provided by Israel to U.S. intelligence, was about an ISIS plan to blow up an airplane with a bomb hidden inside a laptop in a way that could evade airport security, ABC reported, citing current and former U.S. officials. The terror group killed more than 200 people two years ago when it blew up a Russian airliner with a bomb hidden in a soda can. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said Tuesday that the common threat that the U.S. and Russia face from ISIS justified the disclosure. But the former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, told ABC that the president’s actions were inappropriate. “Russia is not part of the ISIS coalition,” he said. “They are not our partner.” Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro warned ABC that the incident would “inevitably cause elements of Israel’s intelligence service to demonstrate more caution” when sharing intelligence with its chief ally. This may already be happening: Danny Yatom, the former head of Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence organization, told CBS News that Israel “will think twice before conveying very sensitive information.” Contact Aiden Pink at pink@forward.com or on Twitter, @aidenpink.

The newspaper suggested that the president-elect knew about the investigation, which probed the Flynn Intel Group’s contract with a Dutch firm owned by a Turkish businessman to run a campaign to allegedly discredit US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for staging the 2016 failed coup. Flynn was forced to resign after only 24 days in office. He has since been at the center of accusations against Trump over his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia after he purportedly discussed US sanctions on Russia with its envoy to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Last week, Trump fired FBI director James Comey, raising claims of a cover-up. An explosive report emerged in the New York Times this Tuesday suggesting the US president had asked Comey to close the probe into Flynn’s links to Russia. Russia has repeatedly denied US claims that it meddled in the 2016 presidential vote, calling such allegations absurd. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Moscow did not have official contacts with Trump's team during the campaign. ...

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You At the I/O developer conference last year, Google debuted its first chip. The company kept the component mostly for internal artificial intelligence needs. Today, version two arrived -- and Google is selling this one. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced the new chip on Wednesday during a keynote address at the Alphabet Inc. unit’s annual I/O event. Normally, the gathering focuses on mobile software. This year’s spotlight on hardware underscores Pichai’s effort to transform the search giant into an "AI-first" company and a real cloud-computing contender. Companies will be able to purchase the hardware, called Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), through a Google Cloud service. Google hopes it will quicken the pace of AI advancements. And despite official statements to the contrary, it may also threaten Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., the main suppliers of powerful semiconductors that run large processing tasks. "This is basically a supercomputer for machine learning," Urs Hölzle, Google’s veteran technical chief, said. Machine learning, a method for deciphering patterns in reams of data, is behind Google’s recent progress on voice recognition, text translation and search rankings. But the approach cost a lot, and sucked up computing time in Google’s data centers. The latest chip was designed to address these issues, and executives said they saw dramatic improvements after putting the component to work on these internal tasks. Google wouldn’t divulge the chip’s price, what company manufactures it, or when the related cloud service goes on sale. Google still purchases processors from Intel and Nvidia. But by relying more on in-house designs, Google could trim its multi-billion-dollar annual computing bill. Google plans more chips like this, and sees the components as essential for success in the cloud -- a key part of Alphabet’s push to make money beyond digital advertising. Other non-advertising announcements from the conference included new voice-based commerce features for Google’s digital Assistant and physical photo books selling for $9.99 or more. "The field is rapidly evolving," Hölzle said. "For us, it’s very important to advance machine learning for our own purposes and to be the best cloud." During his morning keynote, Pichai also introduced a flurry of machine learning updates for Google products, and unveiled a new web portal housing all of the company’s AI efforts. Google’s cloud business grew by more than 80 percent last year, according to estimates from Synergy Research Group. But Amazon Web Services still has over 40 percent of the public cloud market, and continues to expand at a steady clip. Google is third, according to industry estimates. To gain share, Google is leaning on its AI prowess. The Cloud TPU chip won’t be sold to Dell Inc. and other makers of servers that power traditional corporate data centers. To get the benefits, customers will have to sign up for a Google cloud service and run their software tasks and store their data on Google’s equipment. If companies get on board, Google insists, they can plumb their own data for unseen efficiency gains and profit. AWS and no. 2 player Microsoft Corp., make similar cases. So Google’s pitch stresses performance. A single Cloud TPU device, composed of four chips, is nearly 12,000 times faster than IBM’S Deep Blue supercomputer, the famous chess victor from 1997, Hölzle said. Google is stringing 64 of the devices into "pods" that sit in its data centers. Google unveiled its chip at last year’s I/O conference, so why does it need another? First, the company is going up against rivals that develop and deliver faster processors on an annual cadence. To lock in customers, it must match that pace. In addition, the original chip only worked for "inference," processing data that’s already packaged in mathematical models. It’s akin to compressing large photos into tiny digital formats. For instance, a company could turn an algorithm for voice recognition into an app using inference chips. To create an algorithm from just raw voices, you need lots of data to train AI software. That takes massive computing power, forcing coders to wait days or weeks to see results. Google’s second chip speeds up the training process. In internal tests, it cut the time in half compared to commercially available graphic processing units, known as GPUs. Nvidia, the dominant GPU manufacturer, recently announced a new chip, called Volta, that handles training data like Google’s Cloud TPU. An eight-chip Volta module will sell for $149,000 starting in the third quarter. Google is less experienced at selling chips, so it’s being cautious about commercial deployment. "When you have something that’s really new, some of the tools occasionally break. You want to reach a certain level of maturity," Hölzle said. "We’re probably going to have a lot more demand than we can satisfy." Excessive demand inspired the creation of TPUs in the first place, according to company lore. Six years ago, Google saw an uptick in voice searches on phones. Just three minutes of conversation a day, per Android phone user, would have doubled the number of data centers Google needed, based on its technology at the time. TPUs were designed to handle the extra volume more efficiently. The second-generation chip accelerated Google’s own research. For its translation efforts, Google previously ignored more than eighty percent of its data at the training stage, according to Jeff Dean, who leads a Google AI research unit called Brain. With its new chip, they can use all the information. That means better trained and potentially more accurate AI software. The new chip may let researchers use image data that currently sits unused because of high computing costs, according to Fei-Fei Li, an AI expert who runs a machine learning group inside Google’s Cloud business division. Image classification is one of the machine learning tools Li’s team is offering cloud clients, and the new chip will make this more accessible and usable. EBay Inc. used Google’s cloud to develop ShopBot software that identifies items snapped on smartphone cameras. Today’s image-recognition systems have around ten percent accuracy, said R.J. Pittman, EBay’s Chief Product Officer. The new Cloud TPU, which EBay has not yet tested, could eventually increase accuracy to more than 90 percent, he added. Companies like EBay want AI to tag every physical good in existence. Li imagines businesses that may want to map every square inch on earth or each minute part of a human cell. Amazon and Microsoft have their own AI-powered cloud services too though, and both have committed to buy Nvidia’s Volta chips. "Nvidia is not standing still," said Pittman from EBay, which also buys Nvidia GPUs. Hölzle dismissed a direct rivalry. Nvidia’s chips are built for more general-purpose tasks, he said, while Google’s focus solely on machine learning. That won’t calm Intel and Nvidia investors, who worry about in-house chipmaking efforts by their largest customers -- data center operators like Google. Analysts are concerned that revenue and profitability at the two companies, both at historically high levels, may be dented. Even if Google doesn’t succeed in commercializing its own chips, it’s in a better position to negotiate on price. Google isn’t restricting cloud customers to its own chips. It has Intel and Nvidia processors running inside its data centers. Google’s pushing a Lego-like model -- corporate customers can chose their combination of software and hardware, and rent storage and computing power by the minute. It has to be flexible if it’s going to catch AWS and Microsoft. "Down the road, we make actually pick the hardware for you that minimizes your cost or maximizes your turnaround time or whatever you tell us is important to you," Hölzle said. "It becomes invisible to you."

MacBook Pro aficionados did not like the decision that Apple took to have a Skylake chip running under the hood of the new laptop. This decision probably prevented many Mac users to upgrade to the new 2016 model of the MacBook Pro. However, it seems like the moment that everybody is waiting for is finally coming very soon. Rumor has it that Apple might launch the updated MacBook Pro as early as next month. According to Bloomberg, Apple is expected to release a slew of hardware products during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA. The event, which is normally used for software-related announcements, will be held from June 5 to 9. Among the products to be unveiled is the MacBook Pro 2017. While the new laptop will not include any aesthetic changes, most of the updates will happen inside. Chief of which is the change from Skylake to Kaby Lake processors from Intel. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) In addition to the MacBook Pro, the event will also introduce a new MacBook as well as the MacBook Air. This would probably come as a surprise to everyone as Apple somewhat alienated the MacBook Air last year when it released the MacBook Pro. At the time, the company wanted consumers to choose the basic MacBook Pro as a replacement for the ultra-light laptop. However, it only led to more orders for the MacBook Air. So, instead of getting rid of the model altogether, it has decided to thrown in a few upgrades to the MacBook Air as well. As mentioned, readers should note that the upgrades will not be anything major. The most that Apple will do is update the processor and memory across its range of laptops. The only reason that Apple is releasing upgraded MacBooks is to regain interests in response to increasing demands for Microsoft products. Also, Apple wants consumers to realize that the company is still invested in its range of computer products. For more updates on the MacBook Pro 2017, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The New York Times reports that Flynn and his legal team informed Donald McGahn, the current White House counsel, about the investigation on Jan. 4. In August, while he was advising the Trump campaign, Flynn signed a contract with Inovo BV, a Dutch consulting firm linked to the Turkish government. The Daily Caller first reported the relationship on Nov. 11, just days after Trump won the election. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying For Turkish Businessman Connected To Government) On that same day, hours before Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, Flynn published an op-ed at The Hill calling for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric. It was a strange position for Flynn to stake out, but one which was heavily supported by the Turkish government and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Nov. 18, Trump chose Flynn as his national security adviser. According to The Times, Flynn’s lobbying work is the subject of a grand jury subpoena signed by Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and the acting attorney general for DOJ’s National Security Division. The subpoena, which The Times reviewed, asks for records of Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, and several of its associates, including Ekim Alptekin, the owner of Inovo BV. Alptekin serves as chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, a trade group controlled by the Turkish government. As part of the contract between Flynn and Alptekin, Flynn agreed to investigate Gulen using an investigative team comprised of former intelligence community officials. Flynn’s team met with Alptekin and two top Turkish government ministers in New York City on Sept. 19. The Justice Department first notified Flynn of its interest in his lobbying activities on Nov. 30. (RELATED: New Disclosures Reveal The Next Scandal That Would Have Hit Michael Flynn) “In light of that editorial and reports in the media about potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey, on Nov. 30, NSD requested additional information from Lt. Gen. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc.,” reads the DOJ memo, a readout of which was provided to TheDC in March. (RELATED: What Prompted Michael Flynn To Register As A Foreign Agent Of Turkey) Flynn hired a lawyer weeks after being contacted by DOJ. The attorney, Robert Kelner, informed McGahn of the investigation on Jan. 4. A week later he responded to the Justice Department and informed the agency that Flynn would likely be registering as a foreign agent of Turkey. Flynn did so only on March 8, nearly three weeks after Trump fired him for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador. It is unclear how the investigation into Flynn’s work for the Turkish government factors into the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. Flynn is said to be one of the subjects of that investigation.

Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... * The President's legislative and policy agenda will be diluted and delayed * Sell stocks as risk is underpriced * Buy gold as a protective strategy and for diversification purposes "News broke late Tuesday of Mr. Comey's contemporaneous notes that Mr. Trump asked him in February to "let this go," referring to the FBI probe of axed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that account of the conversation, but that would be more credible if its previous statements were more reliable. Mr. Trump's strife and insults with the intelligence community were also bound to invite blowback. The Post report is sourced to "current and former U.S. officials," which raises the question of how former officials are privy to "code word" information, defined as anything that could be expected to cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security if disclosed. In that case the public leaks about Mr. Trump's actions, if true, will do more damage than whatever he said in private. Mr. Trump is considering a White House shakeup, including cleaning out many of his top aides, but the White House always reflects the President's governing style. If Mr. Trump can't discipline himself, then no Jim Baker ex machina will make much difference. Mr. Trump needs to appreciate how close he is to losing the Republicans he needs to pass the agenda that will determine if he is successful. Weeks of pointless melodrama and undisciplined comments have depleted public and Capitol Hill attention from health care and tax reform, and exhaustion is setting in. America holds elections every two years, and Mr. Trump's policy allies in Congress will drift away if he looks like a liability. Millions of Americans recognized Mr. Trump's flaws but decided he was a risk worth taking. They assumed, or at least hoped, that he'd rise to the occasion and the demands of the job. If he cannot, he'll betray their hopes as his Presidency sinks before his eyes." - Wall Street Journal, "Loose Lips Sinks Presidencies: The Russian Intel Story Shows the Price of Trump's Lost Credibility" It is growing increasingly clear that, at best, the Trump administration's policy initiatives -- tax and regulatory reform and various fiscal endeavors, including infrastructure spending and cash repatriation -- probably will be delayed and diluted. At worst, the decline of Trump's presidency is now coming into focus. Over the last few weeks the descent in the president's fortunes has accelerated, owing in part to the following events and paths: * FBI Director Mike Comey was fired in the middle of a Russian investigation. This followed the canning of former U.S. Attorney Preet Bahrara and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, the former of whom was embarking on his own investigation of Trump's campaign team and Russian officials and the other had objected to the administration's immigration policy as well as Michael Flynn's background. * President Trump warned former FBI Director Comey of tapes of their private conversation. * President Trump apparently revealed classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador. * Finally, it was recently claimed that a Comey memo reveals that the president attempted ("I hope you get let this go") to shut down the FBI probe of Flynn, raising the flames of possible obstruction of justice. I expressed concern about six months ago in my 15 Surprises for 2017 that we'd see fighting, internal chaos and a president increasingly isolated, enraged, unable to be contained and out of touch with the requirements of the presidency. When Presidents Nixon and Clinton (and others) ran afoul, their minions circled the wagons. By contrast and in a break with history, Donald Trump is much like the day trader who essentially operates by himself. As such, the vulnerability, and even demise, of the administration may be closer at hand than many realize. And the associated uncertainties may not be market-friendly. Jim "El Capitan" Cramer, in "Selling on Trump Presidency Troubles? Are You Kidding Me?," believes one shouldn't panic and sell stocks based on a presidential spiral. I respectfully disagree as it is my view that the cumulative impact of Trump's actions finally may take hold on an overvalued market (most valuation metrics are in the 95% decile) in which risk is underpriced and where stock prices have been overly inflated by the explosion in ETF popularity and quant strategies that are agnostic to balance sheets and income statements and that worship at the altar of price momentum, and in a overall market in which leadership is narrowing and showing other technical weaknesses. In the near term, all of the administration's economic initiatives likely will come to a stop in a collision course of credibility. I started today's missive with yesterday's Wall Street Journal editorial, which followed an earlier late-March editorial, "A President's Credibility": "Falsehoods are eroding public trust, at home and abroad... If President Trump announces that North Korea launched a missile that landed within 100 miles of Hawaii, would most Americans believe him? Would the rest of the world? We're not sure, which speaks to the damage that Mr. Trump is doing to his Presidency with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods... Yet the President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims... Two months into his Presidency, Gallup has Mr. Trump's approval rating at 39%. No doubt Mr. Trump considers that fake news, but if he doesn't show more respect for the truth, most Americans may conclude he's a fake President." Donald Trump, as I initially feared in my 15 Surprises for 2017, appears to be continually obsessed by the media, doesn't seem capable of restraining himself and his administration is disorganized. The president, under the guise of trying to be seen as a strong leader, continues to raise more questions than answers in both the domestic and foreign arenas. I am sticking with Surprise #4: Surprise #4: "The Unartful Deal" -- President Trump's Popularity Quickly Fades as "The Dude (Doesn't ) Abide." And based on what we have witnessed in the administration's first few months I will also stick with Surprise #5: Surprise #5: Trump Grows Restless After Some Failed Initiatives and Loss of Support. He Begins to Lose Interest in His Job After He Finds Out How Hard It Is to Get Anything Done and Becomes The First Part-Time President in History. Bottom Line The President's legislative and policy agenda is now likely on hold. As Tom Brokaw said recently on " Morning Joe": " There are burning fuses everywhere (in the Trump administration). They are not small ... I have talked to numerous business people in the last few days and they are appalled." The markets have risen on the assumption that the new president would be successful in his bold agenda of regulatory and tax reform and aggressive fiscal policy programs. With housing, retail and autos all peaking, I reject the notion put forward by some that the rate of growth in the domestic economy is reaccelerating and that this trumps the success of the administration's agenda. Meanwhile, rising gold (up $11 this morning), a contained 10-year U.S. note yield (2.29% this morning) and sinking commodities markets (the price of oil has fallen to close to October 2016 lows) seem to be negative economic and market "tells" that up to recently had been ignored. The first few months of the Trump administration have been a test of the president's business acumen. Can his "art of the business deal" be translated into the "art of the political deal" in Washington, D.C.? Arguably, the body of evidence is that the administration has not been successful -- to some, it is failing spectacularly. From my perch, the markets are overvalued and risk remains (perhaps dramatically) underpriced. Given recent White House developments, the " hockey stick" projections and consensus of rapid profit growth in 2017 and 2018 seems to now be "pie in the sky." What is dangerous is that consensus sentiment, political, profit and economic expectations are inflated at a time in which many valuation metrics are in the 95% decile. Moreover, as the Divine Ms. M writes this morning, the technical are eroding: *Breadth is lagging as leadership narrows *The put/call ratio for equities is under 60% for the third consecutive day By my gauge, the market's downside risk substantially exceeds the upside reward -- perhaps by as much as 4:1. As I said back in late 2016 , Donald Trump will make market volatility and economic and profit uncertainty great again. The market seas are growing more turbulent as The Orange Swan looms ever closer. T.I.N.A. (there is no alternative) is B.S. C .I.T.A. (cash is the alternative) should be considered. Be less concerned about return on capital and more concerned with return of capital. Sell stocks, buy gold. Doug Kass is president of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc.

Read: Trump Says He Had an 'Absolute Right' to Give Classified Intel to Russia “The markets were on track for their largest daily declines in nearly two months,” according to Market Watch. By the closing bell at 3:30 on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial fell 310 points and the S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent, with financials tumbling 3.1 percent to lead decliners.   The drop grows due to the political turmoil in Washington following news of a memo from former FBI Director James Comey, in which he describes a meeting in the Oval Office where Trump allegedly asked him to drop the investigation of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn. "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go." the Comey memo quotes Trump as saying. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." Comey writes that he replied to the president: "I agree he is a good guy." The White House issued a flat-out denial declaring, "This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation." Meanwhile, Trump's mood "has become sour and dark" and he has unleashed his fury on his staff, including son-in-law Jared Kushner — calling them "incompetent," The New York Times reported.  During a GOP dinner Tuesday night, Arizona Senator John McCain said Trump’s scandals have reached "Watergate size and scale." Many have called for the president to be impeached, including Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who asked for the action Wednesday morning on the House floor. Trump left Washington Wednesday morning and headed to New London, Conn., where he will give the commencement address at The Coast Guard Academy. Read: Speculation Grows About Sean Spicer's Ouster After Melissa McCarthy Reprises Role on 'SNL' Following a bombshell report in The Washington Post that Trump shared classified intelligence with Russia on the battle against ISIS, Vladimir Putin has spoken out on Trump’s troubles, calling them "political schizophrenia." "This is the only thing I can think of when I hear allegations saying that the president has revealed some secrets to [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov," Putin said. Putin added that he was ready to provide recordings of the exchange that took place in the Oval Office last Wednesday.

Business Technology Qualcomm sues iPhone makers in escalating patent war with Apple Reuters China's Premier Li Keqiang inspects a Foxconn Technology Group plant in Zhengzhou, Henan province on May 9. Qualcomm is suing the Apple contract manufacturer for not paying patent royalties. China's Premier Li Keqiang inspects a Foxconn Technology Group plant in Zhengzhou, Henan province on May 9. Qualcomm is suing the Apple contract manufacturer for not paying patent royalties. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm filed a breach of contract lawsuit late Tuesday against four Taiwanese contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads for Apple – the latest salvo in an escalating war between two tech giants over patent royalties. Qualcomm’s court action is in response to Apple’s steps last month to block its contract manufacturers from paying Qualcomm for use of its cellular patents in iPhones and iPads. “Apple is definitely behind this, and certainly what the contract manufacturers would say is the reason they are not paying,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Our response to that is you are big, sophisticated companies. You have contractual obligations. You have license agreements with us that don’t involve Apple. You are responsible for paying that.” The lawsuit falls short of more drastic moves that media outlets speculated Qualcomm would pursue against Apple – including seeking to ban imports of iPhones and iPads into the U.S. Last week, Bloomberg reported Qualcomm would ask the U.S. International Trade Commission to issue an injunction prohibiting iPhone imports, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans. The story was widely repeated. Rosenberg declined to comment on why Qualcomm chose a lawsuit in San Diego Federal Court against Apple’s contract manufacturers rather than going to the U.S. International Trade Commission to bar iPhone imports. "We don’t like suing our licensees,” said Rosenberg, noting that in the past decade the company has brought just one patent infringement case against a smartphone maker. “And we won’t unless we are really put in a corner and forced to do that, and we are forced to do that here.” The lawsuit names iPhone/iPad assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., known as Foxconn: Pegatron Corp.; Wistron Corp.; and Compal Electronics – all based in Taiwan but with manufacturing operations in China and elsewhere. All have long-standing patent license agreements with Qualcomm and continue to pay patent royalties to Qualcomm on smartphones and tablets that they make for other companies besides Apple, said Rosenberg. The lawsuit seeks unpaid royalties of at least $1 billion and damages, as well as attorney fees and other costs. “What they are saying is Apple is not paying us, so we are not paying you, and Apple has told us not to pay you,” said Rosenberg. “And we said, that is interesting, but that is between you and Apple.” He continued, “Presumably you have a contract with Apple. You ought to go enforce that contract against Apple. I hope they take that action.” Over the past eight months, Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has been under fierce attack by anti-monopoly regulators and technology giants including Apple, Samsung and Intel. The Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million and seeks to dismantle the way it licenses its patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm in January over similar grounds, and Samsung and Intel have filed friend of the court briefs supporting the FTC’s case. Apple joined the assault shortly after the FTC and perhaps has been the most aggressive in maneuvers against Qualcomm, which believes that Apple is behind a “global attack on the company.” It is a complicated dispute. Apple reimburses Foxconn and the other contract manufacturers for patent royalties owed to Qualcomm. Early this year, it withheld $1 billion in reimbursements on the grounds that Qualcomm had reneged on a separate royalty “rebate” agreement with Apple in retaliation for Apple’s cooperation with anti-trust regulators. Then last month, Apple quit reimbursing Foxconn and the others altogether for Qualcomm patent royalties – claiming it couldn’t pay until the dispute was resolved. As a result, Qualcomm slashed its financial forecast for the year. Qualcomm pioneered a good portion of 3G/4G cellular radio technology and holds thousands of patents on its inventions. Its technology is inside nearly every smartphone. The company licenses patents based on the price of the entire device, and it has agreed to provide certain patents under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms because they are included in wireless industry standards. Qualcomm’s royalties top out at 5 percent of the device price, but typically come in lower depending on each licensing agreement negotiated with handset makers.. Apple and regulators claim Qualcomm abuses its market power to overcharge for “standard-essential patents” and block competition. They are pushing for patent royalties based on the cost of the cellular modem chip instead of the entire phone, and they want Qualcomm to agree to license not only smartphone makers but also rival chip outfits such as Intel and Samsung. Asked about Qualcomm’s latest lawsuits, Apple referred to comments that Chief Executive Tim Cook made during the company recent first quarter earning conference call. “"The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value,” said Cook. “And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it." Qualcomm has counter-sued Apple, is appealing the Korea Fair Trade Commission decision and has asked a Northern California federal judge to dismiss the FTC case. A hearing on the dismissal motion is slated for mid-June.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global LTE IC Market Size, Share, Development, Growth and Demand Forecast to 2020 The growing demand of 3G and 4G LTE IC form Smartphones and tablets and other networking devices are fueling the growth of the global LTE IC market. The retail costs of smartphones are largely influenced by the cost of LTE IC integrated equipped in them. The LTE enabled phones are high in cost, since major smartphone manufacturers intend to increase profit, using LTE as a high-end differentiated feature. However, the established players of LTE IC in the market have very high proprietary learning curve, which is acting as a barrier for the new entrants. Qualcomm and Intel accounted for more than 80% share of the high end LTE IC market in 2014. To Browse Full Report Visit Here: www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/lte-ic-market The market is going through continuous product innovations. Recently, the 64 bit chip and octa-core chip are witnessing high penetration in the high end networking devices. The prices of 64bit are expected to fall during the forecast period, as more chip vendors are expected to launch such products. The competition among the vendors for the octa-core LTE IC market is high. In 2014, MediaTek Inc was the largest manufacturer of octa core chip. In 2013, the company launched 3G octa core chip MT6592, which has high market penetration, due to lack of competitor in the Chinese market. Moreover, MediaTeck launched ‘MT6591’ a six core 3G SOC chip, which was the first hexa core chip in the world. MediaTeck is expected to use hexa core chip, for relieving the price pressure on its Octa core chips. The increasing penetration of smart phone in developing countries has boosted the growth of the LTE IC market. The smartphone segment accounted for more than 70% share of the global market in 2014. By the end of 2017, the smart phone shipment is expected to reach touch 1.5 billion units, as compared to 1 billion shipments in 2013.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 05.17.17. 05.17.17 Time of Publication: 5:51 pm. 5:51 pm Sundar Pichai Sees Google’s Future in the Smartest Cloud Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers the keynote address at Google I/O 2017 on May 17, 2017 in Mountain View, CA.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Two days before delivering the keynote at Google I/O, the company’s annual State of the Union address, Sundar Pichai is worried about losing his voice. Sitting at the coffee table inside his remarkably spartan office at company headquarters, the Google CEO speaks softly, even by his standards. Step by careful step, he explains the major themes that will run through his keynote speech, and at first, they seem less weighty than they should, considering they represent the near-future of the world’s largest internet business. That’s partly because Pichai isn’t feeling too well and partly because those themes aren’t all that different from the themes that drove last year’s speech. Google, he keeps saying, is now an “AI-first company.” But about halfway through this chat, he reveals that the company will unveil a new chip specifically designed to power the new wave of artificial intelligence. However softly he speaks, this news will echo loudly across the tech industry. Google I/O David Pierce Google Assistant Comes to Your iPhone to Take on Siri Liz Stinson Google Just Made Email a Heckuva Lot Easier to Deal With David Pierce Google Lens Turns Your Camera Into a Search Box Cade Metz Google Rattles the Tech World With a New AI Chip for All Yes, Google unveiled an AI chip at last year’s conference. But this is something different. According to Pichai, Google’s new chip is far more powerful and far more versatile than the one that came before, designed not only to run the latest machine learning services but to train them as well. No one else has really built a chip like that, though others, including Intel, are scrabbling to build such tech. And this time, Pichai says, Google will share its AI chip with the whole world. As he sees it, this is part of the company’s wider effort to democratize artificial intelligence, to put it in the hands of everyone. “One of the most exciting things we all can do is demystify machine learning and AI. It’s important for this to be accessible by all people,” he tells me in the I/O greenroom just after his Wednesday morning keynote, stage music pumping on the other side of the wall, the excitement and verve back in his voice. “That journey matters.” Still, when I ask if Google will sell this chip on the open market, he says no. That would democratize things a little too much. Rather than sell the chip itself, Google will offer its new silicon to the world via a cloud computing service. Anyone will be free to use it—but only if they use the Google Cloud. “We view our state-of-the-art machine learning and AI technologies as a differentiator for the cloud platform,” he says. “I think it will help propel the platform forward.” In other words, he hopes the new chip and the new service will set Google’s cloud business apart from services offered by its main rivals, including Amazon and Microsoft, the unnamed competitive threat underlying his I/O keynote. A New Wave Between its two AI labs—Google Brain, based at company headquarters in Silicon Valley, and DeepMind, a London AI startup Google purchased a little more than three years ago—Google is leading the new wave of artificial intelligence research and development so rapidly changing entire industries and economies. And it’s leading an equally enormous shift in the way the world builds and operates data center hardware. But all that is old news. In this year’s State of the Union, what stands out is how forcefully Google is working to share its technology with others and, in no small way, leverage all of these strengths in the hope of reaching the top of the cloud computing market, which could ultimately be the most lucrative tech market of them all. “I have always felt that you build a product or a platform—particularly a platform—and you do it well, there will be a lot of revenue to go with it,” Pichai says. “If you are running cloud at scale, that means you are powering the data platforms that will transform many industries. Will there be an economic opportunity there? I absolutely think it will be big.” ‘One of the most exciting thing we all can do is demystify machine learning and AI.’ Sundar Pichai The overwhelming share of Google’s revenue today comes from online advertising. But the company believes cloud computing—where computing power is rented over the internet to businesses and software developers—could one day bring in far more. Indeed, research firm Forrester says the market will reach $191 billion by 2020. The trouble is that after years of dithering, Google’s cloud business trails Amazon and Microsoft in this rapidly growing market. Pichai hopes the company’s lead in AI can propel its fortunes forward. Google built its new chip as a better way of serving its own AI services, most notably Google Translate, says Jeff Dean, the uber-engineer who oversees Google Brain, the company’s main AI lab. Even so, Pichai says that the company has only started using the chips internally, even as the company is preparing to share access to them via the Google Cloud. That shows how much importance the company places on the cloud market: Pichai and company are not waiting around. Of course, this new chip is no guarantee of success in the cloud. Most companies train their AI models today using nVidia GPUs, graphics processing chips that also happen to work really well for machine learning. Choosing to use Google’s new chips via the cloud could require is real change in the way businesses and developers do things. “The question is: how easy is it?” says Chris Nicholson, the founder and CEO of a machine learning startup Skymind. “Do you have to be a Google engineer to understand the stack?” Related Video Google Home Is The Assistant That Will Never Leave You Alone Pichai acknowledges that there may be learning curve. Buy he also believes that developers are willing to make the changes that can significantly push technology forward. “The pace with which these things shift can be very fast,” he says. “When the web came, Javascript development didn’t exist. The whole development chain didn’t exist. But it happened.” What’s more, Pichai knows that GPUs will continue to play a big role in AI research and operations. Google will offer its new chip via the cloud, but it will offer access to GPUs and possibly other chips for AI, as well. “This is not either/or,” he says. “It’s about advancing the overall optionality.” That’s Silicon-Valley-speak for “choice.” And it makes good sense. Pichai wants to give businesses whatever they need, even as he gives them something no one else can. Digging Deeper Ultimately, Pichai says Google is doing what it is best at: building platforms that others can use to build whatever they like. “We have always cared about computing platforms. I have spent most of my time here working on them,” he says. “It is the most leveraged way to drive innovation.” The TPU service is yet one more platform that will likely feed so many others in the months and years to come. After all, it’s a way of running any machine learning service—the core technology a host of other industries will use to transform how their own businesses work. Pichai is particularly interested in Google’s AutoML research project, a way of building artificial intelligence using artificial intelligence. He says it reminds him of Inception. “I tell my engineers: ‘We must go deeper,'” he quipped during his keynote. His larger point is that automation will soon be an enormously important way of creating AI—and he envisions Google offering this option to the rest of world as its own online service, driven by the AI chips the company just unveiled. Meanwhile, as Google also revealed this morning’s keynote, its engineers are building new software—TensorFlow Lite—that will run machine learning models on individual smartphones, eliminating the need to connect to the internet to perform every AI-powered task. Google intends to open source this technology, too, turning it into yet another platform for the masses. These localized versions of AI will still feed off the new TPU service—and feed into it too. Before running AI models on the phone, developers must train them in the data center. Still, amid all the talk of democratizing AI and creating platforms for everyone, it’s important not forget that cloud computing is also a rather direct way of making money, a resource that also happens to be enormously important to the company’s future. Much like last year, Pichai is intent on painting Google as an AI-first company. And there’s a lot of truth to that spin. But he also knows that AI is a path to another breakthrough: a new way of funding everything his company does.

Diehards like him have to been known to hike uphill on their own power if that’s what it takes to enjoy what’s left of the snow.  Many resorts don’t prevent people from going on hikes like that, though the activity is not really encouraged, either.  Woman Charged With DUI, Child Cruelty After Crash “It was so much fun,” Wagner said after completing the ski run that followed his lengthy uphill trek. “I'm relatively tired; my legs are burning, but other than that—I feel good!”  It's an arduous climb for many, and the resort is quick to remind people they do this at their own risk: there is no ski patrol when lifts aren't spinning, and the terrain is quite bumpy.  Despite the challenges and warnings, Darin Lambeth came to Killington from the Mad River Valley to make the most of Wednesday’s warm-up.  “I like to try to do a multi-sport day this time of year every once in a while, so snowboard, then I have the paddle board on the car, and the bike in the back, so I'm going to try to do all three today,” Lambeth told necn. “Seems like the perfect day for it!”  Wagner took note of how different skiing is in very warm air temperatures, compared to what he experienced a few short months ago.  “You're not freezing—it’s not minus 20,” Wagner chuckled. “You're not fighting to stay warm—you’re fighting to stay cold!”  A Killington spokesman said the resort will keep offering lift-served skiing and riding on Fridays through Sundays into June, if the remaining snow holds.  The lifts spin Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., according to Killington’s website. More traditional warm-weather activities return soon, with Killington Resort’s golf course, bike park, and limited Adventure Center activities scheduled to open May 27, according to the resort. It wasn’t all about skiing Wednesday: golfers at Green Mountain National, also in Killington, were at the driving range and putting green honing their skills for the season that’s just getting started.

By J.A. Watson for Jamie's Mostly Linux Stuff | May 17, 2017 -- 09:53 GMT (02:53 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software The ASUS X441SA. Image: Asus A few months ago I bought an ASUS X540SA notebook, which I was quite pleased with as a low-priced system. The one thing about it that I was never really happy with was the 15.6-inch display, because the display size determines the overall system size (and indirectly the weight), and I prefer to carry smaller/lighter laptops in my backpack. In addition, the larger display consumes more power, thus shortening battery life. Despite that, though, I have been using that laptop quite a lot, and I've been very pleased with it. A week or so ago, I saw another very similar ASUS notebook on sale here in Switzerland at about the same price (CHF 300.-), but with a 14-inch display. Not only does that smaller display avoid my complaints about the larger X540S, but because it has the same resolution (1366x768) I think the display looks better on the smaller size. I wish that I could tell you for sure what the model number of the new system is, but I'm can't. I can say for sure that what is written on the box, and on the sticker on the bottom of the system, is R414SA. However, when I went to the ASUS website to verify the configuration, I couldn't find any mention of that model - or of any "R"-series model! Then things got even more confusing, because while I was slogging through the Windows 10 setup, I happened to look at the System Info screen, and that identifies it as an X441SA. So I went back to the ASUS web page, and I couldn't find anything about that model, either -- but at least there is an "X"-series. Then, just to complete the confusion, I noticed that on the web page of the store that is offering this model in Switzerland, it says that it has an Intel N3710 processor, but the one that I got actually has an N3160. Anyway, be that as it may and whatever this model is actually called, I still think it is better suited to my needs and use. Here is a more complete comparison of the specifications of the two systems. R414SA X540SA CPU Celeron N3160 Quad Core Celeron N3060 Dual Core RAM 4GB DDR3 8GB DDR3 Disk 500GB HDD 500GB HDD Display 14" 1366x768 Intel HD Graphics 15.6" 1366x768 Intel HD Graphics Network Wired Gbit WiFi b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0 Wired Gbit WiFi b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0 USB 1x2.0 / 1x3.0 1x3.1 USB-C 1x2.0 / 1x3.0 1x3.1 USB-C Video HDMI & VGA HDMI & VGA Memory Card SD/SDHC/SDXC SD/SDHC/SDXC Optical Drive 8x Super-Multi DVD 8x Super-Multi DVD Weight 1.6Kg 2.0Kg Depending on your use, the smaller amount of memory could be a disadvantage -- but honestly, if you are doing something that needs 8GB of memory, this is probably not the right notebook to be using anyway. As with all of my laptops (and desktops), the primary use of the notebook will be with Linux -- but I will at least make an attempt to keep Windows on it. Rather than make this a long drawn-out description of the installation process, I am just going to hit the high points: Windows 10 Home tech pro research IT pro’s guide to working smarter with Linux This ebook offers practical tips and advice to help your organization get the most out of Linux. Read More What can I say? It came pre-loaded, so I walked it through the setup and configuration process. It would be more accurate to say that I dragged it through the process, or I allowed it to crawl through the process. It took an hour or so to answer the questions (no, I don't want to send my personal data to Microsoft, no, I don't want to send my browsing history to Microsoft, no, I don't want to connect to unknown WiFi networks just because someone I know connected to them once, or because Microsoft thinks they are nice) and then let it complete the setup and install the first batch of "critical patches". Also: It's the year of Linux on the Windows desktop | Dell's new high-end all-in-one PC offers Ubuntu Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Windows wins the desktop, but Linux takes the world | TechRepublic: Linux desktop operating system: A beginner's guide Then it immediately wanted to "Upgrade to Windows 10" (don't ask me what this means for a freshly installed Windows 10 system), so I let it do that. It downloaded 4GB of data, and then spent another hour and a half installing that. Once that was done it seemed to be quiet for a while - but the next day it once again said that it needed to install "critical updates", and it downloaded another 4GB and spent another two hours installing it. Now it seems to be happy about updates, at least for the moment. But every time I boot Windows, the performance monitor shows the disk access constantly running at a minimum of 40 percent. openSUSE Tumbleweed (KDE) As always with my Linux installations, this was the first to be installed and it will control all of the multi-boot operation from now on. Installation took about 20 minutes, and I had absolutely no problems with it. All of the hardware was recognized and properly configured, including the nasty ASUS "clickpad" pointing device. Manjaro 17.0.1 (KDE) Installation took less than 15 minutes, and everything works. Debian GNU/Linux Because we are getting close to the release of Debian 9.0, I decided to use the Stretch RC3 installer. This probably saved me some trouble, because when I installed Debian 8 (jessie) on the ASUS X540S it didn't handle either the display or the clickpad properly, but the Stretch installer had absolutely no problems at all. I chose the Cinnamon desktop for this installation - I think this is the first time I have used Debian Cinnamon, and it really is nice. Significantly nicer looking and easier to use than the standard Debian Gnome 3 desktop. Fedora (Gnome 3) Again, since we are getting pretty close to the Fedora 26 release, I decided to install 26 Alpha. Again, no problems and everything works. Solus (MATE) Because I already have Solus with the Budgie desktop installed on the other ASUS, I decided to try the MATE desktop on this one. No problems with the installation, and the desktop looks very good. They have done a good job of integrating MATE with the Solus design philosophy. Ubuntu 17.04 (Unity) No problems. Just think, this might be the last time that I load a system with Unity! openSUSE Leap 42.3 Alpha (KDE) Again, because I'm loading the newest versions, and in hopes of avoiding problems, I went for the 42.3 Alpha instead of the stable 42.2 release. The installer didn't like the clickpad, so I had to use a USB mouse for the installation process, but the installed systems works with everything just fine. The bottom line here is that I installed and configured seven Linux distributions in a lot less time than it took to setup Windows 10 - without even including the hours that Windows spent on "upgrades" after the setup was complete. More importantly, every one of those Linux installations boots faster and is more pleasant to use than Windows 10 on this notebook.

Nutanix and IBM executives said that would give a lift to various types of cloud computing and machine learning tasks. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 17, 2017 4:07 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Nutanix logo atop its headquarters in San Jose, California. Illustration: Tiernan Ray for Barron's Shares of storage technology vendor Nutanix (NTNX) are down 69 cents, or 4%, at $16.25, a victim of today’s general sell-off in the broader market, but yesterday the news flow was happier, as the company announced a “multi-year partnership” with International Business Machines (IBM) to sell Nutanix’s software on top of “hyper-converged” computing devices from IBM. The products aren’t hear yet: further details are expected later this year with actual products vaguely promised before the year is out. The announcement was a statement of intent for the two companies to create something unique versus Nutanix’s original appliance offerings, and what IBM could have done on its own. Nutanix's head of marketing, Howard Ting, and IBM's head of its "Power" computing operations, Stefanie Chiras, were kind enough to take a few minutes to talk with me by phone about the announcement. For Nutanix, this is its third "OEM " deal, after supplying both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) with its storage software to run on top of those partners' hardware. Previously, Nutanix had deals to deliver a combo of hardware and software to Dell, for example. This deal gets Nutanix a much wider platform for distribution by having the products sold by IBM's global sales team. For IBM, this is its first foray into so-called "converged" infrastructure, where a single machine incorporates a combination of storage, networking and compute. "It is a big deal that this is the first non-Intel offering" in the converged marketplace, said Ting, meaning, the first device that doesn't run on an Intel (INTC) "x86" microprocessor. Chiras noted that the Power chips, which IBM has designed for years, have been tuned to run compute cycles on the open-source Linux operating system. The chips and the system, along with Nutanix's software, have been designed to support things such as "cognitive" workloads, said Chiras, such as a bank, perhaps, trying to run financial models through deep-learning algorithms. Power has been optimized for a number of things that Chiras thinks will make Linux efficient for tasks such as "big data" and "analytics," things such as better handling of large cache sizes, a focus on greater bandwidth in the processor than is the case in Intel parts, and greater "multi-threading" of applications. She noted IBM's "Open CAFE" technology provides for ten times the throughput of a comparable x86 part doing similar workloads. I also asked Chiras about True North, a project that's been going on for years in IBM's research division, to develop chips focused on tasks such as artificial intelligence. Chiras said the Power team "work band in hand with our research team, absolutely, on things like accelerators and I/O [input/output]."

Image Credit: GamesBeat PC gaming isn’t ceding the Electronic Entertainment Expo tradeshow to consoles, and it is even getting some of the biggest names in the industry to fill out its stage presentation. Xbox and the popular Battle Royale-like online shooter PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds are joining the PC Gaming Show at E3. At 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, June 12, PC Gamer (a magazine and website that covers computer gaming) will take over The Theater at the Ace hotel in Los Angeles for an event that will feature news from Intel, Arma developer Bohemia Interactive, and more. This shows how Microsoft is attempting to further its presence in the PC-gaming space. The company has backed off a console-first approach, and it now says that it doesn’t care where you buy its games because it’s more interested in getting you to use Xbox Live. Microsoft is planning to have “leaders” and game developers from its Xbox team on the show’s stage to talk about what the company is doing with PC gaming. The company will also talk about its Beam livestreaming video service. “PC gaming is a huge part of our gaming ecosystem — across Windows, Beam, and Xbox,” Xbox marketing boss Mike Nichols said. “The PC Gaming Show is the perfect place for us to talk about what’s next from Xbox for PC gamers.” Developer Bluehole will give its more than 2 million PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds players news and updates about where that shooter is headed. That game is the latest massive Early Access success on Steam, and fans are eager to hear more about what the studio is planning to do with its recent influx of millions of dollars. Other games and companies that are headed to The PC Gaming Show include tactical mech combat sim Battletech from Paradox Interactive. Developer Creative Assembly will bring its Total War: Warhammer II strategy game on behalf of publisher Sega. And startup indie publisher Raw Fury Games are planning to participate as well.

May 17, 2017 | By Staff May 17, 2017 | By Staff     Post A Comment More: VR, Design, Production, VRDC Good news, VR enthusiasts: Organizers of the Virtual Reality Developers Conference are proud to announce another pair of great sessions for VRDC Fall 2017, which is happening September 21-22 at a bigger, better venue in San Francisco! Both of these sessions are part of the Innovation track of talks at VRDC Fall 2017, which is all about providing attendees opportunities to meet and learn from experts who are blazing a trail at the frontier of VR and AR development.  Notably, a number of folks who worked on the remarkable Google Earth VR will be speaking at VRDC Fall 2017 about how they designed a comfortable, intuitive interface people can use to navigate the entire world in VR.  In their talk on "UX in Google Earth VR", Google UX lead Adam Glazier and Google engineers Nadav Ashkenazi and Per Karlsson will discuss the work of building an interface that allows you to virtually circumnavigate the globe by flying, dragging, rotating, teleporting and searching. To maintain usability, immersion and comfort, each navigation mode went through rounds of iteration and user testing -- this talk pulls the lid off the UX insights and implementation details that helped make or break each mode of navigation. Don't skip it! Also, VRDC Fall 2017 will play host to Kim Pallister, director of Intel's VR Center of Excellence. In his talk on "What VR Hardware Research can teach about VR Software's Future", Pallister will open up about some "proof of concept" VR hardware and software experiments Intel has done, and what lessons devs can learn from them as they think about future projects. For example, PC HMDs with portions of the software pipeline in the HMD, wireless HMD interfaces, biometric sensors, and computer vision systems embedded in HMDs are just a few of the areas of research Pallister plans to break down in his talk. It promises to be a fascinating session, and course conference officials look forward to announcing many more fantastic VRDC Fall 2017 talks in the weeks ahead.  For now, don't miss the opportunity to save money by registering for the conference early -- the deadline to register for passes at a discounted rate is next Wednesday, May 24th, 2017! Since tickets sold out for the first three VRDC events, VRDC Fall 2017 will offer more sessions and move to a bigger location at the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, CA September 21-22.  For more information on VRDC Fall 2017, visit the show's official website and subscribe to regular updates via Twitter and Facebook.

Qualcomm's recent suit is based on the belief that Apple's refusal to pay royalties related to technology used in smartphones will take a big bite out of its profit and revenue.  (Kiichiro Sato / The Associated Press)   By Mike FreemanThe San Diego Union-Tribune Wed., May 17, 2017 SAN DIEGO—Qualcomm filed a breach of contract lawsuit late Tuesday against four Taiwanese contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads for Apple — the latest salvo in an escalating war between two tech giants over patent royalties. Qualcomm’s court action is in response to Apple’s steps last month to block its contract manufacturers from paying Qualcomm for use of its cellular patents in iPhones and iPads. “Apple is definitely behind this, and certainly what the contract manufacturers would say is the reason they are not paying,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Our response to that is you are big, sophisticated companies. You have contractual obligations. You have license agreements with us that don’t involve Apple. You are responsible for paying that.” Read more: Apple posts quarterly upturn, but numbers show big iPhone dependence Article Continued Below Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm buying NXP Semiconductors in $38.1B deal Apple announces $1B fund to create more U.S. manufacturing jobs The lawsuit falls short of more drastic moves that media outlets speculated Qualcomm would pursue against Apple — including seeking to ban imports of iPhones and iPads into the U.S. Last week, Bloomberg reported Qualcomm would ask the U.S. International Trade Commission to issue an injunction prohibiting iPhone imports, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans. The story was widely repeated. Rosenberg declined to comment on why Qualcomm chose a lawsuit in San Diego Federal Court against Apple’s contract manufacturers rather than going to the U.S. International Trade Commission to bar iPhone imports. “We don’t like suing our licensees,” Rosenberg said, noting that in the past decade the company has brought just one patent infringement case against a smartphone maker. “And we won’t unless we are really put in a corner and forced to do that, and we are forced to do that here.” The lawsuit names iPhone/iPad assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., known as Foxconn Technology Group; Pegatron Corp.; Wistron Corp. and Compal Electronics — all based in Taiwan, but with manufacturing operations in China and elsewhere. All have long-standing patent license agreements with Qualcomm and continue to pay patent royalties to Qualcomm on smartphones and tablets that they make for other companies besides Apple, Rosenberg said. The lawsuit seeks unpaid royalties of at least $1 billion (U.S.) and damages, as well as attorney fees and other costs. “What they are saying is Apple is not paying us, so we are not paying you, and Apple has told us not to pay you,” Rosenberg said. “And we said, that is interesting, but that is between you and Apple.” He continued, “Presumably you have a contract with Apple. You ought to go enforce that contract against Apple. I hope they take that action.” Over the past eight months, Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has been under fierce attack by anti-monopoly regulators and technology giants, including Apple, Samsung and Intel. The Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million and seeks to dismantle the way it licenses its patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Qualcomm in January over similar grounds, and Samsung and Intel have filed friend of the court briefs supporting the FTC’s case. Apple joined the assault shortly after the FTC and perhaps has been the most aggressive in manoeuvres against Qualcomm, which believes that Apple is behind a “global attack on the company.” It is a complicated dispute. Apple reimburses Foxconn and the other contract manufacturers for patent royalties owed to Qualcomm. Early this year, it withheld $1 billion in reimbursements on the grounds that Qualcomm had reneged on a separate royalty “rebate” agreement with Apple in retaliation for Apple’s co-operation with antitrust regulators. Then last month, Apple quit reimbursing Foxconn and the others altogether for Qualcomm patent royalties — claiming it couldn’t pay until the dispute was resolved. As a result, Qualcomm slashed its financial forecast for the year. Qualcomm pioneered a good portion of 3G/4G cellular radio technology and holds thousands of patents on its inventions. Its technology is inside nearly every smartphone. The company licenses patents based on the price of the entire device, and it has agreed to provide certain patents under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms because they are included in wireless industry standards. Apple and regulators claim Qualcomm abuses its market power to overcharge for “standard-essential patents” and block competition. These companies are pushing for patent royalties based on the cost of the cellular modem chip instead of the entire phone, and they want Qualcomm to agree to license not only smartphone makers but also rival chip outfits, such as Intel and Samsung.

The company kept the component mostly for internal artificial intelligence needs. Today, version two arrived -- and Google is selling this one. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced the new chip on Wednesday during a keynote address at the Alphabet Inc. unit’s annual I/O event. Normally, the gathering focuses on mobile software. This year’s spotlight on hardware underscores Pichai’s effort to transform the search giant into an "AI-first" company and a real cloud-computing contender. Companies will be able to purchase the hardware, called Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), through a Google Cloud service. Google hopes it will quicken the pace of AI advancements. And despite official statements to the contrary, it may also threaten Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., the main suppliers of powerful semiconductors that run large processing tasks. "This is basically a supercomputer for machine learning," Urs Hölzle, Google’s veteran technical chief, said. Machine learning, a method for deciphering patterns in reams of data, is behind Google’s recent progress on voice recognition, text translation and search rankings. But the approach cost a lot, and sucked up computing time in Google’s data centers. The latest chip was designed to address these issues, and executives said they saw dramatic improvements after putting the component to work on these internal tasks. Google wouldn’t divulge the chip’s price, what company manufactures it, or when the related cloud service goes on sale. Google still purchases processors from Intel and Nvidia. But by relying more on in-house designs, Google could trim its multi-billion-dollar annual computing bill. Google plans more chips like this, and sees the components as essential for success in the cloud -- a key part of Alphabet’s push to make money beyond digital advertising. Other non-advertising announcements from the conference included new voice-based commerce features for Google’s digital Assistant and physical photo books selling for $9.99 or more. "The field is rapidly evolving," Hölzle said. "For us, it’s very important to advance machine learning for our own purposes and to be the best cloud." During his morning keynote, Pichai also introduced a flurry of machine learning updates for Google products, and unveiled a new web portal housing all of the company’s AI efforts. Google’s cloud business grew by more than 80 percent last year, according to estimates from Synergy Research Group. But Amazon Web Services still has over 40 percent of the public cloud market, and continues to expand at a steady clip. Google is third, according to industry estimates.  Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up To gain share, Google is leaning on its AI prowess. The Cloud TPU chip won’t be sold to Dell Inc. and other makers of servers that power traditional corporate data centers. To get the benefits, customers will have to sign up for a Google cloud service and run their software tasks and store their data on Google’s equipment. If companies get on board, Google insists, they can plumb their own data for unseen efficiency gains and profit.  AWS and no. 2 player Microsoft Corp., make similar cases. So Google’s pitch stresses performance. A single Cloud TPU device, composed of four chips, is nearly 12,000 times faster than IBM’S Deep Blue supercomputer, the famous chess victor from 1997, Hölzle said. Google is stringing 64 of the devices into "pods" that sit in its data centers. Google unveiled its chip at last year’s I/O conference, so why does it need another? First, the company is going up against rivals that develop and deliver faster processors on an annual cadence. To lock in customers, it must match that pace. In addition, the original chip only worked for "inference," processing data that’s already packaged in mathematical models. It’s akin to compressing large photos into tiny digital formats. For instance, a company could turn an algorithm for voice recognition into an app using inference chips.  To create an algorithm from just raw voices, you need lots of data to train AI software. That takes massive computing power, forcing coders to wait days or weeks to see results. Google’s second chip speeds up the training process. In internal tests, it cut the time in half compared to commercially available graphic processing units, known as GPUs. Nvidia, the dominant GPU manufacturer, recently announced a new chip, called Volta, that handles training data like Google’s Cloud TPU. An eight-chip Volta module will sell for $149,000 starting in the third quarter. Google is less experienced at selling chips, so it’s being cautious about commercial deployment. "When you have something that’s really new, some of the tools occasionally break. You want to reach a certain level of maturity," Hölzle said. "We’re probably going to have a lot more demand than we can satisfy." Excessive demand inspired the creation of TPUs in the first place, according to company lore. Six years ago, Google saw an uptick in voice searches on phones. Just three minutes of conversation a day, per Android phone user, would have doubled the number of data centers Google needed, based on its technology at the time. TPUs were designed to handle the extra volume more efficiently. The second-generation chip accelerated Google’s own research. For its translation efforts, Google previously ignored more than eighty percent of its data at the training stage, according to Jeff Dean, who leads a Google AI research unit called Brain. With its new chip, they can use all the information. That means better trained and potentially more accurate AI software. The new chip may let researchers use image data that currently sits unused because of high computing costs, according to Fei-Fei Li, an AI expert who runs a machine learning group inside Google’s Cloud business division. Image classification is one of the machine learning tools Li’s team is offering cloud clients, and the new chip will make this more accessible and usable. EBay Inc. used Google’s cloud to develop ShopBot software that identifies items snapped on smartphone cameras. Today’s image-recognition systems have around ten percent accuracy, said R.J. Pittman, EBay’s Chief Product Officer. The new Cloud TPU, which EBay has not yet tested, could eventually increase accuracy to more than 90 percent, he added. Companies like EBay want AI to tag every physical good in existence. Li imagines businesses that may want to map every square inch on earth or each minute part of a human cell. Amazon and Microsoft have their own AI-powered cloud services too though, and both have committed to buy Nvidia’s Volta chips. "Nvidia is not standing still," said Pittman from EBay, which also buys Nvidia GPUs. Hölzle dismissed a direct rivalry. Nvidia’s chips are built for more general-purpose tasks, he said, while Google’s focus solely on machine learning. That won’t calm Intel and Nvidia investors, who worry about in-house chipmaking efforts by their largest customers -- data center operators like Google. Analysts are concerned that revenue and profitability at the two companies, both at historically high levels, may be dented. Even if Google doesn’t succeed in commercializing its own chips, it’s in a better position to negotiate on price. Google isn’t restricting cloud customers to its own chips. It has Intel and Nvidia processors running inside its data centers. Google’s pushing a Lego-like model -- corporate customers can chose their combination of software and hardware, and rent storage and computing power by the minute. It has to be flexible if it’s going to catch AWS and Microsoft. "Down the road, we make actually pick the hardware for you that minimizes your cost or maximizes your turnaround time or whatever you tell us is important to you," Hölzle said. "It becomes invisible to you." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(MU) Stock While It’s on Sale! MU stock just went on sale thanks to Goldman Sachs By Louis Navellier, Editor, Blue Chip Growth  |  May 17, 2017, 1:38 pm EDT     Popular Posts: The 7 Best REITs You Must Buy Right Now! 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a Reckoning UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) Wins No Matter the Healthcare Outcome Recent Posts: Buy Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock While It’s on Sale! 82 Blue Chip Trades to Make Right Away The 7 Best REITs You Must Buy Right Now! View All Posts Thanks to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) just went on sale. That is, GS just downgraded MU stock because it thinks that memory prices have peaked. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr Granted, the stock is up 200% in the past 12 months, so you can understand why GS analysts are inclined to look a bit skeptically at a more extended run. But the thing they don’t take into account is the fact that we are at the point of inflection with new technologies that are going to require faster and better memory than ever before. The best analogy is to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). This was just a company that made high-end graphics cards for computers. Nothing too special and it had huge competitors like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) on a low-margin product. But then came advances in technologies like virtual reality, Big Data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, smart and driverless cars. All of a sudden, NVDA was in huge demand and the stock continues to soar. That is very similar to what is now happening in memory. For all these new technologies to work and continue to evolve, memory needs to be more dynamic and accessed in near real time. Artificial intelligence is a good example. Store images need to be referenced, analyzed, categorized and a decision needs to be made while a car is in motion. Mechanical memory is not sufficient. GS is looking at a model that isn’t taking into account the significance of this shift. And it’s going to be focused players like MU that will win the biggest in coming years. But you don’t have to wait that long. It’s already happening. MU Stock Is on Fire In late March, Micron announced its Q2 earnings. Revenues were 58% higher than they were compared to the same quarter a year ago and 17% higher in sequential quarters. Gross margins nearly doubled compared to the same quarter last year. These aren’t the numbers of company that is fading into a new leg of the tech revolution. These numbers are growing because MU stock is on top of its industry. As more companies demand better, faster memory, they will need a big company to be able to supply them with the speed and quality they demand. MU stock fits the bill. As for the various competition, it doesn’t have the size or scope or focus that MU has built over the past 40 years. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Yes, the current MacBook Pro is only a couple of months old, but there are plenty of buyers eagerly waiting for the 2017 MacBook Pro update before buying. Signs point to a 2017 MacBook Pro release date as soon as June at WWDC 2017 when Apple gathers developers together to talk about iOS 11 and the new version of MacOS. The current MacBook Pro arrived in October, but there is still more coming from Apple. Tim Cook recently told investors, “You will see us do more in the pro area,” adding that it is “very important to us.” This comes after criticism of the 2016 MacBook Pro. We know that Apple is working on a new Mac Pro, but we expect the 0217 MacBook Pro will beat the new Mac Pro to the market. We’ll set the stage for what you can expect from the 2017 Macbook Pro and what you shouldn’t expect as Apple marches forward with changes to the Pro line of computers. After a major shift last fall pushed the 13-inch Macbook Pro without Touch Bar into the MacBook Air slot, it looks like Apple is committed to keeping a slimmer computer lineup. We expect a 2017 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar as well as two 2017 Macbook Pro Touch Bar models. Look for a 2017 MacBook 12-inch sometime this year. New details suggest we may even see a 2017 MacBook Air release soon. 2017 MacBook Pro Release Date We could see a 2017 MacBook Pro release date in the second half of the year. Originally rumored for later this year, new reports point to a quick 2017 MacBook Pro release date. Bloomberg reports that Apple will announce a 2017 MacBook Pro update at WWDC. Expect this to happen on June 5th on stage as Apple discusses new software and devices. This will be one of three new MacBooks that Apple announces on this date. Apple has not announced new hardware at WWDC since 2013, but this rumor meshes well with previous reports. Ming-Chi Kou, is one of the best sources for Apple information. In a research note shared on MacRumors, we learn that Apple may start production of the 2017 Macbook Pro in Q3. That means the new models may see production as soon as July. Kou isn’t right 100% of the time, but he is one of the best sources. It would make sense for Apple to announce the 2017 MacBook Pro at WWDC on June 5th and start selling it as soon as July. Given the lack of any visual changes, this could happen even sooner than Kou’s original report.   2017 MacBook Pro Specs We expect a processor upgrade for the 2017 Macbook Pro models. Other than that, there is a good chance that we will see similar specs, though there is a chance for more RAM. Ming-Chi Kou says that we will see Kaby Lake processors as the headline for the 2017 MacBook Pro specs. Bloomberg backs this up in a report in May. We’ve also seen code in a macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta hint at support for Kaby Lake. Apple launched the current models with an older Skylake processor. While it is possible that Apple is building their own processors for the MacBook Pro, it’s unlikely it will be ready for this refresh. Intel Kaby Lake Processors Kaby Lake Integrated GPU on 13-inch and Radeon Pro GPU on 15-inch 8GB and 16GB RAM Options – Potential for 32GB RAM Option Four USB Type C Ports, Potentially USB 3.1 Gen 2 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD Options We could see Apple add in support for 32GB of RAM in the 2017 MacBook Pro. This is one of the biggest complaints from professional users about the model on sale today. Apple did not offer 32GB of RAM due to power consumption, which would have hurt the battery life of the MacBook Pro. 2017 MacBook Pro Design Expect a similar MacBook Pro design. The 2016 MacBook Pro design is what you can expect for the 2017 MacBook Pro. Apple keeps MacBook designs around for a long time, much longer than iPhones, and it would not make sense to switch the design dramatically in such a short period. Perhaps the biggest potential change to the 2017 MacBook Pro design would be the colors offered. You can only buy two Macbook Pro colors, but there are four color options for the MacBook. It would make sense for Apple to add in a Gold MacBook Pro and a Rose Gold MacBook Pro during the 2017 refresh. 2017 MacBook Pro Battery Life We could see the 2017 MacBookPro battery life improve thanks to Intel Kaby Lake processors. The 2016 models arrived with complaints about poor battery life, irregular battery life and other battery problems. While Apple sorted out many of these issues, there are still some owners who see bad MacBook Pro battery life at random. The new Kaby Lake processors are more power efficient. PCGamer reports, “Intel claims laptops with Kaby Lake processors will be able to provide up to 9.5 hours of 4K video playback.” That could shake out to better overall Macbook Pro battery life. 2017 MacBook Pro Price Look for a very familiar 2017 MacBook Pro price. The 2017 MacBook Pro price will likely be the same. We have not heard rumors yet that indicate major changes to features that would coordinate with a higher price and it is unlikely that there will be a price cut this soon. Apple just started selling the 2016 Macbook Pro for $300+ off in the refurbished store, which will remain as an option for cost-conscious buyers. New MacBook Pro: 6 Reasons to Buy, 4 Reasons Not To Buy for a Smaller Design & Touch Bar   1 / 10 One of the biggest reasons to buy the 2016 MacBook Pro is the new design. The new MacBook Pro is thinner, lighter and smaller than the one it replaces.  Apple shaves half a pound of each of the models, shrinks the overall; size by 20 to 23% and makes them thinner without cutting battery life, performance or the screen size.  The new models include a Touch Bar above the display on the $1,799 and up models. This allows you to touch the small display to control applications and system functions.  When you use Apple applications and soon other applications, the Touch Bar will change so you can use it to quickly access what you want. We know you can use it for Emoji, for app functions, for quick replies and much more.  In addition to the Touch Bar, you also get a new Force Touch trackpad that is twice as big as the trackpad on the 2015 MacBook Pro.    1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

He has recently been increasingly critical of the Trump administration following news reports alleging that the President had casually given Russians highly classified intelligence during an Oval Office visit and that he had allegedly pressured former FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into a member of his staff. Read more Intel Trump gave to Russia 'so secret US media asked not to report it' “We’ve seen this movie before. It’s reaching Watergate size and scale,” Mr McCain said previously at a dinner for the International Republican Institute. “This is not good for the country.” Those scandals have rocked the White House recently, and has further alienated Republicans in Congress who already appeared to be having a difficult time working in sync with the Trump administration to move legislation. Republicans in both the House and the Senate have indicated that they want to see memos reportedly written by Mr Comey that describe conversations with Mr Trump in which the President asked him to let go of investigations into former National Security Director Michael Flynn’s interactions with Russian officials. Mr Flynn was forced to step down form his post in February after it was revealed that he had misrepresented a conversation he had with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period.   #Breaking Vid: Watergate took months—This thing seems to be taking hours @SenJohnMcCain#impeachtrump #trumprussia pic.twitter.com/0koLWO6Xu0 — Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) May 17, 2017   The biggest names involved in the Trump-Russia investigation 11 show all The biggest names involved in the Trump-Russia investigation 1/11 Paul Manafort Mr Manafort is a Republican strategist and former Trump campaign manager.

Mr Bahara had been heading up several investigations including one into one of President Donald Trump's favorite cable television channels Fox News. Several investigations would lead back to that district, too, including those into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia, and Mr Trump's assertion that Trump Tower was wiretapped on orders from his predecessor.

(NASDAQ: AMD) has incredibly outperformed the markets this year and analysts have been eating out of this company’s hand. But there could be a problem going forward. The company recently held its analyst day, and now that firms have gotten a closer look, some aren’t necessarily liking what they see. One analyst went from bullish to not entirely convinced in this short span. Loop Capital downgraded AMD to a Hold rating but maintained its price target of $13, implying upside of 2% compared with a $12.75 close. In a sense the firm is moving to the sideline on this stock. As part of this guidance, AMD announced plans to launch Ryzen 3 CPUs for premium desktops in the third quarter, Ryzen Pro for commercial desktops in the second half of 2017, Ryzen Mobile for consumer in the second half of 2017, Mobile Ryzen Pro for commercial in the first half of 2018, Vega GPUs in June, and Epyc CPUs for servers in June. AMD expects Ryzen CPUs to be made available by the top five PC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the second quarter. As a result, AMD reiterated its year-over-year revenue guidance for 2017 of low double-digit percentage growth and expects the ramp up of these products along with continued growth in semi-custom chips for game consoles to drive sustained this double-digit revenue growth as a percentage through 2020. AMD also guided long-term revenue growth of double digits as a percentage driven by a few reasons: New product momentum. Pro forma gross to a range of 40% to 44% driven by higher average selling prices (ASPs) and richer product mix. OpEx as a percent of overall revenue in a range of 26% to 30% as AMD needs to continue to invest. Pro forma EPS of >$0.75 driven by improving profitability. Loop Capital also added: We believe shares of AMD increased 11.65% yesterday vs. the 1.49% of the SOX primarily due to an article in Fudzilla that implies Intel will be licensing AMD’s GPU (graphics processing unit) IP. Intel and NVIDIA’s 7-yr licensing and royalty agreement recently ended. This agreement gave Intel the rights in perpetuity to every one of NVIDIA’s patents (since NVIDIA’s inception) up to the conclusion of the agreement. We believe with Intel having 106,000 employees vs. AMD’s 8,200 (as of December 2016) and rights in perpetuity (i.e. forever) to every one of NVIDIA’s GPU patents up to January 2017 that Intel does not need AMD’s GPU IP and think it’s very unlikely Intel will strike a licensing deal with AMD. Shares of AMD were last seen down 9% at $11.56 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $12.62 and a 52-week trading range of $3.69 to $15.55.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 17, 2017 -- 17:21 GMT (10:21 PDT) | Topic: Hardware The Google Cloud TPU delivers up to 180 teraflops of computing power. At the Google I/O conference Wednesday, Google unveiled the next generation of its custom-built Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a chip designed for machine learning. The first generation of TPUs, revealed at last year's I/O, were designed to run already-trained machine learning models. This new chip, delivering an impressive 180 teraflops of computing power, both trains and runs such models. Called the Cloud TPU, the second-generation chip will be available to anyone through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Developers on GCP are still free to design with traditional like Intel's Skylake or GPUs like Nvidia's Volta. The Cloud TPU is the latest example of how Google's using its cutting-edge technology to set itself apart from its public cloud competitors. "We want Google Cloud to be the best cloud for machine learning," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in the I/O keynote address. "This lays the foundation for significant progress." special feature How to Implement AI and Machine Learning The next wave of IT innovation will be powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We look at the ways companies can take advantage of it and how to get started. Read More To ramp up computing power even further, Google has built a custom, ultra-high speed network to connect 64 TPUs into a machine-learning supercomputer. Called a TPU pod, it can deliver up 11.5 petaflops (or 11,500 teraflops) of compute to train either a single large machine learning model or many smaller ones. To illustrate the power of a TPU pod, Google said that to train its new, large-scale language translation model, it would take a full day using 32 of the world's best commercially available GPUs. By contrast, one-eighth of a TPU pod can train the model in just six hours. Both the individual Cloud TPUs and the full TPU pods were designed to be programmed using high-level abstractions expressed using the Tensorflow machine learning system -- the open sourced system developed by Google. The first-generation TPUs were deployed internally at Google two years ago and are used on Google producuts such as Search, the new neural machine translation system for Google Translate, Google speech recognition and Google Photos. Jeff Dean, a senior fellow for Google Brain, told reporters this week that Google is still using CPUs and GPUs to train some machine learning models. However, he expects that over time, Google will increasingly use TPUs. Meanwhile, Google on Wednesday also announced the TensorFlow Research Cloud, a cluster of 1,000 Cloud TPUs that Google will offer for free to researchers on certain conditions. The researchers must be willing to openly publish the results of their research and potentially open source the code associated with their research. Google's making the Research Cloud available to accelerate the pace of machine learning research and plans to share it with entities like Harvard Medical School. For those involved in proprietary research, Google plans to launch the Cloud TPU Alpha program.

Stratoscale shows you how Video GE Power's Ganesh Bell: How not to fail at digital transformation Last week saw a few thousand devoted OpenStack community members flock to Boston to take part in the bi-annual OpenStack Summit. This summit marks a major turning point for the initiative. Since we all congregated in Barcelona last year, there have been some major pieces of news which have rocked the community. Only a couple of weeks before the event, Intel pulled out of a partnership with Rackspace to build an OpenStack-based test facility, and OpenStack poster boy Mirantis pivoted from a pure OpenStack strategy to one covering a number of open source initiatives. Indeed, it was an eye opener to walk around the OpenStack expo hall for the brief time I was in Boston — past summits have seen huge expo stands from big names such as HPE, IBM, Cisco and EMC. This year, while the expo hall had lots of companies there, they were predominantly small bit players. And while the OpenStack Foundation was proud of its new sponsors, it should be noted that the days of the mega-vendors coming on board and sponsoring the foundation (which has, it must be added, a not insignificant budget) would seem to be over. While these new logos look good on a slide deck, I’m not sure how well they fill the coffers. And so, the foundation really did need some awesome wins to crow about. And while good, chunky commercial success stories are few and far between, and they did gain some accolades from an unexpected quarter. Edward Snowden, the NSA whistle-blower, made a live appearance via satellite link from his exile in Russia. In his interview with OpenStack Foundation stalwart Mark Collier, Snowden warned those watching about the risks of the for-profit cloud computing vendors — in particular the big three: Amazon, Microsoft and Google. According to Snowden, people should not mindlessly use technology as these commercial companies tend not to offer their customers control or visibility over their data. “You’re giving them your data and giving up control,” he opined. He further waxed poetic suggesting that, “If you run on Google’s or Amazon’s technology, how do you know when it starts spying on you? You have no awareness because it happens at a hidden layer of the software.” In what must have been music to the OpenStack Foundation’s board and management, Snowden suggested that the use of open source technologies, of which OpenStack is, of course, one, may be a better option for users than investing in technology they don’t own, influence, control or even shape. Of course, the open source community has a tendency to have a higher-than-usual proportion of proponents of this “they’re out to get us” mentality, and Snowden’s message was understandably well-received. MyPOV Very few individuals or organizations make technology choices simply because of the conceptual risk of outside interference or oversight. While the Snowden revelations did have lots of people hand-wringing and suggesting we should all leave the big vendors en masse, the reality is that this hasn’t occurred to any real degree. Of course there are other reasons to avoid these vendors — for those in heavily regulated industries or with data location requirements that they can’t meet, for example. But this is more of a needs-must situation rather than one of principle. Witness the less than stellar success OpenStack has generated and contrast it to the incredible growth of Amazon, Microsoft and Google and their cloud platform — that in itself is a good indication of what is really important to people. So while Snowden’s comments were well received by attendees, they’re unlikely to make a real difference from an adoption perspective. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

Producing all-in-one products shouldn't be difficult - simply choose an OEM and add a few customisations to apply your own stamp - and hey presto, you've a premium product with plenty of enthusiast appeal. But not all liquid coolers are alike, as the manufacturer-specific tweaks range from RGB lighting, additional software and tailor-made fans. EVGA has all this and more in its latest offering, the CLC 280. Priced at £130 and aimed at the enthusiast who doesn't want to dabble with a custom loop, this closed-loop-cooler (CLC) is designed to be easy to install and powerful enough to tame an overclocked CPU. Radiator dimensions of 312mm x 139mm x 27mm limit chassis compatibility somewhat, but if you have room for the aluminium block, an all-in-one cooler helps clear the clutter from around the CPU socket, creating a tidy-looking build. Build quality, as you'd expect from an Asetek-based cooler, is good throughout, but given EVGA's prominence in the graphics market, we're a tad surprised the firm has opted for a completely sealed unit. This is strictly a CPU-only solution and no provisions have been made for incorporating a graphics card into the loop. Sleeved tubing neatly connects the radiator to the pump and copper waterblock, with the latter supplied with a neat coat of thermal paste as standard. Do note that no additional thermal paste is provided as part of the bundle, so you'll need to source your own supply for any subsequent installations. The bundle does include fixtures and fittings for Intel sockets LGA2011, 2011-v3, 1150, 1151, 1155, 1156 and 1356, as well as AMD AM2, AM3, FM1 and FM2. Support for AMD Ryzen (AM4) isn't available out of the box, but a compatible bracket can be ordered free of charge. In an effort to stand out from the crowd, EVGA equips the radiator with two 140mm Teflon Nano Bearing fans. Both are pre-attached to the radiator in an intake configuration (though they can be reversed if need be) and the unusual 'curved housing' is said to improve airflow and limit vibration. At the other end of the product, the low-profile CPU block, with neatly rounded sides, touts a transparent top with a backlit EVGA logo. The RGB illumination can be configured by the user and be set to respond to temperature or match an EVGA graphics card, however the position of the tubing is likely to obscure the illumination - the pipework naturally droops down, somewhat defeating the purpose the of the lights. Asetek's latest-generation mounting kit worked well on the recently reviewed Fractal Design Celsius S24, and it's the same story here. Fix the plastic backplate to the rear of the motherboard using the supplied standoffs, then secure the CPU block in place with the four metal bolts. Installation could hardly get any easier, though, if you're being picky, you could argue that EVGA's implementation isn't the cleanest. Both fans attach to a split cable emanating from the top of the block, and the three-pin power cable originates from the same position. In addition to these two cables, a USB lead connects to the bottom of the block and attaches to a motherboard header for software customisation. Something to be aware of if keeping cable clutter down to a minimum is high on your list of priorities. Software control tends to divide consumers. Some prefer not to install additional utilities for components that ought to just work, while others appreciate the ability to fine-tune. EVGA is targeting the latter crowd with its Flow Control software, through which both the RGB LED and the fan curve can be customised. Flow Control doesn't scale well on our 4K screen and the software still feels rough around the edges. What's interesting is that fan speed doesn't drop below 1,000rpm at the lowest setting and the default fan curve is particularly aggressive. The only way to reduce noise further is to manually lower the voltage supplied to the three-pin header via BIOS, though in doing so you risk stalling both the pump and fans. EVGA is clearly focussed on performance first and foremost, so let's see what the benchmarks have to say.

CEO Sundar Pichai revealed the new chip and service this morning in Silicon Valley during his keynote at Google I/O, the company’s annual developer conference. Google I/O Wired Staff Google I/O 2017 Liveblog: Breaking News From the Live Keynote Michael Calore Google I/O 2017: Watch Live Video of Google’s Big Show Right Here David Pierce Google Lens Turns Your Camera Into a Search Box Liz Stinson Google Just Made Email a Heckuva Lot Easier to Deal With This new processor is a unique creation designed to both train and execute deep neural networks—machine learning systems behind the rapid evolution of everything from image and speech recognition to automated translation to robotics. Google says it will not sell the chip directly to others. Instead, through its new cloud service, set to arrive sometime before the end of the year, any business or developer can build and operate software via the internet that taps into hundreds and perhaps thousands of these processors, all packed into Google data centers. The new chips and the new cloud service are in keeping with the longterm evolution of the internet’s most powerful company. For more than a decade, Google has developed new data center hardware, from computer servers to network gear, to more efficiently drive its online empire. And more recently, it has worked to sell time on this hardware via the cloud—massive computing power anyone can use to build and operate websites, apps, and other software online. Most of Google’s revenue still comes from advertising, but the company sees cloud computing as another major source of revenue that will carry a large part of its future. A data center TPU ‘pod,’ packed with 64 chip boards.Google The Sequel Dubbed TPU 2.0 or the Cloud TPU, the new chip is a sequel to a custom-built processor that has helped drive Google’s own AI services, including its image recognition and machine translation tools, for more than two years. Unlike the original TPU, it can be used to train neural networks, not just run them once they’re trained. Also setting the new chip apart: it’s available through a dedicated cloud service. Today, businesses and developers typically train their neural networks using large farms of GPUs—chips originally designed to render graphics for games and other software. The Silicon Valley chip maker nVidia has come to dominate this market. Now Google is providing some serious competition with a chip specifically designed to train neural networks. The TPU 2.0 chip can train them at a rate several times faster than existing processors, cutting times from as much as day down to a several hours, says Jeff Dean, who oversees Google Brain, the company’s central AI lab. Amazon and Microsoft offer GPU processing via their own cloud services, but they don’t offer bespoke AI chips for both training and executing neural networks. But Google could see more competition soon. Several companies, including chip giant Intel and a long list of startups, are now developing dedicated AI chips that could provide alternatives to the Google TPU. “This is the good side of capitalism,” says Chris Nicholson, the CEO and founder of a deep learning startup called Skymind. “Google is trying to do something better than Amazon—and I hope it really is better. That will mean the whole market will start moving faster.” Still, arriving at a new chip first doesn’t guarantee Google success. To take advantage of TPU 2.0, developers will have to learn a new way of building and executing neural networks. It’s not just that this is a new chip. TPU 2.0 is also designed specifically for TensorFlow, software for running neural networks that was developed at Google. Though Tensorflow is open source software available to anyone, many researchers use competing software engines, such as Torch and Caffe. “New forms of hardware require new optimizations,” Nicholson says. “Every time we optimize for a new chip, it takes months.” A few weeks before Google introduced TPU 2.0, Yann LeCun, Facebook’s head of AI research, questioned whether the market would move towards new AI-specific chips because researchers were already so familiar with the tools needed to work with GPUs. “They are going to be very hard to unseat,” he said of GPUs, “because you need an entire ecosystem.” All that said, Google will continue to offer access to GPUs via its cloud services as the blossoming market for AI chips spans many different processors in the years to come. A TPU board from above.Google A New Way Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. By analyzing millions of cat photos, for instance, they can learn to identify a cat. By analyzing a vast database of spoken words, they can learn to recognize the commands you speak to your digital assistant. At Google, neural networks even help choose search results, the heart of its online empire. These systems are fundamentally changing the way technology is built and operated, all the way down to the hardware. Unlike traditional software, these system must be trained. They must, say, analyze a few hundred million cat photo to learn what a cat is. Companies and developers undertake this training with help from GPUs, sometimes thousands of them, running inside the massive computer data centers that underpin the world’s internet services. Training on traditional CPU processors—the generalist chips inside the computer servers that drive online software—just takes too much time and electrical power. Related Video Meet the Blind Man Who Convinced Google Its Self-Driving Car Is Finally Ready For similar reasons, CPUs are ill-suited to executing neural networks—that is, taking what they’ve learned about how to identify cats in photos, for example, and identifying them in new ones. Google designed its original TPU for this execution stage. Offering a chip that handles training as well represents a major step forward. Dean said the company built this new chip at least in part because its machine translation models were too large to train as fast as the company wanted to. According to Dean, Google’s new “TPU device,” which spans four chips, can handle 180 trillion floating point operations per second, or 180 teraflops, and the company uses a new form of computer networking to connect several of these chips together, creating a “TPU pod” that provides about 11,500 teraflops of computing power. In the past, Dean said, the company’s machine translation model took about a day to train on 32 state-of-the-art CPU boards. Now, it can train in about six hours using only a portion of a pod. That kind of speed advantage could certainly attract outside AI researchers. AI research is an enormously experimental process that involves extensive trial and error across enormous amounts of hardware. “We’re currently limited by our computational resources,” says Isaac Kohane, a professor of biomedical informatics and pediatrics who is exploring the use of neural networks in healthcare and has discussed the new chip with Google. But the success of Google’s cloud service will depend not only on how fast the chip is and how easy it is to use, but on how much it costs. Nicholson believes that if Google offers the service at a much lower cost than existing GPU services, it could build a significant foothold for its larger cloud computing efforts. “If they make it free or next to free, people will use it,” he says,” and they will make people dependent on their cloud infrastructure.” Along those lines, Google has already said that it will offer free access to researchers willing to share their research with the world at large. That’s good for the world’s AI researchers. And it’s good for Google. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Legal Image Source: DENIS POROY/AP/REX/Shutterstock Qualcomm really wants its iPhone money Chris Smith @chris_writes May 17th, 2017 at 12:52 PM Share Tweet Qualcomm has some serious legal problems right now. The FTC and Apple accused it of abusing its power in the chip business. The FTC is investigating Qualcomm’s alleged antitrust practices, while Apple went ahead and sued the company for overcharging for critical chips used in the iPhone. Qualcomm is disputing those claims and denying any wrongdoings. But it certainly doesn’t look goodfor the company right now, because Samsung and Intel have just filed amicus briefs against Qualcomm in its FTC battle. On the Apple front, things aren’t looking good there either, as the iPhone maker supposedly instructed its suppliers to withhold royalty payments to Qualcomm until the lawsuit is resolved. Qualcomm doesn’t appreciate missing out on iPhone money and the company has sued no less than four major Apple partners. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life Qualcomm has filed a complaint against Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, and Compal, companies that mass-produce various devices for Apple, according to Reuters. A few weeks ago, Qualcomm was forced to revise its most recent earnings guidance after Apple informed it that there will be no royalty payments to its contract manufacturers for the sales in the March quarter. iPhone fees would have accounted for some $500 million in revenue for the first three months of the year, money that Qualcomm might not see anytime soon. But it turns out that Qualcomm really wants that cash. The chip maker wants these four entities to comply with their obligations and asked for declaratory relief and damages in its new suit. “While not disputing their contractual obligations to pay for the use of Qualcomm’s inventions, the manufacturers say they must follow Apple’s instructions not to pay,” the company said.

News 338 0 0 May 17, 2017 Vladimir Putin Willing To Release Transcript Of Meeting With Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Louis Babcock It seems like every day there is a new accusation of a scandal developing within Donald Trump’s presidency. The latest accusation claims that President Trump illegally shared classified information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Trump administration, along with Russia, has denied the accusation. A report by CNN states that Vladimir Putin is willing to release a copy of the transcript from the meeting between Trump and Lavrov in order to put a stop to the claims. According to Putin, this latest accusation against Trump is “political schizophrenia.” “If the US administration finds it necessary, we are ready to provide the record of the conversation between Trump and Lavrov to the Senate and Congress.” If Vladimir Putin sticks to his word and releases his copy of the transcript from the meeting, pressure could mount that forces the Trump administration to release their copy of the same meeting. Both transcripts would need to match up in order for the public to believe they are authentic. Vladimir Putin: Russia Can Prove Donald Trump Did Not Give Classified Intel to Diplomats https://t.co/cZXhcfRQHC pic.twitter.com/jjPlwRLv66 — Jim Eastridge (@jimEastridge1) May 17, 2017 Another report by CNN states that the Senate intelligence committee has put in a request to be told what was said during the meeting between Trump and Lavrov. Two members of the Senate intelligence committee, Senator Richard Burr and Senator Mark Warner, commented on the Senate’s request. “Once Mark and I have an opportunity to talk to individuals that were in the meeting, that will either confirm our confidence or possibly shake our confidence. We’re trying to go the extra mile — we owe the White House the chance to present us with the information, present us with the truth. We want to know from people in the room, also want to know if there are these supposed transcripts.” As president, Donald Trump has the ability to declassify any classified information. Senator Burr went on to discuss this ability. “This is probably a good time to take a breath, and understand the President has the ability and the right to talk about intelligence. There is a point that you cut that off with foreign leaders, especially when sources and methods are involved, so it’s crucial that we talk to individuals to find out exactly what was said not necessarily what was not said.” The idea that Donald Trump illegally shared classified information with Lavrov came from a report by the Washington Post. The story from the Washington Post used an anonymous source in their report. H.R. McMaster was present in the Oval Office when the meeting took place and commented on the information that was discussed. “The president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.” Vladimir Putin rushes to defend Trump amid calls for his impeachment https://t.co/0Xad86BINs pic.twitter.com/JmtHYozCHi — HuffPost UK Politics (@HuffPostUKPol) May 17, 2017 This latest scandal has caused talks of impeachment to ramp up. It used to be believed that these talks of impeachment were just democrats who were angry but now the impeachment talks have crossed party lines. A report by News Max is stating that Representative Justin Amash, republican from Michigan, says Trump should be impeached if it is discovered that he tampered with the FBI investigation into Michael Flynn by asking James Comey to stop the investigation. This would be considered obstruction of justice which is an impeachable offense. Related Article Impeachment Process: What Steps Need To Happen To Remove The President From Office?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Is Slumping Today The company's Analyst Day event deflated some of the optimism surrounding the stock. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) May 17, 2017 at 12:06PM What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) dropped on Wednesday in reaction to the company's Analyst Day event Tuesday afternoon. While AMD revealed new information about upcoming products and laid out long-term financial targets, investors were left underwhelmed. The stock declined as much as 9.7% Wednesday morning, settling into an 9.25% loss by 11:45 a.m. EDT. So what AMD laid out its plan to return to profitability. The company expects to grow revenue by a low double-digit percentage in 2017, with the bottom line boosted by a rising gross margin. Positive non-GAAP net income is expected, although AMD didn't provide a specific target. AMD expects to continue to grow revenue by a double-digit percentage annually through 2020, with gross margin rising above 40% and non-GAAP EPS reaching $0.75. A focus on premium products with high margins will be the driver behind the growth. Image source: AMD. In terms of products, AMD announced that Ryzen Mobile and the commercial orientated Ryzen Pro will be launching in the second half, and the 16-core Threadripper desktop CPU will be available in the summer. AMD also announced the first product built around its high-end Vega GPU, the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, which targets professional applications. EPYC, AMD's upcoming server processors previously codenamed Naples, will launch in June. There are two things that could be responsible for driving down AMD's stock price on Wednesday. First, the stock already traded for 17 times what the company hopes to earn in 2020 going into Wednesday, a valuation investors may be realizing is too optimistic. Second, AMD failed to confirm a rumor that emerged on Tuesday that it had struck a graphics licensing deal with Intel. The lack of confirmation could mean that it's still nothing more than a rumor. Now what AMD is targeting the premium segment of both the PC CPU and GPU markets, where it will face stiff competition from Intel and NVIDIA. In the server CPU market, it will need to show its customers that its EPYC CPUs offer a clear value proposition compared to Intel's offerings. If any part of that plan gets derailed, AMD will miss its long-term targets, which are already baked into the stock price. The slump on Wednesday is another instance of investors realizing that the optimism surrounding AMD was overdone. The stock nearly quadrupled in 2016, but it took a hit after a lackluster first-quarter report, and it's taking another hit after the long-term outlook simply wasn't enough to justify the stock price. AMD may outperform its targets, with its new products performing better than expected. But the company has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, so I wouldn't bet on it.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews Memory  Kingston Digital Gold microSD UHS-I Class 3 64GB and 32GB Flash Card Review Kingston Digital Gold microSD UHS-I Class 3 64GB and 32GB Flash Card Review Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Wed, May 17, 2017 - 10:21 AM 0 Comments Kingston Digital recently refreshed its microSD UHS-I Speed Class 3 (U3) with the introduction of the Kingston Gold microSD UHS-I U3 series of memory cards. These microSD Flash cards are ideal for 4K recording devices such as GoPro or drones due to the small form factor and high level of Read/Write performance. These new microSD UHS-I U3 cards are available in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB capacities and will allow you to shoot 4K video up to 30 frames per second and capturing footage at 120 frames per second in 1080P HD. And like all Kingston Flash memory cards they are waterproof, shock and vibration proof and backed by a lifetime warranty with free technical support. We managed to get our hands onto the Kingston Gold microSD UHS-I Class 3 64GB card (Sold under part number SDCG/64GB for $47.73) and the 32GB model (sold under part number SDCG/32GB for $25.68) to do some testing on. There is also the 16GB version (part number SDCG/16GB for $12.59) for those that don’t need as much storage space. All three cards are rated at up to 90 MB/s sequential read and 45 MB/s sequential write We got a chance to try out the cards on our 7th Gen Intel Core i7-7700K powered desktop that uses an ASUS Z270 platform with a Kingston FCR-HS4 USB 3.0 memory card reader ($17.98 shipped). We’ll be taking a quick look at these cards with CrystalDiskMark 5.2.1, ATTO Disk Benchmark v3.05 and a real world drag and drop test to see how the sequential Read/Write speeds look on our particular test system. We should point out that the Kingston Digital Gold microSDHC UHS-I Speed Class 3 32GB Flash card comes formatted with the FAT32 file system whereas the larger 64GB microSDXC version comes formatted in the exFAT file system. exFAT is nice as it allows you to store files much larger than the 4GB limited on FAT32 and works with all versions of Windows and the most recent versions of Mac OS X. We managed to reach sequential Read speeds of up to 92.7 MB/s and up to 28.3 MB/s Write on the 64GB card and up to 91.9 MB/s Read and 42.6 MB/s Write on the smaller 32GB card. So, we were able to beat the cards rated 90 MB/s Sequential Read speeds, but fell short of the 45 MB/s Sequential Write rating on both the Kingston Digital Gold microSDHC 32GB card and Kingston Digital Gold microSDXC 64GB card. Let’s see if we can hit them on another benchmark like ATTO. ATTO Disk Benchmark also showed that we were close to the rated speeds as we topped out at 95 MB/s Read and 44 MB/s Write when using the 64GB microSDXC card and then we hit 96 MB/s Read and 49 MB/s Write on the 32GB microSDHC card. These are pretty close to the cards rated speeds, but as you can see from the results you’ll need to be transferring larger sizes to see speeds like that. Speeds of course vary depending on the host and device configuration, but this should give you a ballpark idea on what performance you can expect. The final test we did was to transfer a 2.16GB MKV file of a 1080P movie that we backed up and copied it from our Window 10 systems M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD to each of the Kingston Gold microSD Flash memory cards. The 32GB card topped out at around 50 MB/s and it took roughly 48 seconds to transfer the entire 2.16GB movie. The 64GB card was faster at the start of the transfer and topped out at a higher 52 MB/s and was able to finish the file transfer in roughly 47 seconds. Not bad performance and we are happy to see that each card was able to perform better than the rated 45 MB/s write speed in this test. Final Thoughts & Conclusions We found the new Kingston Gold microSD UHS-I U3 memory card series to be offer solid performance, respectable price points and a lifetime warranty. Not all microSD memory cards come with a lifetime warranty, so be sure to keep an eye on warranties if you are shopping around for a new microSD card for your camera, action camera, drone, smartphone, tablet or whatever device you plan on using it in. You should also keep in mind that the Kingston Digital Gold microSD series is a step up from the Class 4 and Class 10 UHS-I cards in terms of speed, but still is a step behind the UHS-I Speed Class 3 (U3) cards. If you want the fastest Kinston Digital microSD card possible you’ll need to look at the UHS-I Speed Class 3 (U3) series as they have up to 80 MB/s write speeds versus the 45 MBs/s write speeds on the Gold Series that we reviewed here today. All three Gold series microSD cards are rated at up to 90 MB/s sequential read and 45 MB/s sequential write. The problem with the Kingston Gold microSD series is the pricing. These cards came out in March 2017 and here we are in May 2017 and they are priced higher than the faster Kingston UHS-I Speed Class 3 (U3) series that came out back in January 2015 (read our review from 2015). Take a look at the Amazon prices from May 17th, 2017 below. Kingston Gold microSD Series Pricing: 64GB – SDCG/64GB – $47.73 32GB –  SDCG/32GB – $25.68 16GB – SDCG/16GB – $12.59 Kingston microSD UHS-I Speed Class 3 (U3) Pricing: 64GB – SDCA3/64GBSP – $39.45 32GB – SDCA3/32GB – $18.99 The older series is over $8 less expensive and has 77% faster write speeds. We’d still recommend going with one of these older cards right now due to the price points, but pricing changes all the time so you’ll need to be sure that is still the best value. Legit Bottom Line: The Kingston Digital Gold microSD Flash card series looks good, but street pricing has faster Kingston microSD cards available for less. Questions or Comments?

Recent News CRYORIG Launches NZXT CAM Powered H7 Quad Lumi RGB Cooler Olympus TG-5 brings back the Tough Heads-up, the PC Show 2017 is coming Review: Bragi the Headphone Faces Stiff Competition Cube Mix Plus 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop Review Thursday, May 18, 2017 Gaming Personal Technology Smart Living Mobilty Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Prosumer Reviews for 22 million Enthusiasts Forums SGCafe Advertise Search for: Home > Personal Technology > Laptops > Cube Mix Plus 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop Review LaptopsPersonal TechnologyReviewsTablets and E-Readers Cube Mix Plus 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop Review Zayne Seah May 17, 20170153 Cube has been around for awhile. Alongside Chuwi, it’s a well-known Chinese brand that has consistently produced decent tablet-PCs for a rather low price point. The Cube Mix Plus, is a prime example. For US$379, the Cube Mix Plus sports a really snappy processor, a solid metallic body, and a crystal-clear touchscreen that’s Windows Ink-enabled. So if you’re looking for a budget tablet PC armed with a stylus, look no further. Design The Cube Mix Plus doesn’t look particular eye-catching. It has an unassuming matte silver rear that is cool to the touch, and a pearl-white bezel on the front that frames your display. The tablet screen itself sports the dimension of 27.30 x 17.20 x 0.96 cm. This can be considered to be quite a compact tablet-PC depending on how you look at it, but I do find the device a little larger than necessary considering the significant bezels on the frame. I suspect it’s because of the numerous ports available, with a USB 3 port, USB Type C port, an audio jack, a charging dock, TF card slot, attachments for a physical keyboard as well. It weighs in at 700g, which doesn’t even feel heavy when you slot it in your backpack, but holding it single-handedly might not be that easy. Display The Cube Mix Plus comes with a WACOM enabled 10.6″ IPS panel with a 1920 x 1080 (FHD) resolution. A screen resolution of 1080p means the system will be in general, more fluid and you can even play some games at the native resolution. Nonetheless, the best thing is the WACOM stylus support which makes a the usage of styluses this device much more fluid than on any other budget tablet in the market. The only not-so-lovely part about the screen is honestly the large bezels which makes it look a tad dated. Performance The Cube Mix Plus took me by surprise in the department of speed. It fared incredibly well on my day-to-day usage and I hardly experienced any lags. I ran multiple applications, from Word, to Chrome, to Edge and VLC media player simultaneously without noticing any slowdowns or delayed responses at all, which in my opinion, was really commendable. This could be credited to both its fantastic Intel Kaby Lake Core M3-7Y30 Dual Core 1.61GHz processor alongside its 128GB SSD hard drive (most budget tablet-PCs only offer a slower HDD). I tested the device with GeekBench’s OpenCL test and got the score below. OpenCL Performance Score 9630 Sobel 12448 548.4 Mpixels/sec Histogram Equalization 10914 341.0 Mpixels/sec SFFT 2292 5.72 Gflops Gaussian Blur 13974 244.8 Mpixels/sec Face Detection 5536 1.62 Msubwindows/sec RAW 35730 345.9 Mpixels/sec Depth of Field 14188 41.2 Mpixels/sec Particle Physics 6059 957.9 FPS I thought this was quite a commendable score to be honest, for a device in the US$400+ range. Gaming performance seemed rather okay-ish with the Intel Graphics 615 processor, I wouldn’t recommend it for gaming to be honest, because I mainly see it as a work computer from every angle. Nevertheless, I ran the 3DMark benchmarks and you can see the results here. I found that the Cube Mix Plus does slightly overheat during daily usage, but it doesn’t really affect the battery life drastically so if that’s a concern of yours, then don’t worry too much about it. Add-Ons The tablet-PC allows you to attach an additional keyboard and use a stylus pen alongside it. I highly recommend getting these attachments. The keyboard gives you extra USB ports for easy thumbdrive docking and the keys feel very nice to type on too, greatly improving my keystroke speed with the tablet. The stylus attachment is definitely something you need with this WACOM screen, because using it with Windows Ink certainly makes writing on screen, whether you’re using handwriting input or just using it to jot notes down on your documents, way easier. This is invaluable for students in my opinion. Battery Life The battery life on the Cube Mix Plus is satisfactory at 7.4V / 4300mAh. It can last you around 6-7 hours depending on how you often you use it. The main source of power consumption on the Cube Mix Plus is really the WACOM screen, so if you shut off the screen and send it to sleep intermittently across the day, it should have no issues. Using it for student life when you only need to study or take notes is perfect, but if you’re an executive who needs to use it non-stop throughout the day, it’s wise to carry your power plug around with you. Verdict The Cube Mix Plus is a great tablet-PC well worth its US$379 price tag. It’s ideal for students require a WACOM-enabled tablet and that can couple as a PC thanks to its fast m3 processor. The only drawback of this ultra-fast tablet PC with a generous 128GB SSD is perhaps its battery life and slightly heavy frame.   computerCubecube magiccube mix plusiWorkLaptoppersonaltabletTablet PC Zayne Seah A tech geek going beyond specs.

Last fall, A.I. competitors Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, and Google banded together to form the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society, an industry-led attempt to get ahead of the many social, ethical, and economic issues presented by the advent of technology with increasingly human-like capabilities. Apple joined the group as another founding member earlier this year. On Tuesday, the Partnership on AI (PAI) announced nearly two dozen new members, including more of the tech industry’s biggest names—Intel, eBay, Salesforce, and SAP among them—and many of the world’s foremost A.I. research institutions, such as the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Also joining are nonprofits focused on digital privacy, human rights, and freedom. The full list of members is below. The organization also outlined its initial plan of action, organized around seven “thematic pillars” (several of which hew closely to the AI principles agreed on by a gathering of researchers at the Asilomar conference earlier this year). The PAI pillars include safety, transparency, human-A.I. collaboration, economic and workforce impacts, and social and societal impacts. After a recent board of directors retreat, the PAI plans: working groups to develop best practices by topic and sector; a fellowship for individuals at nonprofits and non-governmental organizations; an “AI, People, and Society” Best Paper Award; and a series of A.I. Grand Challenges aimed at “some of the most pressing long-term social and societal issues.” The PAI is finding its organizational footing, but still has some big pieces missing: an executive director, for one. While it was organized by the biggest names in technology and business, the PAI also aspires to be a “multi-stakeholder” organization and has welcomed into its fold the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy & Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Human Rights Watch. It will be interesting to watch the degree to which these groups and their representatives to the PAI have sway over the organization’s direction, and the policy positions and best practices it puts forth—particularly on issues that could conflict with the business interests of its for-profit member companies. PAI founding partners: Amazon, Apple, DeepMind, Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft Other for-profit partners: eBay, Intel, McKinsey & Company, Salesforce, SAP, Sony, Zalando, Cogitai Nonprofit partners: Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, ACLU, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AI Forum of New Zealand, Center for Democracy & Technology, Centre for Internet and Society—India, Data & Society Research Institute, Digital Asia Hub, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Future of Humanity Institute, Future of Privacy Forum, Human Rights Watch, Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, OpenAI, UNICEF, Upturn, the XPRIZE Foundation.

On Tuesday, the company confirmed that it has joined BMW, Intel and Mobileye as a development partner for the companies’ automated vehicle effort. In a statement, Delphi says it will act as the group’s systems integrator in creating an autonomous-driving system that can be used by a large number of OEMs, not just BMW. “From the very beginning we designed our cooperation on a non-exclusive platform for this technology of the future. With the onboarding of Delphi we significantly strengthen our development of the automated driving and do a future step in spreading this technology across the industry,” stated Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. Speaking about the partnership, president and chief executive of Delphi Kevin Clark said “This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience in automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation partners develop and deploy at scale. Our close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success.” News of Delphi’s combined effort with BMW, Intel and Mobileye perfectly shows that partnerships are the future of autonomous vehicle development. Waymo is working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and may soon join forces with Honda. VW and Audi have both teamed up with Nvidia, Chevrolet is working alongside Lyft, Volvo and Uber are collaborating and both Toyota and Bosch are developing self-driving technologies with Nvidia.

Along with chanting, some people held signs saying, "President Trump, we're with you" while others held signs that said "Fake President, Russian President" or "Impeach Trump." Among the many who made the trip to Williams Street, some were not there to take a side. They just wanted a glimpse of the president and the motorcade, but it did not pass by. The demonstrations began around 8 a.m., when the Unify and Resist Coalition gathered for a protest at the Soldiers and Sailors monument. Former FBI Director Mueller to Lead Trump-Russia Probe "I am very concerned that Mr. Trump is going to ruin our Constitution and really the simple fabric of our country, so it’s an opportunity to honor the grads today who have worked their whatevers off and say that they deserve a better leader," a woman from New London said. "I just think he needs to go away. He’s scary to me," a protester from Hampton said, adding that she is concerned about climate change and fears war. "I hope that humans survive his administration." Former FBI Director Mueller to Lead Trump-Russia Probe The protest included a march to McKinley Park. Trump supporters stood across from the protesters.  One supporter said Trump is the first person he ever voted for in a presidential race and if he had a nickel for every story about Trump that was supposed to end his administration, he would be rich.  It's a Record Year for Processing US Passport Applications Another supporter said she thinks Trump is for the people.  Before the presidential visit, representatives from the City of New London met with the Secret Service on security plans and New Haven police have dozens of officers on duty. House GOP Leader Suggested Putin Was Paying Trump: Report In all, police said more than 500 people showed up to demonstrate for or against the president and everyone behaved themselves. "Despite differences, everyone was able to voice their opinions and remain peaceful," police said in a news release. US Households Owe Record Amount, Topping Pre-Recession Peak The Raging Grannies, of Greater Westerly Rhode Island, participated in the protest. Their own supporters also attended the protest. "It’s not so much of a protest. If the president fails, we all fail," the husband of one member of the Raging Grannies said. He added that he supports health care, regulations on the environment and a transparent government.

(„GTI”), whereby it was granted various intellectual property rights related to the design, development and manufacturing of various scientifically-engineered fabric technologies and performance technologies, including a patented T3® design, Bact-Out®, CoolSkin®, WarmSkin®, Kottinu™, ColdSkin™, SteelSkin™, Satinu™, CamoSkin™, RecoverySkin™, SlimSkin™, AbsorbSkin™ and IceSkin™. The Company commenced operations using these technologies on March 9, 2017. The Company plans to provide performance fabric solutions in virtually every sector that has textile applications.

The Company believes that its future fabrics will be superior in performance relative to current market „standards” and will have a wide range of applications in multiple clothing and textile categories, including, but not limited to, sports apparel, medical, sleepwear, linens, undergarments, military, designer wear, protective, industrial and first responders. The Company’s business model is to co-develop fabric with manufacturers to obtain exclusive licenses of technology and purchase fabric technology to build on its portfolio. The Company plans to commercialize these inventions by selling bolts of fabric directly to retailers and wholesalers. The Company also plans to control the proprietary process of the technology for IP protection and does not intend to own any manufacturing facilities, which are intended to allow it to scale. The Company is in the market to acquire additional technologies from inventors looking for a commercialization partner.

HOW TO HIRE THE BEST There's One Big Idea That Will Make Your Company More Successful (Too Many CEOs Ignore It) It's great for a business's bottom line. By Quora Quora is a website where you can post any question and get real answers from people with firsthand experience. WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement How does a tech company benefit from a workforce that includes more women and minorities? originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. Answer by Rebekah Rombom, VP of Career Services & Business Development at Flatiron School, on Quora: Study after study shows us there is a business case for diversity - it's good for a business's bottom line. Deloitte found an 80% improvement in business performance when companies had high levels of diversity and inclusion. Intel found that if two companies are identical apart from their levels of diversity, the more diverse company will in all likelihood be more profitable. Research by Women 2.0 found that women-led companies achieve 35% higher returns on investment and venture-backed tech companies led by women bring in 12% higher revenue than ones owned by their male counterparts. Despite this body of research, a study by Lawless Research found that only 23% of the tech founders and executives surveyed believe that diversity actually improves financial performance. Bringing different experiences, cultural lenses, and biases to the process of running a business begets results that are more likely to represent your whole customer base. And good ideas often come from the collaboration of people with diverse perspectives bumping up against each other - engaging in a discourse, debate, and discussion; inspiring one another to consider refinements and iterations on their concepts, and challenging assumptions by drawing on different experiences and views. Diversity as we often discuss it - whether it comes from gender, ethnicity, age, geographical upbringing, degree of wealth, or type of education -- is a proxy for diversity of thought. Simply put, different people mean different perspectives, and different perspectives mean teams that can solve a wider range of problems -- and ultimately make better products. Consider Flatiron School alumna Victoria Friedman, a female English major and writer who now works as a developer at New York Magazine; or another female Flatiron graduate, a former assistant editor who now works as a front-end engineer at Vogue. Both of these women had experience and interests that are extraordinarily relevant to the software they now develop - experiences that wouldn't have come from standard software engineering education paths. How can a magazine company build a better CRM for editors? I'm willing to bet a former editor is more clued into the needs and wants of current editors than a more traditional CS-grad engineer -- because she herself has had those problems. By opening themselves up to candidates with a diversity of educational backgrounds, these companies found employees with unique value to add in their functions that the companies might not have found recruiting through traditional paths. Having a wide range of views and experiences represented on your team means you'll be in a better position to see -- and solve -- more and bigger problems. The bottom line: You can't effectively build products for the whole world if your organization only represents a small slice of it. This question originally appeared on Quora. -the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. More questions: Women in Technology: What are the most significant barriers facing women in the tech workplace today? Workforce: Are there any downsides to having a female-dominated workforce? Diversity: Where do many companies fall short between stated diversity objectives and actual outcomes?

He hasn't slowed down since Avery Hartmans Business Insider Wednesday 17 May 2017 15:14 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, is one of the most powerful figures in tech, with a net worth of roughly $82 billion. Today, his “Everything Store” sells more than $136 billion worth of goods a year. Here's how the former hedge funder got his start and became one of the world's richest people. ​Jeff Bezos' mom, Jackie, was a teenager when she had him in January 1964. She had recently married Cuban immigrant Mike Bezos, who adopted Jeff. Jeff didn't learn that Mike wasn't his real father until he was 10 but says he was more fazed about learning he needed to get glasses than he was about the news. ​ When Bezos was 4, his mother told his biological father, who previously had worked as a circus performer, to stay out of their lives. When Brad Stone interviewed Bezos'  father for Stone's book “The Everything Store,” Bezos' dad had no idea who his son had become. Bezos showed signs of brilliance from an early age. When he was a toddler, he took apart his crib with a screwdriver, because he wanted to sleep in a real bed.​ From ages 4 to 16, Bezos spent summers on his grandparents' ranch in Texas, doing things like repairing windmills and castrating bulls. His grandfather, Preston Gise, was a huge inspiration for Bezos and helped kindle his passion for intellectual pursuits. At a commencement address in 2010, Bezos said Gise taught him “it's harder to be kind than clever.” (Getty) Bezos fell in love with reruns of the original “Star Trek” and became a fan of later versions too. Early on, he considered naming Amazon MakeItSo.com in reference to a line from Captain Jean-Luc Picard. In school, Bezos told teachers “the future of mankind is not on this planet.” As a kid, he wanted to be a space entrepreneur. Now he owns a space-exploration company called Blue Origin. After spending a miserable summer working at McDonald's as a teen, Bezos, together with his girlfriend, started the Dream Institute, a 10-day summer camp for kids. They charged $600 a kid but managed to sign up six students. The “Lord of the Rings” series made the required reading list. Bezos eventually went to college at Princeton and majored in computer science. Upon graduation, he turned down job offers from Intel and Bell Labs to join a startup called Fitel. After he quit Fitel, Bezos almost launched with Halsey Minor — who would later found CNET — a startup that would deliver news by fax. Instead, he got a job at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He became a senior vice president after only four years. Meanwhile, Bezos took ballroom dancing classes as part of a scheme to increase his “women flow.” Just as Wall Streeters have a process for increasing their “deal flow,” Bezos thought analytically about meeting women. He married MacKenzie Tuttle, a D.E. Shaw research associate, in 1993. She's now a novelist. In 1994, Bezos read that the web had grown 2,300% in one year. This number astounded him, and he decided he needed to find some way to take advantage of its rapid growth. He made a list of 20 possible products to sell online and decided books were the best option. Bezos decided to leave D.E. Shaw even though he had a great job.​ “When you are in the thick of things, you can get confused by small stuff,” he said later. “I knew when I was 80 that I would never, for example, think about why I walked away from my 1994 Wall Street bonus right in the middle of the year at the worst possible time. That kind of thing just isn't something you worry about when you're 80 years old. At the same time, I knew that I might sincerely regret not having participated in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a revolutionizing event. When I thought about it that way…it was incredibly easy to make the decision.” His boss at the firm, David E. Shaw, tried to persuade Bezos to stay. But Bezos was already determined to start his own company. He felt he'd rather try and fail at a startup than never try at all. And so Amazon was born. MacKenzie and Jeff flew to Texas to borrow a car from his father, and then they drove to Seattle. Bezos was making revenue projections in the passenger seat the whole way, though the couple did stop to watch the sunrise at the Grand Canyon. Bezos started Amazon.com in a garage with a potbelly stove. He held most of his meetings at the neighborhood Barnes & Noble.​ In the early days, a bell would ring in the office every time someone made a purchase, and everyone would gather around to see whether anyone knew the customer. It took only a few weeks before it was ringing so often they had to make it stop. In the first month of its launch, Amazon sold books to people in all 50 states and in 45 different countries. And it continued to grow. Amazon went public on May 15, 1997. (Getty) When the dot-com crash came, analysts called the company “Amazon.bomb.” But it weathered the storm and ended up being one of the few startups that wasn't wiped out by the dot-com bust. Amazon shares have continued to go up since the crash (until the recent market correction). It has now gone beyond selling books to offering almost everything you can imagine, including appliances, clothing and even cloud computing services. Jeff Bezos was a demanding boss and could explode at employees. Rumor has it he hired a leadership coach to help him tone it down. Here are some of the strategies Bezos used in building his Amazon empire.  Bezos is known for banning PowerPoint presentations at Amazon. Instead he requires his staff to turn in six-page papers on their proposals to encourage critical thinking over simplistic bullet points.​ Bezos is also known for creating a frugal company culture that doesn't offer perks like free food or massages.​ In 1998, Bezos became an early investor in Google. He invested $250,000, which was worth about 3.3 million shares when the company went public in 2004. Those would be worth about $2.2 billion today. (Bezos hasn't said whether he kept any of his stock after the initial public offering.) What does Bezos do with all his money? In 2012, he donated $2.5 million to defend gay marriage in Washington. Bezos has also donated $42 million and part of his land in Texas to the construction of The Clock Of The Long Now, an underground timepiece designed to work for 10,000 years.​ In August 2013, Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million. His space company Blue Origin made history last year when it became one of the first commercial companies to successfully launch a reusable rocket. Bezos' interest in flying has gotten him into trouble in the past. In 2003, Bezos almost died in a helicopter crash in the Texas boondocks while scouting a site for a test-launch facility for Blue Origin. ​But in early 2016, he flew his personal jet to Germany to pick up and bring home the Washington Post reporter who had been detained by Iran. (AP) Bezos is said to own a 5.35-acre estate on Seattle's Lake Washington that includes 200 yards of shoreline. ​He also bought a seven-bedroom, $24.5 million mansion in Beverly Hills in 2007. There's a greenhouse, tennis court, pool, and guest house on the property, and it neighbors Tom Cruise's estate. In January 2017, Bezos bought the Textile Museum, a pair of mansions in Washington, D.C.'s Kalorama neighborhood. The property sold for $23 million and is the largest in Washington. Bezos also owns three linked apartments totaling 10,000 square feet in New York City's Century Tower.​ Exactly 20 years after going public, Amazon has a market cap of $457 billion. Barclays predicted Amazon could be the first trillion-dollar company. In March, Bezos became the world's second-richest person, right behind Bill Gates. With a net worth of more than $81 billion, Bezos is closing in on the No. 1 position. But don't expect Bezos to stop experimenting with new ideas anytime soon. In an interview with Business Insider, Bezos said: “What really matters is, companies that don't continue to experiment, companies that don't embrace failure, they eventually get in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is a Hail Mary bet at the very end of their corporate existence.” • Here's what will happen in the event of Queen Elizabeth's death • Japan's sex problem could cause the population to fall by 40 million by 2065 • Japan's mouthwatering school lunch programme is a model for the rest of the world Read the original article on Business Insider UK. © 2016.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pivotal Role of Inventory Optimization in Supply Chain Transformation Leads the Discussion at Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference Roundtable ATLANTA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Logility, Inc., a leading provider of collaborative supply chain optimization and advanced retail planning solutions, invites attendees of the 2017 Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference to register for the roundtable, Driving Supply Chain Transformation and Optimizing Inventory Investments. The conference, located at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge Resort & Spa in Phoenix, Ariz., will be held May 23 – 25, 2017. One of the key challenges for supply chain organizations is the ability to balance inventory investments with service level goals. These two powerful levers can have a significant impact on both a company’s topline growth and bottom line profitability. Multi-echelon inventory optimization (MEIO) helps ensure the right levels of stock are at the right places to create the optimal balance between inventory cost and service level. This interactive roundtable will pull from nearly two decades of experience with companies such as HP, Intel Corporation and Moen to highlight how MEIO can free up millions of dollars trapped in working capital.
