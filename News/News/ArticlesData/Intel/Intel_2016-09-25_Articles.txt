At the time of the announcement, Intel CEO Bryan Krzanich said, “Intel’s growth strategy is to expand our core assets into profitable, complementary market segments. With this acquisition, we will harness the power of Moore’s Law to make the next generation of solutions not just better, but able to do more.” That’s a nebulous way of saying Intel had plans to leverage Altera technology to boost its own profits, which is typically the point of acquisitions such as this. How Altera’s technology would be used, however, wasn’t fully explained at the time, but it is becoming more clear by the day. Intel has already disclosed that it has plans to integrate FPGAs into Xeon processors, which will leverage Altera technology. Those processors are due to arrive later this year and they should allow Intel to market more specialized, configurable hardware for accelerating a multitude of different workloads. FPGAs feature an array of logic gates that can be programmed to perform a myriad of tasks, and they can be optimized and re-programmed on the fly, as new workloads emerge or compute demands and algorithms change. The flexibility inherent to FPGAs is also at the core of Microsoft’s Project Catapult, which is a code-name for the technology behind Microsoft’s hyperscale acceleration fabric. Microsoft explains that Project Catapult “is at the center of a comprehensive set of investments Microsoft is making to build a supercomputing substrate that can accelerate our efforts in networking, security, cloud services and artificial intelligence.” Efficiently accelerating all of those different workloads is not something easily done with an ASIC – there isn’t some one-size-fits all chip out there to address the specific needs of each use case and data set. An FPGA, however, can be programmed to accelerate the algorithms associated with the specialized workloads and data sets of each specific application.  Altera Stratix V5 FPGA On A Project Catapult Accelerator Board For the past few years, Project Catapult has been evolving within Microsoft. At first, FPGAs were used to accelerate Bing’s Indexserve engine. A number of servers – over 1600 – were initially outfitted with FPGAs that were connected via a secondary network. The FPGAs were programmed to accelerate specific search-related algorithms, and the end result was in improvement in latency and a 50% reduction in the number of servers required to process workloads. Subsequently, Microsoft decided to put Project Catapult into production. A v2 architecture that enabled configurable clouds was eventually laid out and last year Microsoft ramped-up to large-scale production in Bing and Azure. However, Microsoft now also plans to employ Project Catapult FPGA accelerator boards in “nearly every new production server” and use the technology for virtually all of its services. In the future, these services could also encompass forward-looking AI-assisted, contextually aware computing and search models, similar to what was detailed in a recent Microsoft patent filing.   We’re speculating a bit, but with Intel putting FPGAs on Xeon processors, it should be able to reduce latency even further, since off-chip communications will be minimized due to the coherently attached in-socket FPGA adjacent to the central host processor. Density should be increased as well, and there may be power and efficiency benefits too. Should Microsoft’s Configurable Cloud architecture be adopted by others, and Intel’s future Xeons address the needs of Project Catapult, it could mean very good things for Intel in the lucrative, high-margin enterprise server platform space.

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Cloud How DreamHost Builds Its Cloud: Selecting Microprocessors September 26, 2016 Written by Luke Odom This is post No. 2 in a series of posts about how DreamHost builds its Cloud products. Written by Luke Odom straight from data center operations.  In this post, we are going to be looking at what processor we are using in the new DreamCompute cluster, and how we picked it! A processor is one of the most crucial components of a machine. The processor, also known as the CPU, is the metaphorical brain of the computer. It does all the “thinking” for the computer. A CPU can have one or more cores. A core is the part of the processor that does the actual computing. The first thing to consider is the instruction set. This is the language that the processor speaks. The popular instruction sets for use in servers are Sparc, ARM, and x86-64. Processors using the Sparc instruction set are made by Oracle. While Linux can run on them, the processors are designed to run Solaris, an operating system that is also made by Oracle. ARM is an instruction set that has been around for 30 years and had primarily been used in embedded devices. Cell phones, TVs, and tablets are some of the many places you will find ARM processors. Recently, we’ve been testing some servers with ARM processors. The advantage of these servers is they use very little power and have many low-power cores, which is useful in environments where you have many processes running at the same time. The most common instruction set you will find in a data center is x86-64. This is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set that has been in use since 1978. Almost all consumer laptop, desktop, and enterprise servers are made using processors based on x86-64. Because of this, we decided to use a processor based on x86-64. Source: Flickr The server x86-64 processor manufacturers are AMD and Intel. AMD, which we used in our beta cluster, last released a major x86-64 server processor in 2012. Since that release, AMD has been working on Zen, a new architecture. Unfortunately, Zen has not yet been released. Because of this, the AMD processors currently for sale are much higher wattage and slower than others on the market. In the time since the last major AMD update, Intel has released three new generations of chips, each faster and more power efficient. This makes Intel the best choice right now, so we decided to use them. Every year or so, Intel releases a new “generation” of processors. With each generation, Intel does one of two things. They either change the transistor size, making the processor smaller and more power efficient, or they keep the transistor size the same and focus on adding features. Within the server line of processors, there are four generations currently being produced. Ivy Bridge, which was released in 2012, is a upgrade of the older Sandy Bridge processors with smaller transistors and is denoted with a v2 at the end of the processor name for most server processors. Haswell, released in 2013, is a refinement of Ivy Bridge and uses the same transistor size. For servers, it is denoted as v3. Broadwell, released in 2014, was a refinement of the Haswell processor with smaller transistors and is denoted with a v4. Finally, SkyLake, released last year, is a refinement of Broadwell at the same transistor size and is denoted with a v5. Individual product lines within the server category are upgraded at different times. Even though a generation has been released, it may be years before a certain product line begins using that generation, and certain product lines may skip over entire generations. The five current product lines within the server category are Atom, Xeon D, Xeon E3, Xeon E5, and Xeon E7. The Atom line is an ultra-low power line. These aren’t really powerful enough to use in our hypervisors, and the low number of cores would significantly limit the size of virtual machine we could offer. The next line is Xeon D. These are higher wattage and faster than the Atom processors, but still not quite the power we wanted to be able to give our customers. The next line is the E3. The E3 line is the only server based line that has been upgraded to SkyLake. It has plenty of power, but you are limited to a single processor per system and four cores per processor. The E3 line lacks the density that would make it usable. At the time we were designing the new DreamCompute cluster, the E5 was Haswell-based but we knew Broadwell was coming soon. As we can only use what is currently being produced, we only looked at the Haswell line. The E5 line is marketed to data centers. Within the E5 line, you have both single, dual, and quad processor options with many choices within each of those. The E5 line just might work! The E7 line is last line we looked at. The E7 line was, at the time, Ivy Bridge-based, though we knew Haswell was coming soon. The E7 line is focused on density. E7s have both quad and octo processor options with up to 18 cores per processor. They are primarily used in environments where you need a single computer to be able to do a lot of work. That made E7s a possible, but not ideal, fit for DreamCompute as we probably don’t want that much density. Now that we knew what processor lines would work, we needed to consider two more factors. We needed to figure how many processors we wanted in each system and how many cores each processor should have. Originally, processors had a single core, but modern x86-64 processors can have up to 22 cores on a single processor. This is especially useful in a shared resource environment (like DreamCompute) where you don’t want the processes of one user to affect everyone else on that hypervisor. Intel also has a technology called “hyperthreading,” where it presents each core to the operating system twice to allow for more efficient use of each core. You can also put multiple processors in each server. You can have up to eight 18-core processors in a system for a total of 144 cores or 288 threads. Though, as we know from our previous cluster, density isn’t everything. We wanted to be able to balance power and density, and limit the single points of failure. Based on the RAM-to-core ratio we wanted and the maximum density we were willing to have, we decided to test dual and quad processor systems with eight to 14 cores in each system. We tested both the E5 dual and quad processor lines as well as the E7 quad processor line. To pick the processor we wanted to use, we needed to take into consideration a few other factors. But… more on that in another post coming soon!

The fingerprint scanning technology is implemented in Lenovo’s latest Yoga 910 laptop, which is one of those consumer 2-in-1 convertible gizmos with a fold-back screen that lets it be used like a laptop. It relies on some hardware security features implemented in Intel’s 7th-gen Core processors, but also uses biometric fingerprint sensor technology from Synaptics and payment processing from PayPal to deliver a FIDO-compliant solution. The goal, according to Lenovo, is to help reduce online fraud and increase security, while making authentication “nearly frictionless" with biometrics secured by hardware-level protection replacing those so-easily stolen passwords. In actual fact, Intel, Lenovo, PayPal and Synaptics are all members of the FIDO Alliance, the industry body setup several years ago to address the lack of interoperability among authentication devices. While this has enjoyed some take up in the mobile world, the Yoga 910 brings FIDO authentication to PC users for the first time, according to Lenovo. As well as offering greater security than passwords, the technology is also intended to be more convenient. Once the user has registered with a FIDO-compliant website, they no longer need to enter a password to be authenticated, but simply swipe their finger over the built-in sensor and are instantly logged in. And according to the FIDO Alliance, this is just the start of the FIDO effort to bring password-free authentication to PC users, although it remains to be seen whether the standard has any teeth (geddit?) “The W3C is working to make FIDO web APIs a formal web standard, which will bring FIDO authentication to web browsers across all platforms, said a statement on the organization’s website. In addition, Microsoft is said to have made a “strong commitment” to implementing FIDO compatibility with Windows Hello, the biometric security features in Windows 10, and Google has already FIDO-enabled its Chrome browser with support for second factor authentication via its Security Key program. Lenovo’s Yoga 910 was announced at the end of August, and is due for availability in October. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 26 Comments More from The Register Peccant pwners post 670,000 Pokémon punter MD5 passwords Peek-a-boo to fans of Pikachu 23 Comments Stolen passwords integrated into the ultimate dictionary attack Humans still the weakest link Epic Games forums breached, salted passwords nabbed Unreal Engine chathaus had unbelievably bad security 12 Comments Microsoft bans common passwords that appear in breach lists Azure Active Directory no longer allows the likes of 'M!cr0$0ft' to gain entry 35 Comments Dropbox: Leaked DB of 68 million account passwords is real Login details are strongly hashed and date back to 2012 28 Comments 98.1 million CLEARTEXT passwords pasted as Rambler.ru rumbled 'Яussian Yahoo!' may just have become world's biggest breach 28 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Judging by the promo video from Intel, the building will also be a horrible nag that micromanages employees’ sleep, work commute, exercise, and even what they have for lunch. It’s a bureaucrat’s dream and a regular human’s nightmare. In classic dystopian surveillance fashion, Intel's future ultra-smart building begins with face recognition. No need for ID badges when the walls know who and where you are at all times. Thousands of sensors scattered throughout the facility will "fit your needs, optimize your day, and ultimately help you live your best life." If you're often tardy for work, the building will nudge you toward carpooling with more punctual coworkers. And at lunchtime, it will let you know when the cafeteria is busiest — because all your colleagues are closely tracked too — and recommend / force you to eat something healthier. Should you find yourself lacking motivation to exercise, the building will also politely remind you to take the stairs now and again. Actually, when you think about it, this isn't too far from the experience of wearing a present-day smartwatch. The only difference with Intel's new Israel campus will be that it's integrated into your surroundings. And probably has a crimson-red all-seeing eye somewhere observing your every step. Update: Since publication of this article, Intel has pulled the amusingly dystopian video of its future office building from both Facebook and YouTube.

Intel Core i7 6800K Benchmarks On Ubuntu + Linux 4.8 Written by Michael Larabel in Processors on 26 September 2016. Page 1 of 6. 18 Comments While the Core i7 6800K has been available for a few months now, there hadn't been any review on it since Intel hadn't sent out any Broadwell-E samples for Linux testing this time around. However, I did end up finally buying a Core i7 6800K now that the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support is finally coming together (at first, Intel PR said it wouldn't even be supported on Linux) so that I can run some benchmarks there plus some other interesting items on the horizon for benchmarking. Here are some benchmarks of the i7-6800K from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Linux 4.8 kernel. The Core i7-6800K is a six-core CPU plus has Hyper Threading to provide 12 logical cores. The i7-6800K has a 3.4GHz base frequency, 3.6GHz turbo frequency, and with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 can hit up to 3.8GHz for a core. The TDP on this higher-end CPU is 140 Watts and supports DDR4-2400/2133MHz memory and is suited for LGA-2011 v3 X99 motherboards. I picked up the Core i7 6800K last week for $430 USD. It's well supported under Linux but with the main limitation being no support for Turbo Boost Max 3.0. Those patches have yet to be merged to the mainline kernel nor is it clear as of writing if that support will be merged for Linux 4.9. Thus for the testing today off the Linux 4.8 kernel it's without the TBM 3.0 support, but in a follow-up article I will be testing this out-of-tree code. I'll also run some other i7-6800K follow-up Linux tests; if any Phoronix Premium readers have any particular test requests, please let me know. For the Core i7 6800K Linux benchmarking I was using the recently-reviewed MSI X99A Workstation motherboard, which I would recommend for Linux/BSD users looking to utilize new v4 Broadwell processors and are looking for a nice motherboard. From this MSI X99 system with 4 x 4GB of RAM, GeForce GTX TITAN X, and OCZ Trion 150 SSD storage was a comparison to the Core i7 5960X, Xeon E5-2609 v4, and Xeon E5-2687W v3 CPUs as my other available LGA-2011 v3 processors. I also tested an AMD FX-8370 for some comparison on the red side. Given the i7-5960X tops out at DDR4-2133, I tested the i7-6800K when running at the common DDR4-2133 speed as well as DDR4-2400MHz using the supported G.SKILL memory. DDR4-2400 is the highest stock rated frequency for this Broadwell-E CPU. All tests for this initial i7-6800K Linux benchmarking was carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the Phoronix Test Suite software. Following these initial LGA-2011 v3 and AMD FX results are the CPU thermal and power consumption data.

By Ian Allison September 26, 2016 15:56 BST R3 CEV logoR3 CEV Financial innovation company R3, Intel and eight R3 consortium member banks have successfully tested a distributed ledger prototype for bond transactions using Intel technology. The trial used US treasury bonds to demonstrate how distributed ledger technology can support trading in real-world financial markets, delivering the necessary scalability and supporting throughput of more than 100,000 transactions per day, said a statement. R3 and its consortium members built and used an implementation of Sawtooth Lake, Intel's proprietary distributed ledger platform, along with Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), a technology that enables developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. The trial was carried out in R3's lab environment, the R3 Lab and Research Centre, which has quickly become a centre of gravity for collaborative research andtesting of distributed and shared-ledger inspired technologies. R3, Intel and each of the banks used physical, non-cloud-based nodes hosted globally across the US, Canada, Asia, Australia and Europe to interact and simulate US treasurytrading on the ledger. The platform featured advanced smart contract functionality, enabling trading, matching and settlement of US treasury bonds on-chain, as well as automated coupon payments and redemption based on network time and third-party data sources. Additional features included an on-chain identity registry to facilitate the permissioning of validators and transactors, and the association of those roles to different organisations. Jerry Bautista, VP of the New Business Group at Intel, said: "We believe collaborative exploration of blockchain usages is key to the development of this emerging technology. We are excited to show how Intel technologies such as Software Guard Extensions can improve the security and scalability of blockchain deployments." Tim Grant, CEO of R3's Lab and Research Centre, said: "Our goal at R3 is to bring our members together with the strongest technology players and work collaboratively to evaluate and accelerate this groundbreaking technology to production using real-world use cases. We are delighted to build on our strong relationship with Intel to demonstrate how distributed and shared ledgers can deliver material efficiencies throughout the full trading lifecycle of an asset." R3 consortium members involved in this project included CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. Intel will be donating the bond-related transaction families (software code written to simulate the behaviour of bonds on an exchange) developed for this project to the Hyperledger Project. It will be running live demos of the platform at the Hyperledger booth (C90) at Sibos this week. R3 and Intel are premier members of the Hyperledger effort, and State Street is a general member.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor AMD’s Zen Processor Might Power Next-Generation Apple MacBook Pro – Custom SOC Design With HBM2 Memory System By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 months ago 95Shares Share Tweet Submit The next generation of Apple MacBook Pro products are rumored to feature an AMD chip inside them. Bits and Chips reports that due to tech stagnation in regards to Intel’s mobility processors, Apple might jump ship over to camp AMD and use their latest Zen based processors to power off the MacBook Pro lineup. Next-Generation Apple MacBook Pro Might Feature a Custom AMD Zen Chip For a long time, Apple MacBook Pro series has been featuring a mix of U and H series processors. Usually, both tiers get their graphics updated with performance enhancements around the same time but with Kaby Lake, the high-performance models might be looking elsewhere for that extra horsepower. The latest Intel mobility processor roadmap shows that after Skylake, Intel would be shifting to a new CPU family known as Kaby Lake. This family will be available in several variants. However, MacBook Pro’s have relied on faster graphics performance and that doesn’t seem to be the case in the upcoming generation of Intel processors. Intel’s 14nm Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake CPU roadmap leaks out. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) The U-series models in this family are going to be available in Q1 2017 with GT3e graphics. The faster H-series processors will rely on a slower GT2 graphics chip. This problem is with GT2 parts as Apple has a major focus on graphics performance from Integrated GPUs. While 13″ models of the MacBook Pro can utilize the U-series chips, the high-performance aimed, 15″ models will not be a major graphics update if Apple decides to go with new Kaby Lake or even the Coffee Lake parts available in mid 2018. The only high-performance variant that Intel has in their H-series line is based on Skylake and has GT4e graphics. This model is fast but comes at a high cost. The GT3e graphics chips are only offered in sub-45W variants with either Kaby Lake or Coffee Lake chips. It’s possible that Intel could offer enough GPU updates with Kaby Lake that it somewhat matches the GT3e tier level performance but there’s another solution. Advertisement AMD’s Custom Zen Based SOC Could Be A Potential Candidate For Apple MacBook Pro AMD is known to offer custom chips based on their latest Zen architecture in 2018. Apple could go that route if Intel is unable to meet their requirements in the graphics department. AMD can exploit this situation and round up a custom Zen based SOC featuring their latest GCN cores and a couple of HBM (cache/system subsystem) for Apple. Recently leaked details show AMD’s next generation APU solutions with power as low as 10W and base models with 35-45W TDP. That matches Intel’s H-series processors in terms of power consumption and added graphics performance from the GCN cores sounds like a potential candidate for the latest MacBook Pro models. Such a custom chip could be a big win for AMD’s custom-SOC division. By 2018, such a chip would be very feasible to produce in terms of cost and volume as FinFET process would have matured enough and HBM2 yields would be ideal to supply to mass market. Of course, we aren’t setting this in stone as if Apple is indeed going to feature a AMD chip inside their next gen laptop solution. But the possibility of it happening is high given the latest Intel roadmap leak. Intel is known for changing roadmaps from time to time so we might just see them slipping in a GT3 graphics chip under the H-series lineup.

Minyanville SP 500 Weekly Earnings Update: Bullish for Next 2 Quarters, Election Notwithstanding By Scutify Sep 26, 2016 7:59 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Let's take a quick look at revisions within the SP 500. fc-eps-estimate-revisions Hopefully this spreadsheet, which has been updated weekly for years, is helpful to readers. Note how just within the last week, 412 of the SP 500 companies have seen their estimates changed/tweaked/adjusted by Street analyst's. The fact that over 80% of the SP 500 saw estimate revisions this past week was surprising, but the takeaway for readers is that Street consensus is CONSTANTLY changing to reflect competitor disclosure, economic data change, and a host of other variables. (Intel's raised guidance could have something to do with this - note with the week of June '14, what Intel's raised guidance did to the percentages). Conclusion: what's unusual about the last 4 weeks data is that normally - within a quiet period of earnings reporting since 499 of the SP 500 have reported their Q2 '16 results - the negative revisions far outweigh the positive revisions, except for this Q3 '16, where the last 4 weeks, positive revisions have improved steadily. Look at the above spreadsheet again and note how positive revisions as a percentage keep ticking higher. This is an important trend change and it's been in evidence for a while (and bears repeating), and speaks to what was written prior to this weekend's posthere and here. So Why the Optimism For the Next 6 Months ? The SP 500 is lapping easier comp's from late 2015: the yuan devaluation in August, 2015, led to a 2-month, sharp correction in August, September, 2015, which then led to a sharp rally starting in early October '15 lasting until late November '15, and then the SP 500 saw a 12% decline from late November '15 through mid-February '16. Commodity returns were at the bottom of the asset-class return table for the last 4 years culminating in the sharp drop in crude and commodity prices in late 2015 (crude oil, gold, silver, copper, grain prices, etc.) which then led to spread-widening in the high yield bond market, which in my opinion is what caused the decline in the SP 500 last December '15 through mid-February '16. The Energy and Basic Material's sector's high yield debt outstanding is far greater as a percentage of the high yield bond market than the stocks are as a percentage of the SP 500. While Energy and Basic Mat stocks comprise roughly 8% - 9% of the SP 500 by market cap, I suspect that the debt outstanding is probably closer to 15% - 20% of the total junk bond market. The point is that even if commodity prices remain stable, there should be year-over-year growth in the next 6 months, for commodities that fell even further after the China devaluation. JP Morgan's Dr. David Kelly made an interesting point this week on one of JP Morgan's occasional economic calls, where David and his team talk about econ data and it's implications for the market. Dr. Kelly noted that inflation could be influenced by the year-over-year change in crude oil in Q1 '16 since crude will be lapping the $28 print it saw in Q1 '15. Basically for the Energy sector, net income was completely wiped out in Q1 '16 given the drop in crude oil in late Q4 '15 and early '16. The typical weak period in terms of SP 500 returns that is typically seen from August 1 through early October every year, never materialized. Per Bespoke, "this is the first year since 2010 where average prices have traded up between Labor Day and 9/22." The cumulative advance / decline (A/D) line made a new bull market high per Bespoke. Here is a chart from Josh Brown's The Reformed Broker as of mid-August '16, highlighting same. Market breadth has been consistently positive through the bull market, thus hitting an all-time high this week is a positive. Where is the Risk ? The election and the possible ascension of Mr. Trump is the Rumsfeld-ian, "Known Unknown". However, In Bespoke's Weekly Report that comes out every Friday afternoon and remains a wonderful source of great information on the broad asset classes that comprise the investable market, Bespoke notes that "the betting markets are still heavily favoring Clinton by 2 - 1 margin." Bespoke also noted that Clinton's lead over Trump today is almost identical to Obama's lead over Romney at this time in 2012. Monday night's first debate could be a pivotal event. (Please, the above is not a political statement in the least. As an advisor, my job is to assess portfolio risk and market risk for clients, and to try and discern if the US capital markets are more comfortable with one candidate over the other.) Jeff Miller's weekly "Weighing the Week Ahead" gives some excellent thoughts on the election cycle. It will be interesting to see how polling results change (if they change at all on Tuesday and next week) and how the market responds, if it does at all. --------------------------- Thomson Reuters SP 500 earnings Data (by the numbers): 499 of the SP 500 have reported their Q2 '16 results Forward 4-quarter estimate: $125.13 versus last week's $125.54 P.E ratio: 17.3(x) PEG ratio: 8.5(x) SP 500 earnings yield: 5.78% down from last week's 5.87% Year-over-year change in forward 4-quarter estimate: +2.03% vs last week's +2.08%. Conclusion: Sentiment data - at least AAII (American Association of Individual Investor) data - continues to indicate a lack of real optimism and even downright pessimism towards expected, future, stock returns, which in and of itself, should be good reason to be long or overweight the SP 500 within balanced portfolios. Per AAII directly, bullish sentiment has been below it's historical long-term average of 38.5% for 79 of 81 weeks. I'm expecting the next 6 months - from October through early April '17 to be pretty decent for the SP 500. Technology should be the clear sector winner although it is now overbought. For readers, be prepared - risk comes on quickly. This article was written by Brian Gilmartin for Trinity Asset Management on Sep 25, 2016.

Home Technology Health Environment Design People Social Awareness Breaking News Contact Us About Us NoCamels Israeli Innovation News Aiming High: Intel Israel Creates ‘World’s Smartest Office Building’ Design News ,Technology News Einat Paz-Frankel, NoCamels | Sep, 26 2016 Intel Israel broke ground yesterday on what it claims will be the world’s smartest building. Being constructed in Petach Tikva, Israel, this 34,000-square-meter research and development center will join half a dozen Intel locations in Israel, including two manufacturing facilities. Thousands of smart sensors scattered around the building will use cutting-edge information technologies to gather relevant data and provide what employees need in order to do their work. “The smart building will make the work environment work for you,” says Kobi Bor, Intel Israel’s smart campus project manager. According to Intel, this energy-saving building, which will be home to some 2,500 employees, will recognize employees’ faces, so they won’t need a badge; turn the lights on and off; offer carpools to employees based on estimated arrival times to the office; and even direct employees to vacant parking spots. SEE ALSO: Report: Apple Israel Could Be Behind Company’s Smart Home Breakthrough If you’re having a meeting, the smart building will turn on the lights for you, set the temperature, the computer and the projector, and even upload the relevant files for you. It can help you navigate the campus, and even tell you when you can squeeze a haircut into your schedule! SEE ALSO: Why The World’s Largest Tech Companies All Want A Piece Of The Israeli Pie Hungry? The smart building will tell you how long the line is at the cafeteria and, if it’s packed, will provide more convenient lunch times. It can even tell you the nutritional value of the dishes served and what the most popular dish of the day is. Intel stresses that its smart building will only learn the habits of employees who choose to share their information, and will adjust its recommendations accordingly. The employees who choose to opt in will enjoy a unique mobile app that will cater to their needs, including ordering the cup of coffee they like in the morning. The new building, which is expected to be completed in 2019, will be LEED-certified (a green building certification), with emphasis on energy conservation and water recycling. “Building this new campus highlights the importance of our presence in Israel, and reflects our values of innovation, technology and green building,” Intel Israel CEO Maxine Fassberg said in a statement. Her statement comes on the heels of a reorganization that led to the furlough of hundreds of Intel Israel employees, and thousands in other Intel locations around the world. 10,000 employees in the Holy Land  With roughly 10,000 employees in Israel, Intel is the largest multinational high-tech company in the country. It has four development centers in Haifa, Yakum, Petach Tikva and Jerusalem, as well as manufacturing facilities in Kiryat Gat and Jerusalem. Recent statistics show that Intel exports account for roughly 9 percent of the total goods exported from Israel. Intel picked Israel for its first R&D center outside the US 40 years ago. Since the chipmaker set up shop in Israel, it has developed a series of breakthrough computer processors and has evolved beyond hardware. Photos and video: Courtesy Facebook Comments

Judging by the promo video from Intel, the building will also be a horrible nag that micromanages employees’ sleep, work commute, exercise, and even what they have for lunch. It’s a bureaucrat’s dream and a regular human’s nightmare. In classic dystopian surveillance fashion, Intel's future ultra-smart building begins with face recognition. No need for ID badges when the walls know who and where you are at all times. Thousands of sensors scattered throughout the facility will "fit your needs, optimize your day, and ultimately help you live your best life." If you're often tardy for work, the building will nudge you toward carpooling with more punctual coworkers. And at lunchtime, it will let you know when the cafeteria is busiest — because all your colleagues are closely tracked too — and recommend / force you to eat something healthier. Should you find yourself lacking motivation to exercise, the building will also politely remind you to take the stairs now and again. Actually, when you think about it, this isn't too far from the experience of wearing a present-day smartwatch. The only difference with Intel's new Israel campus will be that it's integrated into your surroundings. And probably has a crimson-red all-seeing eye somewhere observing your every step. Update: Since publication of this article, Intel has pulled the amusingly dystopian video of its future office building from both Facebook and YouTube.

Initially rejected by EA, the publisher eventually relented and a gem was born in Mirror's Edge, albeit one that was too innovative and unique for most to appreciate. Since then, there's been a struggle regarding which direction a sequel should take, but the pieces eventually came together to form Mirror's Edge Catalyst, a semi-open world game with messenger missions and traditional cut scenes (as opposed to the animated ones seen in the previous title).     On the technical side, the game is pretty well optimized, as is always the case with DICE games. But whether you're on a low-end laptop or just looking to get things running butter smooth on your mid-range rig, this guide will help you get the best balance between image quality and performance.     Test Setup and System Requirements     Our Test System   OS: Windows 10 64-bit Processor: Intel Core i5 3570K 3.4GHz (Stock) Memory: Corsair XMS3 8GB DDR3-1600 (Stock) Storage: Crucial BX200 2.5'' 480GB 6GB/s SSD Video Card: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290X 4GB (Stock) Driver: Radeon Software Version 16.9.1 Resolution: 1920x1080 Input: Logitech G400 mouse, Hermes RGB mechanical keyboard     System Requirements   Minimum:   OS: Windows® 7 64-Bit Processor: Intel i3-3250 / AMD FX-6350 Memory: 6 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 650 Ti 2GB or better / AMD Radeon™ R9 270x or better Storage: 25 GB available space   Recommended:   OS: Windows® 10 64-Bit Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 at 3.4GHz / AMD FX-8350 at 4.0GHz Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 970 4GB or better / AMD Radeon™ R9 280x 3GB or better Storage: 25 GB available space Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find Mirror's Edge Catalyst for sale below.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Features A Powerful Processor, Is Apple Working on a Major Design Change for the Device? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 26, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» As the craze for the launch of the iPhone 7 appears to be dimming a bit, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is the new centre of attention. It’s a highly expected and anticipated device and speculation suggests that the Cupertino-based tech company may reveal the device this October. Some advocate that Apple will most-likely wait for the Intel Kaby Lake processors, making the MacBook Pro 2016 a must-have. The possible launch of the MacBook Pro 2016 has now boosted previous reports that the much-awaited refresh is coming about this fall. Compile that with some hype from Apple CEO Tim Cook; MacBook Pro fans indeed have a reason to get excited. It has been more than 479 days since the MacBook Pro has had a refresh, so it’s not difficult to understand the eager anticipation as folks hope that the wait is worth it. The preceding months saw various rumours tied up to the MacBook Pro 2016. Among them one such rumour spoke about the popular features that the next Apple notebook will offer. The list includes OLED touch strips, Type-C USB ports, Touch ID, and a fingerprint scanner. The 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air, run solely on integrated graphics bundled with Intel’s chips. The 15-inch MacBook Pro is available in two versions, a lower-end arrangement with only integrated graphics and the other, a higher-end configuration that adds an enhanced graphics chip for sophisticated performance. The 15-inch MacBook are furnished with both types of graphics, and can automatically switch between the two, judging whether better performance or better battery life is needed at the moment. Apple has generally used chips like Intel’s GT3 or GT3e for graphics performance, with the “e” suffix on the GT3e signifying embedded DRAM, on the chip,  improving performance. Compared to the GT3 tier, the GT3e delivers finer performance. If we consider Intel’s history, for chips outside Skylake, the 15-inch MacBook Pro faces a major problem. This is due to the fact that Intel has no plans for any quad-core chips with integrated graphics higher than the GT2 level. This essentially has about half the raw power of the GT3 tier, which will be a part of the next-generation Kaby Lake family of processors. As a result, the Skylake H-series chips, which is being currently offered on the 15-inch MacBook Pro – that we are also expecting to be updated next month – may remain as Intel’s lead offering for these types of high-performance mobile chips. Unless the new Coffee Lake chips are introduced in the second quarter of 2018! Even then the original Coffee Lake chips will comprise of only GT2-level graphics that may not be powerful enough for Apple’s requirements. Mobile & Apps, recently reported that Apple is planning on making the MacBook Pro 2016 thinner and lighter, plus it will also incorporate the innovative hinge design. There is also a possibility of more colour options. Apple seems very stern about removing the 3.5mm headphone jack from its future devices. Probably, as a way to show that the company has the guts to think ahead. Therefore, the MacBook Pro 2016, much like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, may also sport the Bluetooth AirPods. According to Apple Insider, MacBook Pro 2016’s physical function keys may be replaced as well by an OLED display touch bar having modifiable software keys, which will adapt to the functions and needs of various apps.

Israel's largest high-tech company Intel Israel is moving its 2,500 development personnel into a new building in Petah Tikva. This 34,000 square meter building will learn the habits of every employee who chooses to disclose personal information, customize his working environment, help save energy and continue learning and improving over time. Among other things, the building will know what coffee to make for each employee, when to send him to get a haircut and recommend where to park. Today, Intel laid the cornerstone of its Petah Tikva campus, which is one of company’s most advanced buildings worldwide and is a living demonstration of the various technologies it develops. Upon its completion, the personnel working in this building will be able to control their environment and adjust it to their needs using thousands of sensors and advanced processing capabilities. In addition, the new building will have integrated systems encouraging a healthy lifestyle, energy conservation and a green environment. RELATED ARTICLES "Intel's Israel team has done it again" Mobileye, Intel and BMW to build self-driving cars Intel to close Jerusalem production plant Intel Israel hands out layoff notifications "The new building will bring together employees currently working in 13 buildings, and will enhance cooperation between the different groups," said Maxine Fassberg, Intel Israel CEO and Intel Group vice president. "The construction of this campus emphasizes the importance of our presence in Israel and reflects our values: innovation, technology and green construction. We have found real partners in the Petah Tikva Municipality, who have helped us realize this vision." The new building will house Intel's 2,500 development personnel working in central Israel and will be based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology, also developed in Intel. Further advanced technological products developed in Intel Israel will be integrated into this building, which will be built on a 34,000 square meter plot in Petah Tikva's Kiryat Arye industrial zone, not far from Intel's current Petah Tikva campus. The building will have nine floors, as well as a 32,000 square meter underground parking. It will also contain 3,500 square meters of electronic labs, three restaurants, a café, a gym, a spa, a hairdresser, a beauty salon and a learning and convention center. This will be a green building, with a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum level certification, focusing on energy conservation and water recycling. The campus will be built as a 'learning building', which will constantly become more efficient, improving energy and water consumption, as well as the general operation of the building. As part of the focus on green construction, the R&D center will also contain covered parking for 120 bicycles, with adjacent showers. This building is highly accessible to public transportation, in line with Intel's green agenda, the first Israeli company which received the Ministry of Environmental Protection's sustainable building certification. By using a designated application, the employees who choose to do so will be able to use personalized services. For example, the application will offer employees living around the same area to carpool to work. An employee who comes to work with his car will be directed to the available parking which is closest to his meeting's location, in synchronization with his diary. The application will even learn the employee's coffee drinking habits and will thereby be able to offer him his favorite coffee and even order it in advance for the employee to pick from the lobby on the way to his office. One of the most noteworthy improvements offered by this building is the end to fights between employees over air conditioning. The building will study each employee's temperature preferences and, during a meeting, propose the temperature which is most accommodating for all participants. Lunches will also be based on studying employee behavior. First of all, the system will monitor the number of people eating and, if the dining room is busy, it will offer the employee to eat at another hour. In addition, the building could check, based on the employee's preferences, whether he will be interested in eating when his friends are also available. Moreover, the building will be capable of telling whether the employee's favorite dish is being served on a specific day and in which cafeteria. Every day, the screens will clearly show the employees' favorite dishes, and rating them will be possible. Employee time management and services offered by the building will not be limited to meals. Intel's new smart campus, like any other Intel campus, will have a gym, two restaurants, meat and dairy, a café in the lobby and, of course, an entire area devoted to campus services - spa, hairdresser, laundry services and more. An employee interested in a certain service could order it and receive a notification when the service is available. Moreover, the building will be able to learn the employee's habits - if he tends to get his hair cut every two months, it will send him an SMS when a haircut is due; if an employee works out in the gym, she will be able to receive recommendations for a menu suitable for her training regimen.

Here is our full review. Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Published:September 25, 2016 9:30 am Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga, arguably the lightest business 2-in-1 in the world, has finally made its way to India. The concept of the Ultrabook is about half a decade old. It started when Intel posted a reference design for manufacturers to follow. Ultrabooks had a big impact on the market by pushing for slimmer designs across price points and use cases. It also resulted in the convertibles segment, which is now called the 2-in-1s, or computing devices that can give users a better access to the screen by turning or tearing away. Intel as well as its manufacturing partners are still betting big on this segment to be a huge commercial success. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga was first announced at the CES in Las Vegas this year. The device, arguably the lightest business 2-in-1 in the world, has finally made its way to India. Though a part of the popular ThinkPad series, this device brings in the learnings from Lenovo’s popular Yoga series, especially the multiple forms it can take to facilitate presentation, work, creation and consumption. All thanks to a powerful hinge that holds the screen in place. Specs: 14-inch WQHD (2560 x 1440p) OLED touchscreen with 300 nits | 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-6200U processor with 4GB RAM | 126GB ROM | Windows 10 Pro 64-bit | USB x3, HDMI x 1 England 103/5 At Stumps On Day 2, Trailing India By 352 Runs Bigg Boss 10 November 17 Review: Swami Om Apologized From Mona Lisa Parliament Adjourned Amid Debate Over Demonetisation Issue Demonetisation: Select Petrol Pumps To Dispense Cash Up To Rs 2,000 Demonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate WorkersDemonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate Workers Miscreants Break Into SBI ATM In Odisha’s Nabarangpur District: Here’s What Happened Audience Reaction : John Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha Starrer Force 2 Gets A Thumbs Up Here’s What Supreme Court Said On Government’s Demonetisation Move Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Rules Out Roll Back Of Demonetisation Move West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Protest Against Demonetisation Government Issues Fresh Guidelines On Withdrawal Norms: All You Need To Know Mamata Banerjee Demand Roll-back Of Demonetisation Within Three Days If Mulayam Singh’s Trust Is With Ram Gopal, I Am Also With Him: Amar Singh SYL Row: Amrinder Singh Seeks President’s Rule In Punjab Uproar In Parliament Over Demonetisation Debate: Here’s What Happened Price: Rs 1,12,000 What is good? The X1 Yoga has a stunning screen, mostly because it is 2K and one of the brightest displays you will see at 300 nits. This is the hero of this device as you will always have the screen in front as you use the different forms the laptop can take, especially when it is in the tablet mode. You will have no issues with viewing angles of sunlight when using the X1 Yoga. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a stunning screen, mostly because it is 2K and one of the brightest displays you will see at 300 nits. While there is a good touchscreen, most of us still prefer to use the old fashioned keyboard for inputs. The X1 Yoga has one of the best backlit keyboards in town, well spaced out and with the right amount of travel. The slightly curved keys are almost welcoming your fingertips, while the top row offers a range of functional keys that make life very easy. It has a very good trackpad with separate left, right clickers that are unique to Lenovo devices. Plus, there is a trackpad for those who prefer that instead of a touchscreen or mouse. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga has one of the best backlit keyboards in town, well spaced out and with the right amount of travel. The review device I had was running a Intel Core i5 processor and the performance was pretty good. However, this device can pack much more powerful Core i7 vPro version with 4GB RAM. So performance will not be an issue in anyway. The i5 version was also not underwhelming in any way and stays cool which is a good thing. Where this device has an edge over most of the competition is in its form factor and weight. While most powerful business laptops are still heavy and bulky this is thin and light while bringing in the versatility of the full foldable screen. Don’t forget that you will be paying a premium for this. What is not that good? Despite the stunning screen, the audio is underwhelming to put it mildly. With the screen facing you in the presentation form or in tent mode the audio is a bit more audible, but otherwise you will need headphones or an external speaker to enjoy this. Verdict The Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga is a very powerful and versatile device. There is nothing really wrong with this 2-in-1 which ticks all the boxes. However, the price will ensure that this ends up as being an enterprise purchase for more people. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes BusinessDemonetisation: Execution could not have been better, says Arun Jaitley IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaPriyanka Gandhi to play 'major role' in UP Assembly polls: Congress EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

Consider Intel Corporation (INTC), a firm in the Semiconductor General industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat. This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, INTC has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations. Intel’s Earnings in Focus: A Recent Surprise for Investors Two quarters ago, INTC expected to post earnings of 49 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 54 cents per share, a beat of 10.2%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 53 cents per share, when it actually reported earnings of 59 cents per share instead, representing a 11.3% positive surprise. Intel Price and EPS Surprise Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation Quote Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Intel. 7 High-Dividend Stocks to Buy ASAP In fact, the Earnings ESP for INTC is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat. After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for INTC, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.82%, so another beat could be around the corner. This is particularly true when you consider that INTC has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that INTC could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.

News & Analysis Baidu Releases AI Benchmark Intel, Nvidia post results training neural nets Rick Merritt 9/26/2016 04:30 PM EDT 2 comments Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Calling for 100x faster processors, China Web giant Baidu released DeepBench, an open source benchmark for how fast processors train neural networks for machine learning. DeepBench is available online along with first results from Intel and Nvidia processors running it. The benchmark tests low-level operations such as matrix multiplication, convolutions, handing recurrent layers and the time it takes for data to be shared with all processors in a cluster. Machine learning has emerged as a critical workload for Web giants such as Baidu, Google, Facebook and others. The workloads come in many flavors serving applications such as speech, object and video recognition and automatic language translation. Today the job of training machine learning models “is limited by compute, if we had faster processors we’d run bigger models…in practice we train on a reasonable subset of data that can finish in a matter of months,” said Greg Diamos, a senior researcher at Baidu’s Silicon Valley AI Lab. The lab has found, for example, it can reduce by 40% errors in automatic language translation for every order-of-magnitude performance improvement in computing. “We could use improvements of several orders of magnitude--100x or greater,” said Diamos. No striking results emerged from initial tests on NVidia TitanX, TitanX Pascal and M40 GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi processors, according to the Baidu researchers. “Even for the same type of operations like matrix multiplies, depending on the sizes of the models and the ways they are used, performance varies even on the same processor,” said Diamos. “We aren’t as concerned about minor differences between these processors--we want both to be 10 times faster,” he said. Nevertheless, one executive took occasion to claim bragging rights. Baidus DeepBench results clearly highlight Pascal as the performance leader across all deep learning workloads, said Ian Buck, vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia. When full applications are benchmarked, such as Caffe AlexNet or Caffe VGG-19, our internal testing shows Pascal is up to 6x faster than [Intel's] Knights Landing, he added. The Baidu researchers also hope other processor vendors and data center operators contribute to expanding and running chips on the benchmark. “I’d be personally interested in results on AMD GPUs and ASICs from startups with custom hardware for whom it may be difficult to run full models -- this might be an easier way to for them to get their capabilities out there,” Diamos said, noting the lab currently uses systems with eight Nvidia TitanX processors to run its speech recognition models. DeepBench tests low-level hardware libraries, not higher level AI frameworks the data centers create such as Baidu’s PaddlePaddle and Google’s TensorFlow. “At the framework level, there’s a huge amount of difference in the models, and different models for different apps, but below the frameworks they use a few common operations,” said Sharan Narang a software engineer in Baidu’s AI lab. “The hope is we can find the core common operations that are more actionable for hardware makers,” he said. The researchers are considering whether they need a benchmark for inferencing, the separate job of using the models to find patterns in data. Today Baidu and Microsoft use FPGAs on servers to accelerate that less compute-intensive work. Whether competing data center operators collaborate on DeepBench remains to be seen. To date, Google has made its TensorFlow framework open source and created an ASIC to accelerate inferencing jobs on its servers. For its part, Facebook released an open source server using multiple Nvidia GPUs for training neural networks. A handful of startups are working on processors optimized for training neural networks including Wave Computing which presents its work at an event this week and Nervana which Intel recently acquired. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Google Designing AI Processors Facebook Preps Open GPU Server Intel to Acquire Deep Learning Nervana AI Drives Startup to Map Deep Learning Computer Email This Print Comment More Related Links Intels Nervana Attacks GPUs Virtual Reality Will Stay Hot Samsung Makes 10nm Qcomm SoC Taming erratic cellular latency with "extreme asynchronous" IoT firmware design Electronica Settles into Automotive, Industrial, IoT Roles Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Rookie Need more than benchmarks WaveJin   9/27/2016 5:04:54 PM Login to Rate Great article Rick. At Wave we welcome the goals of DeepBench. Although in its current form, it is useful mainly for comparing GPUs and CPUs, we are looking forward to contributing to this effort to enable fair comparison of non-GPU architectures. More fundamental to Baidu's goal of achieving 100x improvement in compute power, we believe this can only be met through discontinuous versus continuous innovation. If we only focus on incremental improvements of low-level operations such as matrix multiplications or convolutions, we will miss out on opportunities for key innovations. Wave's CTO, Dr. Chris Nicol, recently wrote an interesting blog about the need for discontinuous innovation in computing architectures to achieve real and game-changing improvements in computing systems for deep learning rather than being constrained by certain types of benchmarks and associated designs. http://wavecomp.com/blog/benchmarks-can-either-encourage-or-constrain-innovation While the initial work on DeepBench is very useful, it needs to be complemented with the willingness to think out-of-the-box and innovate at all levels to meet the 100x challenge posed by Baidu. Thank you again for a really insightful article and we are looking forward to continuing discussions on this topic.

The platform featured advanced smart contract technology that enabled trading, matching, and settlement of U.S. Treasury bonds, as well as automated coupon payments and redemption, R3 said in a statement. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin, enabling data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its perceived usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. "Our goal at R3 is to bring our members together with the strongest technology players and work collaboratively to evaluate and accelerate this technology to production using real-world use cases," said Tim Grant, chief executive officer of R3's Lab and Research Center. R3 is leading a consortium of more than 60 of the world's largest financial institutions created to develop commercial applications of blockchain technology for the financial services industry. The R3 consortium members involved in U.S. Treasury debt project included CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. The blockchain trial was undertaken at R3's Lab and Research Center.

For the rest of us, we are under constant surveillance, to the point where Homeland Security will fly a whole team into Detroit airport for what they thought was going to be a treasure trove of Intel, via their five-hour grilling of Gordon Duff. All they got is the opportunity to go through all of his German vacation photos and videos, hundreds of them, all time- and date-stamped, which prove he was not training IS snipers in Syria or Afghanistan. And of course, the taxpayers footed the labor bill on this fiasco. Boko Haram is miraculously able to secure the use of satellite phones — very hard to get without major ID and a traceable payment schedule — normally leaving behind a bread crumb trail that should have drones raining down on them, to the extent that getting a satellite phone would technically be deemed a form of suicide. Yet, VT does not find anyone in Intelligence, investigative media, or politics who is the slightest bit curious about such anomalies, despite their being the flashing neon light kind. When we query professionals about this, we can tell with rare exceptions that the issue has never entered their minds before. It’s like they have a DNA-activated “no go” survival instinct that renders them dumb, blind and stupid, whenever it’s in their best interest. This orchestrated failure of not asking the right questions is carved in stone in the history of the War of Terror; and what a hoax it has been, as to who has primarily been running it and why. Gordon will tell you the rest, in his own special way, his good deed for the day… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ This is the result of Western-backed “Jihadi adventure tourism” – First published … September 26, 2016 – The game is called chaos theory. The goal is destabilization, putting the world “in play.” The tool is sexual frustration driven by cultural bias and economic hardship, put in play by the CIA to move literal armies of young Islamic males around the world. Executed Syrian soldiers Those not being sent as jihadists for ISIS or the oft rebranded “moderate” mercenary surrogate armies, now flood the cities of the world where carefully orchestrated press, staged incidents, false flag terrorism and a very real social disaster is radicalizing fearful Americans and Europeans, driving them to political suicide. None of this is an accident. To the CIA and other agencies that are run by social scientists with excessive moral flexibility, all conflict is good, an agent for change and all change can be controlled, directed and managed. Agents of change are typically terrorism, political strife, poverty and, less well known, sex. You see, the current agent of chaos, the one dominating the world scene is testosterone, the drive for “coupling” by the endless population of young males willing to uproot themselves from hopeless lives and go wherever they are directed for whatever task is put in front of them. All that is required is the promise of sex and maybe hope for a life of some kind even if the work is tyranny and beheadings. The author of these migrations, mostly Islamic males, is the CIA, MI6 and the Mossad along with France’s DGSE. Intelligence agencies are agents of change “on the cheap” and operate best when governments fall, when alliances crumble and when social unrest festers and erupts into open conflict. Here, the “masters of the universe,” the Washington and Tel Aviv think tanks, the self-proclaimed geniuses of Whitehall, themselves no more than jackals serving an unseen master, manipulate the world with Twitter and Facebook. There is a wonderful efficiency to social media, anonymous, deniable, cheap and dirty, oh so very dirty. In America, it is done from Ft. Huachuca, Arizona, the US Army Intelligence School. There every Arabic dialect is known, every social network penetrated, the word is put out: “German women are all whores, you can simply rip their clothing off and have your way with them. German authorities are cowards, the German people weak and best of all, the German government will pay you to live like a king and you never have to work.” The Israelis, working closely with their Saudi and Turkish friends from centers staffed with unemployed housewives, have their own version, one that plays well from the Philippines to Africa’s Sahel, one that has brought a hundred thousand or more from obscure villages to the battlefronts of the Middle East: “Come to Syria and Iraq, join ISIS. Travel across the world, from airport to airport, no visa, no tickets, you will move across the world like magic, to a world where all is yours, any woman you want, any boy, protected by the US Air Force, paid by Saudi Arabia, rape, murder and steal and when you are done, you can live in Paris or Frankfurt or Stockholm.” And they do move as though by magic, some 8000 miles or more, through the most secure airports of the world, across impenetrable borders, fed, clothed and protected, paid, armed and furnished with wives from among the tens of thousands of sex slaves who live in agony and thrall to the CIA and her sister terror groups who, as more and more accept, are ISIS and every other terror group on the planet. They are called “Non-State Actors,” typically armed (ANSA) and are cataloged by Geneva Call, a Swiss group that lives in heady denial of the reality of our time, that ANSA’s are surrogate armies that act as agents for destabilization on behalf of world organized crime, also known as the “global economy.” What we are addressing today is the sexual component of “war on the cheap” and how human biology makes this all so easy. It is no secret that young men are vulnerable to bad decision making. In males, or so we are told by social scientists, the cerebral cortex doesn’t develop properly until well into the 30s. When you add to this certain tenets of Islam, the seemingly overt demonization of sexuality outside marriage and the many controversial interpretations of the Koran that allow rape, then you have created a powerful message. Further exacerbating the issue is the high birthrate, always inside legal marriage mind you unlike in the West, that Islamic countries enjoy, that and the crumbling economies. Place this is a social subtext of sex within marriage only when the population is entirely Islamic, as is so often the case, and little hope of achieving the required economic status that would allow sex within marriage and a certain desperation ensues. Place a few I-Phones around, load up social media with tales of sex parties in Manjib and Mosul, of fat Saudi paychecks sent home to needy families, of heroic war against the West and recruiting jihadists is an ease. Little do they know they are working for Israel or Washington or London or Paris, as they are all the same anyway. Behind this put a supporting mechanism that controls the world’s airports through companies like Israel’s ICTS and the global terror databases that seem to allow only terrorists to travel without being questioned, and it all comes together. Aiding it all is the United Nations and an endless number of Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide training, transportation, medical care, food and, of course, the finest high technology weapons possible, the best missiles, sniper rifles, satellite intelligence, F16s flying air cover and Western diplomats providing needed subterfuge. There would be no terrorism, no “war on the cheap” without phony charities, and most charities are just that. Google Idea Groups Then you have the world press, the Reuters news agency, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, BBC and Guardian, all secretly bought by drug profits from Afghanistan, fed by CIA contracting companies like Booz Allen Hamilton and Google Idea Groups, and it all starts to come together. It isn’t just Syria and Iraq, not just Africa. The refugee crisis in Europe, the crisis that has already destroyed Europe as more and more admit each day, is just another stage. In the US, the current election process, a purely theatrical expression with no democratic aspects whatsoever, now is heavily backdropped with “Islamization” scare tactics. Each day every American receives emails linking to YouTube videos showing gang rapes across Europe and promising that this will come to America unless the right candidate is supported. The emails all trace down to Washington think tanks closely aligned with the Israel lobby of course, but few look and fewer care. Who are the victims? Who are the winners? Add to this an endless stream of carefully staged events, shopping center knifings, school shootings, car bombings, too many to be believable, often with perpetrators whose history leads back to intelligence agency contacts or suspicious psychiatric treatments, but this is another subject for another time. Can you hire an army with a handful of “tweets?” Sure you can. Can you uproot millions with the promise of sex? We’ve seen it done? Is it all part of a plan? We know it is.

A few cultural/historical observations, (1) This is nothing new, historically speaking. At the battle of Uhud, fought between the polytheist Meccans and the Muslim Medinans, Abu Sufyan, the commander of the Meccans, brought some of the finest young ladies from Mecca. They were singing, dancing, and taunting the Meccan soldiers, so as to inspire them to combat and violence; who would want (especially in the world of 1400 years ago) to pass up the opportunity to bed one of Mecca’s most attractive women after battle?? Sociologists have also pointed out that the early Jamestown colony was one of the most violent societies in history, with constant duels and fights. The reason: the strenuous early colonial lifestyle was mostly suited to men. Only the richest could afford to bring their wives from the homeland. The rest were a bunch of single males, too much testosterone. Log in to Reply FrigidInferno  September 27, 2016 at 12:06 pm (2) I always had a (very mistaken) impression that Islam was sexually repressive (though some modern variants certainly are!). In the purview of its original context, Islam’s attitude toward sex was relatively liberal. While Muhammad (pbuh) warned of the sins and pitfalls of sex, he also proclaimed its blessing when done correctly (i.e. in marriage, with the perspective/attitude of serving the OTHER person). He encouraged people to marry early, encouraged people to be open to having sex (again in the “right”, Islamic way), and even expounded the detrimental impacts of abstinence on those who were not married. And for Shias, Islam even sanctioned a form of temporary marriage. Done properly, maturely, and sincerely, it’s a classical, Islamic parallel to the concept of “boyfriend”/”girlfriend.” It’s mind-numbing how this early, advanced understanding has been lost to a large degree in the modern Muslim world. FrigidInferno  September 27, 2016 at 12:06 pm (3) Sex isn’t just being used in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia to engineer hordes of sexually frustrated jihadis. Sex is also a driving factor in the control of the West. So many of the trends and fashions that are pushed on the public, generation after generation, are driven through by sexual frustration/repression/anticipation. Many people adopt their identity, lifestyle, and image wanting to feel connected with the masses, and this is, I believe, subconsciously (or even consciously) driven by sexual desires, sexual frustrations, and sexual programming via the media. Isn’t it amazing how so much human dysfunctionality is being driven by sex? Nasir  September 27, 2016 at 9:58 am Gordon, about you travel problems. This is the second time I reading about your personal problems. As a grown man who does not tow the party line, you should expect it an take it as a compliment. Why do you whine about your own personal problems? Do you think others get a break? That is quite a bit of whining from person who should know better. Sincerely, Nasir Log in to Reply Nasir  September 27, 2016 at 9:46 am A side bar: Commenters in the Facebook section; Some of you claim to divine Gordon’s intent from his ramblings; so you being prescient and all, answer this: Would not you agree that the reason rape is so rampant in India (pop. 1.3 Billion), is due to pron watching and perception of western women as portrayed by west itself, not because Indian men don’t any–they seem to be getting it quite a bit, look at the population? Or would you say that women are asking for it? does it have to do anything with religion? What kind of numbskulls are reading VT these days, there used to be pretty sane people around. Perhaps my friend Jonas can explain this, after all this is a social and cultural issue. Log in to Reply Nasir  September 27, 2016 at 9:36 am Gordon, with all due respect, please stop writing. If you need to share something with people just talk, or talk to someone who can then write it down for you. I have no idea what is the relationship of sex and Intelligence agencies. Are you saying that young men don’t get to tap any? If they don’t, how do you explain the population explosion in the Muslim world? Someone is definitely having sex and having babies, and I am not sure it is your local fertilization doctor. How do you reconcile it? Now if you are saying that they hunger for extreme depravity,as shown by our western porn, which at the minimum involves oral, vaginal, and anal sex: you might be on to something. Probably they don’t get to hammer throats and double penetrate. But is that normal? You and I both know that this demand was created by our porn industry, just like McDonald’s heart attack giving hamburgers. You can not blame young people outside the west for thinking that all white women like this type of treatment and are fond of being humiliated. This is the only thing they have ever seen, thanks to our porn industry and our Hollywood: we have marketed our women like a piece of meat just like those hamburger patties. Sincerely, Nasir Log in to Reply the truth please  September 27, 2016 at 7:25 am I now know what NGO stands for, Non Governmental Organization , we live and learn. Log in to Reply the truth please  September 27, 2016 at 3:09 am Excellent article Mr Duff, but I need to ask a few question so please excuse my ignorance. Could you please tell me what “ET“ NGO stands for ? because when I first saw `ET` my mind went to Extraterrestrial like it would with most people but I`m stuck on `NGO`. Also I find it interesting that you emphasized those abbreviations at the beginning of your article as though you want us to get something into our heads without actually saying it. This brings me to a radio interview you did sometime back where you indicated that there was a group on this world looking for land areas on Earth to house an incoming Extraterrestrial Alien race and one of those countries was Africa. Since that interview all hell has broken loose in Africa and the East, so I ask is it all connected ? is this terraforming ? total disruption and destruction to make room for this nomadic race of Aliens, or have I got it all wrong, I apologize for my ignorance if I have.

Culturewars.com is where his books can be seen, as well as his magazine “Culture Wars”. I think he is unsurpassed as a cultural analyst, investigative journalist, and historian. He is also a very sharp philosopher and theologian. Log in to Reply darrelld  September 27, 2016 at 2:01 am I thought I saw a comment on E Michael Jones, maybe it was a different article.

Sickening really – good article! Log in to Reply Beydety  September 26, 2016 at 6:02 pm Yes, I’ve always wondered how no one questions how is it that Governments know every persons digital footprint in real time, yet we still have so called terrorism acts on innocents. To me that’s all people need to know of who really is behind everything. Log in to Reply Zaguero  September 26, 2016 at 4:19 pm Well, Gordon, I believe you’re absolutely correct. I have suspected this for a long time. But good luck convincing the mainstream of this. I have been dropped like a hot potato by several “friends” for saying things far milder. None so blind as those who will not see.

Being flown around the world, given a little cash, and sex of your choice. Sounds better than the $96 per month, and the $26, or $27 (bonus bucks) combat pay given to me in ’68. Only to come home after 13 months to find I couldn’t get laid unless I had a fist full of $20s. About a week before my discharge date in ’69, I was offered the prize. $3,000, and choice of duty station. All I had to do was re up, visit ft. Benning’s famous jump school, train to be a door gunner, and 1 more tour in country, and after that the world was mine. Of course I turned it down. Gordon, the odd thing about this is, to this day, at times I feel guilt for refusing. What’s that about? Brainwashing? Remember back in the day, every assignment had a “life expectancy”? 15 minutes is my recollection. It wasn’t openly talked about, more like whispered, voices from the grave. I picture the mercs, who make up ISIL, and others, as poor, few options for a decent life. Young, dumb, and full of …..! How did the song go? “….the new boss, same as the old boss….we won’t get fooled again….” Right?

Just trust us, says Microsoft executive Microsoft releases Server 2016, complete with commercial Docker engine Microsoft inserts 'new kind of computer ... into our cloud' for speedier Azure services Ignite Microsoft is using Intel Altera Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) chips to speed up Azure services, according to an announcement at the Ignite event under way in Atlanta. FPGA chips aim to combine the performance advantage of hardware with the flexibility of software. They are integrated circuits that can be reconfigured by downloading a new hardware configuration after manufacture, hence "Field Programmable". Initiated in 2010, Microsoft's Project Catapult is an effort to accelerate cloud computing through a network of FPGAs in the company's datacenters. Now the company has announced what it says is the world's largest deployment of FPGAs. For three years or so, Microsoft has been including an Altera FPGA in every server it installs. Altera, a specialist FPGA vendor, was acquired by Intel in 2015. This FPGA network will be used to accelerate artificial intelligence services, among other things. Microsoft says the current rollout is in 15 countries over five continents, though there is no detail available. Newer data centres, such as those recently opened in the UK, are likely to be suitably equipped. “The really important thing is how we’ve architected the system,” Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Doug Burger told The Reg. “The FPGA sits directly between the server and the network, so all the traffic goes through. The CPU can also talk to it over PCIe, but the FPGAs can talk to one another over the network as well. So in some sense it’s a new kind of computer that’s been inserted into our cloud. That layer can do networking, it can do AI, it can do other things. It is a major architectural change." The fact that all the network traffic goes through the FPGAs is what enables Microsoft to use the FPGAs somewhat independently of the servers, rather than always going via the host servers. At the same time, this design introduces new risks, since a bug or fault impacts the whole system. That, said Burger, has been the key challenge. "You are putting an alien technology into a very mature system. All of the network traffic runs through this thing. You screw it up, you can do some real damage. You think about reliability at scale, failure diagnostics, health monitoring, debugging, version management, package management, all of that needs to be built into the platform. No one has gone large scale like this." The benefit though is huge speed-up for certain specialist tasks. "When you have a successful FPGA deployment, the speed-ups you get tend to range between 10 and 1000 times. Usually it’s in the low 10s," said Burger. Might Microsoft allow developers to upload their own FPGA images to run on Azure? "That is a potential business," says Burger. "We haven't announced any plans or schedule to do that." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Microsoft boffins: Who needs Intel CPUs when you've got FPGAs?

Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. I am extremely bearish on the semiconductor sector. In particular, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for the reasons listed below. I am looking to short 5,000 shares of the stock at a price of $37.20 or higher. I am looking for a quick drop of $2+ for a $10,000 profit in a week or two. Any sector that rises over 50% in a year without a pull back, is a likely candidate. This is what has happened to the semiconductor index $SMH. Intel Corp in particular has hit a double top from 2014 which is why I am focussing on this as a big short. When an index is beyond extended and one of its biggest components has a double top, the short is a high reward and low risk trade.

MSI’s GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Notebook Receives Drivers for Windows 10 All files required to provide maximum performance Sep 26, 2016 11:43 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  MSI has made available all the drivers required by its GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii notebook in order to provide maximum performance, stability, and usability while running the 64-bit variant of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system. When it comes to the downloadable packages, MSI provides a new BIOS that fixes VBIOS version display in BSU, as well as updates the device’s MicroCode. These files might come in handy in case future updates turn up faulty. As for other components, Rivet Networks, Atheros, and Intel provide the Ethernet, Wireless, and Bluetooth drivers, while Realtek ensures the well-functioning of the card reader and audio feature through the appropriate files. In addition to that, while Intel provides Chipset, RST (Rapid Storage Technology), RST Preinstall, ME (Management Engine), and Thunderbolt files. Synaptics makes sure all touch-related functions work perfectly. Last but not least, Intel also takes care of the video chipset, as well as all of its available features through its graphics package, and NVIDIA enables the full power of the notebook’s dedicated video card. That said, if you intend to apply these packages, simply save all files on your computer’s internal storage, extract them if necessary, and run the appropriate setup files one by one. Also, upon completion, it would be a good idea to perform a system reboot to ensure all changes take effect. Therefore, download MSI GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Drivers, take into account all aspects described above, and check our website as often as possible to be up to speed with the latest news.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii#MSI#Notebook#GT72S Dominator G Tobii#Drivers reddit it! flip it share it tweet it MSI GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Notebook (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Download Drivers for MSI GT72VR 6RD Dominator Tobii Notebook Download Drivers for GT73VR TITAN and TITAN SLI Notebooks Download Drivers for MSI’s New X99A TOMAHAWK Motherboard Download New BIOS for MSI H110M PRO Series Motherboards Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 AMD Releases Radeon Crimson Edition 16.11.4 Hotfix - Download and Apply Now New Firmware Is Available for Sony PlayStation 4 Consoles - Get Version 4.06 Amazon Adds Alexa to Its Fire, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 - Get Firmware 5.6.0 5 photos    MSI GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii New Apps Gwyddion: An efficient and reliable modular application designed specifically for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data visualization and analysis Gus Tools: Turn ESD images of Windows 10 to ISO format, so that you may upgrade your computer to this operating system using a USB or a DVD Avira System SpeedUp: Clean junk files, repair registry errors, delete invalid keys, clean computer activity traces, and defragment your drives using this all-in-one tool POPcon PRO: Advanced program that helps you retrieve messages from POP3 mailboxes and deliver them to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes using antispam, archive, antivirus engine, rule-based distribution and scheduled tasks WFilter Enterprise: Monitor bandwidth, filter and block Internet activities on your network from a single computer via a web-based administration interface PDF to Image Converter: An intuitive and user-friendly application that can come in handy whenever you want to convert your PDF files to various graphic formats Mkgmap splitter: Split the OpenStreetMap files into smaller tiles in order to use them on your Garmin device, with this practical command-line utility Reader comments NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 more on: 375.95 Hotfix i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Ogg September 25, 2016 10:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) may have received a lot of new cash from a capital raise and recently reworked its wafer supply agreement, and now analysts have started getting back on the AMD wagon after a sharp pullback. Oddly enough, rival Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) may be a driving force for AMD, even on top of AMD’s other ongoing long-term positives. Before chasing analyst calls unilaterally, it is important to understand that AMD’s recent trading was after a monumental run of more than 300%. Then came AMD’s dilutive financing via stock and convertible debt sales. It is also important to understand that many analysts get their upside theses wrong, and sometimes they just ride a bull for long enough that they forgot about the horns. AMD has a 52-week trading range of $1.65 to $8.00. Its consensus analyst price target is now $6.12, according to Thomson Reuters. That consensus target was $6.01 a week ago, $5.25 a month ago, $5.19 two months ago and $3.95 at the end of June. Here are some of the recent positive AMD analyst calls, tempered with some cautious calls so investors get both sides of the coin. AMD saw a key Sell-equivalent rating removed by Bernstein on September 20. The firm raised AMD to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its target price to $5 from $3. AMD shares were last seen flat at $6.16 ahead of that call. The prior day brought a big call from the likes of Jefferies, which reiterated a Buy rating and a whopping $9 price target. Jefferies reflected upon AMD’s recent debt and equity financing, noting multiple catalysts ahead and that the Street has not fully caught on here. Even before Intel raised its guidance, MKM Partners reiterated its Buy rating and $8 price target on AMD on September 7. This was after the revised wafer supply deal with GlobalFoundries and was after the financing of debt and stock was at least known. MKM Partners said: The launch of margin-rich Zen server solutions should close the architecture gap with Intel (INTC, Buy, $36.08, $40 PT), and help stabilize and then increase their share of the x86 server market. We maintain our Buy rating and $8 price target (implies 1.76x multiple to our EV/FY17 Sales estimate). On September 11, Canaccord Genuity reiterated its Buy rating and its $8.50 price target. It also acknowledged Intel’s threat, but its thesis said: While we recognize that roadmap execution, competition and financial risks remain, we remain impressed with the new management team and still anticipate a quick recovery to solid profitability given prospects for topline growth given a much stronger product roadmap and due to lower expense levels necessitated by the company’s recent struggles. Finally, we believe risk/reward for AMD shares remains unbalanced to the upside despite the recent stock move and could quickly recover from recent volatility. We reiterate our BUY rating and $8.50 price target and would be buyers of any stock weakness following the announcement of these strategically important long-term moves. More recently, Standard & Poor’s equity team reiterated their Hold rating and $6 price target. Their September 17 note said: Our 12-month target price of $6.00 is based on a price-to-sales ratio of 1.1X our 2017 sales per share estimate, a steep discount to peers, but near its ten-year historical average. A discount to peers is warranted, we think, given its lack of profitability. Also on September 13, Deutsche Bank remained cautious. The firm has a Hold rating and a $5 price target. The cautious view said: AMD benefits from interest savings and pushes out the maturity of the next tranche of debt to 2022; however, it also dilutes its current shareholders by as much as ~30% between the new equity/convertible and the recently-issued warrants to Mubadala. Overall, while we applaud AMD’s recent execution on products, IP and profitability, we believe the core challenges of the company remain. Merrill Lynch remains among the most cautious and negative on AMD. Its team has an Underperform rating on AMD (and a Buy rating on Intel and NVIDIA). Their price target is $5, but even that target was raised in the recent months. Even the more cautious analysts have recently raised AMD target prices. Now just keep in mind that AMD shares are up 128% year to date and up 280% from this time a year ago. That is not normal, even for AMD. A gain like that also means that much of AMD’s coming good news is already at least partly baked into the cake here. Thomson Reuters does not have AMD expected to be profitable on an earnings per share (reported, not GAAP) until 2018. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Sep 25th 2016, 8:00 AM 20,041 Views 18 Comments Share25 Tweet Email5 Image: James Crombie/INPHO SITTING ACROSS THE table from Enda McNulty, I catch myself early on. We’ve all seen the clip. Hundreds of times. ’We fight for that inch’. We get it. The motivational techniques, the inspirational stuff – it tends to irritate us after a while. We’re wary of over-complicating. We remain steadfastly suspicious of keeping an open-mind. It’s not long before the begrudgery and sneering starts. McNulty, more than most, knows all about that scene from Any Given Sunday. His former Armagh coach Joe Kernan used to show it to the players on the team bus throughout that monumental 2002 All-Ireland campaign. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=m_iKg7nutNY&t=) Source: umterps3511/YouTube So McNulty is long past sneering. His father graduated from Queen’s University with a degree in psychology. Since his teens, he’s been heavily immersed in the topic. He didn’t need any encouragement from Kernan when it came to clawing with his fingernails for that inch. Years before the Cork hurlers wore red wristbands with ‘Gach Uile Liathroid’ written on them, Armagh were already at it. McNulty would go further. He’d have individual letters on his wrist tape. Each letter corresponded to something he wanted to achieve during the game. In certain circles, there’s been an inevitably raised-eyebrow regarding McNulty’s subsequent career as a high-performance specialist. In 2005, he established Motiv8 and began advising a host of sports clients. His and the company’s reputation quickly skyrocketed to such an extent that it now employs 30 people and 90% of its business is gleaned from the corporate sector. The easy thing is to sneer, of course. Less than a minute into our conversation, I do. McNulty references ‘clutch or pressure moments’. And I catch myself. Buzz words already. Cliches already. But the more McNulty talks, the more he veers away from convention. The way he analyses elite performance is a marked contrast from the norm. It’s studious and forensic and absorbing. Sometimes, it’s scientific. Sometimes not. But it’s always engaging. “Either we heal as a team or we are going to crumble”. He’s passionate about collaboration, something he feels doesn’t happen enough in Ireland. Instead of following the think-tank model that exists in other countries, he thinks we’re resting on our laurels. Waiting for inspiration rather than going out and finding it. “We don’t have enough of a collaborative approach to performance”, he says. I’m not just talking about sport. One of the organisations we work with is Intel. Can you imagine what we can learn from them? Intel have one of the leading manufacturing plants in the world. They are producing world-leading performance every single day. Another of our clients is Riverdance. Padraic Moyles is the lead dancer. I believe soccer players can learn a lot from Riverdance. This guy has done over 5,500 performances. That’s a lot of caps. We haven’t learned enough from GB in what they’re doing in terms of that joined-up approach from what they can learn from the best performance crucibles in the world. We’re too insular. We need to take the blinkers off. We need to take a tin-opener to the top of our minds and say ‘What is possible?’ We’ve got some of the most talented athletes in the world. We’ve got some of the most amazing sports organisations in the world. If we’d only bang our heads together and have positive collisions.” “We are in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light.” Psychology is a sexy, modern facet of sport. Like analytics. But it can often be used as a mere PR exercise rather than a coherent element of a long-term performance strategy. In 2014, just prior to the World Cup in Brazil, the FA brought in the renowned sports psychiatrist Steve Peters to work with the England players. He was tasked with conjuring a miracle with limited, controlled access to the group. It was always a long-shot. “I think a lot of things in sport are about the optics more than the substance”, McNulty says. Source: Jonathan Brady “The best performance organisations in the world make sure everything is tied together. It becomes a fabric of the culture. Team GB in the Olympics – the sports psychologists wouldn’t have been a once-off, a one-hit wonder. It would’ve been the last eight years. I was in Loughborough University with David Gillick about 10 years ago and at that stage, the athletes were working with sports psychologists in advance of the London Olympics and they’ve been consistent with that right up to the present day. I think the English soccer team is a prime example of a team that choked under pressure, that weren’t ready mentally, that have consistently under-performed on big occasions, that have malfunctioned now coming up on six World Cup/European Championships. It’s incredible. So how can we have one of the most experienced brain mechanics in the world working with a team that needed a brain mechanic and they’ve consistently under-performed? “It’s not just psychological. It’s cultural, it’s technical, it’s tactical, it’s leadership. I found the lack of technical skills more amazing than the mental. The teams I played on – we knew being mentally tough wasn’t good enough. You could have the most mentally tough team in the world but no leaders. I can be calm, composed, concentrated, confident in the last five minutes but if I don’t know how to scream at my full-back line to say ‘Step up guys – do whatever you need to do to get the ball in the next tackle here’…The leadership needs to be merged with the mental toughness. With English soccer, I don’t believe it’s just the mental frailties of the team. There are not enough leaders on the park – you saw that against Iceland. Where were the leaders? Did you see anyone rally the troops? Did you see anyone screaming like Kevin McManamon at Croke Park this year? Did you see anyone communicating? Did you see anyone bringing the guys in and making the midfield cohesive? I didn’t see any sign of it.” Elite performers have the capability to immediately refocus after an error. It’s quickly forgotten about it, erased from the memory bank. Even across various strands of performance, the rules remain the same among the best. “There’s a similar technique but it varies how it’s executed”, McNulty says. Source: PA WIRE “Dan Carter, after a mistake, will do this (slaps his thigh)  - which means ‘Delete the mistake’. It’s a little trigger mechanism to get back into the moment. Some of the elite Irish rugby players we work with are incredible at getting a breath at the right moment to centre them in the middle of the now. One, deep, quality centering breath that settles you into what’s happening here and now.” Still, even the best can freeze. “Now I can’t make you do it. You gotta look at the guy next to you. Look into his eyes. Now, I think you are going to see a guy who will go that inch with you. You are going to see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows when it comes down to it, you are gonna do the same thing for him.” In his autobiography ‘Red’, Gary Neville discusses his 85-cap England career. He refers to it as a ‘waste of time’, detailing how too many players were plagued by the fear of failure rather than motivated by the prospect of success. ‘Motivation’ is a term flippantly thrown around sports discussions. But it’s a nuanced concept. For Dave Brailsford, GM of Team Sky, he argues that elite performers will train even without feeling motivated. It’s the commitment to the craft that’s the crucial step. Carlo Ancelotti says a manager’s job is to demotivate players, that the elite are self-motivated and individually driven – not coaxed into producing top performances. And yet, occasionally, some athletes will push harder in response to negative comments or perceived criticism. But that’s only a ‘short-term motivator’, according to McNulty. “I met Arsene Wenger about three or four years ago at a conference and he spoke about motivational stamina”, he says. Source: PA ARCHIVE IMAGES “What does that mean? Well, it’s easy to activate someone’s motivation. We can all be motivated for the next month – get fit, get lean or do extras on the football pitch or the golf course. That’s activation. But intensity of the activation. Is it high intensity of motivation (raises voice to a roar) – ‘We’ll fucking do whatever it takes to be unbelievably successful every single day’ or (drops voice) is it low intensity motivation where we don’t really give a damn? “And then there’s the consistency of the motivation. Someone’s negative comments in the media gives you a little spurt. Maybe for a night. I don’t believe, from spending my whole life in this space, that you can drive yourself for 10 or 12 years on what someone said in the media. The best coaches – the Fergusons, the Mourinhos, the Codys, the Phil Jacksons, the Joe Schmidts, even going back to Barcelona and what that club was built on in the early days – I don’t think it was built on what somebody said in the media. It was built on that sweet spot of motivation which is striving every day to be the best you can be. That’s sustainable. It’s something that can give you energy every day. I would never set out to motivate someone negatively. Let’s get into the middle of the arteries of the players’ motivation rather than being on the veneer of the surface of some bullshit.” Consistency. Being the best. We were the best at boxing. But what happened in Rio? Why did the performance levels drop? Too many distractions? “I wouldn’t say it was only social media but a medley of small factors,” McNulty says. “Obviously Billy Walsh, the uncertainty over the last 12 months, maybe that every sports organisation in the world – even the one I played under in Armagh – when you raise the bar and become very successful, if you don’t raise the bar again the next year or over the next four years, you’re going to get obliterated”. “In any fight it is the guy who is willing to die who is going to win that inch.” Social media is becoming an increasingly sizable issue for McNulty and other performance consultants to get to grips with. Some athletes find it difficult to let go. There’s a dependency. “In some cases, we’ve found it scary, to be honest”, McNulty says. You could have an athlete coming to you on the morning of a major, major sporting event – we’re talking about the biggest you can imagine – and they’re saying ‘I just can’t believe this trend about me across social media this week – I’m really gutted by it.’ Or, ‘It’s really heightening my own expectations – they’re saying there’s a big contract on the line because of this performance.’  So we’re meeting that on a really, really frequent basis. In fact, when it’s not mentioned we’re more surprised. “My approach to social media before an Olympics or before a major tournament would be that it needs to be strongly tapered down. The same way a strength and conditioning coach would talk about tapering down a week or two before a tournament. Similarly, their mental conditioning would be tapered down – we’re not going to give them a lot of mental preparation a week before a big event. Social media should be tapered down so that it’s non-existent two days before. That’s what the best athletes are doing, by the way. They’re literally switching off. They don’t have the tweets coming through, they don’t have the Facebook messages coming through. They delete the apps from their phones for those three days. “The young superstars we work with are amazing at that. The players who may have been inconsistent in their performances would say ‘Well, I like my social media the day before – I like to log on and tweet and browse’. We’re saying ‘Sorry – why are you doing that? That doesn’t make any sense’. You’d never tell someone not to do it because it’s too much like a school teacher and authoritarian. You would try and say to them ‘Let’s understand why we’re asking you to taper it down significantly’”. McNulty talks a lot about the preparation timeline for athletes and how the days immediately before an event should be calm and composed, both mentally and physically. By that stage, the hard work should be done. Trying to cram before a big exam is always unhelpful and stressful. “The computer should be programmed three days before the big performance”, he says. Source: Morgan Treacy/INPHO “At that stage – as we tell the athletes or performers – close it. Take everything off the table. You’re ready to perform. Physically, mentally, technically, emotionally, tactically – you’re ready. Rather than the night before – ‘I’m going to do my visualisation’. Or the night before – ‘I have to get myself ready for those moments that matter in the last 30 seconds’. It’s too late. At that stage, the game is over. It’s like me trying to get fit the night before an All-Ireland final. It’s not going to happen. If you’re trying to fine-tune your skills the night before an All-Ireland final, you’re in trouble. I come at this from a place of pain. Three nights before the All-Ireland final in 2003, I was on a pitch working with a coach in a 1-on-1 to help me get sharper in preparation for marking Peter Canavan. And it was an unmitigated disaster. This old coach of mine – Dessie Ryan – is the best defensive coach I’ve come across. He was getting my footwork fine-tuned, my hands fine-tuned, getting me mentally fine-tuned – amazing coaching. The problem was it was the wrong time. It should’ve been two weeks before, not three days. I went into that final with a flu because I was tired, jaded and had done too much work.” “The margin for error is so small. I mean, one half step too late or too early you don’t quite make it. One half second too slow or too fast and you don’t quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us.”  The search for the inches has led to a significant rise in sports science, performance psychology, data analysis across professional and amateur performance. Can McNulty envisage a time when coaches will return to sticking the back page of the local newspaper on the dressing-room wall as a motivational tool? Or when man-management reverts to allowing the players a few beers on their way to a game? “I remember an old mental coach of mine back in the day using the phrase ‘The revolution is going to be back to basics’”, he says. “Our technology, our sports sciences, the sophistication in terms of our preparation is now almost 10x what it was when I finished playing four years ago. It’s incredible. But the basics still apply. All the other stuff is really only window-dressing. Get the basics right 99.9 times out of 100 and you’ll stand out in any performance crucible. Is it your tackle technique in rugby? As a Gaelic footballer, is it keeping your man scoreless? I can do all the other sexy, cool stuff but if I can’t keep Peter Canavan scoreless then I shouldn’t be on the team. I think sometimes we lose our focus on that but it will never be taken away from us.” The42 is on Snapchat! Tap the button below on your phone to add!

Hackers discovered the issues, saying that Apple weakened backup security with iOS 10. But Apple is already on the case and plans to issue fixes for it. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 review According to Forbes, well-known Russian forensic company, Elcomsoft said that cracking the logins for backups stored on a Mac or PC is considerably easier now. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s believed that Elcomsoft helped hackers crack the Apple ID accounts of several celebrities in 2014, just a few days ahead of Apple’s iPhone 6 announcement. The company found that Apple was using a weaker password protection mechanism for manual backups via iTunes on Mac and PC. Using CPU acceleration, Elcomsoft could potentially guess backup passwords 40 times faster when compared to cracking iOS 9 with a speedier GPU tool. Using an Intel i5 CPU, the task was incredibly faster – an “astonishing 2,500 times faster,” as Forbes puts it. The computer would try 6 million passwords per second compared to 2,400. That lowers significantly the amount of time you have to wait for a computer to guess the correct password and access a backup data file. “We discovered an alternative password verification mechanism added to iOS 10 backups,” Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin wrote in a blog post on Friday. “We looked into it and found out that the new mechanism skips certain security checks, allowing us to try passwords approximately 2500 times faster compared to the old mechanism used in iOS 9 and older.” Apple, meanwhile, issued a statement acknowledging the problem. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC,” a spokesperson said. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” And yes, you totally should protect the iTunes backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with a password. That’s the only way to encrypt the iTunes backup.

Adobe adds machine learning and design tool to Creative Cloud First look at Windows Server 2016: 'Cloud for the masses'? We'll be the judge of that Windows updates? Just trust us, says Microsoft executive Ignite Microsoft announced the release of Windows Server 2016 and System Center 2016 at its Ignite event in Atlanta. The commercially supported edition of the Docker engine is included at no extra cost. Server 2016 and System Center 2016 are available for download this week and will be on sale from October 1 2016. A key feature of Server 2016 is its support for Windows containers, a lightweight virtual machine designed for the deployment of microservices. This has enabled the open source Docker engine, already widely used on Linux, to be ported to Windows. Docker has been in preview on Windows for some time, but the release of Server 2016 means that it is now generally available. “There’s a commercial relationship now between Microsoft and Docker,” said Scott Johnston, Docker COO. “We provide the commercially supported Docker Engine, which is the hardened, validated, patched version of the open source product, as part of the Windows Server 2016 SKU. Microsoft will provide Enterprise support for that. We’ll have Docker datacenter support as well, to manage these workloads.” Despite this relationship, the Docker Engine is not integrated into Windows Server setup, nor is it serviced via Windows Update. "There’s a PowerShell [script] to install," said Johnston. Docker was keen to extend its business to Windows, said Johnston. “Sixty-three per cent of the Intel server workloads are run on Windows. Most of the workloads in the enterprise are Windows workloads, not Linux. In Silicon Valley startups it’s easy to think the world has gone 100 per cent Linux and it’s just not true. And on the dev side, 8 million .NET developers.” Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told the Reg that Docker Windows work started two years ago. “We had our own internal container-type technology, but it made sense to leverage the open ecosystem that Docker had pioneered. That 63 per cent of server workloads on Windows, those same companies are also using Linux some place, so it makes sense to have a common technology.” In order to make Docker work, Microsoft had to build new container primitives into the Windows kernel. However it also made many contributions to the Docker Engine itself. “One of our kernel developers, John Howard, is a maintainer with committer rights,” said Russinovich. What about the Azure Container Service, currently Linux-only, will that now have a Windows option? “We don’t have a timeline yet, but I did demonstrate it at DockerCon,” Russinovich said. Some types of applications, such as those using Java or even the cross-platform .NET Core, can be run on either Windows or Linux; but Johnston and Russinovich will not be drawn on performance comparisons. “It’s a technology choice,” says Johnston. “But very soon we’ll see mixed application stacks and you’ll have native Windows and Java or Linux applications in the same application, each taking a role that’s optimal for them.” “That’s our use case, says Tyco CTO Daryll Fogal, a Microsoft customer. “We have a bunch of .NET developers, and we’ve got to try and get scalabilty of platforms. With the tools chain it’s very easy for .NET developers to get going. Second, when you get out of individual VMs and into Docker containers, you get a certain amount of scalability by choosing to be in that environment. We can do a little bit of refactoring and get it running in Docker containers, and then we’ve got time to go do the proper refactoring with a microservices architecture.” “The other part is this hybrid environment. We acquire a company, they’ve got Java developers. We have to have a hybrid solution.” Is Microsoft using Docker internally? “It’s hot off the press, we don’t have anything in production,” says Russinovich. “But we strongly believe that every new application should be run in containers. This applies to all Microsoft services as well. You’re going to see integration of Docker containers on Linux and Windows for all our services everywhere, in the fullness of time.” Why use Docker? “It boils down the fundamental benefits you get out of containers, which is the ecosystem of images, the developer experience, the reliability of the experience, so you can take something that worked in one environment, you move it to another one and it works, the efficiency you get by leveraging shared resources, and the resource isolation that controls what resources these applications are getting. Then you layer on microservices on top, and that’s what we view as cloud native,” said Russinovich.® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register Microsoft sets date for SQL Server on Linux Be patient: first code won't land until 2017 21 Comments Windows Server 2016: Leg up or lock in?

Clayton Cotterell for WIRED It was December 2012, and Doug Burger was standing in front of Steve Ballmer, trying to predict the future. Ballmer, the big, bald, boisterous CEO of Microsoft, sat in the lecture room on the ground floor of Building 99, home base for the company’s blue-sky R&D lab just outside Seattle. The tables curved around the outside of the room in a U-shape, and Ballmer was surrounded by his top lieutenants, his laptop open. Burger, a computer chip researcher who had joined the company four years earlier, was pitching a new idea to the execs. He called it Project Catapult. Doug Burger. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED The tech world, Burger explained, was moving into a new orbit. In the future, a few giant Internet companies would operate a few giant Internet services so complex and so different from what came before that these companies would have to build a whole new architecture to run them. They would create not just the software driving these services, but the hardware, including servers and networking gear. Project Catapult would equip all of Microsoft’s servers—millions of them—with specialized chips that the company could reprogram for particular tasks. But before Burger could even get to the part about the chips, Ballmer looked up from his laptop. When he visited Microsoft Research, Ballmer said, he expected updates on R&D, not a strategy briefing. “He just started grilling me,” Burger says. Microsoft had spent 40 years building PC software like Windows, Word, and Excel. It was only just finding its feet on the Internet. And it certainly didn’t have the tools and the engineers needed to program computer chips—a task that’s difficult, time consuming, expensive, and kind of weird. Microsoft programming computer chips was like Coca Cola making shark fin soup. The current incarnation of Project Catapult. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Burger—trim, only slightly bald, and calmly analytical, like so many good engineers—pushed back. He told Ballmer that companies like Google and Amazon were already moving in this direction. He said the world’s hardware makers wouldn’t provide what Microsoft needed to run its online services. He said that Microsoft would fall behind if it didn’t build its own hardware. Ballmer wasn’t buying it. But after awhile, another voice joined the discussion. This was Qi Lu, who runs Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Lu’s team had been talking to Burger about reprogrammable computer chips for almost two years. Project Catapult was more than possible, Lu said: His team had already started. Today, the programmable chips that Burger and Lu believed would transform the world—called field programmable gate arrays—are here. FPGAs already underpin Bing, and in the coming weeks, they will drive new search algorithms based on deep neural networks—artificial intelligence modeled on the structure of the human brain—executing this AI several orders of magnitude faster than ordinary chips could. As in, 23 milliseconds instead of four seconds of nothing on your screen. FPGAs also drive Azure, the company’s cloud computing service. And in the coming years, almost every new Microsoft server will include an FPGA. That’s millions of machines across the globe. “This gives us massive capacity and enormous flexibility, and the economics work,” Burger says. “This is now Microsoft’s standard, worldwide architecture.” Catapult team members Adrian Caulfield, Eric Chung, Doug Burger, and Andrew PutnamClayton Cotterell for WIRED This isn’t just Bing playing catch-up with Google. Project Catapult signals a change in how global systems will operate in the future. From Amazon in the US to Baidu in China, all the Internet giants are supplementing their standard server chips—central processing units, or CPUs—with alternative silicon that can keep pace with the rapid changes in AI. Microsoft now spends between $5 and $6 billion a year for the hardware needed to run its online empire. So this kind of work is “no longer just research,” says Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft’s CEO in 2014. “It’s an essential priority.” That’s what Burger was trying to explain in Building 99. And it’s what drove him and his team to overcome years of setbacks, redesigns, and institutional entropy to deliver a new kind of global supercomputer. A Brand New, Very Old Kind of Computer Chip In December of 2010, Microsoft researcher Andrew Putnam had left Seattle for the holidays and returned home to Colorado Springs. Two days before Christmas, he still hadn’t started shopping. As he drove to the mall, his phone rang. It was Burger, his boss. Burger was going to meet with Bing execs right after the holiday, and he needed a design for hardware that could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms on FPGAs. Putnam pulled into the nearest Starbucks and drew up the plans. It took him about five hours, and he still had time for shopping. Burger, 47, and Putnam, 39, are both former academics. Burger spent nine years as a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, Austin, where he specialized in microprocessors and designed a new kind of chip called EDGE. Putnam had worked for five years as a researcher at the University of Washington, where he experimented with FPGAs, programmable chips that had been around for decades but were mostly used as a way of prototyping other processors. Burger brought Putnam to Microsoft in 2009, where they started exploring the idea that these chips could actually accelerate online services. Project Catapult Version 1, or V1, the hardware that Doug Burger and team tested in a data center on Microsoft’s Seattle campus. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Even their boss didn’t buy it. “Every two years, FGPAs are ‘finally going to arrive,’” says Microsoft Research vice president Peter Lee, who oversees Burger’s group. “So, like any reasonable person, I kind of rolled my eyes when this was pitched.” But Burger and his team believed this old idea’s time had come, and Bing was the perfect test case. Microsoft’s search engine is a single online service that runs across thousands of machines. Each machine is driven by a CPU, and though companies like Intel continue to improve them, these chips aren’t keeping pace with advances in software, in large part because of the new wave in artificial intelligence. Services like Bing have outstripped Moore’s Law, the canonical notion that the number of transistors in a processor doubles every 18 months. Turns out, you can’t just throw more CPUs at the problem. But on the other hand, it’s generally too expensive to create specialized, purpose-built chips for every new problem. FPGAs bridge the gap. They let engineers build chips that are faster and less energy-hungry than an assembly-line, general-purpose CPU, but customizable so they handle the new problems of ever-shifting technologies and business models. At that post-holiday meeting, Burger pitched Bing’s execs on FPGAs as a low-power way of accelerating searches. The execs were noncommittal. So over the next several months, Burger and team took Putnam’s Christmas sketch and built a prototype, showing that it could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms about 100 times faster. “That’s when they really got interested,” says Jim Larus, another member of the team back then who’s now a dean at Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne. “They also started giving us a really hard time.” Tech Titan Architectures The Epic Story of Dropbox’s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire Netflix Isn’t Made for the US Anymore—It’s for the Whole World Intel Reinvents Itself to Stay King in a Changing World The prototype was a dedicated box with six FPGAs, shared by a rack full of servers. If the box went on the frizz, or if the machines needed more than six FPGAs—increasingly likely given the complexity of the machine learning models—all those machines were out of luck. Bing’s engineers hated it. “They were right,” Larus says. So Burger’s team spent many more months building a second prototype. This one was a circuit board that plugged into each server and included only one FPGA. But it also connected to all the other FPGA boards on all the other servers, creating a giant pool of programmable chips that any Bing machine could tap into. That was the prototype that got Qi Lu on board. He gave Burger the money to build and test over 1,600 servers equipped with FPGAs. The team spent six months building the hardware with help from manufacturers in China and Taiwan, and they installed the first rack in an experimental data center on the Microsoft campus. Then, one night, the fire suppression system went off by accident. They spent three days getting the rack back in shape—but it still worked. Over several months in 2013 and 2014, the test showed that Bing’s “decision tree” machine-learning algorithms ran about 40 times faster with the new chips. By the summer of 2014, Microsoft was publicly saying it would soon move this hardware into its live Bing data centers. And then the company put the brakes on. Searching for More Than Bing Bing dominated Microsoft’s online ambitions in the early part of the decade, but by 2015 the company had two other massive online services: the business productivity suite Office 365 and the cloud computing service Microsoft Azure. And like all of their competitors, Microsoft executives realized that the only efficient way of running a growing online empire is to run all services on the same foundation. If Project Catapult was going to transform Microsoft, it couldn’t be exclusive to Bing. It had to work inside Azure and Office 365, too. The problem was, Azure executives didn’t care about accelerating machine learning. They needed help with networking. The traffic bouncing around Azure’s data centers was growing so fast, the service’s CPUs couldn’t keep pace. Eventually, people like Mark Russinovich, the chief architect on Azure, saw that Catapult could help with this too—but not the way it was designed for Bing. His team needed programmable chips right where each server connected to the primary network, so they could process all that traffic before it even got to the server. The first prototype of the FPGA architecture was a single box shared by a rack of servers (Version 0). Then the team switched to giving individual servers their own FPGAs (Version 1). And then they put the chips between the servers and the overall network (Version 2).WIRED So the FPGA gang had to rebuild the hardware again. With this third prototype, the chips would sit at the edge of each server, plugging directly into the network, while still creating pool of FPGAs that was available for any machine to tap into. That started to look like something that would work for Office 365, too. Project Catapult was ready to go live at last. Larus describes the many redesigns as an extended nightmare—not because they had to build a new hardware, but because they had to reprogram the FPGAs every time. “That is just horrible, much worse than programming software,” he says. “Much more difficult to write. Much more difficult to get correct.” It’s finicky work, like trying to change tiny logic gates on the chip. Now that the final hardware is in place, Microsoft faces that same challenge every time it reprograms these chips. “It’s a very different way of seeing the world, of thinking about the world,” Larus says. But the Catapult hardware costs less than 30 percent of everything else in the server, consumes less than 10 percent of the power, and processes data twice as fast as the company could without it. The rollout is massive. Microsoft Azure uses these programmable chips to route data. On Bing, which an estimated 20 percent of the worldwide search market on desktop machines and about 6 percent on mobile phones, the chips are facilitating the move to the new breed of AI: deep neural nets. And according to one Microsoft employee, Office 365 is moving toward using FPGAs for encryption and compression as well as machine learning—for all of its 23.1 million users. Eventually, Burger says, these chips will power all Microsoft services. Wait—This Actually Works? “It still stuns me,” says Peter Lee, “that we got the company to do this.” Lee oversees an organization inside Microsoft Research called NExT, short for New Experiences and Technologies. After taking over as CEO, Nadella personally pushed for the creation of this new organization, and it represents a significant shift from the 10-year reign of Ballmer. It aims to foster research that can see the light of day sooner rather than later—that can change the course of Microsoft now rather than years from now. Project Catapult is a prime example. And it is part of a much larger change across the industry. “The leaps ahead,” Burger says, “are coming from non-CPU technologies.” Peter Lee. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED All the Internet giants, including Microsoft, now supplement their CPUs with graphics processing units, chips designed to render images for games and other highly visual applications. When these companies train their neural networks to, for example, recognize faces in photos—feeding in millions and millions of pictures—GPUs handle much of the calculation. Some giants like Microsoft are also using alternative silicon to execute their neural networks after training. And even though it’s crazily expensive to custom-build chips, Google has gone so far as to design its own processor for executing neural nets, the tensor processing unit. With its TPUs, Google sacrifices long-term flexibility for speed. It wants to, say, eliminate any delay when recognizing commands spoken into smartphones. The trouble is that if its neural networking models change, Google must build a new chip. But with FPGAs, Microsoft is playing a longer game. Though an FPGA isn’t as fast as Google’s custom build, Microsoft can reprogram the silicon as needs change. The company can reprogram not only for new AI models, but for just about any task. And if one of those designs seems likely to be useful for years to come, Microsoft can always take the FPGA programming and build a dedicated chip. A newer version of the final hardware, V2, a card that slots into the end of each Microsoft server and connects directly to the network. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Microsoft’s services are so large, and they use so many FPGAs, that they’re shifting the worldwide chip market. The FPGAs come from a company called Altera, and Intel executive vice president Diane Bryant tells me that Microsoft is why Intel acquired Altera last summer—a deal worth $16.7 billion, the largest acquisition in the history of the largest chipmaker on Earth. By 2020, she says, a third of all servers inside all the major cloud computing companies will include FPGAs. It’s a typical tangle of tech acronyms. CPUs. GPUs. TPUs. FPGAs. But it’s the subtext that matters. With cloud computing, companies like Microsoft and Google and Amazon are driving so much of the world’s technology that those alternative chips will drive the wider universe of apps and online services. Lee says that Project Catapult will allow Microsoft to continue expanding the powers of its global supercomputer until the year 2030. After that, he says, the company can move toward quantum computing. Later, when we talk on the phone, Nadella tells me much the same thing. They’re reading from the same Microsoft script, touting a quantum-enabled future of ultrafast computers. Considering how hard it is to build a quantum machine, this seems like a pipe dream. But just a few years ago, so did Project Catapult. Correction: This story originally implied that the Hololens headset was part of Microsoft’s NExT organization. It was not. Go Back to Top.

Corrales Comment News Reporting as if Democracy Matters Home Welcome to Corrales Comment Publication Dates Subscribe CC Advertise! Ad Rates Archived Articles CALENDAR COP21 Reporting From Paris Upper Meadowlark Design Goes Out for Contract Details Published: 26 September 2016 A contract to design big changes for upper Meadowlark lane from Loma Larga to the Rio Rancho boundary has been advertised.Village Administrator John Avila said at the September 13 Village Council meeting that state officials have okayed the Village contracting for design and engineering for the trails project along Meadowlark without having to await final approval on right-of-way certification, “and that is around the corner as well.” The project funded through the Mid-Region Council of Governments and the N.M. Department of Transportation (NMDOT) will realign and rebuild upper Meadowlark to include bicycle paths and horse trails as well as improved drainage and traffic safety features. When funding was secured last year, the design work was to have been concluded by now, with early-stage construction to be under way by the end of this year. On-the-ground work is now expected next year. Months of delays resulted when NMDOT imposed new requirements for a variety of clearances and certifications. One of those requirements insisted that Village officials declare and certify that the work along upper Meadowlark would not conflict with any railroad crossing. This summer Avila reported that the highway department had relaxed its insistence that no work or expenditure be initiated until all certifications were submitted and approved. Those final clearances and issuance of a request for proposals could be done concurrently, he explained. But the right-of-way considerations will have to include whatever changes will be needed at the Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersections, he cautioned. Early in the planning process for upper Meadowlark, NMDOT and local officials conducted a traffic safety audit for that intersection. That 2014 exercise concluded with recommendations for improvements, one of which was to  build a traffic circle, or roundabout, there. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXXIII, No.4 April 5, 2014 “Traffic Circle for Meadowlark at Loma Larga?”) Even if the pending right-of-way certification for the Meadowlark-Loma Larga intersection does not include property for a traffic circle, it would likely include areas along Loma Larga for stormwater ponding and discharge. In September 2013, the consulting firm hired to suggest ways to improve upper Meadowlark Lane, Architectural Research Consultants, called for bike riders to use the same downhill driving lane as autos, or divert to the future pedestrian path along the south side of the re-configured roadway. Appearing before the mayor and Village Council at their September 10, 2013 meeting, the firm’s Steve Burstein presented a revised “Option A”  that showed a five-foot wide bike lane adjacent to the westbound driving lane, while eastbound bike riders would be expected to come down in the same regular traffic lane used by motor vehicles. If cyclists did not want to “take the lane” with regular traffic coming down  hill, they would be encouraged to  bike along the proposed pedestrian path along the south side of Meadowlark. The revision would basically shift the pavement approximately two feet to the north from where it is now, he explained. Among the advantages of the new plan, cyclists using the bike paths along the Rio Rancho section of Meadowlark Lane would have a continuous connection to designated routes coming down into Corrales. Downhill bike riders would be informed to merge with regular vehicle traffic, or veer off onto the pedestrian trail. Then-Mayor Phil Gasteyer said he thought the revised recommendation would be “much more acceptable to the whole neighborhood.” Some residents along the north side of upper Meadowlark had objected to routing both uphill and downhill bike riders to a future path on the north side of the road. They said they feared pulling into the path of fast bike riders as they left their driveways and tried to enter traffic. In the new plan, downhill cyclists would use the eastbound driving lane or  use the pedestrian path along the south side of the road. The change was endorsed by the Corrales Bicycle, Pedestrian Advisory Commission as well, following communications with Burstein and his planners. At that point, the plans were almost purely hypothetical since no funds had been allocated to tackle the re-make of upper Meadowlark, estimated subsequently at $1.18 million.  Recommendations from the planning sessions in summer 2013 produced a preferred alternative with provisions listed below.  The Village’s pending RFP may, or may not, call for all of these recommended features. The recommendations have four major themes: traffic-calming features; bicycle lanes and trails for pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians; drainage; and landscaping. Recommendations were as follows. Traffic-calming features. • Major traffic-calming features should be spaced along the street at a distance of approximately 500 feet. This is the approximate distance needed to moderate traffic at the 25 mph speed limit. The need for adequate turning radii into driveways resulted in spacing of traffic-calming features that varied from 500 feet in some segments. • Landscape islands and narrow lanes are the main thematic features for the street. The islands would typically be 10-feet wide, sufficient to grow significantly sized native bushes, if not irrigated, and to include infiltration galleries. The separated travel lanes would narrow down to 20-feet in width, and have ‘choker’ mini-rolled  curbs. The islands create horizontal shift somewhat similar to the chicane, while not creating a true weaving pattern. The 60-foot right-of-way constricts the opportunity for broad, sweeping chicanes, given the desire to also accommodate trails and landscaping (particularly in the steeper ares to the west), while leaving safe lines-of-sight for driveways. Public art can be placed in the landscape islands, subject to Village approval. The village should encourage neighbors and organized groups to adopt islands to help maintain them, thus building community and helping the village. • Speed tables should be installed in two locations where major traffic-calming features are needed, but too little space is available due to driveways. • Choker mini-rolled curbs should be installed to prevent vehicles from using the shoulder and avoiding the table. They are known to better accommodate emergency vehicles compared to speed humps. Each speed table extends 22 feet. At least one speed table needs to be staggered in order to allow drainage down the middle of the street, similar to the speed humps in place. This speed table will require design modification from a normal speed table to accommodate the inverted crown. A speed table can span the street continuously and function more effectively if a grate into a storm drain is located upstream from it. • Regular travel lanes should be reduced in width from the current 12 feet or 13 feet to 11 feet to slow traffic speed and make available additional space for trails and landscaping. The lanes should be demarcated with double yellow center paint linea and white outer paint lines. • While no curb and gutter is planned in this scheme, the vegetative strip adjacent to the street should contain native planting, using a native seed mix similar to what NMDOT routinely uses, and shrubs while leaving a few unplanted shoulder ares designated for use in case of accidents or emergencies. This outer vegetation strip narrows the drivers’ perspective and should help reduce speed. The Village must take care not to allow vegetation to grow too tall and block visibility of the roadway and trails. Some islands and strips should be far enough away from driveways to allow for large vegetation that does not limit needed sight distance. • The crosswalk island and gateway monument located at the Thompson Fence Line will constrict lane width to 10 feet, inform motorists that they are entering the village and caution them to slow down. Some of the crosswalk island extends into Rio Rancho, requiring the City of Rio Rancho’s cooperation. Commercial truck restrictions should be posted at this location. The structures provide safety for pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians who cross the street and enter the trailheads for the Intel Trail and Thompson Fence Line Trail. We recommend a traffic control feature to heighten motorists’ awareness of the trail crossings, such as a radar board. The aesthetic components of vegetation or artwork of these structures demonstrate pride in the Corrales character. Bicycle Lanes and Trails for Pedestrians, Bicyclists and Equestrians. • We propose a 5-foot wide west-bound bicycle lane. A bicycle lane is considered a safer facility than a side path on streets with numerous driveways or cross streets. Commuter and faster recreationist bicyclists prefer a bike lane over a shared pedestrian-bicycle trail.  The bicycle lane should be routed on the outside of the traffic island choker curbs. • We propose two trails: a paved 5--foot trail for pedestrians and bicyclists, and a natural soil horse trail. The south side is more suitable for the bicycle pedestrian and horse trails because it has fewer driveway crossings than the north side (8 compared to 14), is more level and will require less grading or additional retaining structures to accommodate a trail. Without the need to reconstruct the entire street, there is space for  vegetative strips to separate the bike, foot and horse traffic from motor vehicles. Optimally, the street would be moved several feet to the north. If the street would need to be reconstructed, we recommend shifting the centerline approximately two feet to the north. A 5-foot wide paved pedestrian and bicycle trail should be located on the south side of the street. The trail should accommodate walkers and slower, less experienced bicyclists. The pedestrian/ bike trail should comply with ADA, and be usable by wheelchairs as well as bicyclists, although planners expect trail users will be mostly pedestrians. To comply with ADA regulations, the trail should be paved and at least 5 feet wide. The trail will provide an off-street means for bicyclists to descend the hill if they do not want to share the eastbound lane with motorists. Bicyclists should ride slowly because the trail crosses driveways. Driveways will need to be demarcated on the trail with paint; both trail users and those pulling into and out of the driveways must be cautious in this ‘mutual yield’ situation. In some areas, property walls may need to be lowered to improve the light of sight of motorists pulling out of driveways. The paved trail will provide safe walking for residents of the street and accommodate all foot traffic to the Intel and Thompson Fence Line Trails. The equestrian trail can be successfully laid out in an interesting way in the Upper West Meadowlark Lane Charrette Report of September 2013, varying terrain on the north side of the street at places meandering away from the street, at other places steeper than the street. The equestrian trail would be closest to the north right-of-way edge, while generally leaving some vegetative space between the trail and private property lines. This trail would have the greatest variability in its layout within the terrain (steep in places, and possibly routed on terraces) with only one established route in order to retain vegetation and minimize erosion. Natural sand and gravel in the area, but mostly sand, are preferable to crusher fines because horses could churn up the crusher fines, which would not be as durable. This design aspect can be reconsidered. • We propose that both motorized vehicles and bicyclists share the eastbound travel lane with signage and ‘sharrow’ pavement markings. Bicyclists can travel at or near the 25 mile pre  hour speed limit down the hill, a comparable speed for motorized vehicles. Drainage. The inverted crown street design appears to adequately convey stormwater, with the primary exception of flooding one or more houses at the lowest area, which should be addressed site-specifically. Based on anecdotal information from the Village and most charrette participants about the success of this design, the ARC team recommends its retention. Some participants did express a preference for a curb and gutter system. As mentioned, there has been no hydrologic study of the street, so this critical design component could be reconsidered in a future engineering design project. • Infiltration galleries in the landscape island should be used in some landscape islands to provide some capture of stormwater for landscaping and groundwater recharge, while much of the stormwater would  flow through the gallery feature. The Village should select several islands based on needed dimensions and available budget. The island would be designed to be below surface grade, but with curb and side inlets for stormwater drainage. The island would combine plantings of native grasses and shrubs with rocks. To preserve the street pavement, the edges of the island will need a concrete footer. Since infiltration galleries with landscape vegetation are a relatively new and innovative feature in New Mexico, a feasibility study should be conducted to determine their appropriateness and best design in Upper Meadowlark Lane. If irrigation is available, trees could also be planted in selected landscape islands or vegetative strips. • The total right-of-way gains impervious surface area due to the addition of a bicycle trail and paved bicycle-pedestrial trail, even with narrower travel lanes. Most stormwater off the trail should drain into the vegetative strip. • At the bottom of Upper Meadowlark, a grate and storm drain should divert water into the bar ditch flowing north on the west side of Loma Larga Road. This element must be located west of the intersection by roughly 200 feet to intercept stormwater before it can leave the right-of-way and flood private property. The engineering design for the Meadowlark Lane and Loma Larga Road intersection will also address drainage in this area. Consequently, we recommend consideration of this drainage element while an alternative may be chosen. • Property owners at the top of Upper Meadowlark Lane on the north side are responsible for detaining their ‘net new’ stormwater rather than allowing it to flow directly into the street. Modifications on those properties should be made to accomplish this. Landscaping Recommendations. The islands and vegetative strips should have a landscape scheme that accomplishes narrowing drivers’ perspective, thus lowering traffic speeds, enhancing the aesthetics of the street, providing separations of trails, and improving stormwater infiltration.Native bushes should be the primary vegetative palette. Some varieties include: four-wind salt bush (dominant vegetation); chamisa; Apache plume; sagebrush. Bushes planted will require some starter irrigation. Alternatively, trees would be a great component of the streetscape if water line and irrigation were installed. The caliper of tree species selected for the street should be limited in size in order to minimize safety concerns. Native seed mix used by NMDOT may be appropriate for disturbed areas. Adjacent property owners should be asked to collaborate with the Village on final design and maintenance efforts. Public art or sculpture can be displayed in islands. Benches may be installed along trails. Upper Meadowlark and Loma Larga Road intersection. Various recommendations in this plan interface with the design work soon to begin on this intersection. Phasing. We recommend that the Village consider several phasing options. It should be recognized that splitting the Upper Meadowlark Lane project into phases prolongs construction impacts. Results of the 2014 road safety audit for the Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersection ordered by the N.M. Department of Transportation and contracted to HDR Engineering called for a return to the four-way stop, rather than giving Loma Larga drivers unrestricted passage, and later, a traffic circle. At one point, the road safety audit (RSA) completed in 2014 was to be the first step in modifications to the intersection and, presumably, to the rest of upper Meadowlark on up to the Rio Rancho boundary. Proposals are also on the table for better traffic-calming measures along upper Meadowlark and lane (or path) accommodations for bicycle riders, pedestrians and equestrians. In March, Village officials submitted a request to the state highway department to use its Municipal Arterials Program (MAP) funds to engineer and construct pathways, drainage improvements and other amenities for upper Meadowlark. The request was turned down. (See Corrales Comment, Vol.XXXIII, No.3, March 22, 2014 “Upper Meadowlark To Get Improved Drainage.”) That submission followed recommendations from a planning charrette conducted by Architectural Research Consultants, which followed a citizens’ task force named to resolve long-standing conflicts over whether to use the extra-wide Village-owned right-of-way along upper Meadowlark for bike lanes. All of that followed the Village Council’s decision to turn back a 2009 grant of $214,000 from the Mid-Region Council of Governments to construct bike paths along upper Meadowlark.  Residents along Meadowlark for decades have complained about unbearable traffic along their residential street, especially due to vehicles headed to or out of Rio Rancho. Adding bicycle traffic, pedestrians and horses on the road past their homes would only make matters worse, they argued. Neighbor versus neighbor conflicts among upper Meadowlark residents over what, if anything, to do about better using the Village’s 60-foot right of way mellowed over the past 18 months. Meadowlark resident Pam Cox, who chaired the citizens’ task force, was also named to the RSA team, along with Michelle Anderson, a traffic engineer who serves on the Corrales Planning and Zoning Commission, former Village Administrator Chris Allen and Bonnie Bagley, representing equestrian interests. The RSA team also included four engineers from the highway department, two from HDR Engineering and Mid-Region Council of Governments transportation planner Julie Luna, as well as Village Administrator John Avila. In the team’s conclusions section, they present “a wish-list of projects they wanted to be implemented. The projects were separated into two categories: short-term and long-term. The preliminary wish-list for implementation is as follows: “• All-way stop at the intersection (short-term) “• Pavement markings, such as crosswalks and new striping of existing lane layouts (short-term) “• Signs indicating pedestrians, equestrian users and bicycles have right-of-way (short-term) “• Enforcement of existing speed limits and other regulations such as weight limits for heavy vehicles (short-term) “• Flashing beacons with push-buttons (mid-term) “• Detectable Speed Signs (mid-term) “• Pedestrian crossing separate from the intersection (long-term) “ Installation of roundabout (long-term) “• Re-alignment of intersection approaches (long-term).” The report included an illustration of how a traffic circle would be integrated into the Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersection. Found on Page 22 of the report, the illustration superimposes a 100-foot diameter roundabout over an aerial photograph of the intersection.  An alternative to the traffic circle also is illustrated in the preliminary RSA report. Turning lanes could be added to the existing intersection configuration, such as a free right-turn lane from northbound Loma Larga onto eastbound Meadowlark, and a similar continuous right-turn lane from southbound Loma Larga onto westbound Meadowlark. Villagers went around and around about a proposed traffic circle at the Corrales Road-Meadowlark intersection a decade ago and then again about five years ago. The idea collapsed over the amount of property that would have to be taken from nearby landowners to accommodate an appropriate diameter traffic circle (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXVII, No. 1, February 21, 2009 “Corrales To Seek Funds for Meadowlark Traffic Circle.”) Back then, state highway officials were generally skeptical about the value of roundabouts. That attitude seems to have changed as the metro area and the state have gained more experience with them. The Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersection was selected for a road safety audit, as the report notes, after “safety concerns have been brought to the NMDOT by members of the Village of Corrales community and users of the Loma Larga Road/Meadowlark Lane intersection.… Some of the concerns brought to the NMDOT include: “• Vehicle crashes (46 reported from 2008 to 2013); • Loma Larga Road has long stretches  with no traffic control devices (approximately 7,500 feet north of and 6,200 feet south of, the intersection with Meadowlark Lane), leading to increased travel speeds; • Eastbound Meadowlark Lane has very high approach volumes, both in average daily traffic and peak hours; • There are no sidewalks or multi-use trails along either roadway; • Sight distance from eastbound Meadowlark Lane looking onto north and south onto Loma Larga Road is partially restricted due to curves in roadway.” Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Analyst claims HoloLens “sales outlook slipping” -4 by Surur  @mspoweruser Sep 26, 2016 at 20:00 GMT2 months ago Microsoft has been shipping a commercial version of their HoloLens Augmented Reality headset for some months now, but has refrained from releasing any sales numbers. Today analyst company Nomura’s Donnie Teng  in an investor note however complained about weak shipments of the device, and has downgraded supplier Himax, noting that “meaningful volume” of the $3000 headset may not happen until the second half of 2017, and that the sales outlook for HoloLens was slipping. Teng had earlier upgraded the component supplier (who supplies “liquid crystal on silicon,” and “wafer level optics”) on the expectation of better performance of the “the major AR device” and a positive “future AR/VR trend.” Microsoft may not be looking to make the HoloLens a market success by itself, but rather working to establish their Windows Holographic framework as the OS as choice for other AR/VR OEM. Intel recently announced Project Alloy, an all-in-one VR headset powered by Windows Holographic platform. It is a fully untethered headset and it includes CPU, graphics, batteries, and sensors just like HoloLens. It also has Intel RealSense cameras built into it allowing you to see the outside environment. Intel has built this as a reference platform for OEMs allowing them to create new VR/Mixed-Reality hardware powered by Windows Holographic. Intel will open source Project Alloy details by 2H 2017 and some analysts expecting up to 15 devices in H2 2017 running the Windows 10-based OS.

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuMore NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based financial innovation start-up R3 announced on Monday that it and eight banks, including HSBC and State Street, have successfully tested a blockchain platform powered by Intel Corp technology for bond transactions. The platform featured advanced smart contract technology that enabled trading, matching, and settlement of U.S. Treasury bonds, as well as automated coupon payments and redemption, R3 said in a statement. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin, enabling data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its perceived usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. "Our goal at R3 is to bring our members together with the strongest technology players and work collaboratively to evaluate and accelerate this technology to production using real-world use cases," said Tim Grant, chief executive officer of R3's Lab and Research Center. R3 is leading a consortium of more than 60 of the world's largest financial institutions created to develop commercial applications of blockchain technology for the financial services industry. The R3 consortium members involved in U.S. Treasury debt project included CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. The blockchain trial was undertaken at R3's Lab and Research Center. R3, Intel and each of the banks used physical, "non-cloud-based nodes" hosted across the U.S., Canada, Asia, Australia and Europe to interact and simulate U.S. Treasury trading on the blockchain.   (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Alan Crosby) Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Microsoft cuts top Xbox One games by 40% in Black Friday deals The Verge New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech AirSelfie drone is small enough to stow away in a phone case Digital Trends This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Credit Zhejiang Daily / AP Given the recent ubiquity of cyber-scandals—Colin Powell’s stolen e-mails, Simone Biles’s leaked medical records, half a billion plundered Yahoo accounts—you might get the impression that hackers can already break into just about any computer they want. But the situation could be a lot worse. The encryption methods that protect everything from online shopping to diplomatic communications remain effectively impregnable when properly implemented, even if, in practice, there are frequent breaches—whistle-blowers, careless clicks, and so on. This relatively happy state of affairs will not, however, endure. Scientists around the world are inching toward the development of a fully functioning quantum computer, a new type of machine that would, on its first day of operation, be capable of cracking the Internet’s most widely used codes. Precisely when that day will arrive is unclear, but it could be in as little as ten years. Experts call the countdown Y2Q: “years to quantum.” This looming but uncertain deadline hovered in the air at the Hilton Toronto last week, where government officials, cyber-security researchers, and representatives from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel gathered for an international workshop on “quantum-safe cryptography.” Michele Mosca, a professor at the University of Waterloo’s Institute for Quantum Computing and the co-host of the workshop, pegged the odds of reaching Y2Q by 2026 at one in seven, rising to one in two by 2031. But the exact date doesn’t really matter, because the time needed to invent, battle-test, standardize, and roll out new security algorithms Internet-wide might be just as long. Brian LaMacchia, the head of security and cryptography at Microsoft Research, has a working estimate of 2030. “The people who try to build quantum computers, who sit on the floor upstairs from me, said fifteen years last year,” he told me. “So I said, O.K., let’s work backwards from that. And I’m out of time.” Classical computers encode information as a series of bits, which can be either 0 or 1, and then manipulate those bits according to simple rules. A quantum computer isn’t just a faster or better classical computer; it’s fundamentally different. Instead of bits, it stores information as qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at once. That’s a consequence of the quantum-mechanical property of superposition, which allows physical objects to exist in multiple states, or even be in different places, at one time. Thus, two qubits can represent four states simultaneously (00, 01, 10, 11), and a hundred qubits can represent 1.3 quadrillion quadrillion. This quantum peculiarity allows the computer to find patterns in huge data sets very quickly—to get detailed information about a forest without looking at all the trees, as Mosca put it. The main mathematical challenge in breaking current codes is factoring very large numbers, which for classical computers is the equivalent of trying combination after combination to see if it opens a lock. As the keys get longer, the locks get tougher. It took about two years on hundreds of computers to unlock a single instance of the RSA-768 algorithm, which, as its name suggests, requires a key that is seven hundred and sixty-eight bits long. Doing the same for its more secure cousin, RSA-1024, would take about a thousand times longer, and RSA-4096 is effectively out of reach. A quantum computer, on the other hand, would tackle such problems effortlessly. When quantum computing was first proposed, in the nineteen-eighties, it was mostly a theoretical curiosity. That changed in 1994, when Peter Shor, then at A.T. & T.’s Bell Labs, demonstrated how it could apply to cryptography. Once the significance of Shor’s work became clear, the race to actually build a quantum computer became one of the hottest tickets in physics. Among the biggest players was the U.S. government, which by 2007 was spending about sixty million dollars a year on quantum-computing research. It didn’t just want to build one; it also needed to know whether anyone else was getting close. After all, top-secret messages sent today could still be embarrassing or dangerous if they were intercepted and stored, then decrypted by a device built a decade from now. So far, the best quantum computers have just a handful of qubits—five, for example, in a system that I.B.M. announced earlier this year. The company expects to scale up to between fifty and a hundred qubits within the next decade, which would be powerful but still short of the thousand or so that LaMacchia estimates would represent a serious cryptographic threat. (D-Wave Systems, a Canadian company that caused a stir when it announced a thousand-qubit computer last year, uses an alternative approach to quantum computing that isn’t suitable for code-breaking.) This may sound like painfully modest progress after two decades, but it has been steady enough in the past few years to shift the underlying question from if to when. The “Y2Q” handle makes explicit the parallels between the quantum threat and the Y2K bug, which, at the turn of the millennium, was supposed to make the world’s computers think it was 1900 again, bringing civilization to a grinding halt. In the popular imagination, Y2K has become a punch line, a prophecy of doom unfulfilled, like the Maya calendar turned out to be in 2012. But for many of the people at the cryptography workshop—those responsible for establishing international standards for safe computing or signing off on data-security protocols for hundred-billion-dollar companies—Y2K was a relatively minor event only because the hysteria that preceded it mobilized an estimated three hundred to five hundred billion dollars in preventive action by governments and corporations. So far, Y2Q has failed to generate quite that level of interest. One big difference is that it was clear, if inconvenient, what needed to be done to avoid Y2K. The best way to ward off a quantum attack, on the other hand, is still very much up for debate. The simplest approach is basically mathematical: come up with new encryption algorithms that quantum computers can’t break. That doesn’t require big changes in technology, but it’s very hard to know for sure which algorithms will be resistant, until they fail. The other approach is to directly harness the weirdness of quantum mechanics; since the mere act of observing a quantum system freezes it in one state, you can construct sophisticated communications links where it’s impossible, even in theory, to eavesdrop on the message without destroying it or betraying your presence. This approach sounds great, but is far harder (and more expensive) to implement. Both approaches have been making progress in the real world over the past few months. China, for instance, has nearly completed a twelve-hundred-mile fibre-optic “quantum backbone” that will link Shanghai and Beijing, allowing signals to travel from one end to the other without losing their quantum properties. And the world’s first quantum satellite, launched from the Gobi Desert in August, will allow the country to send fully quantum-encrypted messages over much longer distances. For most of the companies and other governments represented at the workshop, though, quantum-resistant algorithms remain the focus. In July, Google announced that it would test a candidate algorithm dubbed New Hope in a small fraction of Chrome browsers. Soon afterward, the National Institute of Standards and Technology put out a public call for input on how it should evaluate such algorithms in the future. The organization may be ready to issue standards in draft form, a NIST cryptographer at the workshop estimated, by 2022 or 2023. Some members of the crowd reacted with audible consternation. In a sense, then, the fundamental question isn’t whether we should do something to prepare for Y2Q. It’s how we balance the seeming necessity of doing something right now with the inconvenient fact that we don’t yet know what to do. The most persuasive answer to this dilemma came from Vadim Makarov, an exuberantly bearded, Hagrid-like figure who heads the University of Waterloo’s Quantum Hacking Lab. He and his colleagues work with companies to test their quantum-cryptography systems before they go public, and have demonstrated that even “theoretically perfect” setups can be hacked when they’re actually implemented—for example, by blinding the receiving device with a bright laser that makes it unable to distinguish between quantum and classical signals. Such vulnerabilities may suggest that quantum-safe systems aren’t yet ready for prime time, but Makarov, during a panel discussion, drew the opposite conclusion. “It’s a bit of chicken-and-an-egg problem,” he said in a thick Russian accent. It will be impossible to know which systems can resist attacks until they’re out there, in the real world, inviting attacks. Waiting for a perfect solution just brings the arrival of a quantum computer closer and closer, at which point it will be too late to fix things. “So, folks, please deploy more,” Makarov said. “We want real hackers, not the toy ones like me and my students.” He smiled, not quite reassuringly.

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: PerformanceTest 9.0 build 1000 Door Bart van Klaveren, maandag 26 september 2016 18:54, 7 reacties • Feedback Bron: PassMark Software PassMark Software, bekend van onder andere BurnInTest en WirelessMon, heeft versie 9.0 van PerformanceTest uitgebracht. Met dit programma kan een computer met daarop Windows XP of hoger aan een reeks benchmarks worden onderworpen. In 32 tests worden de vijf hoofdgroepen, te weten de processor, 2d-graphics, 3d-graphics, opslag en het geheugen, zo objectief mogelijk getest en grafisch tegen een aantal andere systemen afgezet. Daarnaast zijn er zeven extra tests, waarin onder andere virtualisatie en het netwerk onder de loep genomen kunnen worden. In versie 9.0 zijn de volgende veranderingen en verbeteringen aangebracht: Test Changes New DirectX 12 test that runs at a default resolution of 4K (3840x2160). In cases where 4K resolution isn't available the score will be scaled down and the test will run at the highest available resolution. Removed simple DirectX 9 test from 3D test suite. This was removed as DX9 is now fairly old and the simple test wasn't putting much load on newer video cards. CPU extended instructions test will perform testing using sub-tests for FMA, AVX and SSE (or only those that are supported) and take the average of the 3 (or of those that are supported) for the benchmark result. FMA and AVX are new CPU instruction sets that have become available over the last few years in Intel and AMD CPUs. They were designed to make certain mathematical operations faster. Individual sub-test duration has also be adjusted to account the new sub-tests. CPU Physics Test and the Advanced Physics Test have been switched to use the current 'Bullet' physics engine. In the past we were using the Tokamak engine, but Tokamak is no longer maintained. While at the moment GPU acceleration isn't stable in Bullet, we hope to enable GPU acceleration in Bullet in a future patch (limited to integrated GPUs). 2D Graphics, added a Fonts and Text test using Direct2D. This test will launch after the original Font and Text test complete on systems that support Direct2D (Vista and higher). Direct 2D is used by most browser and some other applications for rendering text and web pages. So the new Fonts and Text test result will now be a combination of Direct2D performance and GDI performance. GDI being the traditional method if displaying text and graphics in Windows. While Microsoft advertised Direct2D as being faster than GDI, we found the opposite in most cases. Win10 did bring some Direct2D performance improvements however. DirectCompute (GPU Compute) tests will now run for longer based on the test duration configuration setting. The bitonic test will now run for a length of time corresponding to the duration setting, previously it was set to 100 iterations. Added an OpenCL test to the GPU Compute set of tests GPU Compute bitonic, standard test will launch two instances of bitonic test is there are 2 identical cards in the system (not running in SLI/XFire mode) Advanced Disk Test Added sampling of individual latency results and added support for latency results plotted on the graph as a heat map. New Drive IOPS Test available from "Advanced->Disk->Drive Performance..." menu option. Advanced Memory Test NUMA is now supported where available. Settings are displayed when selecting results to graph. Exported results and graph will now include NUMA settings. Added DX11 Oculus Rift VR test, as an advanced test. This is currently a bit experimental and it has only had limited testing. The test is based on the existing DX11 test (the Lunar landscape test), but has been redesigned slightly to run on an Oculus Rift. Advanced 3D Test Changed how results were displayed and will now display frame latency times. Note: Frame latency is measured from the applications point of view, so doesn't tell the whole story, as the video card can buffer or discard frames. Added button for easy copy of results to clipboard Advanced Direct Compute (GPU Compute) Renamed to GPU Compute Added an OpenCL test Added option for bitonic test to run on all available cards. Previously the test would only run on a single card. Advanced network test, added internet and transfer protocols used to test report output. Also changed the maximum block size of 256KB and set the default to 32KB. The larger block sizes result in less overhead and higher throughput. Advanced Visualized Physics Test Now uses Bullet physics engine (see above) Added a new collection of preset tests, based on the capabilities of the Bullet engine. Ragdoll, compressible objects, friction, rope simulation, etc.. Switched to using OpenGL3 (instead of DirectX) for rendering the scene. Changed max number of shapes to be 30000 (limited by Bullet Physics) Removed Overall FPS display (same as render FPS due to multithreading) Made some changes so GPU Compute tests are now DPI aware and should no longer automatically scale on high DPI monitors User interface changes Totally new look user interface, redesigned with new charts for displaying benchmark data, your result vs the world (using all submitted baselines) and your result vs same hardware model (CPU/Video/RAM/Disk). Added User editable string file allowing for customisation and translation of strings used in PerformanceTest (pt_localization.txt). Nearly all menus and headings can be customised/translated by editing the text file. This will allow future localization of the software into French, Chinese, etc.. Added option to enable/disable heat map plotting in Customization dialog (in the advanced tests) Added real-time temperature collection and display to main 3D window display In system information window physical disks are now displayed in disk number order (as opposed to the SMBIOS order) Added baseline drag and drop loading to main baseline information window, baselines can be dragged form windows explorer into PerformanceTest for loading. Added right-click menu to benchmark graphs for exporting results to clipboard/file Removed "Show numeric results column" from Preferences Temperatures are now updated after corresponding test suite has completed (eg. CPU temperatures updated after running CPU test suite, etc) When RAM manufacturer/part number from the SPD data is not available, use SMBIOS details instead Added mouse over tooltips for advanced memory graphs Added DPI scaling for 2D font test. Previously the test window would be tiny on high DPI displays. Replaced 'Upload baseline' button with checkbox that is checked by default. Checkbox is enabled only if full baseline is available and baseline has not already been uploaded. Replaced some icons with higher quality ones When running a single test a reduced size status window is now displayed Removed Vsync options in main preferences, will now always default to off. Script command will remain and allow it to be changed when running a script. Added German, French, Chinese (simplified and traditional) translation Misc Scripting, added REPORTSUMMARYHTML script keyword to output report in HTML format when using the LOOPS command Scripting, added optional parameter SINGLELINE to commands EXPORTCSV, EXPORTTEXT for outputting the computer's system information and results to one line Added shortened operations descriptions to CSH/HTML/TXT exports (eg M/ops, Mb/s, Fps, etc) Added error message when the number of selected baselines cannot fit on one page when printing Added error message when saving results to image fails due to the image file height being too large (eg too many selected baselines) Added a warning message when submitting a baseline if different video card names were detected as being tested. This is to alert the user and try to prevent situations in systems with low power/high power video cards using the low power card in some tests Support for new CPUs and better identification of AMD graphics card (some AMD card have never identified themselves correctly and only refer to themselves as 'Series 200' or the like). Added export function to export results and graphs to HTML file from drive performance Changed an error message when then DirectX12 test could not be launched Added a delay before launching 3D tests when running a script and using their single test command to prevent monitor resolution switching occurring too quickly and causing errors Scripts will now exit and no longer continue to run if an error occurs during the SETDISK command Changed the behaviour of the Dx9 and DX10 when run from a script, previously they would run for much longer than the duration used for SETDURATION Added network drives to Advanced Disk -> Drive Performance disk selection Changed scripted CSV output to always print test names and results, if no result recorded then output N/A, to allow for easier combination of results from multiple machines Added option to 'Clear chart cache' in Preferences window. All .xml files under ProgramData\Passmark\PerformanceTest9\ChartData\ are deleted. Added a check for Nvidia G-Sync, if detected (and if result seems to be capped at a framerate between 54 and 60) will block basline submission until G-Sync is turned off and 3D tests re-run Changed how script files are processed to better handle the loop command Bug Fixes Fixed some places where files were saved to the local user directories instead of the executable directory when running with command line parameter /p (eg not saving to USB drive as expected) Fixed a bug in the memory read cached test where the buffer size used was in steps from 16KB to 148KB instead of 16KB to 8MB. Test results in this test will now be slightly lower than they were as a result. Fixed baseline search in baseline manager where searches of turbo speed 5001MHz+ were not working correctly Fixed a bug in the Advanced Direct Compute bitonic test where the displayed results were being calculated incorrectly Added some checks to try and avoid a situation where a graphics driver crash could cause an abnormally high Direct2D result Fixed a crash when running Direct Compute test Now closing DirectIO.sys library when PT exists to stop the .sys file being in use until automatically closed. This should avoid an error some people saw on installation that the DirectIO.sys was locked and couldn't be overwritten. Fixed incorrect values for average speed + data transferred when exporting results from the advanced network test Fixed crash in advanced network test if test was started without server being available. Fixed a bug where the ADT_SETEXPORT graph settings were not being read correctly and the graph type was not changing Fixed a bug where DX11 test would often pick a low refresh rate (eg 24hz) Fixed a bug where the "raw disk read" options for the advanced CD/DVD test was unavailable in windows versions newer than XP Fixed some CSV output so "," characters in CPU names no longer break the formatting Test Score Scaling Added 6.5% scale down of CPU Mark so PT9 results are closer to PT8 results, to compensate for the increased scores in the Extended Instructions and Physics test changes. So the PT8 CPUMark should be broadly comparable to the PT9 CPUMark. Same for the overall PassMark rating. Still, when possible, for improved accuracy, compare PT9 results to PT9 results and PT8 results to PT8 results. DX12 test score is penalised if it cannot be run at the desired 4K (3840x2160) resolution. Running at lower resolution increases the frame rate. So the scaling compensates for this. The weighting of the 3D tests was changed due to the removal of the DX9 simple test and the addition of the DX12 test. The DX9 (complex) test is now weighted lower than the other tests (approx. 25% less). Systems that cannot run the DX12 test will received a 20% penalty to the overall 3D mark score.

Will Nvidia graphics in future Macs make AMD green with envy? By Darren Allan Graphics cards   Job ads point to Apple turning away from AMD's discrete GPUs Shares It seems that when it comes to Apple's computers, there may soon be a switch in the company providing discrete graphics solutions, with Nvidia potentially set to step in. While the majority of Macs simply run with integrated graphics courtesy of Intel's processors, those beefier models (or custom configured affairs) which do boast a separate GPU have their pixel-shifting power provided by AMD these days, with Nvidia not having been near an iMac or MacBook Pro for some time now. But all that could be about to change according to some job listings. Bloomberg spotted three adverts for positions at Nvidia which mention Apple, all pertaining to software development for the Mac, with the most telling being a job for a 'Metal Compute and OpenCL Software Engineer for Mac'. The blurb says the successful applicant will be working in partnership with Apple to "define and shape the future of Metal and OpenCL on Mac OS X", (we think perhaps the future might be with macOS rather than OS X, mind you), and he or she will "help produce the next revolutionary Apple products". Mac driver team Another of the listings apparently calls for a software engineer working in the 'Nvidia Mac graphics driver team'. And interestingly enough, we found a job listing in which Apple said it was 'searching for world-class software engineers to join the Nvidia Mac graphics driver team and help produce the next revolutionary Apple products', dating back almost six months. So, it appears the search for staff has been going on for a little while now, and perhaps we could see Nvidia back inside Apple's computers sooner rather than later. That said, a scattering of job listings is hardly concrete evidence for the switch. But if this move is in the pipeline, it would certainly be a blow for AMD, as the company could well do without losing any turf to Nvidia. Nvidia is the dominant force in graphics, and the clear leader when it comes to desktop PCs – the latest figures we've seen put the company on a market share of 77%, with AMD on 23%. However, AMD did actually claw back some share in the last quarter to the tune of 2.5%, which might not sound like all that much, but it is significant in the fact that it's the first gain AMD has made on its rival since 2012.

Google is cooking up a new laptop device codenamed “Bison” and nicknamed “Pixel 3” by employees, say sources speaking to Android Police. This device will run an OS codenamed “Andromeda,” which is said to be a combination of Android and Chrome OS. Think of it like Chrome OS features folded into Android, like a report from 2015 described, not like Chrome OS running Android apps. The Pixel 3 will reportedly be a laptop-style device with a 12.3-inch display that’s less than 10mm thick and supports a tablet mode. However, it’s unknown whether this means that the Pixel 3 will be a convertible device that lets you flip the keyboard behind the display or if the screen will literally detach from the body. When it comes to raw specs, Google is currently planning for an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor, 32/128GB of storage, 8/16GB of RAM, dual USB Type-C ports, stereo speakers, four microphones, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a glass trackpad, a backlit keyboard, and a fingerprint reader. Google also wants to include Wacom stylus support, though the stylus itself would be sold separately. Today’s report does caution that these specs are not set in stone, so the Pixel 3’s internals could look very different when, or if, it does launch. Speaking of launch, Google is reportedly aiming to release the Pixel 3 in Q3 2017. Pricing could start at $799, which is less than the Chromebook Pixel laptops released by Google in the past. This Pixel 3 sounds like a pretty intriguing device. While Google has released its share of Android tablets and Chromebooks, the Pixel 3 could be a full-on laptop device that offers Android’s vast app library with the best features of Chrome OS. Support for a Wacom stylus would be a nice addition and give the Pixel 3 even more work cred.  Unfortunately, today’s report claims that we’re just under a year away from seeing this Pixel 3 launch. Based on what we’ve heard about it so far, would you buy this Pixel 3 device?

IoT space is surely booming in leaps and bounds. However, some questions that need an answer include what all it has in store for us in future? How would IoT affect the way we live? Is IoT the next big thing? If you want to get an answer to any of these questions, this post will enlighten you on the same. Let us first begin by a clarification of the IoT concept. What Is IoT? In simple terms, IoT (Internet of Things) is a technology that enables simple everyday objects with the ability to send and receive data using internet and a sensor. Such devices are becoming very common in everyday lives and people are getting used to them. In layman terms, IoT is a network of physical objects that have sensors attached to them and they are able to connect using internet to a smart phone or other devices. IoT allows us to make any object smart by placing a sensor and internet connectivity to it. IoT also allows devices to be fitted with actuators that turn things on or off automatically under given circumstances. Here is an example to explain the concept. Have a look at the watch. It is a simple object. Now, add a sensor, let’s say heart rate monitor and internet connectivity. Now this watch can connect to a smart phone or other device and provide information on how our heart is functioning.  From Industrial to Consumer Though most of us relate internet connected devices with consumer products, it is actually not the case always. The concept of IoT began mainly with enterprise solutions and that is still a very big but comparatively lesser known part of the picture. AT&T, GE, Cisco, IMB and Intel shaped IIC or Industrial Internet Consortium and have been pushing new ideas through the same since two years. IIC is a nonprofit syndicate that aims to coordinate the structure and foundation of the industrial internet. Since its inception, there has been materialization of a range of connected sensors that collect data in an industrial setting. But how does all this affect enterprise mobility? Enterprise Mobility Earlier, most companies were using enterprise mobility in context of solely messaging and collaboration. However, with time, as capabilities developed, we are seeing enhanced demand for software that supports enterprise apps. There is a foray of opportunities in enterprise app development and developers can surely benefit from the same. Well positioned app developers can unlock valuable sensor and asset data to bring about revolutionary products.  Better association implies enhanced growth It is clearly evident how the growth of IoT will allow businesses to leverage mobile workforce by staying connected to key systems and assets anywhere in the world. Enterprises which are interconnected internally via sensors, internet and smart machinery have an advantage of reducing downtime, gain more insight into their working and this means it can improve the services and products. All this implies better growth opportunities.   IoT enterprise solutions that are already making a mark IoT is being used in environmental monitoring a lot and is giving great results. Remote sensors send information about the quality of air, water and even soil or other atmospheric conditions that are of great help to its users. IoT is being used a lot to improve the warning system for a major seismic event, which helps save countless lives. Another important use of IoT is in energy management. Energy companies are utilizing IoT to sense and communicate current energy generation and usage that allows them to effectively balance and optimize energy levels. Also, some IoT based devices have actuators that turn a device on or off automatically under specific conditions, saving energy and providing comfort at the same time.  What are the other possibilities in IoT apart from wearables? Wearables are no doubt an important part of IoT and are getting a lot of attention in media and advertisements. However, there are endless possibilities in IoT beyond wearable in the enterprise solutions. Enterprise solutions are making our lives easier whether or not we realize the same. AVIS, a car rental company has used IoT and installed sensors of their cars that alert them of over speeding renter. Their system then sends a message to the driver warning them of the same. This is an enterprise solution utilizing IoT.   Another example of enterprise solution to IoT could be a car that sends alerts to the owner when it needs an oil change. What IoT has in store for us? -Evolution will be rapid In the coming years, it is expected that IoT space will evolve at a rapid pace. Experts believe that IoT products will become more cheap, small and fast. It is not a distant dream that they may become so small that we can ingest them and ember them in our bodies. Yes, really! The Apple’s watch is expected to be an altogether an improved device over the coming years.  -Our lives will be affected in every which way We will experience life in a different way altogether with the improvement in obtrusive wearables. Obtrusive wearables which are already in the market like smart glasses will develop further and there will be more such wearables that will disguise their technological components completely. According to Gartner, “biometric sensors will be included in 40% of smart phones shipped to the end user by next year.” There are ample opportunities still left to be explored in this segment.

In addition, 9to5Google also reports that Huawei is working on a new Nexus tablet that will also run the new OS. To be released in Q3 2017 Both outlets report that the new laptop won't be marketed as a Chromebook. Rather, the device is far more ambitious, serving as a fully realized notebook running software that's meant to rival Windows and macOS when it comes to productivity. The notebook will be 10mm thick, have 12.3-inch displays, and will convert into a tablet mode with stylus support. As far as features are concerned, there'll be an Intel processor, two USB-C ports, a backlit keyboard, and a glass trackpad with force detection a la the new MacBooks. As for the new Nexus tablet, details are slimmer, but it will reportedly have a 7-inch display and 4GB of RAM and also run on Andromeda. Evan Blass tweeted earlier this month that the new tablet was on track for the end of the year. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 Crucially, the new Andromeda OS powering the devices looks like the Android-Chrome OS hybrid Google has been working on for some time. The Wall Street Journal and The Verge confirmed last year that the search giant was attempting to fold Chrome OS into its more-dominant mobile cousin, with plans to release hardware running on the OS by 2017. That this new Pixel will potentially see release by this time next year does seem to line up with that original timeline. What's more, 9to5Google also reports that Google is testing the new OS on the recently discontinued Nexus 9. Don't expect to see the "Bison" at next week's Pixel event Does any of this mean observers should expect news about "Bison," the new Nexus, or Andromeda at Google's Pixel event next week? It's complicated. All signs so far show that the event will be devoted to new phones and Android Nougat's next phase, so it's possible the Huawei Nexus will make an appearance. However, Q3 2017 is a long way off. Anything can happen in a year's time, so it's entirely possible Google will push back this clearly ambitious effort. Still, there's every reason to be excited about what Google has planned for computing in years ahead.

UK Retailers Facing One Million Fraud Attempts Per Day ‘We'll Always Have Paris’ – Highlights from ISSE Conference 2016 US Government Releases New IoT Security Guidance Three Arrested After Suspected Insider Breach at Three   News Topics Features Webinars White Papers Events & Conferences Directory Search Infosecurity Magazine Home » News » iOS 10 Flaw Could Expose Backup Data to Hackers 26 Sep 2016 News iOS 10 Flaw Could Expose Backup Data to Hackers Steve Evans Freelance journalist, copywriter and editorial consultant Follow @Evans_Steve Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 10, contains a significant security flaw that could compromise locally-stored device backups, according to a Russian firm that sells iPhone hacking software. According to Elcomsoft, Apple introduced an “alternative password verification mechanism” to iOS 10 that “skips certain security checks” during the backup process. This flaw means Elcomsoft could brute force passwords 2500-times quicker than in iOS 9, severely weakening manual backups carried out via iTunes. Using an Intel i5 CPU, the company was able to guess six million passwords per second. The same CPU targeting iOS 9 backups could only manage 2400 password guesses per second. This new, much weaker password verification method is only present in iOS 10; however, and rather strangely, the older, more secure version that runs on iOS 9 and earlier, is present in iOS 10, Elcomsoft said. Security researcher Per Thorsheim also looked into the flaw, and found that a password hashing algorithm was to blame. “Specifically they have changed from pbkdf2(sha1) with 10,000 iterations into using a plain sha256 hash with a single iteration only,” he wrote. “The change is so devastating that an early cpu-only cracking implementation is almost 40-times faster than a fully optimized GPU implementation for the old pbkdf2 version.” “The interesting question for Apple to answer,” Thorsheim added, “is whether this massive weakening of your security and privacy is intentional, if it is a stupid glitch, or is it clueless crypto/developers?” What’s particularly worrying about this flaw is that it could potentially give hackers access to information stored in a user’s Apple Keychain. This could include passwords, credit card info and Wi-Fi network information. At the moment, this hack appears to be the only way of accessing the Keychain, as iPhones, iPads and iCloud are all considered too secure, Elcomsoft said. “Keychain is Apple’s protected storage that is additionally encrypted on a file level (on top of the already active full-disk encryption that works on a block level). While stored on the device, the keychain is encrypted with a key that is buried deep in Secure Enclave. Even if you can jailbreak a 64-bit iOS device (iPhone 5s and newer), you would still be unable to extract decryption keys for the keychain,” Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin wrote. “Logical acquisition (via password-protected iTunes backups) is currently the only way to extract and decrypt keychain data out of an iOS 10 device,” he added. Apple confirmed to Forbes that it was aware of the issue and was working on a fix. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups.” “We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption,” Apple’s statement added.

ONTAP also gets upgraded, with Azure support for ONTAP Cloud This follows on from the E-Series launch of the entry-level all-flash and hybrid flash/disk E2800 (PDF) earlier this month, aimed at midsized businesses and remote offices. That has a pay-as-you-grow scheme for adding capacity. Sunnyvale claimed that the E2800 offers best-in-class performance - up to 300,000 IOPS - at the lowest acquisition cost for an all-flash array. There are six new mainstream NetApp arrays and we'll start with the AFF flash fliers. The two new AFF arrays use Samsung’s 15TB SSDs, which provide a 4x capacity increase at the entry and old mid-range levels. We understand that the A300 replaces the AFF8040 and AFF8060 with the AFF700 replacing the AFF8080 EX. New hybrid FAS9000, FAS8200 and FAS2600 arrays replace the current FAS2500 and FAS8000s. All these systems scale up but are built to scale-out with clustering from 2 to 24 AFF and/or FAS nodes. Naturally a new generation of Intel CPUS is used for the controllers. For the AFF A700 and FAS9000 - there are two Broadwell 18-core processors per controller; so 72 cores per high -availability (HA) pair. The AFF A300 and FAS8200 get two 16-core Broadwells, 32 cores per HA pair. At the low end of the new FAS product line the FAS2620 and FAS2650 get two 6-core Broadwells, 12 cores per HA pair. Re-tapping ONTAP ONTAP, the AFF and FAS operating system, gets a refresh to v9.1 which offers: FlexGroup – a massively scalable, high-performance NAS container for the latest generation of applications in the EDA, high-tech, oil and gas, and media and entertainment industries. It scales a single container up to 20PB and 400 billion files. Volume Encryption – granular, volume-level, software-based encryption for data on any type of drives across AFF, FAS, or ONTAP Select systems. ONTAP Cloud support for Microsoft Azure on top of existing AWS support. ONTAP Select now supports all-flash commodity servers. ONTAP v9 is available as a base bundle and a premium bundle (FlexClone, SnapMirror, SnapVault, SnapRestore, SnapCenter and SnapManager) with separate optional software; OnCommand, SnapLock and FlexArray virtualisation of third-party storage. New All-flash FAS systems We have the new AFF A300 mid-range and AFF A700 high-end system with configuration flexibility through a modular design. This is said to ease servicing and prepare the way for future upgrades. These systems deliver up to twice the performance at half the latency, compared with the previous generation of AFF systems, with setup in under 10 minutes. A 24-node AFF cluster can deliver more than 7 million IOPS. NetApp claims the new AFF arrays reduce SSD storage use by five to 10 times on average with inline data reduction technologies. Compared to the old AFF arrays (see table below) the new ones have increased flash capacity, memory and NVRAM, also greater host connectivity bandwidth. NetApp points out that its AFF line uses Samsung 3D V-NAND and is the first all-flash array to support (Samsung) 15TB SSDs. These two AFF boxes are also the first to use multi-stream write (MSW) SSDs, which improve SSD write performance and SSD endurance through better garbage collection techniques. The new AFF arrays support 32Gbit/s Fibre Channel, with 8 ports for the A300 and 32 for the AF700; 24 and 64 16Gbit/s FC ports are supported respectively. On the Ethernet front, 40GbitE, 8 and 32 ports respectively, and 32 and 64 10GbitE ports respectively are supported. They also have 4 and 20 PCIe expansion slots respectively. AFF A300 Details of the A300 (with the AFF8040 numbers in brackets) are; Max SSD - 384 (384) Max raw capacity - 5.9PB (1.47PB) Effective capacity - 24PB (6.1PB) Max memory - 256GB (64GB) Controller - 2 controllers in 8U chassis (6U) Details of the A700 (with the AFF8060 numbers in brackets) are; Max SSD - 480 (480) Max raw capacity -7.3PB (1.84PB) Effective capacity - 30PB (7.63PB) Max memory -1,024GB (128GB) Controller - 2 controllers in 8U chassis (6U) The AFF8060 also came with dual enclosure HA: 2 controllers and 2 IOXMs in two 6U chassis for a total of 12U. How does the A700 compare to the existing AFF8080 EX? It’s very close in flash capacity: 7.3PB vs 7.4PB for the 8080 EX, but the A700 has four times more memory and double the NVRAM capacity of the 8080 EX, so it'll chew through the flash-stored data faster. For NAS scale-out the new AFFs support 1-24 nodes (12 HA pairs), the same as before, with 1-12 nodes (6 HA pairs) for SAN scale-out; it was 1-8 nodes for the previous AFF arrays. Multi-stream writes A Samsung note [PDF] says “To reclaim free space, garbage collection activity copies user data to new storage blocks and erases invalid data storage blocks, thereby allowing the media to store new write data. “However, garbage collection processing decreases both SSD read and write performance. In addition, garbage collection increases write amplification because individual host data write requests can result in multiple internal SSD writes to the NAND medium. Here, valid data is first read from a media block about to be erased, then rewritten to another media storage block, accompanied by the write to store new host data. Consequently, write amplification decreases SSD lifetime because each NAND chip can endure a certain number of writes before it begins to fail.” MSW sidesteps this: "Streams are host hints that indicate when data writes are associated with one another or have a similar lifetime. That is, a group of individual data writes are a collective stream and each stream is given a stream ID. Because the data within an erase block has a similar lifetime or is associated with one another, there is a greater chance that an entire erase block is freed when data is deleted by a host system. “A multi-stream SSD improves Write throughput up to 9x over a legacy SSD [and] the ... endurance can potentially be more than 3x of a legacy SSD.” Neat. MSW is implemented in Samsung’s PM953S NVMe SSD, by the way. Fresh FAS systems FAS2600 There are four new FAS boxes, and these replace the current low-end/mid-range FAS2500 (2520, 2552, and 2554) and high-end FAS8000 (8020, 8040, 8060, 8080 EX) arrays; FAS2620 for small business FAS2650 for mid-size business FAS8200 for enterprise-scale workloads FAS9000 for business-critical use-cases The FAS8200 and FAS9000 replace the existing FAS8000 line. That has FAS8020, 8040, 8060 and 8080 EX models. We’d suggest the FAS8200 replaces the FAS8020 and 8040, with the FAS9000 superseding the FAS8060 and 8080 EX. FAS2600 The FAS2600 range has up to 3x the performance of the previous FAS2500 generation. There are two systems: 2620 and 2650, which are quite similar. Both scale up to 144 drives (the same maximum as the FAS2500), 1TB of NVMe Flash Cache, 64GB of ECC memory, 8GB of NVRAM (4GB before) and a 24TB Flash Pool (16TB before). They can have up to eight unified target adapters (UTA 2s - IO ports) and four 10GbitE ports, both of which can also be used for cluster interconnectivity. The differences are that the 2620 controller has 12 large form factor drives and the 2650 twice that number; 24. Also, and oddly, the 2650 maxes out at 1,243TB of raw capacity and the 2620 at 1,440TB – a small difference really. The prior FAS2500 topped out at 1,152TB capacity, not that much less. NetApp says the 2620 is geared toward value-oriented, larger capacity deployments, suitable for secondary workloads and backup targets, smaller organisations, remote offices, and local storage. The 2650 is equipped for higher performance needs, suitable for mid-size businesses and distributed sites of larger organisations, Windows applications and virtual server consolidation with multiple workloads. Users can convert their FAS2650 and FAS2620 systems to an external disk shelf if they upgrade to larger NetApp systems. FAS8200 FAS8200 The FAS8200 is a larger beast with up to 50 per cent more performance than the prior generation: Max raw capacity - 4,800TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 480/480 Max NVMe Flash Cache - 4TB Controller form factor - 3U ECC memory - 256GB NVRAM - 16GB Max Flash Pool - 48TB Onboard I/O: UTA 2 - 8 10GbitE ports - 4 12Gbit/s SAS - 8 FAS9000 The new FAS9000 has a modular design and scales up to up to 14PB in a system and out to 172PB in a cluster, virtually the same cluster maximum as the current FAS8080 EX, which scales up to 11.5PB in a single system. As with the A700 the modular design is said to simplify servicing and enable simplified future upgrades. FAS9000 Its maximum capacity is three times higher than the FAS8200’s and it boasts more memory, NVRAM, and a larger Flash Pool: Max raw capacity - 14,400TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 1,440/480 NVMe Flash Cache - 2 - 16TB Controller form factor - 8U ECC memory - 1,024GB NVRAM - 64GB Max Flash Pool - 144TB PCIe expansion slots - 20 NetApp says the FAS9000 has 20 expansion slots to support 12Gbit/s SAS, 40GbitE, and 32Gbit/s FC IO, as well as 10GbitE and flexible 4-port UTA2 adapters for both Ethernet and FC connectivity. Many of the new systems will be offered as Express Packs, for simplified configuration selection and quoting. NetApp talks of improving its pricing structure. The new systems will be introduced with simplified software packaging - see ONTAP section above - and more competitive capacity-based pricing. This across the board major FAS/AFF/ONTAP news represents a solid refresh of NetApp's core product range. It should please FAS adherents as well as helping to continue NetApp's flash resurgence with much more capacious and performant A300 and A700 systems. Pricing is not yet available. All the new systems will ship in the final 2016 quarter. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Woah: NetApp is number two in the all-flash market, says IDC First quarter 2016 numbers show firm climbing past Pure, HPE and IBM 14 Comments IDC, IDC, o crystal ball.

FAS8200 FAS8200 The FAS8200 is a larger beast with up to 50 per cent more performance than the prior generation: Max raw capacity - 4,800TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 480/480 Max NVMe Flash Cache - 4TB Controller form factor - 3U ECC memory - 256GB NVRAM - 16GB Max Flash Pool - 48TB Onboard I/O: UTA 2 - 8 10GbitE ports - 4 12Gbit/s SAS - 8 FAS9000 The new FAS9000 has a modular design and scales up to up to 14PB in a system and out to 172PB in a cluster, virtually the same cluster maximum as the current FAS8080 EX, which scales up to 11.5PB in a single system. As with the A700 the modular design is said to simplify servicing and enable simplified future upgrades. FAS9000 Its maximum capacity is three times higher than the FAS8200’s and it boasts more memory, NVRAM, and a larger Flash Pool: Max raw capacity - 14,400TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 1,440/480 NVMe Flash Cache - 2 - 16TB Controller form factor - 8U ECC memory - 1,024GB NVRAM - 64GB Max Flash Pool - 144TB PCIe expansion slots - 20 NetApp says the FAS9000 has 20 expansion slots to support 12Gbit/s SAS, 40GbitE, and 32Gbit/s FC IO, as well as 10GbitE and flexible 4-port UTA2 adapters for both Ethernet and FC connectivity. Many of the new systems will be offered as Express Packs, for simplified configuration selection and quoting. NetApp talks of improving its pricing structure. The new systems will be introduced with simplified software packaging - see ONTAP section above - and more competitive capacity-based pricing. This across the board major FAS/AFF/ONTAP news represents a solid refresh of NetApp's core product range. It should please FAS adherents as well as helping to continue NetApp's flash resurgence with much more capacious and performant A300 and A700 systems. Pricing is not yet available. All the new systems will ship in the final 2016 quarter. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register NetApp shrinks headcount yet again Hundreds axed in another round of layoffs 3 Comments Tiery-eyed NetApp previews on-prem storage and cloud tie-up FabricPool takes Data Fabric further with dynamic data movement to AWS 5 Comments NetApp gives Data Fabric a little nip, tuck and some filler A dose of digital Botox for hybrid cloud ideas 4 Comments NetApp is hyped about its under-wraps hyper-converged system Gear said to be still in development 6 Comments Woah: NetApp is number two in the all-flash market, says IDC First quarter 2016 numbers show firm climbing past Pure, HPE and IBM 14 Comments Solidfire is 'for people who **CKING HATE storage' says NetApp Founder Dave Hitz VMWORLD 2016 Apologises for 'screw-up' of slow move to Flash 8 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to Come Out Next Year Sporting a Power-Efficient and Very Powerful Kaby Lake Processor, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 27, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 will complete its one-year market cycle next month that is why rumors about its successor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, have been making the rounds on the internet heavily for the past couple of months. While the Redmondian company would like nothing but to launch the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in October this year, reports have it that Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, which Microsoft intends to use for its hybrid laptop-tablet line, is still due for mass production before the end of the year. Thus, it seems logical to assume that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out to the market sometime next year although no exact date has been given thus far, reports Yibada. The Intel Kaby Lake processor is reported to be a power-efficient and very powerful processor that could double the performance of the hybrid laptop-tablet. One of the major problems of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, when it was launched last year, was its poor battery. The Intel Kaby Lake processor, in effect, fixes the battery issue on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 right off the bat, notes the University Herald. Other notable features The latest iteration of Microsoft’s hybrid laptop-tablet line shall also be sporting a USB Type-C port, which has become the standard in modern day devices to allow for speedy data transfer. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall also be sporting a 4K Ultra HD display with an option for a lower-end variant with a 2K display. The devices shall feature 16GB of RAM, a rear-facing 16-megapixel camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing snapper. There are rumors saying that Microsoft would be holding an event in October but it will not be launching any of the next generation Surface devices nor the much-rumored Surface Phone. Instead, the Redmondian company will be launching an all-in-one PC together with a revamped Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. The rumored all-in-one PC will be the company’s center of focus at next month’s event and it would be tagged as the device to turn users’ desktops into studios. However, all these remain as speculations pending the official confirmation from Microsoft so it should be taken with a pinch of salt. The best just got better When the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 came out in October last year, it was regarded as perhaps the best device ever to come from the Redmondian company. With the combination laptop tablet about to mark its one-year market cycle next month, rumors and speculations are starting to get louder on the impending arrival of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, which would make the best even better. High among the rumored features of the Surface Pro 5 is its next-generation processor from Intel, which accordingly is to be called as Kaby Lake. More than the name of the processor, what’s really interesting is the fact that Intel actually used 14-nanometer technologies in designing the Kaby Lake processor which means that it is more high-tech and more advanced. As such, it is also expected that the Kaby Lake processor shall bring about more impressive features for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The Kaby Lake processor was announced by Intel on August 30, 2016, but it began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of this year. However, mass production is not expected to commence until late this year. The speculations about the impending arrival of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 also started gaining traction when retail prices of the Surface Pro 4 started dropping in a number of retail stores last month. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 received a price cut of $280 on account of a 50-hour sale that concluded on August 20. Based on the previous rumors, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall reportedly come out with a 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) panel screen. It is also reported to feature a USB Type-C port, which has become the norm in modern devices because of its very fast data transfers.

At the weekend 2K Games and developer Firaxis announced they had locked down the minimum and recommended specifications for the game on PCs. If you expected low-ish spec system requirements you would have been correct, both the minimum and recommended sets of specs are quite light. Part of this is down to the development work and testing done "to ensure Civilization VI is as optimized as it can be". You can look through and compare the minimum and recommended specs above. Interestingly, many Intel Skylake chips (with integrated HD Graphics 530) should comfortably beat the minimum GPU performance required. That's good for those who might like to play Civilization VI on a laptop or ultra-compact desktop. Civilization VI is available to pre-order online now but only becomes playable post-launch (21st October). Steam has several game/hardware combinations on offer. It is selling both the regular (£50) and digital deluxe (£70) versions of the game with and without the Steam controller bundled (with a 15-18 per cent discount on controller bundles). The Digital Deluxe version includes a 25th anniversary soundtrack download and access to four post-launch DLC packs. Pre-orders also qualify for the free Aztec Civilisation pack. Please note that 90 days after the game launches the Aztec pack will become freely available to all. Limited 25th Anniversary Edition of Civilization VI For eager Civilisation fans, 2K announced the 25th Anniversary Edition of Civilization VI this weekend. This is a physical retail product limited to 20,000 copies. It includes everything in the Digital Deluxe version, plus the Aztecs, a 25th anniversary coin set, a display case, and a 100-page hardcover art book entitled 'Civilization Through the Years'. All in specially themed packaging, as shown below.

With that in mind, it’s no surprise that Apple’s latest iteration of their flagship laptop is hugely anticipated. However, Apple fans might not have to wait much longer to get their hands on the new MacBook Pro, with a reveal and release date expected next week. The new 2016 model of the MacBook Pro was largely rumored to be making an appearance at an Apple event next week, with an analyst now confirming that will be the case. Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, spoke to Forbes about Apple’s newest MacBook Pro model. The widely trusted analyst confirmed that Apple will be refreshing their 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro models. She also added that IHS was predicting a launch in late September or October 2016. However, with only a few days left in September, Alexander revised the prediction to confirm that the new MacBook model will materialize next week. When is MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 2016: Arriving? Probably Soon @mbrookec @Forbes https://t.co/U8t6bJuwhd pic.twitter.com/tdyXQASvvU — Rob Shiveley (@RobShiveley) September 25, 2016 Perhaps the most interesting revelation, however, is that alongside the aforementioned new MacBook Pro models, Apple is also expected to refresh their MacBook Air lineup with a new 13.3-inch variant. That’s something of a surprise considering Apple was widely expected to be dropping the MacBook Air line in favor of the revised MacBook model. Alongside when the new MacBook Pro model will be available to purchase, Alexander has also been predicting what specs she expects to see inside the new models. As it stands, Alexander believes that it’s unlikely Apple will include the new Intel Kaby Lake chip in their models, given the timing of the laptop’s production. With that in mind, IHS is predicting that Apple will opt for the slightly older Skylake processor. That being said, there’s always a chance Intel could have brought forward production of Kaby Lake for the new MacBook Pro. There’s also been a good deal of speculation that Apple plans to up the graphical performance of their MacBook Pro line with AMD’s latest graphics cards. However, Rhoda Alexander was quick to quash those rumors, claiming that it would be incredibly unlikely for Apple to opt for an AMD GPU. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3xxnPAnvE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES IN INQUISITR: Apple Freely Released iPhone 6S Launch Weekend Sales But Hoarding iPhone 7 Figures MacOS Sierra Features: Apple’s Newest Operating System Releases Today — Should You Upgrade? MacBook Pro 2016: Apple Event In October, Release Date And Rumors The new 2016 MacBook Pro is expected to be Apple’s biggest update to their signature laptop yet. According to Bloomberg, the new MacBook Pro will be packed into a thinner form factor, closer to that of the standard MacBook and MacBook Air models. That being said, whilst the new MacBook Pro variants are expected to be thinner than their predecessors, they’ll still retain the series’ signature design. Apple apparently has no plans to bring a tapered design to the Pro models as it stands, as we’ve seen with other MacBook models. What could be the new MacBook Pro 2016's OLED Touch Display as designed by Martin Hajek! https://t.co/KNueScvkkx pic.twitter.com/x8a4Yo6krU — Luis M. Gochoco (@lgochoco93) September 23, 2016 The other big standout feature of the 2016 MacBook Pro will be an OLED function bar. Apple has been rumored for a while to be replacing the function keys on the MacBook Pro with an OLED display that adapts to what users are doing on the laptop. Despite still being a speculative feature, that hasn’t stopped fans from creating mock-up designs that foreshadow what that new OLED function bar will look like physically. Similarly, Apple is expected to bring the new USB-C type ports to the 2016 MacBook Pro and Touch ID. If IHS Markit Technology is correct with their prediction, the new 2016 model MacBook Pro will be revealed by Apple next week. If that’s the case, the new laptop should be available in Apple stores across the globe by the end of October.

Just jailbreak iOS Apple is brewing a fix to patch an iOS password flaw that allows credentials to be stolen from backups. Elcomsoft researcher Oleg Afonin says the flaws mean cracking efforts against iOS 10 backups are 2500 times faster compared to similar efforts against iOS 9. If successful, the attack will grant access to device keychains. The latest iOS released earlier this month allows six million passwords to be attempted each second compared to 2400 a second against iOS 9, using an Intel i5 processor. Afonin conducted his research using a commercial tool. Apple says in a statement it will address the flaws in an upcoming security update, adding that it did not affect iCloud backups. Afonin says Apple devices are highly secure and his work is one of the last avenues available to attackers should they be able to obtain a local device backup. "Apple smartphones are secure. iOS is also secure, and gets tougher with each subsequent generation," Afonin says. "Forcing an iPhone or iPad to produce an offline backup and analysing resulting data is one of the very few acquisition options available for devices running iOS 10. "At this time, logical acquisition remains the only acquisition option available for iPhone 5s [and newer] running iOS 10 that offers access to device keychain." Image: Thorsheim. PasswordsCon and security boffin Per Thorsheim (@thorsheim) says Apple moved to a weaker algorithm. "Apple have moved from pbkdf2 (sha1) with 10,000 iterations to a plain sha256 hash with a single iteration only," Thorsheim says. Afonin is now working on an attack optimised for much more efficient GPU systems. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 17 Comments More from The Register Artificial intelligence will eradicate channel drudgery, says Lenovo boss Canalys Channels Forum 2016 Any intelligence would be a start, grumble partners 16 Comments It's Friday – and that means one thing: Yup, Microsoft's TypeScript 2.0 is out JavaScript superset adds new features including non-nullable types and read-only properties 16 Comments Reg readers cluster in pub to ponder artificial intelligence Reg Events And hear why a mic-dropping, beer hurling AI would be a real advance 3 Comments White House to bring us up to speed on artificial intelligence hype latest Will AI kill or cure? 11 Comments Hey! spies!

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 DRAM Desktop Memory Designed for High-Performance Overclocking on Intel X99 Motherboards Vengeance LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation, and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for performance potential. The DDR4 form factor is optimized for the latest Intel X99 Series motherboards and offers higher frequencies, greater bandwidth, and lower power consumption than DDR3 modules. Vengeance LPX DDR4 modules are compatibility-tested across X99 Series motherboards for reliably fast performance. There's XMP 2.0 support for trouble-free automatic overclocking. And, they're available in multiple colors to match your motherboard, your components, or just your style. Compatibility Tested Across X99 Series Motherboards for Reliably Fast Performance Part of our exhaustive testing process includes performance and compatibility testing on most every X99 Series motherboard on the market – and a few that aren't. Designed for High-Performance Overclocking Each Vengeance LPX module is built from an eight-layer PCB and highly-screened memory ICs. The efficient heat spreader provides effective cooling to improve overclocking potential. Pure Aluminum Heat Spreader for Faster Heat Dissipation And Cooler Operation Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the Vengeance LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system's cooling path, so you can push it harder. The heat spreader doesn't just allow Vengeance LPX to run better… the aggressive yet refined form factor looks great in showcase systems. XMP 2.0 Support for Trouble-Free, Automatic Overclocking Manually pushing your DRAM frequency can be a fun experiment, but sometimes you just want to get maximum performance without the hassle. Intel X99-based motherboards support the new XMP 2.0 standard, and Vengeance LPX DRAM does, too. Turn it on, and it will automatically adjust to the fastest safe speed for your Vengeance LPX kit. You'll get amazing, reliable performance without lockups or other strange behavior. Low-Profile Design Fits in Smaller Spaces When the first Mini-ITX and Micro ATX motherboards for DDR4 are released, Vengeance LPX will be ready. The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium. Available in Multiple Colors to Match Your Motherboard or Your System The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. Vengeance LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard, your other components, your case - or just your favorite color. Designed for Enthusiasts. Backed by Corsair.

Reuters/Shannon Stapleton In case Surface Pro fans are expecting a Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in 2016, they may be disappointed. Even though the company has not revealed anything yet about the highly-anticipated device, rumours and unconfirmed reports are all suggesting a 2017 release. The hybrid laptop is expected to be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor and hence is getting delayed as the chipsets will be available from end of 2016. As per techradar, Microsoft won’t release the Surface Pro 5 until and unless it has run the device on the Kaby Lake processor and has become comfortable with the 14-nanometre architecture. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to have the USB Type-C port for rapid charging and faster data transfer. It may also sport an Ultra HD 4K display, 16GB RAM and 16MPrear/8MP front cameras, writes YIBADA. Moreover, the Windows 10 Redstone 2 update is not expected till spring 2017 and that is yet another reason why Microsoft is pushing back the Surface Pro 5 release date to 2017. Microsoft will be holding an event in October and this has led some tech enthusiasts to believe that the Surface Pro 5 may be released or at least announced then. However, this too seems unlikely as the company may be focussing on releasing an all-in-one PC and a revamped Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. It is rumoured that the all-in-one PC will turn users’ desktops into studios. Thus, the neither the Surface Pro 5 nor the Surface Phone may make it to the 2016 release list. Experts believe that the wait is worth it as the upcoming Surface Pro could be a revolutionary device with the best of specs clubbed into one. Fans are expecting to at least mention the device in the October event. Meanwhile, it is impossible to know whether the information reported is true or not.

Reuters/Stephen Lam It has been revealed that Apple is currently refreshing its 13.3-inch MacBook Air and it is very much possible that the product may be released in October. Of course, inclusion of the Intel Kaby Lake processors in Apple MacBook Air 2016 seems unlikely if the device is released in October. Apart from the Skylake processors, Apple may also consider AMD’s latest “Polaris” graphics processors. “Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air ... Given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel's] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely,” Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, told Forbes. If Apple is at all trying to revamp the MacBook Air 2016, it may face a problem with the Skylake chipset as the Cupertino-based tech giant emphasises on graphics to a great extent these days. In case Apple implements the Skylake processor, the MacBooks will get stuck to the older processor designs for months and this may go against the company. It has been previously reported that Apple has a number of releases lined-up and after the release of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it is now eyeing October to release a few Mac products. This updated product line also includes the MacBook Air 2016. This kind of ends rumours that Apple is planning to drop the Air line. As per NDTV, Apple could also be bringing the 5K display this October. If that is the case, then the 5K display technology may also be brought to the Apple MacBook Air 2016. In fact, the inclusion of this technology will infuse fresh enthusiasm in Apple fans for the Air line. Apple has still not released any official information on MacBook Air 2016.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 09.25.16. 09.25.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 pm. 7:00 pm Microsoft Bets Its Future on a Reprogrammable Computer Chip Prototype hardware for Project Catapult, a six-year effort to rebuild Microsoft's online empire for the next wave of AI---and more. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED It was December 2012, and Doug Burger was standing in front of Steve Ballmer, trying to predict the future. Ballmer, the big, bald, boisterous CEO of Microsoft, sat in the lecture room on the ground floor of Building 99, home base for the company’s blue-sky R&D lab just outside Seattle. The tables curved around the outside of the room in a U-shape, and Ballmer was surrounded by his top lieutenants, his laptop open. Burger, a computer chip researcher who had joined the company four years earlier, was pitching a new idea to the execs. He called it Project Catapult. Doug Burger. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED The tech world, Burger explained, was moving into a new orbit. In the future, a few giant Internet companies would operate a few giant Internet services so complex and so different from what came before that these companies would have to build a whole new architecture to run them. They would create not just the software driving these services, but the hardware, including servers and networking gear. Project Catapult would equip all of Microsoft’s servers—millions of them—with specialized chips that the company could reprogram for particular tasks. But before Burger could even get to the part about the chips, Ballmer looked up from his laptop. When he visited Microsoft Research, Ballmer said, he expected updates on R&D, not a strategy briefing. “He just started grilling me,” Burger says. Microsoft had spent 40 years building PC software like Windows, Word, and Excel. It was only just finding its feet on the Internet. And it certainly didn’t have the tools and the engineers needed to program computer chips—a task that’s difficult, time consuming, expensive, and kind of weird. Microsoft programming computer chips was like Coca Cola making shark fin soup. The current incarnation of Project Catapult. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Burger—trim, only slightly bald, and calmly analytical, like so many good engineers—pushed back. He told Ballmer that companies like Google and Amazon were already moving in this direction. He said the world’s hardware makers wouldn’t provide what Microsoft needed to run its online services. He said that Microsoft would fall behind if it didn’t build its own hardware. Ballmer wasn’t buying it. But after awhile, another voice joined the discussion. This was Qi Lu, who runs Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Lu’s team had been talking to Burger about reprogrammable computer chips for almost two years. Project Catapult was more than possible, Lu said: His team had already started. Today, the programmable chips that Burger and Lu believed would transform the world—called field programmable gate arrays—are here. FPGAs already underpin Bing, and in the coming weeks, they will drive new search algorithms based on deep neural networks—artificial intelligence modeled on the structure of the human brain—executing this AI several orders of magnitude faster than ordinary chips could. As in, 23 milliseconds instead of four seconds of nothing on your screen. FPGAs also drive Azure, the company’s cloud computing service. And in the coming years, almost every new Microsoft server will include an FPGA. That’s millions of machines across the globe. “This gives us massive capacity and enormous flexibility, and the economics work,” Burger says. “This is now Microsoft’s standard, worldwide architecture.” Catapult team members Adrian Caulfield, Eric Chung, Doug Burger, and Andrew PutnamClayton Cotterell for WIRED This isn’t just Bing playing catch-up with Google. Project Catapult signals a change in how global systems will operate in the future. From Amazon in the US to Baidu in China, all the Internet giants are supplementing their standard server chips—central processing units, or CPUs—with alternative silicon that can keep pace with the rapid changes in AI. Microsoft now spends between $5 and $6 billion a year for the hardware needed to run its online empire. So this kind of work is “no longer just research,” says Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft’s CEO in 2014. “It’s an essential priority.” That’s what Burger was trying to explain in Building 99. And it’s what drove him and his team to overcome years of setbacks, redesigns, and institutional entropy to deliver a new kind of global supercomputer. A Brand New, Very Old Kind of Computer Chip In December of 2010, Microsoft researcher Andrew Putnam had left Seattle for the holidays and returned home to Colorado Springs. Two days before Christmas, he still hadn’t started shopping. As he drove to the mall, his phone rang. It was Burger, his boss. Burger was going to meet with Bing execs right after the holiday, and he needed a design for hardware that could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms on FPGAs. Putnam pulled into the nearest Starbucks and drew up the plans. It took him about five hours, and he still had time for shopping. Burger, 47, and Putnam, 39, are both former academics. Burger spent nine years as a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, Austin, where he specialized in microprocessors and designed a new kind of chip called EDGE. Putnam had worked for five years as a researcher at the University of Washington, where he experimented with FPGAs, programmable chips that had been around for decades but were mostly used as a way of prototyping other processors. Burger brought Putnam to Microsoft in 2009, where they started exploring the idea that these chips could actually accelerate online services. Project Catapult Version 1, or V1, the hardware that Doug Burger and team tested in a data center on Microsoft’s Seattle campus. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Even their boss didn’t buy it. “Every two years, FGPAs are ‘finally going to arrive,’” says Microsoft Research vice president Peter Lee, who oversees Burger’s group. “So, like any reasonable person, I kind of rolled my eyes when this was pitched.” But Burger and his team believed this old idea’s time had come, and Bing was the perfect test case. Microsoft’s search engine is a single online service that runs across thousands of machines. Each machine is driven by a CPU, and though companies like Intel continue to improve them, these chips aren’t keeping pace with advances in software, in large part because of the new wave in artificial intelligence. Services like Bing have outstripped Moore’s Law, the canonical notion that the number of transistors in a processor doubles every 18 months. Turns out, you can’t just throw more CPUs at the problem. But on the other hand, it’s generally too expensive to create specialized, purpose-built chips for every new problem. FPGAs bridge the gap. They let engineers build chips that are faster and less energy-hungry than an assembly-line, general-purpose CPU, but customizable so they handle the new problems of ever-shifting technologies and business models. At that post-holiday meeting, Burger pitched Bing’s execs on FPGAs as a low-power way of accelerating searches. The execs were noncommittal. So over the next several months, Burger and team took Putnam’s Christmas sketch and built a prototype, showing that it could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms about 100 times faster. “That’s when they really got interested,” says Jim Larus, another member of the team back then who’s now a dean at Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne. “They also started giving us a really hard time.” Tech Titan Architectures The Epic Story of Dropbox’s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire Netflix Isn’t Made for the US Anymore—It’s for the Whole World Intel Reinvents Itself to Stay King in a Changing World The prototype was a dedicated box with six FPGAs, shared by a rack full of servers. If the box went on the frizz, or if the machines needed more than six FPGAs—increasingly likely given the complexity of the machine learning models—all those machines were out of luck. Bing’s engineers hated it. “They were right,” Larus says. So Burger’s team spent many more months building a second prototype. This one was a circuit board that plugged into each server and included only one FPGA. But it also connected to all the other FPGA boards on all the other servers, creating a giant pool of programmable chips that any Bing machine could tap into. That was the prototype that got Qi Lu on board. He gave Burger the money to build and test over 1,600 servers equipped with FPGAs. The team spent six months building the hardware with help from manufacturers in China and Taiwan, and they installed the first rack in an experimental data center on the Microsoft campus. Then, one night, the fire suppression system went off by accident. They spent three days getting the rack back in shape—but it still worked. Over several months in 2013 and 2014, the test showed that Bing’s “decision tree” machine-learning algorithms ran about 40 times faster with the new chips. By the summer of 2014, Microsoft was publicly saying it would soon move this hardware into its live Bing data centers. And then the company put the brakes on. Searching for More Than Bing Bing dominated Microsoft’s online ambitions in the early part of the decade, but by 2015 the company had two other massive online services: the business productivity suite Office 365 and the cloud computing service Microsoft Azure. And like all of their competitors, Microsoft executives realized that the only efficient way of running a growing online empire is to run all services on the same foundation. If Project Catapult was going to transform Microsoft, it couldn’t be exclusive to Bing. It had to work inside Azure and Office 365, too. The problem was, Azure executives didn’t care about accelerating machine learning. They needed help with networking. The traffic bouncing around Azure’s data centers was growing so fast, the service’s CPUs couldn’t keep pace. Eventually, people like Mark Russinovich, the chief architect on Azure, saw that Catapult could help with this too—but not the way it was designed for Bing. His team needed programmable chips right where each server connected to the primary network, so they could process all that traffic before it even got to the server. The first prototype of the FPGA architecture was a single box shared by a rack of servers (Version 0). Then the team switched to giving individual servers their own FPGAs (Version 1). And then they put the chips between the servers and the overall network (Version 2).WIRED So the FPGA gang had to rebuild the hardware again. With this third prototype, the chips would sit at the edge of each server, plugging directly into the network, while still creating pool of FPGAs that was available for any machine to tap into. That started to look like something that would work for Office 365, too. Project Catapult was ready to go live at last. Larus describes the many redesigns as an extended nightmare—not because they had to build a new hardware, but because they had to reprogram the FPGAs every time. “That is just horrible, much worse than programming software,” he says. “Much more difficult to write. Much more difficult to get correct.” It’s finicky work, like trying to change tiny logic gates on the chip. Now that the final hardware is in place, Microsoft faces that same challenge every time it reprograms these chips. “It’s a very different way of seeing the world, of thinking about the world,” Larus says. But the Catapult hardware costs less than 30 percent of everything else in the server, consumes less than 10 percent of the power, and processes data twice as fast as the company could without it. The rollout is massive. Microsoft Azure uses these programmable chips to route data. On Bing, which an estimated 20 percent of the worldwide search market on desktop machines and about 6 percent on mobile phones, the chips are facilitating the move to the new breed of AI: deep neural nets. And according to one Microsoft employee, Office 365 is moving toward using FPGAs for encryption and compression as well as machine learning—for all of its 23.1 million users. Eventually, Burger says, these chips will power all Microsoft services. Wait—This Actually Works? “It still stuns me,” says Peter Lee, “that we got the company to do this.” Lee oversees an organization inside Microsoft Research called NExT, short for New Experiences and Technologies. After taking over as CEO, Nadella personally pushed for the creation of this new organization, and it represents a significant shift from the 10-year reign of Ballmer. It aims to foster research that can see the light of day sooner rather than later—that can change the course of Microsoft now rather than years from now. Project Catapult is a prime example. And it is part of a much larger change across the industry. “The leaps ahead,” Burger says, “are coming from non-CPU technologies.” Peter Lee. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED All the Internet giants, including Microsoft, now supplement their CPUs with graphics processing units, chips designed to render images for games and other highly visual applications. When these companies train their neural networks to, for example, recognize faces in photos—feeding in millions and millions of pictures—GPUs handle much of the calculation. Some giants like Microsoft are also using alternative silicon to execute their neural networks after training. And even though it’s crazily expensive to custom-build chips, Google has gone so far as to design its own processor for executing neural nets, the tensor processing unit. With its TPUs, Google sacrifices long-term flexibility for speed. It wants to, say, eliminate any delay when recognizing commands spoken into smartphones. The trouble is that if its neural networking models change, Google must build a new chip. But with FPGAs, Microsoft is playing a longer game. Though an FPGA isn’t as fast as Google’s custom build, Microsoft can reprogram the silicon as needs change. The company can reprogram not only for new AI models, but for just about any task. And if one of those designs seems likely to be useful for years to come, Microsoft can always take the FPGA programming and build a dedicated chip. A newer version of the final hardware, V2, a card that slots into the end of each Microsoft server and connects directly to the network. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Microsoft’s services are so large, and they use so many FPGAs, that they’re shifting the worldwide chip market. The FPGAs come from a company called Altera, and Intel executive vice president Diane Bryant tells me that Microsoft is why Intel acquired Altera last summer—a deal worth $16.7 billion, the largest acquisition in the history of the largest chipmaker on Earth. By 2020, she says, a third of all servers inside all the major cloud computing companies will include FPGAs. It’s a typical tangle of tech acronyms. CPUs. GPUs. TPUs. FPGAs. But it’s the subtext that matters. With cloud computing, companies like Microsoft and Google and Amazon are driving so much of the world’s technology that those alternative chips will drive the wider universe of apps and online services. Lee says that Project Catapult will allow Microsoft to continue expanding the powers of its global supercomputer until the year 2030. After that, he says, the company can move toward quantum computing. Later, when we talk on the phone, Nadella tells me much the same thing. They’re reading from the same Microsoft script, touting a quantum-enabled future of ultrafast computers. Considering how hard it is to build a quantum machine, this seems like a pipe dream. But just a few years ago, so did Project Catapult. Correction: This story originally implied that the Hololens headset was part of Microsoft’s NExT organization. It was not. Go Back to Top.

The RADV Radeon Vulkan Linux Driver Continues Picking Up Features Written by Michael Larabel in Radeon on 25 September 2016 at 04:29 PM EDT. 10 Comments It has been about two weeks since last reporting on "RADV" Radeon Vulkan activities, but development hasn't let up and there has been several feature commits since then on this open-source Vulkan Linux driver for Radeon AMDGPU-interfacing hardware. For those not following David Airlie's "semi-interesting" Mesa branch, some of the highlights since I last talked about it on Phoronix include: - Wayland support for RADV. - There's also Xlib WSI support (windowing system integration). - Some changes for helping to bring-up Southern Islands support on this driver. - Compute shader based resolves. - Enabling HiZ by default. And there has been various other changes and fixes, including porting of some more code over from Intel's "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver. The updated TODO list also gives a better look at the overall RADV state. So far RADV continues making much progress with AMD having not yet open-sourced their Vulkan Linux driver. It's still sounding like AMD might just work towards open-sourcing bits relevant to RADV where this community-originated driver may end up being the long-term default open-source Radeon Vulkan driver. It will be interesting to see when it's integrated into mainline Mesa. I will probably do some fresh RADV vs. AMD Radeon Vulkan benchmarking in a week or two once the Linux 4.9 development kicks off with the merging of the new DRM-Next features. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Civilization 6 to Release Soon, Fans Can Buy the Special Anniversary Edition, AI Leaders to Make the Game Interesting Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 26, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Civilization 6 will launch next month, and 2K Games has released the system requirement for the PC. The fans are busy trying to figure out what improvements need to be made to their PC, in order to support the game. 2K Games thanked the fans for cooperating with them and the developers Firaxis. The game developers had taken a lot of time to ensure that Civilization 6 was optimized. The minimum requirement for the PC is Windows 7 64BIT or 8.1 64BIT or 10 64BIT. The CPU should be Intel Core 13 2.5 GHZ or an AMD PHENOM 11 2.6 GHZ. The PC should have a basic 4 GB RAM with 12 GB hard drive. The system needs a DVD-ROM for the installation disc. A 1 GB DX 11 video card is a must. The basic requirement of the graphics card is either an AMD 5570 or an NVIDIA 450. While these are the minimum requirements of Civilization 6, they aren’t the recommended system requirements. The demands of the Civilization 6 system requirement are very low as compared to games like Mafia III and Battlefield 1. 2K Games along with Firaxis decided to launch the Anniversary Edition of Civilization 6. The special edition is priced at $90. The Anniversary Edition will have limited copies with only 20,000 of these available in the market. The special edition contains the new game along with the content featured in the digital deluxe. The bundle includes the Aztec civilization preorder bonus. The players also receive a special 25th-anniversary coin set and display case. There is also a 100-page Civilization Through the Years hardcover art book. The special edition comes with a special packaging themed around the anniversary celebration. Created by Sid Meier, the game debuted in 1991 and had continued to be highly popular over the years. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary, Meier released a statement saying that he hopes that the players enjoy the world that they have created with the new features. The Aztec civilization pre-order pack will be available for free for everyone three months after Civilization 6 launches on 21st October. The deluxe edition would give the players access to four expansion packs with new maps, scenarios, civilizations, and leaders. The countdown to Civilization 6 has started, and Firaxis decided to provide the players with a glimpse of the different leaders in the game. The latest culture to be brought into the game in Rome with Trajan as the leader. It is interesting to note how Civilization 6 brought in Trajan instead of Caesar and Augustus, to be the ruler of Rome. Trajan was responsible for the greatest military expansion of Rome. With him as the leader, fans are hopeful that Civilization 6 will deal with Rome’s most significant phase of expansion. The other civilizations included in the game include Kongo, Greece, Germany, India and Spain to name a few. The AI in Civilization is what makes it interesting. Firaxis has incorporated AI leaders in Civilization 6, and they help the player understand their strategies and actions better, by talking to them. To make the leaders more distinctive in Civilization 6, the developers have given each AI a hidden agenda. Until the previous installments, the cities in the game have taken only one title irrespective of the number of buildings and wonders. Civilization 6 updated this particular feature. The game split the cities across multiple tiles and different districts. Building the districts involves a lot of strategies. The players have to decide where each district will go and which titles they will reserve for farming. Civilization 6 provides bonus points to the players who place districts close to certain things.

Technology 6 0 0 September 25, 2016 Will The Microsoft Surface Book 2 Really Be Released With The 2016 MacBook Pro This Fall? Daryl Deino There are many rumors going around that Microsoft will releases the Surface Book 2 earlier than expected in order to compete with the new MacBook Pros, which are said to be released in the fourth quarter of 2016. According to a site called University Herald, Microsoft is getting ready to announce the updated Surface Book. “Looks like a good news for gadget freaks as Microsoft is gearing up to launch its next-generation device, the Surface Book 2 during the company’s October event along with the Surface Pro 5. Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil its new flagship offerings next month.” When will the Surface Book 2 arrive? [Image by Daryl Deino] The beginning of the article, like other similar ones announcing the Surface Book 2, could just be clickbait. After all, the article goes on to state that the Surface Book 2 is more likely to hit the store shelves in Spring 2017, when Redstone 2, the second important update to Windows 10, is released. It also believed that Microsoft will wait for the newly released Kaby Lake processors to be in full supply, which they will be by the beginning of 2017. Besides, after several updates, Microsoft has recently made the first Surface Book a usable device that was marred with many glitches upon its release. When Microsoft first released the Surface Book in October of 2015, CNET gave it four stars. “The Microsoft Surface Book packs high-end components, including new Intel processors and optional Nvidia graphics, into a smart, slim body. Some components and most of the battery are hidden in the base, so the tablet half is lighter. The high-res screen looks great, and the included stylus pen is excellent.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvgfMOOA-kk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> However, CNET, as well as others, noted that there were some first generation bugs, and some buyers said their Surface Book was almost unusable until this past spring. Some of the problems included poor battery life, an unresponsive touchpad, and display driver difficulties. Since the Surface Book was a first generation product, it’s doubtful that the Surface Book 2 will be as problematic upon its release date. According to Vine Report, the next generation Surface Book looks to be a great upgrade. “Microsoft is set to release a new Surface Book, called the Surface Book 2, and it is expected that the device would be delivering improvements on both its hardware and design. In terms of power and specs, it is expected that the upcoming Surface Book 2 laptop/tablet hybrid would be running under the new Intel Kaby Lake series of chipsets.” The article adds that Microsoft will also be ditching the hinge that caused a lot of problems with the first generation device, even though Microsoft had claimed the hinge was necessary to separate the screen from the rest of the notebook. It will be replaced with a more refined Dynamic-Fulcrum hinge. Others say that at least one version of the Surface Book will have a 4K screen and a higher-end version that will be VR-capable. There is certainly a lot of excitement for the Surface Book 2 on Twitter. Would love to see a @surface book 2 with a gtx1060 or better. Crikey I'd want that bad… — Robert Smith (@vijilKiwi) August 29, 2016 I want it, but I also want to wait for the Surface Book 2; and also don't have lots of money. https://t.co/exLmKpQHzX — Josh Fields (@partiallypro) May 3, 2016 Microsoft Surface Book 2 latest news: Laptop rumored to launch in October and released… https://t.co/7Wyqmaydfa pic.twitter.com/j2fWlMH6H2 — Las Vegas NV Blog (@LasVegasNvBlog) September 18, 2016 Microsoft will face a lot of competition from Apple, who is said to be releasing the updated 2016 MacBook Pro soon. Apple hasn’t significantly upgraded the MacBook Pro since 2012, and according to Bloomberg, that is all about to change. “Apple Inc. is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales,” says columnist Mark Gurman, who adds that the updated notebooks will be thinner, will include a touch screen strip, and contain more powerful and efficient graphics processors. The 2016 MacBook Pro is scheduled to be released either in October or November. If Microsoft does release the Surface Book 2 at the same time, consumers will have a lot of great options. Which notebook are you looking forward to the most — the Surface Book 2 or the 2016 MacBook Pro? Let us know in the comments section.

The center is funded by a five-year, $24 million award from the National Science Foundation, and includes renowned scientists from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and UC Berkeley. It will tackle major scientific challenges in the physical sciences, life sciences and engineering. The project addresses a critical national need for imaging science to enable scientific breakthroughs and technological advances at an important time for the United States to remain competitive in science and technology, Miao said.Seven UCLA professors are participating, including deputy director and co-principal investigator Jianwei “John” Miao, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and member of UCLA’s California NanoSystems Institute. CU Boulder physics professor Margaret Murnane is the director and principal investigator. Miao said that the work of the center, known as Strobe because of its use of stroboscopes for imaging, will integrate several approaches and technologies — including photon and electron-based imaging, advanced algorithms, big data analysis and adaptive imaging — to deal with issues that have the potential to transform imaging science and technology. Recent major advances by the participating scientists in electron, X-ray and optical nano-imaging have paved the way for achieving the project’s multidisciplinary goals. “We will push each imaging technique to its limits, as well as develop improved new approaches,” Miao said. “Physicists, mathematicians, chemists and biologists from UCLA will work closely with leading experts from University of Colorado, Boulder, and UC Berkeley to establish Strobe as a world-class imaging center.” UCLA undergraduate and graduate students will have an opportunity to participate in the research, he said, adding that students trained in imaging science are needed in all areas of science and advanced technology. The center also plans to develop world-class engineers, scientists and leaders of industry; educate a diverse group of students for STEM careers; develop STEM programs to educate high school science teachers and students; and engage in knowledge transfer with industry. Additional UCLA faculty members participating in the project are Pietro Musumeci and Chris Regan (physics and astronomy), Stanley Osher (mathematics), Jose Rodriguez (chemistry and biochemistry), Shimon Weiss (chemistry and biochemistry, and physiology) and Z. Hong Zhou (microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics). UC Irvine, Fort Lewis College in Colorado and Florida International University will also participate. Industrial partners are Intel, IBM, Semiconductor Research Corporation, GlobalFoundries, Anasys, Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, ASML and KMLabs. “UCLA is an international leader in state-of-the-art imaging, which will greatly benefit California and the United States,” said Miguel García-Garibay, dean of the UCLA Division of Physical Sciences. “Under the leadership and remarkable scientific achievements of John Miao, UCLA will continue to set the highest standards of research, education and the transfer of major advances from the laboratory to industry, where they will benefit the public.” NSF science and technology centers conduct “innovative, potentially transformative, complex research and education projects” involving world-class research through partnerships among academic universities and industrial organizations in important areas of basic research, the NSF stated. “They have catalyzed breakthroughs, built bridges of exchange with industry, spun off new technologies and businesses, and trained young scientists and engineers.” “From deepening our understanding of intelligence to developing energy-efficient electronics and next-generation polymers, NSF’s Science and Technology Centers have stood at the forefront of discovery and innovation,” said Suzi Iacono, head of the NSF Office of Integrative Activities. Miao’s research work includes development of a powerful tomography method to image three-dimensional positions of individual atoms. In a new article, published Sept. 23 in the journal Science, Miao and colleagues review recent advances produced by interdisciplinary science that make it possible to determine the three-dimensional atomic structure of crystal defects and non-crystalline materials with high precision. The work, Miao said, offers clues on how to modify and engineer materials that will improve performance of technological devices and likely lead to breakthroughs in fields ranging from electronics to energy conversion. ► Watch a Nature video about Miao’s research.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology Windows 10 will soon run Edge in a virtual machine to keep you safe Application Guard extends Virtualization Based Security to protect against browser flaws. by Peter Bright - Sep 26, 2016 11:08 pm UTC Login to bookmark 106 Untrusted sites get a minimal set of Windows Platform Services and no access to the rest of the system. Microsoft ATLANTA—Microsoft has announced that the next major update to Windows 10 will run its Edge browser in a lightweight virtual machine. Running the update in a virtual machine will make exploiting the browser and attacking the operating system or compromising user data more challenging. Called Windows Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge, the new capability builds on the virtual machine-based security that was first introduced last summer in Windows 10. Windows 10's Virtualization Based Security (VBS) uses small virtual machines and the Hyper-V hypervisor to isolate certain critical data and processes from the rest of the system. The most important of these is Credential Guard, which stores network credentials and password hashes in an isolated virtual machine. This isolation prevents the popular MimiKatz tool from harvesting those password hashes. In turn, it also prevents a hacker from breaking into one machine and then using stolen credentials to spread to other machines on the same network. The Edge browser already creates a secure sandbox for its processes, a technique that tries to limit the damage that can be done when malicious code runs within the browser. The sandbox has limited access to the rest of the system and its data, so successful exploits need to break free from the sandbox's constraints. Often they do this by attacking the operating system itself, using operating system flaws to elevate their privileges. Credential Guard's virtual machine is very small and lightweight, running only a relatively simple process to manage credentials. Application Guard will go much further by running large parts of the Edge browser within a virtual machine. This virtual machine won't, however, need a full operating system running inside it—just a minimal set of Windows features required to run the browser. Because Application Guard is running in a virtual machine it will have a much higher barrier between it and the host platform. It can't see other processes, it can't access local storage, it can't access any other installed applications, and, critically, it can't attack the kernel of the host system. In its first iteration, Application Guard will only be available for Edge. Microsoft won't provide an API or let other applications use it. As with other VBS features, Application Guard will also only be available to users of Windows 10 Enterprise, with administrative control through group policies. Administrators will be able to mark some sites as trusted, and those sites won't use the virtual machine. Admins also be able to control whether untrusted sites can use the clipboard or print. Microsoft recognizes that this feature would be desirable on consumer machines, too, and not just for Edge. Other browsers such as Chrome would also benefit from this kind of protection. So too would Office's "Protected Mode" that's used for opening documents from untrusted sources. However, doing this has certain complexities. Currently, virtualized sites can't store persistent cookies, for example, because virtual machines get destroyed when the browser is closed. This may be acceptable for a locked-down enterprise environment, but it isn't a good fit for consumers. There are also compatibility constraints. VBS installs the Hyper-V hypervisor. This requires a processor with hardware virtualization support, and it also requires I/O virtualization (such as Intel's VT-d) to protect against certain known attacks. This means that some systems in the wild won't support it. There are also software concerns; only one hypervisor can be installed at a time, which means that a machine that's running Hyper-V cannot also run VMware Workstation or Virtual Box, say, or software that uses virtualization behind the scenes, such as the Bluestacks Android-on-Windows software. This virtualization also likely comes at some performance cost, although Microsoft is not saying just what that performance cost is right now. Nonetheless, this use of virtualization to harden a system is an exciting move. Experimental and special-use systems such as Qubes OS have used virtualization in a similar way, but are far from mainstream offerings. Microsoft is uniquely positioned take this kind of capability mainstream. Application Guard will become available later this year in Insider builds of Windows, hitting a stable version some time in 2017.

Linux Kernel 4.4.22 LTS Brings ARM and EXT4 Improvements, Updated Drivers GO All users of Linux 4.4 LTS are urged to update Sep 26, 2016 21:20 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Immediately after announcing the release of Linux kernel 4.7.5, renowned kernel developer and maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman informed the community about the availability of Linux kernel 4.4.22 LTS. Linux kernel 4.4.22 LTS is the twenty-second maintenance update of the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel series, which is currently used in several top-notch GNU/Linux operating systems, including the popular Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus). According to the diff from the previous release, Linux kernel 4.4.21 LTS, and the appended shortlog, Linux kernel 4.4.22 LTS is here to change a total of 132 files, with 886 insertions and 449 deletions. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.4.22 kernel. All users of the 4.4 kernel series must upgrade," says Greg Kroah-Hartman in the release announcement. "The updated 4.4.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.4.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary."

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (38) Post your comment Google's alleged Pixel 3 laptop might be the future and death of Chromebooks 26 September 2016 For all whopping success with smartphones, Google never managed to get huge in the laptop realm. The long-standing Chromebook program can attest that this is not due to lack of trying, but for one reason or the other (and many have been cited over the years), the web-centric approach to mobile productivity is yet caught on. Today, some interesting insider info was brought forward that offers a sneak peek at how the search titan is planning to attack the sector yet again. Apparently, Google is working on a new device within an internal project codenamed "Bison". The tech in question is allegedly a laptop, or perhaps a 2 in 1 convertible that Google is planning to out some time in Q3 next year. A "Pixel 3" moniker has also been suggested, which even in itself hints that we are talking about a successor, or perhaps more correctly, a replacement for the Chromebook family. One in line with the ongoing "Pixel" rebranding. But it is not just the name that gives the intentions away. Apparently, the device will also be the ambassador to a brand new Google OS - Andromeda. Again, the title is a major giveaway here. Remember how Chrome OS promised support for Android apps, but never quite made good on that promise? Well, Andromeda appears to have taken the opposite approach - burn in proper Chrome support into Android. The source is also confident that this is a totally separate effort from Chrome OS and the ARC project as a whole. "Bison" and "Andromeda" are said to be much larger and higher-level undertakings. It is definitely too early to speculate on any feature set for the new OS, but it does sound exciting. Furthermore, given the current state of Android with its flourishing app ecosystem, it really makes more sense to put that experience first on a new mobile productivity platform and then add Chrome to the mix. Plus, since Android 7 Nougat already has a Free Form windowed mode baked in, Andromeda less work to do with the desktop GUI department. We got a few specs for the Pixel 3, too. However, these are entirely preliminary and if "Bison" even survives to a final release, are likely to change. Still, it is said to feature a 12.3-inch display, backlit keyboard, glass trackpad with haptic feedback and force detection and a battery good for up to 10 hours of use, all inside a razor-thin 10mm body. An Intel Core m3 or Core i5 will to power the laptop or perhaps both variants will exist. Storage should range from 32GB to 128GB with 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Other mentioned features include a USB Type-C port, 3.5mm jack, a fingerprint reader, stereo speakers, quad microphone setup, as well as a Wacom pen accessory. The latter will be offered separately. Finally, we have early price estimate. It puts the Pixel 3 at $799 in the lower end. Again, this is likely to change at some point. It is also quite likely for us to see a teaser or perhaps even a sneak preview of the Pixel 3 and/or Andromeda at Google's October 4 event. However, as already mentioned, a release is still some time away. Source Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPhone 7 is all anyone can talk about right now but Apple may still have more goodies to release before the year is up. Analyst Rhoda Alexander, Director of Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, believes the Cupertino company will release refreshes of its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops this fall—likely in October. If you’ve been following the rumors surrounding Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro, the idea of a new laptop launching soon isn’t exactly new. A Bloomberg report in August claimed the company is gearing up to launch a revamped MacBook Pro with an OLED display above the keyboard, something apparently known internally at Apple as a “Dynamic Function Row.” The same Bloomberg report said the refreshed MacBook Air would include a USB-C port, while an updated iMac would feature a new graphics chip. Rhoda says production for Apple’s devices began in the second quarter of this year, which could mean Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor won’t be included in the new models. Kaby Lake was announced about a month ago, although the chips began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs during the second quarter of 2016, so it’s still possible. October is just around the corner, so invites to an Apple event should go out any day now.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Android + Chrome = Andromeda; merged OS reportedly coming to the Pixel 3 Details leak: Google is reportedly planning a launch device for its new operating system. by Ron Amadeo - Sep 26, 2016 6:55 pm UTC Login to bookmark 67 Andrew Cunningham It has been almost a year since The Wall Street Journal dropped a bomb of a scoop on the Android community, saying Chrome OS would be "folded into" Android. The resulting product would reportedly bring Android to laptops and desktops. According to the paper, the internal effort to merge these two OSes had been underway for "roughly two years" (now three years) with a release planned for 2017 and an "early version" to show things off in 2016. It seems like we're still on that schedule, and now Android Police claims to have details on the new operating system—and its first launch device—coming Q3 2017. First up, we've got a host of new code names to throw at you. The hybrid OS is apparently called "Andromeda." Besides being the name of a galaxy, it's probably meant as a geeky portmanteau of "Android" and "Chrome." Google also has a launch device cooking for Andromeda, which is officially codenamed "Bison"—Android Police says this is the unofficial codename of "Pixel 3." "Pixel 3" is a reference to the "Chromebook Pixel" (Google's flagship laptop line for Chrome OS), but since this edition isn't running Chrome OS, you can't really call it a "Chromebook" anymore. We've seen Android and Chrome OS slowly come together in various ways recently, with Chrome OS gaining the ability to run Android apps and Android snagging Chrome OS' dual partition update system. It's easy to see the hybrid OS reports as an overhyped version of these products, but Android Police says Andromeda is a "completely distinct effort" from what is currently public. "Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android not vice versa" the report says. "It would be more accurate to say Bison [AKA the Pixel 3 laptop] will run Android [rather] than Chrome OS." Android Police also has a spec list, which it says is "very much subject to change." Even still, these figures provide an idea of what Google is planning. Bison is a 12.3-inch convertible laptop, but the report isn't sure if that means a Microsoft Surface Book-style detachable screen or a Lenovo Yoga-style fold-over keyboard. Internally, according to Android Police, there will be "an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM," and the competing specs suggest the device will come in multiple configurations. For ports and extras, there are supposedly two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm jack, a fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, quad microphones, a backlit keyboard, and a glass trackpad. The report claims the device is 10mm thick and will support a Wacom stylus, which will be sold separately. The supposed release date for the Pixel 3 lines up nicely with the original Wall Street Journal report: Q3 2017. Android Police says it will start at $799. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 Again, that Wall Street Journal report from a year ago promised an "early version" of the merged OS for 2016. A year is a long time, and plans might have changed, but Google's October 4 event is sounding like a good place for a sneak peek. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's SVP of Android, Chrome OS, and Google Play, has been hyping up Google's upcoming event in the strongest possible terms. He says we'll be talking about Google's October 4 event eight years from now—basically promising an event of historical significance. The event promises to see the unveiling of Google's Pixel phones, and rumors indicate we'll also see the launch of Google's new hardware product line, including Google Home, a "Google Wi-Fi" router, a 4K Chromecast, and a "Daydream" VR headset. Other than Google Home and the VR headset, these are all yearly updates to products Google currently makes (some with new brand names). That collection would not live up to the "historically significant" benchmark set by Lockheimer's tweet. Executives overhype things all the time, of course. But if you're looking for an event that would be on the same scale as the launch of Android, the launch of another new OS from Google certainly fits the bill.

The collaboration will likely produce a VR One unit supporting the Rift headset rather than a completely new backpack PC.More Earlier this month, Micro-Star International teased the VR One during the Tokyo Game Show gaming convention. It is a PC that customers wear on their back, enabling full freedom of movement when playing virtual reality games. The backpack is the result of a collaboration between MSI and HTC to optimize the VR experience for the Vive headset. Now Oculus VR is reportedly wanting to work with MSI to produce a similar PC-based backpack optimized for the Rift. The news arrives by way of unnamed “industry” sources who claim that Oculus VR is in talks with MSI about a backpack PC. Instead of an entirely new backpack PC, Oculus VR and MSI are likely collaborating to optimize the VR One for the Rift headset, thus MSI would sell two versions of its VR One using the same hardware: one best used for the Rift and one optimized for the HTC Vive. Related: Oculus Touch costs even more in the U.K., which may negate Rift’s price advantage These industry sources believe that the collaboration between MSI and Oculus VR will help the latter company expand into the gaming notebook sector. MSI has already teamed up with HTC to sell bundles consisting of gaming notebooks and the HTC Vive headset and the talks likely include similar bundles packing the Oculus Rift. The Vive-based bundles are expected to hit store shelves in October. Sources believe the increased presence of Oculus VR in the gaming notebook market will put a lot of pressure on HTC. As it stands now, the first-generation commercial release of the Oculus Rift costs $600 whereas the first-generation HTC Vive headset costs a meatier $800. That makes the Oculus VR device a bit more reasonable price-wise although the headset is still somewhat expensive. Development of the Oculus Rift essentially set the current consumer-based VR industry on its path. The HTC Vive popped up not long after the Rift became a kit for developers, backed by Valve Software and its Steam digital distribution platform. The competition between the two is somewhat fierce, with the Rift serving as the ‘first’ modern commercial VR headset in development and the Vive backed by a popular PC gaming platform. Both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive can be found bundled with desktop PCs. However, the headsets are less likely found with gaming laptops given their mobile nature. The PC stuffed into MSI’s VR One packs a high-end Intel Core i7 processor and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics chip. The unit relies on two hot-swappable batteries promising up to 90 minutes of gameplay and weighs just under eight pounds with the batteries installed. On the connectivity front, the VR One provides four USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI port, one Mini DisplayPort, one USB Type-C port supporting Thunderbolt 3, a microphone jack, and a headphone jack. The recommended specs for the Oculus Rift include three USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, and one HDMI 1.3 port, thus the VR One has the headset covered. Hardware-wise, the Rift demands 8GB of system memory, an Intel Core i5-4590 equivalent or greater processor, and a graphics card equivalent to or better than the Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290. The MSI VR One PC backpack is slated to arrive in the United States in October. Again, there is a good chance we will see two separate units supporting the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, so stay tuned.

Google’s rumoured Andromeda operating system is reportedly an Android/Chrome operating system hybrid. While the Huawei-made tablet won’t necessarily feature Nexus branding, several sources have confirmed to Android Police that this will likely be the case. Andromeda is likely an effort by Google to bring Android apps to Chromebooks, often referred to as Project Bison. Google reportedly wants the ultra-thin Pixel 3 to support a tablet mode, though hasn’t confirmed whether the laptop is foldable or detachable device as of yet. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 The Pixel 3 will likely include a 12.3-inch display and will be powered by the Intel m3 or an i5 processor. Android Police reports that the device will likely feature either 32GB or 128GB of storage, with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, suggesting that the device could come in two models. It will also feature two USB-C ports and a 3.5 mm headphone jack — obviously opting not to follow Apple’s lead by dropping the 3.5mm jack in the iPhone 7. The Pixel 3 will come with several unconfirmed sensors, stylus support, stereo speakers, quad microphones, backlit keyboard, glass trackpad (similar to the Macbook) and a ten-hour battery life. Google’s planned pricing for the Pixel 3 is $799, though that, along with the specs, is subject to change before the projected Q3 2017 release.

I was under the impression that chrome OS apps were being replaced by Android apps. Why switch to a traditional laptop form factor (track pad/keyboard) when nothing will support it?

The report from AndroidPolice cites "two independent and reliable sources" as confirming the company's plans for the new device, said to be nicknamed 'Pixel 3'. Google will reportedly release the laptop, officially known internally as 'Bison', as soon as Q3 2017. But what makes this particular hardware special is the claim that it will be the first device to feature Google's combined Android/Chrome OS platform, known as 'Andromeda'. AndroidPolice says it is 'extremely confident' that this will be the case, and that the Pixel 3 will not be branded as a Chromebook. Related: iPhone 7 Google has recently made certain Android apps available on its Chrome OS desktop platform, but Andromeda is thought to be a distinct project. The company has long-been promising a combination of its two operating systems, and is expected to reveal more about the project at the Pixel and Pixel XL launch event next week. Andromeda is said to involve combining Chrome features into Android, rather than vice versa. The report itself is, of course, unconfirmed by Google, and is likely to remain that way. AndroidPolice says its sources are 'legitimate and trustworthy' however, so take what you will from that. Bison itself is said to be an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3-inch display that could be capable of supporting a tablet mode – hinting at a possible hybrid design. The machine is expected to feature an Intel m3 or Core i5 chip with either 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM. Elsewhere, there's a fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and stylus support with a Wacom pen which will be sold separately. On top of that, further expected features include stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery said to last 10 hours. And it doesn't end there. A backlit keyboard and glass trackpad with haptic and force capabilities are also said to be part of the new device. Related: Best laptop What's more, the sources have even provided a possible price for the Pixel 3, which is expected to go on sale for $799 in the US when it launches. Again, there's no way to confirm any of this, so take it all with due caution. But as the report notes, the idea of Andromeda debuting on a laptop fits with a previous report from the Wall Street Journal which claims as much. That's all we've got for now but we'll await Google's announcement on October 4 in the mean time.

The laptop will also be the first device to come running Google’s new Andromeda operating system. The project is known internally as ‘Bison’ but has also been referred to as Pixel 3, following in the footsteps of the Pixel Chromebook and Pixel C tablet. Made by Google: What to expect at Google's 4 October Pixel event The Pixel 3 is expected to stray from Google’s Chromebook series and will be marketed as a laptop instead, presumably because of the Andromeda OS which merges the best Chrome features with Android into one platform. Android Police has stressed that details of the Pixel 3 should be taken with a very large pinch of salt because anything could change between now and the expected Q3 2017 launch. However 9to5Google.com has also confirmed the laptop’s existence and has said Andromeda will also launch on a Huawei-made Nexus tablet - which is a separate story - although it’s not clear when this will be unveiled. The laptop is expected to be incredibly thin and feature a 12.3in display, which could double up as a tablet. Whether it will be a 2-in-1 laptop/detachable tablet hybrid or a laptop with a flexible hinge remains to be seen. Power should come from either an Intel i3 or i5 processor with 32GB or 128GB of onboard storage and either 8 or 16GB of RAM. The specs lend to suggest there’ll be two models of Pixel 3 laptop, presumably one for media hoarders and one for those who want to do general web surfing. The rumours suggest Google really is going all out with the Pixel 3, as it will come with a backlit keyboard and a glass trackpad with haptic and force detection, putting it in the firing line of the MacBook, especially when you consider its planned 10mm thickness. Other features are expected to include a fingerprint scanner, two USB Type-C ports, stylus support, quad microphones, stereo speakers and a 10 hour battery life. If the rumours are true, the Pixel 3 could be a genuine contender for the Apple MacBook, especially as it’s predicted to severely undercut the price. The Pixel 3 could arrive with a $799 price tag with a Wacom stylus being available to buy separately.

Internally, the OS is codenamed Andromeda. The ultra-thin laptop is rumored to cost $800.More Android and Chrome OS may merge, thanks to rumors reignited by Android Police. We may see the merged OS, codenamed Andromeda, on a tablet-laptop hybrid from Google coming in 2017. What has fueled rumors about Andromeda is the existence of a product, internally codenamed Bison, and nicknamed “Pixel 3.” Android Police cites two independent sources that say the laptop will be the result of collaborations between the Pixel, Android, and Chrome OS teams. We have reached out to Google for comment. Related: An Android and Chrome OS merger may be in the works Bison isn’t expected to replace Chromebooks, and it’s unclear whether Chrome OS or Chromebooks are going away entirely. We can’t confirm this information, so take it all with a grain of salt. Rumored specs Bison will see Chrome OS merging with Android, and the codename for that OS is Andromeda. The laptop will be thinner than the MacBook Air at 10mm, and it will feature a 12.3-inch display. There will be a tablet mode, but it’s unclear whether the laptop will fold over the keyboard like the Lenovo Yoga series, or will be a separate attachment like the Microsoft Surface. The backlit keyboard will house a “glass trackpad” that has similar force detection to the MacBook. It will be powered by Intel’s Core M3 or i5 processor, and will feature 32 or 128GB of internal storage. It will come packed with 8 or 16GB of RAM. The choice of specifications suggests there will be at least two models. Related: Pixel and Pixel XL: Rumors behind the first smartphones ‘made by Google’ The Bison will also have a fingerprint scanner, two USB Type-C ports, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, various sensors, support for a stylus, stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that reportedly lasts 10 hours, according to Android Police. This isn’t like the Pixel C tablet, which didn’t really have a competitive market. Google is really gunning for Microsoft and Apple here with the Bison. By launch, the search giant wants the Andromeda-powered laptop to run a host of enterprise, developer, and “stylus-driven” apps. Rumored price and release date Bison’s starting price is expected to be $800, which puts it in competitive range of other tablet and laptop hybrids. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 starts at $900 with a Core M3 processor. You’re going to have to wait a while to hold Bison in your hands, though as Android Police says, the device will launch in the third quarter of 2017, or sometime between April and June 2017. We’re expecting to see Pixel-branded smartphones, Chromecast Ultra, Daydream VR, Google Home, and Wi-Fi routers at Google’s October 4 event. Android Police suggests we also may get a sneak peek of Andromeda, and we won’t have to wait long to find out.

The company is expected to announce a slew of devices including the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Chromecast Ultra, but this event is turning out to look like there will be much more. Last year, Google took to the stage in California to announce the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C, but this year’s event could change the way that Google introduces products. We’re seeing more build up after it announced the event as we have seen product placement in a lot more places than we’re used to.   Combined with these devices that we already knew were in the works, it appears that Google may have another product that it will show off. David Ruddock from Android Police is reporting that we may get a sneak peek at the “Pixel 3” laptop which would be running the new “Andromeda OS” which combines both Android and Chrome OS. The device would be the 3rd Pixel laptop to be released by Google and is still in its early stages, but the report suggests Google will be giving everyone a glimpse at its next event. The laptop would be the culmination of many reports suggesting that Google has been planning to merge Chrome OS and Android at some point in time, which gained even more traction after the Google Play Store was introduced to Chrome OS at Google I/O 2016. It’s important to note that these specifications are subject to change as the project will not be finalized until Q3 2017, but here’s what Android Police has so far: 12.3-inch Display Intel M3 or i5 Processor 32GB/128GB Storage 8GB/16GB RAM Fingerprint Scanner (2) USB Type-C ports Stylus Support 10-hour Battery Life It’s also suggested that Google wants this package to be under 10mm which would pit the device against Apple’s Macbook in terms of portability. The Pixel 3 will also support a “tablet” mode meaning that the device may follow in the footsteps of the Lenovo Yoga lineup with its convertible design. Finally, if you’re worried about paying a premium for this device, the report suggests Google will be pricing the Pixel 3 at $799 to start and will sell a Wacom stylus separately. But that’s not all folks…. After getting confirmation from multiple sources, 9to5Google is reporting that the Nexus branding may not be dead after all and this may come to fruition in the form of the rumored Huawei Nexus tablet. What makes this tablet so interesting other than retaining the Nexus branding that we’ve come to know and love is that it will, in fact, be running Andromeda OS.   As for what the device will be running under the hood? Here’s a refresher from a leak that came out earlier this month: 7-inch AMOLED 2560 x 1440 Display Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Processor + Adreno 530 GPU 4GB RAM 64GB Storage 13MP camera This would mark the first tablet released since the Pixel C was introduced last year and the first 7-inch tablet from Google since the Nexus 7 2013. The report from 9to5Google also suggests that although the Pixel 3 will be available in Q3 2017, the new Huawei tablet running Andromeda OS will be available to developers sooner, allowing for developers to begin developing for the new operating system. As for the event itself, Google is preparing to change the world and I can’t wait to see what’s in the cards for the future of Google, Android, and anything else that is in the works.

The latter device was just reported on by Android Police, and we can independently confirm that this device is planned. Our sources say, however, that a Huawei Nexus — yes, a Nexus — is also planned… Before you get too excited, I have to disclaim that I can’t matter-of-factly say with 100% certainty that the Huawei tablet will have Nexus branding, but we’ve heard from multiple sources (and hints from others) that — as of the time of this writing, at least — it will. And we can also say with some confidence that the device will be one of two devices that Google plans to launch with Andromeda. All evidence points to this device being the Huawei-made Google tablet that Evan Blass tweeted about a few weeks ago and perhaps related to the trademark filings we saw in April. We don’t have information on the hardware other than what Blass tweeted earlier this month, which claims that the device will have a 7-inch display and 4GB of RAM. We can’t confirm or deny these details this at this time, but people familiar with it have indeed referred to it as a “Nexus tablet.” Interestingly, we can also now further confirm that Google is indeed testing Andromeda on the Nexus 9, and one source claims this is “because of hardware constraints and availability.” We also have confirmation that Google will not be launching Andromeda on the Nexus 9 publicly. The second device is the ‘Pixel 3’ laptop that you probably read about this morning. It’s internally known as ‘Bison,’ made to show off what Google’s new ‘Andromeda’ OS would look like on a laptop. According to Android Police, there will be two models of the “ultra-thin laptop” with a 12.3-inch display. Configurations will reportedly include either an Intel M3 or i5 Core processor, either 32 or 128GB of storage and either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. There’s also apparently a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5mm jack, two USB-C ports, support for a stylus, stereo speakers, four microphones, a backlit keyboard, a glass trackpad with haptic feedback, and a 10 hour battery. As for pricing, it’s apparently set for around $800. We can’t independently confirm any of these ‘Pixel 3’ details, but one of our sources corroborates the main idea here: “Pixel, but targeting MacBook Pro users.” As for the timeline of these devices, Android Police‘s David Ruddock seems to believe that the fancy new “Pixel” laptop will launch in Q3 of 2017. That’s a long ways off. I think it would be reasonable to think that the elusive Huawei tablet — which Evan Blass says will be ready before end of year — will launch with Andromeda sometime before that — perhaps as a developer-focused device. Maybe, just maybe, Google is going back to the Nexus name’s roots with this 7-inch Nexus 6P successor. Update 9/26 2PM ET: As some have pointed out, it’s possible that the Huawei tablet — as a dev device — could actually have a version of Android out of the box, but have a “developer preview” version of Andromeda available to those who want to develop for it. We’re not clear on this point, but we’re fairly certain that Google plans for it to be able to run Andromeda in some form or fashion at some point. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

The project is apparently known as “Bison” internally at Google and is often referred to as the Pixel 3. This is said to be the first brand new device from Google which showcases the rumored Andromeda operating system which is reportedly going to combine Android and Chrome OS. The Pixel 3 project is said to be completely different from Google’s current initiatives to bring Android apps to Chromebooks. The rumor claims that this new notebook is going to be marketed as a completely new product and that it won’t feature the Chromebook branding. It’s claimed that the Pixel 3 is going to be an ultra-thin laptop that features a 12.3 inch display. Google may include a tablet mode in it as well which will make it a laptap/tablet hybrid device. The Pixel 3 may be powered by an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with up to 128GB of storage and perhaps 16GB of RAM. Expected specifications also include a fingerprint scanner, two USB Type-C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, stereo speakers, support for a stylus, and more. It is claimed that the specifications are very much subject to change. Prices for this notebook are expected to start at $799 with retail availability pegged for Q3 2017. Google has obviously not confirmed anything about this device as yet but we’re bound to hear more about it in the coming months through unofficial sources. Filed in Computers. Read more about Google.

Today's Macs are very different from the earliest models, of course. The first Mac had 128 kilobytes of memory; the iMac we're writing this on has 16 gigabytes. It's a bit faster, too. But whether it's a Mac SE or a MacBook Air, most Macs have something that sets them apart from other people's PCs - although even Apple has made the odd duffer. Here are some of Apple's greatest Macs, and a few Mac misses too. This article is part of TechRadar's Mac Week. This year marks not only the 10th anniversary of Apple's MacBook, but the triumphant return of macOS. So, TechRadar looks to celebrate with a week's worth of original features delving back into the Mac's past, predicting the Mac's future and exploring the Mac as it is today. Prev Page 1 of 21 Next Prev Page 1 of 21 Next 1. Apple Macintosh Date of launch: January 1984 Price at launch: $1,495 / $2,495 The first Mac was the first mass-market personal computer with a graphical user interface and mouse. Apple spent so much money advertising the original Macintosh that CEO John Scully promptly upped the price by $1,000 to try and recoup that money, but despite such tomfoolery the Mac sold well: 50,000 were sold by April, and in the first year Apple sold 280,000 Macs. Its 128KB of RAM proved to be insufficient for many, and a 512KB version was introduced later the same year with a price tag of $3,195. Prev Page 2 of 21 Next Prev Page 2 of 21 Next 2. Macintosh Plus Date of launch: January 1986 Price at launch: $2,600 The Mac Plus was a big success, and wasn't discontinued until late 1990. It had a massive 1MB of RAM, expandable to an even more massive 4MB, an 800KB floppy disk drive and a SCSI interface enabling users to add peripherals such as hard disk drives, printers, scanners and other key devices. It was fanless, which meant it ran really quietly. Unfortunately that also made it prone to overheating. Prev Page 3 of 21 Next Prev Page 3 of 21 Next 3. Macintosh II Date of launch: March 1987 Price at launch: $5,500 For all its joys, the Macintosh didn't have something even the simplest phone has today: a colour display. The Macintosh II changed that, although if you wanted a fully loaded version with colour monitor, hard disk, keyboard and RAM you could double the already hefty $5.5K price tag. Its modular design meant a more PC-style case instead of the all-in-one designs of earlier Macs. Prev Page 4 of 21 Next Prev Page 4 of 21 Next 4. Macintosh SE Date of launch: March 1987 Price at launch: $2,900 For many people, the SE is the Mac that springs to mind when they hear "Macintosh". Introduced alongside the Macintosh II with a cheaper price tag - $2,900, or $3,900 if you wanted a hard disk - the SE could have one or two floppy drives or a floppy drive and a hard drive. It had a fan, too, so it didn't suffer from the heat problems of its more expensive sibling. If you spot a transparent one, snap it up: they were promotional prototypes and Apple only made 10, so they're worth a fortune. Prev Page 5 of 21 Next Prev Page 5 of 21 Next 5. Macintosh Classic Date of launch: October 1990 Price at launch: $1,000 The Classic is significant, not because of its specs but because of its sticker price: it was the first Mac to be sold for less than $1,000. Macs had been getting pricier and pricier - the Macintosh IIfx was $9,900 before you added a keyboard or monitor - and with Microsoft's good-enough Windows 3.0 selling like hotcakes, Apple's sales started to decline. The Classic was an attempt to change that, and it was particularly popular in the educational market. Prev Page 6 of 21 Next Prev Page 6 of 21 Next 6. Macintosh LC Date of launch: October 1990 Price at launch: $2,500 LC stands for "low-cost color" and the Elsie was effectively a Mac Classic with a color-capable video card. Like the Classic it was priced to sell, this time at $2,500, but to hit that price Apple had to cut some corners - and while it was a huge success with over 500,000 LCs sold in the first year it was compromised from the outset. Prev Page 7 of 21 Next Prev Page 7 of 21 Next 7. PowerBook 100 Date of launch: October 1991 Price at launch: $2,300 The PowerBook 100 wasn't the first portable Mac - that was the Macintosh Portable in 1989 - but it was the first popular portable Mac, raking in $1 billion in sales in its first year. It was a collaboration between Apple and Sony, who also manufactured the computer. PC World called the 100 the tenth-greatest PC of all time back in 2006, and the portable won stacks of design awards for its brilliance. Prev Page 8 of 21 Next Prev Page 8 of 21 Next 8. Macintosh Quadra Date of launch: October 1991 Price at launch: $6,000 The Quadras were the Mac Pros of the 1990s, using Motorola's whizzy 68040 CPU and aimed squarely at power users. The Quadra 700 could be upgraded to 68MB of RAM, had 512KB of video memory expandable to 2MB and was capable of displaying 1152 x 870, or 832x624 in 24-bit colour if you maxed out the VRAM. Eagle-eyed, moviegoing Apple fans may have spotted its guest appearance in Jurassic Park. Prev Page 9 of 21 Next Prev Page 9 of 21 Next 9. Power Macintosh 6100 Date of launch: March 1994 Price at launch: $1,820 The Power Mac was the Quadra's replacement and used the new AIM (Apple, IBM and Motorola) PowerPC processor to run the latest Mac OS, Mac OS 9. The Power Mac would hang around for more than a decade - Apple didn't stop selling PowerPC Power Macs until 2006 - and the models fall into two camps: Old World ROM models, which featured the Macintosh Toolbox ROM chip, and New World ROM models, which didn't and which used third, fourth and eventually fifth generation PowerPC processors (the G3, G4 and G5 respectively). Prev Page 10 of 21 Next Prev Page 10 of 21 Next 10. iMac G3 Date of launch: August 1998 Price at launch: $1,299 Apple was in trouble. Sales were in freefall, the product range was a mess and there was only one person who could sort it out: the newly returned Steve Jobs. Jobs slashed the product portfolio, canned projects across the company and presided over the launch of one of the most extraordinary computers ever made, the MacMan. Luckily for Apple, Jobs was persuaded to call it the iMac instead. Jonathan Ive's design influenced not just computers, but all kinds of products ranging from steam irons to sex toys, and the controversial decision to kill off the floppy drive proved to be sensible rather than the act of madness many observers said it was. Prev Page 11 of 21 Next Prev Page 11 of 21 Next 11. iBook G3 Date of launch: June 1999 Price at launch: $1,599 The iBook wasn't just one of the most lovable computers ever made. It also popularised a relatively obscure technology known as Wi-Fi. The fun design wouldn't last - the iBook became considerably more sober with the launch of the "Snow" dual-USB iBook in 2001 - but it was another very visual indication that Apple was really thinking different from the rest of the PC industry. Prev Page 12 of 21 Next Prev Page 12 of 21 Next 12. Power Mac G4 Cube Date of launch: July 2000 Price at launch: $1,799 The Cube was fascinating and flawed: it cost significantly more than similarly-specced Power Macs, its acrylic case suffered from a manufacturing fault that caused cracks in the acrylic case and to some eyes it looked a bit like a toaster. It wasn't a huge success but it retains a cult following, and a few have been made into "macquariums". Apple would try the small-PC thing again a few years later with considerably more success. Prev Page 13 of 21 Next Prev Page 13 of 21 Next 13. PowerBook G4 Date of launch: January 2001 Price at launch: $2,599 The PowerBook was a radical departure from Apple's previous pro-laptop designs, dropping dark plastics in favour of shiny titanium and reversing the Apple logo so it looked the right way up to other people. You can see the PowerBook G4's DNA in all of Apple's current laptops, from the ultra-thin MacBook to the Retina MacBook Pro: the Titanium Powerbook, or TiBook for short, is clearly the grandparent of the Apple portables of today. Titanium proved to be problematic, so later PowerBooks - and their descendants - were machined from aluminium instead. Prev Page 14 of 21 Next Prev Page 14 of 21 Next 14. iMac G4 Date of launch: January 2002 Price at launch: $1,299 The original iMac was limited design-wise because it needed to include a huge CRT tube. Not so with the G4, which had a digital LCD instead. The candy colours of the first iMac had been so widely copied that they'd become a design cliché, so Apple went in a different direction for the new model. Some people see sunflowers; we see Luxo Jr, Pixar's anglepoise mascot. The LCD made the iMac considerably more expensive, so Apple kept a CRT model for the education market and called it the eMac. Prev Page 15 of 21 Next Prev Page 15 of 21 Next 15. iMac G5 Date of launch: August 2004 Price at launch: $1,299 Looking at it now, the iMac G5 sits perfectly between the anglepoise G4 and the aluminium iMacs we have now, but at the time it looked really futuristic. It may seem porky compared to today's ultra-thin iMacs, but in 2004 Apple was able to claim that it had made the thinnest desktop computer on the market. It's a masterpiece of something Apple has become really good at: squeezing lots of computer into increasingly smaller spaces. Prev Page 16 of 21 Next Prev Page 16 of 21 Next 16. Mac mini Date of launch: January 2005 Price at launch: $499 In the 1990s, Apple lost market share to Windows. In the 2000s, Apple went on the attack. Designed specifically to tempt price-conscious Windows users, the Mac mini eschewed keyboard, monitor and mouse to keep the price below $500. Essentially a laptop in the body of a very small desktop, the Mini wasn't as quick as its siblings - but it was an awful lot cheaper. Prev Page 17 of 21 Next Prev Page 17 of 21 Next 17. iMac (Core Duo) Date of launch: January 2006 Price at launch: $1,299 Hell froze over: Apple was using Intel processors, and the iMac was the first recipient. Apple had grown increasingly frustrated with the slow improvements in the PowerPC processor, and PowerPC Macs were lagging further and further behind PCs in the performance stakes. Swapping the G5 for a Core Duo nearly tripled the iMac's speed, and Intel processors would go on to power all Macs by the end of 2006. Prev Page 18 of 21 Next Prev Page 18 of 21 Next 18. MacBook Air Date of launch: January 2008 Price at launch: $1,799 Steve Jobs introduced it by pulling it out of an envelope. The MacBook Air was the world's thinnest laptop, and while the specs weren't brilliant the portability more than compensated for it. The Air made other notebooks seem massive, and subsequent iterations ironed out some of the niggling issues such as processor performance and battery life. It was, and remains, a best-seller for Apple. Prev Page 19 of 21 Next Prev Page 19 of 21 Next 19. Mac Pro Date of launch: December 2013 Price at launch: $2,999 Darth Vader's Dustbin is an extraordinary piece of engineering, with no visual similarities to the Mac Pros it replaced: the first-generation Mac Pro looked like the Power Mac G5, but the current model is one-eighth of the size despite supporting up to 12-core Xeons, four DDR3 RAM slots and dual GPUs. It's the most powerful Mac ever made. Prev Page 20 of 21 Next Prev Page 20 of 21 Next 20. MacBook Date of launch: April 2015 Price at launch: $1,299 Thirty-two years after the first Macintosh, it's clear that Macs can still excite and delight. The 2015 MacBook isn't just a beautiful piece of engineering. It's also the clearest indication of where Apple is right now, with a design that's clearly related to the latest iPhones and iPads and an operating system that brings Apple MacBook, Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple iPad together in perfect harmony. The lines between Macs and iOS devices are getting awfully blurry, especially here: choosing between the MacBook and the iPad Pro is a genuinely tough decision.

Now it looks like it will again be the turn of the green team to provide GPUs for upcoming Apple computers, in the not-too-distant future. Just ahead of the weekend Bloomberg reported that Nvidia had posted job listings indicating some new Apple computers are being readied with, probably, Pascal graphics technology inside. There are three Nvidia job adverts currently live asking for people with the expertise on Macs. Bloomberg says there is one for a Mac software developer, one to join the Nvidia Mac driver development team, and the newest one for a 'METAL compute and OpenCL software engineer – Mac'. This latest advertised role seems quite significant. In the job description Nvidia says the hired candidate will "help produce the next revolutionary Apple products". The engineer will be implementing and extending METAL and OpenCL on the latest Nvidia hardware and Apple OSX software. Furthermore the hired engineer will be "working in partnership with Apple," writing code that "will define and shape the future of METAL and OpenCL" on Macs. As noted by Bloomberg, most Macs rely on Intel integrated graphics, sometimes with build-to-order upgrades available and with higher end machines offering discrete GPU options by default. Between 2013 and its latest set of results Nvidia's reliance on its traditional computer graphics base has dwindled as it pushes into professional visualisation, data centre, and automotive businesses. Nevertheless, it will likely be pleased if it can steal back its Apple Mac business from rival AMD. According to rough calculations by the Motley Fool, winning back the Apple Mac GPU business could net Nvidia approximately $100 million in revenue per annum.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 26, 2016 9:12am   Comments Share: Related Can You Guess This Chart? Gartner's Top Tech Trends For 2017 - Are Investors Listening? BlueFin said in a note released on Sunday that it sees the diversification opportunities for Ambarella Inc (NASDAQ: AMBA) away from GoPro Inc (NASDAQ: GPRO) as positive and positioning Ambarella nicely going forward. Given that GoPro's prospects have degraded, the firm said it is concerned for the system on supplier. The firm's analyst John Donovan noted that Ambarella relies on GoPro for about 30–32 percent of its revenues. However, the analyst noted that Ambarella is wisely expanding its market opportunities, taking cognizance of the weakness at GoPro. Donovan also highlighted the fact that the company is currently working with some of GoPro's competitors in the action camera and drone markets. Related Link: GoPro Going On A Run Ahead Of Critical Holiday Season BlueFin also feels Ambarella would play out well into the wearables and AR/VR markets. While noting that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) describing designs for glasses, the firm said Ambarella has a tremendous opportunity in the space as well. Another area the firm indicated that Ambarella can diversify is into is the unrestricted devices. Notwithstanding these diversification initiatives and opportunities, BlueFin believes GoPro and Ambarella's fortunes will be intertwined with each other in the near term. Although the firm is upbeat about the reception for the recently introduced new products of GoPro, it noted that the company is estimating about 50 percent of its annual revenue in the fourth quarter. A small miss there, according to the firm, could wreak havoc for both firms. Accordingly, the firm said it remains cautious on Ambarella. In pre-market trading, shares of Ambarella were down 1.04 percent at $66.35, while those of GoPro were down 0.87 percent at $17. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → September → Technology ETFs Are Making a Strong Comeback Technology ETFs Are Making a Strong Comeback Max Chen September 26, 2016 0 Comment Current Affairs, DIA, Lead, NASDAQ, QQQ, Sector ETFs, SMH, SOCL, SPY, Technology, VGT, XLK After falling out of favor along with other growth stocks at the start of a volatile year, technology sector-related exchange traded funds have outperformed in recent months. Technology companies have regained their footing in recent months as volatility dissipated and investors renewed their focus on a beaten up growth category, with the Nasdaq Composite and the PowerShares QQQ (NasdaqGM: QQQ), which tracks the tech heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, both making new highs. Over the past three months, QQQ increased 11.3%, whereas the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEArca: SPY) gained 4.9% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEArca: DIA) rose 4.1%. Ever since the so-called Brexit vote to leave the European Union rocked global markets, technology stocks have led the market rebound. More recently, after the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave rates unchanged, broad markets pushed forward with the Nasdaq hitting a new record high Thursday. Looking ahead, growing optimism for the upcoming earnings season is also fueling the rally in tech as many market observers anticipate a turnaround in corporate profits. Historically, after a profit falloff, the technology sector has been among the best areas in a rebound. “The only sector that has record an increase in expected earnings growth since the start of the quarter (due to upward revisions to earnings estimates) is the information technology sector,” according to FactSet. Overall, 33 of the 66 companies in the info tech sector have experienced a rise in their mean earnings-per-share estimates to date. Investors seeking targeted exposure to the technology space have a number of broad sector plays at their disposal. For starters, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLK) has been a popular option to target technology names in the S&P 500. Alternatively, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEArca: VGT) is a cost-efficient avenue for investors looking for technology exposure as well. Large institutional traders may enjoy the robust liquidity found in XLK, but long-term investors who are less concerned about day-to-date, bid-ask spreads may like the cheaper 0.10% expense ratio found in VGT, compared to XLK’s 0.14% expense ratio. Both XLK and VGT track market capitalization-weighted indices, so the top components include prominent names like Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL), Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT) and Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB). Among the best performing tech-related ETFs so far this year, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEArca: SMH) increased 27.2% and Global X Social Media Index ETF (NasdaqGM: SOCL) advanced 25.2%. SMH targets the semiconductor sub-sector, with large positions in well-known names like Intel (NasdaqGS: INTC) 13.4%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) 12.7% and Qualcomm (NasdaqgS: QCOM) 7.7%. The ETF also includes some overseas holdings, including 12.7% Taiwan, 8.5% Netherlands, 6.0% Japan and 5.1% Singapore, along with 66.5% U.S. SOCL targets companies involved in the social media game. While the social media ETF includes some known social media names like Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB) 9.6% and Twitter (NasdaqGS: TWTR) 8.9%, SOCL also includes internet and media names that investors may not think of, such as Tencent 10.1%, Alphabet (NasdaqGS: GOOG) 4.6% and Yahoo (NasdaqGS: YHOO) 4.8%. The fund also includes a significant international exposure, including 23.5% China, 9.8% Japan, 7.6% Russia, 4.2% Germany and 1.0% Taiwan, along with 53.8% U.S. Full disclosure: Tom Lydon’s clients own shares of SPY.

Industries back in the early 90s, and it blew our minds at the time. The graphics were basic and blurry, the headsets cumbersome and heavy, and a session with a Virtuality machine in an arcade often left us befuddled and queasy. But it offered a different type of gaming experience and had us intrigued as to how it might progress in future. That particular tech – and VR in general – soon retreated back into obscurity, like many innovative but poorly realised technologies are bound to do. So while we were always hopeful it would return in some fashion one day, we kind of forgot all about it. We made do with PlayStation and Xbox consoles instead. However, some 20 years later, we were thrilled and amazed when Oculus first hit Kickstarter with its plans to reintroduce VR into our lives. Touting what was to end up as the Oculus Rift headset and, despite it taking a further three or so iterations to get the final consumer device into our hands, its arrival couldn't be better timed. Virtual reality is a magical, wonderful proposition that never fails to delight. And in many respects, the Oculus Rift offers the perfect portal to experience the tech at its current best, with graphics and depth that a mobile platform couldn't possibly hope to rival. But it does come with its caveats, as we shall explain... Oculus Rift review: Taking control The Oculus Rift headset is a less complicated beast than its main rival, the HTC Vive. When we reviewed the latter, we bemoaned the requirement and placement of sensors to ensure that you can be tracked while physically moving around a designated space. Not so with the Oculus Rift. At present, it's better suited to sitting or standing in one spot, and therefore only needs the one sensor which is easy to plonk on a desk or cabinet. Pocket-lint It means the overall experience is hamstrung a tad in comparison, but at least the set-up is a doddle. As long as the sensor is pointing straight at your head it will track you sufficiently to play any of the games that don't require the use of the Oculus Touch controllers (sold separately). You are, however, provided with an Xbox One controller, a wireless dongle for it to communicate with your computer, and a small Oculus remote to interact with experiences that only require a few clicks. The aforementioned Oculus Touch motion controllers are not expected to hit stores until late 2016, so current games and software titles are all usable through at least one of the two included controller mechanisms. Oculus Rift review: Headset design The headset itself is fairly lightweight at around 470g. It feels comfortable to wear, even during prolonged play sessions, and the detachable foam lining around the eyepiece ensures that you can wear it as tight as needed for visual clarity, yet not feel too constrained. It also allows the use of glasses for those who would rather wear them while playing. Pocket-lint There are elasticated, adjustable straps for a perfect fit and stereo headphones are strapped to either side. The Rift is the only headset currently on the market that offers built-in earpieces and that helps when using the device on an ad-hoc, day-to-day basis. We'd recommend separate cans if you want better audio performance, but for speed of use it's great that you don't have to go through the rigmarole of putting on a pair every time. The only other feature of the headset itself – bar its screen quality, which we'll come to shortly – is a switch to space the lenses to best suit your eyesight. You can move them closer or further apart in order to sharpen the image. We also suggest that you tighten the straps as much as possible, which will further reduce image blurriness. The tighter and more stable the headset on your noggin, the better the clarity. Oculus Rift review: Ultimate clarity? The screen in the Oculus Rift uses OLED technology – so is vibrant and rich when in use. It has a resolution of 2160 x 1200 pixels in total, so serves 1080 x 1200 pixels to each eye. A 90Hz (90fps) refresh rate ensures action is smooth enough to prevent nausea during movement; it's a higher refresh than many competitors. Pocket-lint You can just about make out individual pixels during static brighter scenes, mainly if you're purposely looking for them, but if that's the case, the game itself is not doing enough to hold your attention. Games that are as immersive as Project Cars or Eve: Valkyrie should distract you enough to never notice pixels. It must be said that the headset gets warm with lengthy use, which can prompt you to halt a lengthy bout of play, and your eyes can also get a little sore when flitting from one experience to another. We found a 30-minute blast to be absolutely fine, but more than that and you are wholly advised to take breaks. Oculus Rift review: Note about nausea Throughout Oculus' development phase, there have been plenty of reports of headsets making people feel sick. We even had a moment of extreme nausea when playing Minecraft in VR using an earlier concept Oculus device, but it tends to vary from game to game, depending on their control systems and construction, rather than the headsets themselves. Thankfully, Oculus rates each available experience in terms of how extreme or comfortable they are to play. Pocket-lint For the most part, we have felt fine whenever we've used the consumer Rift, as long as we took regular breaks from the action and there was plenty of air circulating through the room. There's often a sense of displacement and an odd acclimatisation period as soon as the headset is removed, but it soon passes and doesn't feel too uncomfortable. Essentially, these are going to be traits of virtual reality no matter the headset, be it Rift, Vive, PlayStation VR or even the mobile system of Samsung Gear VR. You'll have to decide whether you can get used to such feelings. If not, VR really isn't for you – at least with the current platforms. Oculus Rift review: Worth the cash? If you do want to take the plunge into VR and buy an Oculus Rift headset then you have to consider the cost. It costs £549 post-Brexit, but that doesn't take into account that it also requires a beefy PC to run everything. That will invariably cost you much more – at least twice the price of the Rift if you want games to run at their best. During our testing period, we've tried it with a self-constructed gaming PC that has more than the recommended minimum specifications – including 16GB RAM (twice the recommended 8GB) and an Intel Core i7 4790K processor (i5 4590 is the suggested minimum). However, it wasn't until we boosted our graphics card up to an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 that everything ran without any fuss whatsoever. You can certainly get by with lesser spec: Nvidia's GTX 1060 card is a cheaper, very capable option; or seek out a second-hand GTX 970. Pocket-lint When you also consider that the Touch controllers will cost around £190 when they arrive, it's a hell of a lot to shell out to be an early adopter in a new entertainment format, as mind-blowing as it can be at times. That's why this generation of Oculus Rift is more likely aimed at and will be bought by self-confessed geeks (a group to which we belong) rather than general public. Yes, it is now sold in highstreet stores in the UK and US, but it will mainly attract those who have already invested in the technology to drive it. And they will put up with its caveats too. It must be remembered that this is a first generation device – putting aside the devkits and prototypes. It is delicate and complex, and while groundbreaking and well-built, still feels like something a PC accessory manufacturer might make than a product from a consumer lifestyle brand. Oculus Rift review: Staring at the sun It even has to be handled with care when not in use, thanks to an inherent issue with super-focused lenses. As we found to our cost with our first Rift headset, you cannot leave the lenses pointing anywhere near a window or it runs the risk of irreparably damaging the OLED panel. Pocket-lint Remember the old trick of burning a piece of paper with a magnifying glass on a sunny day? Well imagine that, only replace the paper with a hugely expensive, inaccessible full-colour display. We can tell you now, through experience, that it's hard to concentrate on fighter craft in a space battle when there's a mighty red blob streaked across the field of view. It's not covered by the warranty either. So we'd suggest that only those who are experienced in handling their tech are best suited for Oculus Rift mark one. They'll certainly get the most from it, as it is an impressive piece of kit that provides experiences that still wow – even after countless hours of play. Verdict The Oculus Rift is the reason why Facebook bought the VR hardware company and it's easy to see why. But these are still early days for the technology - and while 2016 looked poised to be the year of VR, there's a whole lot more yet to come. The HTC Vive is already available and PlayStation VR could be a massive success when it launches in October, thanks to its huge target audience of PS4 owners. But even those utilise first-generation technologies so have their foibles. As it stands, the Rift is a comfortable, pleasant VR headset that is well supported in software terms and offers great potential. It is pricey – pricier still if you don't already own a PC capable of running it – but you are buying into something fresh and new. Geeks like us will adore it, but we'd advise a little caution if you're not. Just look down at the shirt you're wearing: if it has Sonic the Hedgehog or a 1980s NES controller emblazoned across it, you'll go mad for a Rift; if not then maybe you should try a demo in a store near you before making a final decision.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith Apple’s iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 have been met with widespread critical acclaim. Now it has been revealed that the Cupertino-based company has a number of devices lined-up for release including Apple MacBook Air 2016 and Apple MacBook Pro 2016. Moreover, rumours claim that the company is just months away from releasing the iMac 2016. It may be released in October. Even though Apple has not released any official statement regarding its devices, several unconfirmed reports have stated that the iMac 2016 is in the works, and when it releases, it will have some of the best specs to boast of. According to iTech Post, one of the most-speculated features in the iMac 2016 is VR capability. Some are of the opinion that Apple is partnering with LG to develop the device’s display. Whether it is true or not is another concern but it is highly likely that Apple will bring massive changes to the iMac 2016 after a period of lull. Even if the company does not reveal the device in October, it may at least announce it. HNGN reported that the iMac 2016 may be the AIO PC every Apple fan is hoping for. The company recently released the macOS Sierra. The device is expected to have the AR and VR technology and AMD’s Radeon RX GPU. An October release would mean an Intel Kaby Lake processor is out of question. The LG ultra-clear monitor in iMac 2016 may have 5K technology enabled. Apple has been very particular about graphics quality and a 5K display would make the iMac 2016 a paradise for gamers. 3.1 USB support and a Thunderbolt 3 port are also a possibility. It is also rumoured that the 5K technology will also be included in Apple MacBook Air 2016. Apple is currently refreshing its 13.3-inch MacBook Air and it is very much possible that the product will be released in October along with iMac 2016.

Add to Diigo Bookmark this on Delicious Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Press Release Panasonic Toughbook celebrates 20th anniversary of its rugged mobile computing brand A chance to win a trip to Japan for customers with oldest working Toughbooks Bracknell, UK. 26 September 2016 - Panasonic Toughbook is celebrating 20 years of the legendary rugged mobile computing brand on September 26th, 2016, and to celebrate those still in possession of one of the earliest working Toughbook notebooks could win the trip of a lifetime to Japan. Panasonic Headquarters The Toughbook ancestry stretches back almost 30 years to 1987 where Panasonic gained experience in producing portable PCs and acting as a channel OEM. The market highlighted very early the need for professional level, rugged computing devices with enhanced durability and reduced cost of ownership. This realisation led to Panasonic developing plans and ultimately building a purpose built factory in Kobe in Japan to produce the rugged notebooks. Twenty years on and the latest analysis by VDC Research shows Panasonic leads the European rugged notebook and tablet markets with a 66% rugged notebook and convertible share of sales and a 59% rugged tablet revenue share of sales in 2015. In fact, the Panasonic Toughbook and Toughpad range sold more devices across Europe in 2015 than the rest of the rugged notebook and tablet competition combined. A combination of listening to the market and a passion to meticulously research, develop, build, test and market its own products has helped Panasonic Toughbook achieve a range of firsts that have set the benchmark for rugged mobile computing devices in the 20th and 21st centuries. 1994: The CF-41 The world’s first notebook to integrate a CD-ROM drive This device, with its inbuilt CD-Rom and use of Magnesium alloy, was the basis for the future Toughbook range. 1996: The Toughbook CF-25 The birth of the Toughbook brand This pioneering device was designed to withstand falls from up to 70 centimetres, resist dust and humidity - elements which became the blueprint for future Toughbook models. 1999: The Toughbook CF-27 The world’s first integrated GSM and WAN capabilities and touchscreen The world’s first notebook to introduce integrated GSM or WAN capabilities allowing mobile workers to communicate with each other, their office or the outside world. Also the first Toughbook to have the option of a touchscreen and the first with its Hard Disk Drive (HDD) surrounded by a gel and foam block to keep it secure and absorb any impact forces. 2001: The Toughbook CF-07 An innovative rugged mini PC with mobile wireless data display The Toughbook CF-07 mini PC broke new ground by introducing a revolutionary wireless display. The PC and separate display unit could communicate up to 50m, bringing a whole new level of flexibility and mobility to the work environment. 2009: The Toughbook CF-U1 The world’s first Ultra Mobile PC – bridging the gap between notebook and handheld The CF-U1 took the rugged heritage of Toughbook to a more mobile, handheld level. It featured a full Windows operating system and a host of integrated features such as barcode scanner, fingerprint reader, camera and hot-swap batteries, enabling mobile field workers to do more on the move. 2012: Panasonic Toughpad The launch of rugged Toughpad tablets The Panasonic Toughpad product line is purpose built for professional use. The range of ruggedised tablet computers is extremely durable, resistant to high drops, dust, water spills and high temperatures. 2015: The Toughbook CF-20 The world’s first fully rugged detachable notebook The combined rugged tablet and notebook delivers unrivaled versatility for mobile - a fully rugged notebook with detachable tablet that can be used in 6 different modes to meet every business need. “The range of Panasonic Toughbook and Toughpad solutions continues to evolve with mobile retail and payment solutions, our own docking solutions business and our extension into the rugged handheld market but the essence of our success over the past 20 plus years will remain with us as we move forward,” said Kevin Jones, Managing Director for Panasonic Computer Product Solutions Europe. “We will continue to listen to our business customers and develop solutions for their mobile workforces that improve productivity and reduce costs. We will continue to innovate with our functionality and ergonomic design, and with our partnerships, to produce business solutions that solve our customers’ challenges.” Commenting on Panasonic’s future direction, Nick Parker, Corporate Vice President of the OEM Division at Microsoft Corporation said: “Our strategy and vision align with what Panasonic is doing with its Toughbook product line, which is to build the best mobile and productivity services for today’s mobile-first, cloud-first world,” said Nick Parker, Corporate Vice President OEM Division, Microsoft Corp. “With Windows 10, we are pushing the boundaries of modern computing to bring exciting new software and services capabilities to the market, and industry partners like Panasonic are also pushing the limits with fantastic new hardware that brings these new experiences to life in remarkable ways.” “Throughout the twenty year evolution of Toughbook, Panasonic engineers have taken full advantage of the computing power and reliability of Intel processors to create one of the world’s most rugged PCs,” added Navin Shenoy, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the Client Computing Group, Intel Corporation. “We’re proud that Intel technology has contributed to Toughbook's success, and we look forward to continuing the great work with Panasonic for years to come.” For details of Panasonic Toughbook and Toughpad solutions visit www.toughbook.eu Press contact: Michael Bartley The Amber Group michael@ambergroup.net +44 (0)118 949 7750 About Panasonic System Communications Company Europe (PSCEU) PSCEU is the European branch of Panasonic Systems Communications Company, the global B2B division of Panasonic.

Look and feel The Surface Book is pretty much the first laptop Microsoft has ever made. Where the Surface Pro 4, is foremost a tablet, the Surface has a distinctly laptop centric design that also works as a tablet. This is largely thanks to its 13” detachable touchscreen tablet and a full-size keyboard. There are several Surface Book models available and these largely consist of variations in the CPU, RAM and storage. The review unit I’m testing also packs a dedicated graphics card housed in keyboard. The Surface Book is very stylised and a little quirky as a notebook PC. Its screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio. Within a day of using it, I grew to like working with it. it's a tough cookie too – hewn out of a block of magnesium alloy. This conferred the Surface book with the lightness of aluminium but a far more durable finish. Mind you, the Surface book is no lightweight – it weighs in at anywhere from 95g to hefty 1.58kg depending on which model you choose. The Surface books screen can be undocked by pressing a dedicated dock/undock key. The mounting mechanism feels solid and the tablet/screen seems firmly locked into place. The bundled surface pen is magnetised and attaches to the side of the Surface book. I’d prefer a dedicated slot; it’d make for far fewer lost pens. The part of the Surface Book that gets the most attention is what Microsoft call its 'Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge'. It’s a clever accordion-like hinge arrangement and it cleverly provides balance to the screen heavy device without forcing you to resort to a fiddly and frankly annoying kick-stand. Clever bits Checking on price spy reveals Prices start at $2,300, going up to just over $3,000. A budget laptop the Surface book isn’t. That said, you do get a lot for your money and it is a real joy to use. The Surface Book might command a premium, but it has a bunch of nifty features its competitors don’t have. Unlike many other 2-in-1 notebook PCs, the Surface book is stable and balanced. Other notebook convertibles tend to be screen heavy which see’s their keyboard docks fall over when in use. Thanks to a clever screen hinge design, the surface books weight is more evenly distributed which means the likelihood of a costly screen propelled summersault diminishes significantly. Unlike other convertibles, the hinge wont fold backwards 180 degrees for a presentation mode configuration, but the tablet can be removed and reinserted facing backwards to achieve the same effect. The tablet feels solidly attached and I’ve yet to experience an involuntary drop test when picking up the surface book by the screen. This often sees the keyboard on many other convertibles detaching and clattering to the floor. Not so with the Surface book which uses super strong Magnets and a latch to keep the tablet attached. A quick bit of googling reveals that what Microsoft call a 'Muscle Wire Lock' is used. It’s a clever bit of tech that uses a 'Nitonal' memory wire which changes shape when electricity is applied to it. The gubbins is this – you can only release the screen by pressing a dedicated button on the keyboard. Even with a dead battery, the screen stays firmly put. You’d need to Pull the screen with considerable force and would most likely break the surface book before the screen and keyboard parted company. Another clever design benefit of the Surface books unique hinge design is that there is an airgap between the screen and keyboard. It might irritate your inner OCD sufferer, but it does prevent the screen from being scratched by the keyboard. The bundled surface pen also earns brownie points. Signing electronic documents or pootling about with a paint programme is a real joy. Clicking the button on its top fires up the OneNote app, allowing you to scribble notes to your hearts content. The Surface pen is also magnetised and can attach to the side of the surface book. Under the hood The Surface Book’s display has a 3:2 this might sound odd given the 16:9 ratios we’re all used to with most notebook PCs but when held in portrait orientation it resembles an A4 page, making the tablet ideal as a document substitute. The display is 13.5” and sports a 3000x2000 resolution at a peeper pleasing 267ppi.  Everything is powered by a 6th-generation Intel Skylake CPU. Depending on which model you chose, your choices range from a Core i5 or a Core i7. With the Core i5 version you get 8GB of RAM. A NVidia GPU is also tucked away in the keyboard. With the Core i7 you still get the NVidia GPU but can also choose either 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD or 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD. Tucked away on the keyboard are two USB 3.0 ports, a Mini-DisplayPort and SD card reader. The only port built into the tablet section is the headphone jack. Oddly there is no USB C or Thunderbolt. Next year perhaps? The Surface Book supports 802.11 11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. There are dual-microphones (which are ideal for skyping), an 8Mp rear shooter and a 5Mp front cam. The NVidia custom GeForce GPU is a pleasant surprise.it fires up when the screen is docked. Undocked the tablet uses integrated Intel HD Graphics. Specs-wise the GPU is similar to a GeForce 940m. It clocks in at 945MHz clock speed, and uses 1GB of speedy GDDR5 VRAM. In Use Typing is usually not much fun with most 2-in-1 devices. Their keyboards often feel like after thoughts and are cramped affairs whose keys lack a decent amount of travel. Not so with the Surface Book. Its backlit keyboard and the trackpad are large and comfy. Its keys may still be scrabble tile style, but there is plenty of travel.  Compared to other convertibles, I found my typing accuracy was only marginally atrocious (it is normally utterly shocking) and typing speeds were also good. The Surface Book has two batteries. The tablet has an 18Wh battery while the keyboard has a 51Wh battery. Firing up an HD video clip on repeat in the morning, I got 15 hours and 55 minutes of playback. That's enough to keep you entertained/productive on most long-haul flights. That said, Wi-Fi was switched off and screen brightness was left on auto. Your mileage may vary depending on how you’re using the surface book. Either way, that’s an impressive battery life figure. VERDICT It isn’t cheap, but it is a pretty special piece of gear. Build quality is excellent and it is a real joy to use. Microsoft have obviously taken a no-compromise approach with the Surface Book and it’s worked. The battery life can only be described as amazing and it’s gamer friendly thanks to the NVidia GPU. If you’re a windows user looking for a new notebook, the Surface book should be sitting close to the top of your list. Want to know more on this topic?

  Newsletters Subscriptions Forums Career Media Kit About Us Contact Search Home   Volume 26, Number 40 -- September 26, 2016 IBM Preaches Cognitive, Cloud, And IT Consumption Published: September 26, 2016 by Dan Burger They say it's not just about the technology. It's really about the business. But that brings to mind an old adage from the car industry: You sell the sizzle not the steak. Right now the sizzle is cognitive computing. It has edged out big data and analytics in the one-upsmanship match of IT leadership and the next big thing. At the Edge conference last week, when IBM executives talked strategy and road maps, cognitive computing was on the tip of tongues. Cognitive is a differentiator, an upper hand for IBM. Big Blue has not let the world forget about Watson, its game show champion that's evolved into a must-have business advantage in the making. Watson's augmented intelligence, a term IBM prefers over artificial intelligence, has been applied to healthcare, finance, commerce, education, and security. According to IBM, it has thousands of scientists and engineers working on cognitive projects, which also extend to clients, academics, and external experts. Of course, cognitive computing doesn't hush any conversations about big data analytics. Cognitive is actually the crown jewel of big data analytics. Watson is Linux based, which fits nicely with IBM strategy and it's deliverable in the cloud--another nice fit strategically speaking. IBM Systems head honcho Tom Rosamilia "Three years ago, cloud was thought of in terms of commoditization and standardization," Tom Rosamilia, vice president of IBM Systems group, said during a press conference at Edge 2016. "The consumption model has seen a huge change. We see more need for differentiation. As more advanced usage happens on the cloud, it requires innovation. Cognitive ups the ante on innovation." IBM has a couple of cognitive computing white papers for those of you with a bigger appetite for the topic. Check out Learning to Trust Artificial Intelligence Systems and Computing, cognition and the future of knowing. Linux continues to be the star on which the Power Systems hitches its wagon. Power Systems GM Doug Balog says it's the market with the greatest opportunity. "There are plenty of opportunities in the Linux market," Balog noted in a press conference last week in Las Vegas. "Workloads like SAP HANA, which only runs on Linux; Blockchain (keep reading for more on this) is in the Linux server market; machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence depend on Linux; and Linux is the foundation for the cloud." The OpenPower alliance also targets the Linux market, which Balog pegs at $18 billion and growing at a 5 to 7 percent compound basis annually. He says Linux on Power is responsible for virtually all of the new business. AIX is a diminishing market and IBM i is more or less stable. "Our new business has all been around Linux on Power," he says. As the new kid on the block in the Linux market, Balog has his work cut out for him to make Power Systems a player. One thing he has going in his favor is the group of partners that make the OpenStack cloud controller. Each of those partners has a Linux customer base that will not be able to escape the Power Systems marketing message about a better price/performance package than Intel and that a switch to Power does not require organizations to change their operational models. No matter who's holding the microphone at Edge, it's a safe bet, even in a place like Vegas, that no speaker will talk for five minutes without using the word innovation a minimum of three times. The amazing thing is they never stop to reload. There always seems to be another innovative bullet in the chamber. One topic that was repeatedly shot with the innovation gun was Blockchain. I think it got what it deserved. Blockchain, officially known as the Hyperledger Open Source Blockchain Project, is an example of open source speed, agility, and collaboration at its best. It began as a protocol used by BitCoin to record financial transactions and is now used to write applications that record information and transfers of assets for a variety of industries including insurance, healthcare, and manufacturing. IBM is using it in its supply chain, which at any given time has $100 million tied up in disputes. With the inclusion of encryption, access policies, and digital signatures, it provides a secure database and validation protocol for all participants. The IBM supply chain Blockchain runs in the cloud with the highest level of security. A year ago this didn't exist. Now it's real world and solving business problems such as resolving disputes in the supply chain, as just one example. Open source projects are thriving at IBM. Cloud, mobile, and data technologies are swarming with open source projects. IBM is contributing to more than 400 open source projects each month. That's about a 4X increase in contributions over the past five years, according to Chris Ferris, IBM CTO for Open Technology. Cognitive computing, data analytics, and the cloud dominated the agenda at the Edge conference, but they're not the whole show. The general session presentations and interviews with keynote speakers can be found on the IBMGO website.

How to house and feed millions of people, power their homes and businesses and move them from place to place while reducing environmental impact and combating climate change are among the challenges now under the spotlight. That's where Smart Cities come in. A smart city is basically one where data and sensors are used to plan and deliver better public services, and where everything is connected. Sensors This could involve analysing travel patterns to help reduce congestion and improve public transport systems. Sensors in rivers can be used to monitor water levels, helping to warn about flooding and help city bosses quickly plan a response. Energy consumption in buildings is measured to help improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Part of the Smart City concept also includes constructing environmentally-friendly buildings which use less water and power, provision of a good public transport system and cycling routes, excellent communications infrastructure, including wifi and using efficient public lighting. But is Dublin smart? Finding where the capital is ranked on a global scale is difficult, as there are few indicators available. One, from IESE Business School at the University of Navarra in Spain, ranks Dublin as 36th in the world. But what does that mean? "There's a lot of work being done to develop a proper index, but it's not straightforward," Smart City programme manager in Dublin City Council, Jamie Cudden said. "There's a group of cities recognised as being smart, like Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Barcelona and Bristol and Greenwich in the UK. But it comes back to what your view of what smart is." A survey last year, 'Your Dublin, Your Voice' included a question on "city perception". It found that 45pc of respondents believed that Dublin was a "smart" city, but this perception was lowest among students. The lack of tech investment for the public good, coupled with a poorly-integrated public-transport system and poor broadband were cited as the main reasons why it wasn't up to scratch. Conversely, the presence of so many IT companies, the educated workforce and use of technology and apps for services were seen as positives. Dublin's advantage is that so many hi-tech firms are located here, including Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft, all of which work in this space. Strides The city has also made strides installing hi-tech solutions to everyday problems. Need to know when a bus, train or Luas is coming? Online apps and real-time passenger information tell you. Using a Leap card also reduces the need for cash for fares, while offering better value. The city centre offers free public wifi, and its sophisticated traffic system allows congestion and traffic flows to be monitored in real time, thereby allowing planners to adjust traffic signals and give public transport priority at busy times. In addition, low-cost sensors developed by Kingspan are installed across the city to gauge water levels, while smart bins in Dun Laoghaire alert the council when bins are full. In Croke Park, sensors dotted at the entrance help gather data on crowds. Research projects are under way, including one between UCD and IBM to research how smart buildings will reduce running costs and provide environmental wins through better energy systems, lower water usage and better transport solutions. NUI Maynooth has also been given €2.3m in funding for a five-year project, The Programmable City, to analyse how technology can influence life in the city. But key to all of this is the availability of data. The Programmable City has compiled the Dublin Dashboard (www.dublindashboard.ie) which gathers data from a range of sources and sets out what's happening across the city in real time. There's alerts on water cut-offs, travel times on the M50 and city streets and data on available car parking spaces. But there's also data on planning applications, and a range of indicators on how public money is spent. Dublin may not yet be best in class, but it's getting there.

You understand its strengths, and its weaknesses, and know how to use it. More than likely, you know which distribution is best for you. You know what a distribution is. And you know all this because you are passionate about tech. Why else would you be on a technology website, reading an article about Linux? And I bet you wish your relatives used it too. It would save you so much time. Your weekend plans wouldn’t be derailed by removing 10 years worth of malware from your uncle’s ancient Compaq desktop. There would be no more pop-ups on your mom’s computer. No more ransomware infections A History of Ransomware: Where It Started & Where It's Going A History of Ransomware: Where It Started & Where It's Going Ransomware dates from the mid-2000s and like many computer security threats, originated from Russia and eastern Europe before evolving to become an increasingly potent threat. But what does the future hold for ransomware? Read More that you’d be left to fight. It would be tech support bliss. Here’s the problem. Your relatives aren’t passionate about tech. It’s not something that excites them. Three years ago, they went to Best Buy and bought whatever the sales clerk told them to, and they see no reason to change. So, how do you evangelize Linux to someone who doesn’t share your enthusiasm for tech? Here’s how you do it in a considerate, empathetic way that gets results. Ads by Google Start With the Basics: This Is an Operating System In the introduction to this piece, I used a particular word: empathy. When you try to make recommendations about technology (not just about Linux), it’s important to remember that the person you’re speaking to does not share your experience, or your perspective. Before you start babbling about the finer differences between Windows and Linux, and explaining the systemd controversy Open Source Software and Forking: The Good, The Great and The Ugly Open Source Software and Forking: The Good, The Great and The Ugly Sometimes, the end-user benefits greatly from forks. Sometimes, the fork is done under a shroud of anger, hatred and animosity. Let's look at some examples. Read More , it’s important to get some groundwork down. Perhaps the initial concept you’ll have to explain is what an operating system is. I’ve spoken to people who genuinely don’t know what that is. When they look at a computer, they think “Windows”. To lots of people, these two concepts are intrinsically linked. They don’t know that there are alternatives. Before you even introduce Linux, you may have to explain what an operating system is, and what it does. Above all, you’ll have to explain that these can be changed, and that there are legitimate reasons for doing so, without going into specifics. In the past, I’ve actually had to explain that it’s perfectly legal to remove Windows. While this might sound hilarious to you, for an awful lot of people this is a reasonable concern. They’re not stupid, nor are they ignorant. They just don’t share your experience or perspective. Again, empathy. Linux: The Biggest OS You’ve Never Heard Of What is Linux? No, I’m serious. I’m asking you a question. Imagine I’m the average person. I use computers for casual web browsing and work, and I have no real interest in them beyond that. How would you explain Linux to me? If you said the words “license”, “kernel”, “FLOSS”, “free software”, “command line”, or “toolchain”, congratulations: you failed. Say them to an ordinary person and you’ll get one of two responses. Most likely their eyes will glaze over with boredom. Otherwise they will be completely baffled and won’t follow what you’re saying. Here’s how I’d explain it: Linux is a bit like Windows. It’s a big computer program that lets you run other, smaller computer programs like Google Chrome and Office. In fact, it looks a lot like Windows, too. What makes Linux so special is that compared to Windows, it’s safer and more reliable Is Linux Really as Secure as You Think It Is? Is Linux Really as Secure as You Think It Is? Linux is often touted as the most secure operating system you can get your hands onto, but is this really the case? Let's take a look at different aspects of Linux computer security. Read More . There are thousands of people and companies who work on Linux, trying to make it better. They do this for free, and they allow it to be downloaded by ordinary people like yourself, without charge. This is because they use it themselves, and they benefit from having an operating system that’s fast, rarely crashes, and is less at risk of being hacked or infected with a virus. In those two short paragraphs, I’ve explained what Linux is, and even touched on how it’s built and licensed. I did this without using the words “source code” or “license”, or any other terminology Is Linux Confusing? Here Are The Key Terms You Need To Know Is Linux Confusing? Here Are The Key Terms You Need To Know These days, Ubuntu and other modern Linux distributions usually install without a hitch (and without requiring any knowledge), but as you move forward using them, you will inevitably come across all sorts of terminology that... Read More that normal people don’t use. Relate It to Them: Why Should They Care? By now, the person you’re speaking to should know that Linux is an operating system, and it has some unique strengths. This is good. But again, why should they care? Why should they upgrade? After all, in the world of tech, you don’t have to upgrade the moment something better arrives. The latest iPhone is a perfect demonstration of that. Here’s where you have to make this about them. Has the person you’re speaking to fallen victim to an online scam, or malware? Have they recently had to pay out huge amounts of money to recover their files after being infected by ransomware? Are they currently frustrated with their computer’s sluggish performance? (“It wasn’t like this when I bought it…”) If so, tell them that Linux is different. It isn’t as vulnerable to these types of problems as Windows is. There aren’t as many viruses for Linux, and by design it’s much harder to infect. Tell them that Linux doesn’t get as bogged down and sluggish over time, as Windows does. Those problems that vex them so much? They’ll be a thing of the past. Assuage Their Fears: There’s No Catch Most people get their operating system with their computer. Failing that, they will buy an install CD on Amazon and take their machine to the local computer store for them to install. For many, the idea of downloading a program off the internet and replacing their trusty Windows install is unthinkable. There are other legitimate concerns that people might have when it comes to upgrading to Linux. They may be concerned that effectively they will have to re-learn how to use their computer. They may be afraid to lose the programs they have come to depend upon. This is the point where you do a hands-on demo, and show that they’ve got nothing to worry about. Chromium works just like internet Explorer. LibreOffice works just like Microsoft Office. Their printer will still work. They will still be able to check their emails, and play Solitaire online. Show them that Linux Mint looks unmistakably like Windows XP, and the real-world difference isn’t as great as they might think. Some people may be skeptical about the nature of free software itself. After all why would someone work for free, unless there’s a catch? After all, there’s no such thing as a free meal. At this point, it might help to point out that lots of household names have contributed to Linux, including Intel, AMD, IBM, Nokia, Samsung, Google, Fujitsu, and Microsoft, according to a 2012 report from The Linux Foundation (PDF). You should point out that Linux is so good, it’s used everywhere: from banking systems, to the computers used on Boeing’s P-8A military aircraft. From desktop computers, to smartphones and automobiles. If it sucked, these very serious companies wouldn’t spend their time, money, and resources working on it. Neither would the financial services industry depend on it. Once They’re Convinced, Follow Up This is my last point. It’s a short one, I promise. If you convince someone to start using Linux, you had best make sure that their experience is a good one. You can do this by simply being around and making the first few weeks with it as easy as possible. When you choose a distro for them, pick one that’s likely to be gentle and familiar The Best Linux Distros for First Time Switchers from Windows and Mac The Best Linux Distros for First Time Switchers from Windows and Mac Linux has an intimidating image, making it seem like it would be difficult to start using it. But the switch from Windows and Mac is actually pretty easy, if you can ease yourself into it. Read More . Be patient, and answer questions. Above all, be understanding. Try and see their concerns and frustrations from the perspective of someone being introduced to something very foreign for the first time. If you leave them to fend for themselves, it’ll be a disaster, and they’ll leave this experience thinking that Linux is confusing, difficult, and not worth learning. What a shame that would be. Have you convinced any of your relatives to start using Linux? If so, how did you do it? What lessons did you learn? Let me know in the comments below.

September 30, 2016 at 6:00 pm I indeed have converted quite a few people over to Linux. As to how I did it, it definitely depended on the situation. the most difficult instance was with my Mom, her Dell Latitude laptop was old, and it was running Windows XP, and it was literally bogged down with viruses, malware, adware and all manner of things popping up every 10 seconds. Her McAfee was not able to update because of the infections her machine had, and then one day in August of 2009? her laptop froze when she tried to open Internet Explorer, and even after a reboot it took over 47 minutes to arrive at the desktop! (Yes I timed it!) I had to introduce her to Linux Mint slowly, first by showing her a few screen shots that I printed up, then showing her the real thing on one of my three laptops, I didn't just SHOW her, I lent her the laptop for about a week so that she would be comfortable using Linux daily. She didn't have any boutique software she needed. She only ever went online for recipes, and would email family and friends that lived elsewhere. She had never used Skype on her Windows XP laptop and when I showed her how to use it on Linux Mint, she was hooked. I took her laptop home with me and in one night had installed everything she would need. I customized the KDE desktop so that it resembled her old Windows machine, (I even downloaded and applied the Windows XP "standard" background!) After showing her how to use LibreOffice and informing her that there WERE no ".exe" files for her to click on, she was ok. Although I DID have to reiterate to her on multiple occasions that there was no need for an antivirus on her "new" old laptop. (In the end I installed ClamAV to put her mind at ease..) That was back when Linux Mint was on release version 7 ("Gloria" ) and she's been using it veer since. She went through a bit of an issue with KDE and so later on I moved her to MATE and she's been using it happily since then, she's now running Linux Mint 18 ("Sarah") with the same MATE desktop environment. She was the only person who was the most challenging to convert, I've also helped my oldest sister, my younger brother, my three cousins, and their parents and an array of others make the switch and have had no complaints or problems yet. I think the main reason why some people have such a difficult time with Linux is because they have become so "comfortable" and complacent with Windows. They are so "used" to having to install an anti-virus , having to defrag their machine, needing to purchase a license for the "full" version of their office suite, that they don't know how to deal with NOT having to do these things. But once you get them to agree to TRY Linux? then you're halfway there. I do agree with the author if their first encounter with Linux proves too confusing and frustrating? most likely they will find someone or go to some store and have Windows re-installed. Reply JJ September 28, 2016 at 3:23 pm The year of the Linux desktop... if the corporate resources given to Linux server were available it will happen. Until then, more education toward how to make projects secure in code and design needs to happen. This is how you will win the masses in the near future. Keep them safe. Reply Allen L. Starr September 26, 2016 at 2:10 am You make some excellent points. For many of the reasons you identified, I am using a Chromebook for most of my work (I don't play games on my computer). Due to the way Google controls their Chrome OS updates and their hardware requirements, I have had no problems withe Chromebook software updates. I have to spend about an hour/week/computer to check for Windows updates, antivirus/malware app updates, backup data - don't have to do this with a Chromebook. However, I still use a Windows machines for things like Quicken and tax programs. And YES, I had to fiddle with the Chromebook privacy settings to prevent "giving away the store". Reply Igor Šulji? September 25, 2016 at 10:35 pm How about an extreme case. My mother in law is an old fashioned lady with entire lack of any interest in tech. The one who gave up driving because of the maintenance issues, the one who instantly looks for a male when the light bulb goes out. When she had to start using computer to be able to keep making money on translating, I (being myself Windows user at the time) tried with Windows 2000 (probably the best Windows up to Win7). In next 12 years she never actually learned how to use it, and I was in charge daily. Windows is very, very far from intuitive easy-to-learn OS for computer newbies. There are those complicated metaphorae of files and folders, and totally unclear things like drive, and relation between My Documents, My Computer, My Music etc. The fact that some people believe it is easy is due exclusively to extensive brainwashing. Like, the only reason anyone ever lighted a cigarette, drank a cup of coffee, or went to the cinema to see the most recent US blockbuster is because everyone else does so. Not that it is pleasant or doing any good. Instead one has to get used to it and it takes time. Then, as her old PC came to the end of its life, we bought her an Acer Aspire Revo R3610 as a birthday present. Decent little machine for a person of her needs. There was some strange Linpus Linux preinstalled that was conceived as fast booting pre-Windows auxiliary OS in the case user only needs to check mail or show some photos to family. Now this was really simple user interface. There were few big buttons on the initial screen: Documents, Internet, Multimedia, Files, Settings. And finally, after 12 years, the lady was in command of her system, suited to her ambitions and needs. Unfortunately, Linpus was very strange occurrence of Linux distro. Updating programs and OS itself proved impossible, as it was probably project goal no.1. Revo was supposed to be Windows machine for the poor. So, we had to go on. After some research I picked Mageia Linux with KDE, and adjusted it so that there are three virtual desktops: Internet, Work and Pastime, with filesystem panels peeping into respective folders, and the others containing .desktop application starters, but only the necessary ones. So here I am doing the system and programs update every week or two, without any other maintenance duty. No complains. IF my mother in law were happy with Windows, and not in constant need of tech support (usually urgent and at the worst time, while I was at work), or willing and able to pay for one, I would never object. Reply jymm September 24, 2016 at 10:55 am Most people are just afraid of the unknown, and Linux is unknown to so many. I have relatives that have me look at their computer everytime I am there. It always has four or five tool bars installed on the browser. They have no idea where they come from, even though I have explained multiple times. I showed them how much faster their computer runs on Linux from a USB driver compared to their Windoze Vista installation. I used Mate and made it look just like Windoze for them. Their printer was an HP and easily set up with Linux. Vista was hardware intensive and they bought a excellent computer. Now they want to buy a cheap Win10 computer. I am positive they will again be disappointed. Yet you cannot get them to change. Fear of the unknown. Reply Joshua September 23, 2016 at 3:48 pm I'm a huge Linux lover. I've switched almost entirely from Windows. A while back, my grandpa had an old computer running winXP (HP pavilion). He was sick and tired of it being slow, and him having me come and clean out all the junk. I introduced him to Linux, and I installed Linux Mint. It kind of backfired because it was almost as slow as windows. I put lxde on top of it to make it faster. He liked it and used it for a good long time. Just recently he went to best buy and bought a new PC with Win10 on it. I've tried to get him to have me put Linux on it, but he has the "if it ain't broke don't fix it" attitude. He used to be a nut about security but now it seems he doesn't care! What should I do? Reply Kev Quirk September 24, 2016 at 11:05 am I think the only thing you can really do is wait. Your grandpa clearly isn't interested in moving back over to Linux at this point, maybe he's having fun exploring Win10. I know always enjoy playing around in a new OS. He clearly knows the advantages of running Linux, as you said he's security conscious. So I would simply explain that if/when he decides he wants to move back to Linux, you will help. If he moves over under duress, thanks to a virus etc, the worst thing you could do at that point is hit with "I told you so". Just support him and help in transition over when/if the need arises. Good luck! Reply RedandShare September 27, 2016 at 1:58 pm “I'm a huge Linux lover. I've switched almost entirely from Windows.” It's sentiments like this that makes me hesitant about Linux. A huge Linux lover would presumably be very proficient; and yet, still cannot jettison Windows? I like Windows enough. So Linux is really so much better and safer? I would consider, but not if it means learning/maintaining two separate OSes forever! Reply Paul Paul September 30, 2016 at 3:40 pm I too am a huge Linux lover, but that does not mean that I do not exist in the "real world", and that real world means occasionally having a need for Windoze. As soon as I can get true decent replacements for certain programs, then it's Linux all the way -- until then, I live with both. You should have NO hesitation about Linux ... it runs circles around Windoze. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Sep 26, 2016 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp G7 transportation heads back US guidelines AP, TOKYO US Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, second right, talks with Japanese Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Minister Keiichi Ishii, second left, during a meeting on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in Karuizawa, Japan, on Friday. Photo: AP US Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx yesterday said that his counterparts in the G7 nations welcomed US guidelines on regulating self-driving cars and have agreed to work together on creating such standards to maintain safety. “There was actually a very enthusiastic reception to the policy,” he said. “We did a good job of inventorying what each country is doing and laying out areas that we want to explore further.” Such issues include cybersecurity, ethics and privacy, wireless spectrum questions and many other issues, he said, while noting that reaching a resolution might take years, meaning the technology would be moving faster. Foxx called the US guidelines released earlier this month the most comprehensive on autonomous vehicles, coming out ahead of the rest of the world. He and other transportation officials from the G7 met over the weekend in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa. Speaking by telephone, Foxx stressed road tests on autonomous vehicles must continue to encourage innovation. US electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc’s Model S that was using the semi-autonomous mode crashed in May. The driver died after crashing into a tractor-trailer. Tesla is introducing improvements to its Autopilot system to make it safer. “One of the things I think that autonomous vehicles suffer from is that they get compared to perfection, and not to the 94 percent of car crashes that are attributable to human factors. We have to make the right comparisons,” Foxx said, while declining comment on the ongoing investigation on Tesla. “These vehicles will not be absolutely perfect in terms of having no accidents, but by comparison they can be markedly better.” Many automakers besides Tesla are testing or have rolled out automated vehicles, including Ford Motor Co, based in Dearborn, Michigan, and Nissan Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp of Japan. The new US guidelines are meant to bring order to the technology’s development. Proponents say such technology can make cars safer because machines can react faster and they are less prone to human error. However, even experts remain cautious. Among the recent forays into self-driving technology are the partnership between Chinese-owned Volvo Cars Corp and the Swedish-based automotive safety group Autoliv Inc, as well as Volvo teaming up with US ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. Ford has announced a US$75 million investment in Velodyne Inc, which makes laser sensors. BMW Group, Intel Corp and Mobileye NV have joined together to develop and sell autonomous driving technology. Hans Greimel, Asia editor for Automotive News, believes the new US guidelines are an important “proactive” step in seeking powers to approve autonomous vehicles before they’re brought to market, marking a departure from the past, when regulators enforce rules after the cars are already sold. “They are a clear step toward clearing the way for the next-generation of automobiles. The technology of autonomous vehicles is mostly there. What is lacking is a clear guideline for how the technologies should be applied,” Greimel said. This story has been viewed 1219 times.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple promises fix for iOS 10’s iTunes backup security flaw Adam Westlake - Sep 25, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Security forensics company Elcomsoft revealed last week that encrypted iOS backups created in iTunes have been made far less secure with the recent release of iOS 10. While an unintentional flaw, the new password protected backups offer an “alternative password verification mechanism” that allows them to fall victim to brute force hacks much more quickly and easily than with previous iOS versions. Fortunately Apple acknowledged the issue, and says a fix is on the way with “an upcoming security update.” To be clear, this is an issue that only applies to local iTunes backups created on a Mac or PC; backups made to iCloud remain secure. As Elcomsoft explains, iOS 10’s backup method “skips certain security checks,” which in turn allows passwords to be attempted “approximately 2,500 times faster” than before when using brute force. A source of the problem seems to be the use of a different algorithm, which only runs password attempt once, as opposed to running each password 10,000 times like with iOS 4 through 9. “At this time, we have an early implementation featuring CPU-only recovery. The new security check is approximately 2,500 times weaker compared to the old one that was used in iOS 9 backups. At this time, we are getting these speeds: iOS 9 (CPU): 2,400 passwords per second (Intel i5) iOS 9 (GPU): 150,000 passwords per second (NVIDIA GTX 1080) iOS 10 (CPU): 6,000,000 passwords per second (Intel i5)” Getting access to a password protected iOS backup is a serious concern, as it’s essentially a copy of all the data from an iPhone, including contact details like phone numbers, emails, addresses, in addition to photos and even other passwords stored in Keychain. Apple has issued a statement noting that it’s aware of the problem with local iTunes backups for iOS 10 and an upcoming security update will resolve the issue. iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12.1 updates were recently released for developers and beta testers, so hopefully those will include the necessary fixes.

Osipov previously commanded a paratrooper unit of Russian army in Anapa The Interior Ministry of Ukraine revealed the details on the murdered in Luhansk Russian colonel. As Ministry's speaker Artem Shevchenko wrote on Facebook, Deputy Commander of Kremlin-sponsored ‘2nd Army Corps' of the puppet state ‘Luhansk Peoples Republic' Alexander Osipov  (nicknamed ‘Orlov') previously served as a paratrooper commander in a Russian army unit in Anapa (Krasnodarsk region, Caucasus, Russia).  "Paratrooper, really big bump. He could serve way along in Anapa, now he is dead in separatists showdown in our land. Suicide of the "premier-minister" Tsypkalov – seems to be logical part of the same case," Shevchenko says in his statement. Open sources say, that in the town of Anapa the base of Guards Artillery Regiment №1141 is placed. This unit is a part of 7th Airborne Assault Division of Russian Army. According to Ukrainian volunteers, units of this division took part in Russian invasion to Ukrainian Donbas in 2014 and 2015, in particular - during the battle of Ilovaysk.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) TOKYO (AP) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Sunday that his counterparts in the Group of Seven nations welcomed U.S. guidelines on regulating self-driving cars and have agreed to work together on creating such standards to maintain safety. “There was actually a very enthusiastic reception to the policy,” he said. “We did a good job of inventorying what each country is doing and laying out areas that we want to explore further.” Such issues include cybersecurity, ethics and privacy, wireless spectrum questions and many other issues, he said, while noting that reaching a resolution might take years, meaning the technology would be moving faster. Foxx called the U.S. guidelines released earlier this month the most comprehensive on autonomous vehicles, coming out ahead of the rest of the world. Foxx and other transportation officials from the G-7 met over the weekend in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa. Speaking by telephone with The Associated Press, Foxx stressed road tests on autonomous vehicles must continue to encourage innovation. U.S. electric car-maker Tesla’s Model S that was using the semi-autonomous mode crashed in May. The driver died after crashing into a tractor-trailer. Tesla is introducing improvements to its Autopilot system to make it safer. “One of the things I think that autonomous vehicles suffer from is that they get compared to perfection, and not to the 94 percent of car crashes that are attributable to human factors. We have to make the right comparisons,” Foxx said, while declining to comment on the ongoing investigation on Tesla. “These vehicles will not be absolutely perfect in terms of having no accidents, but by comparison they can be markedly better.” Many automakers besides Tesla are testing or have rolled out automated vehicles, including Ford Motor Co., based in Dearborn, Michigan, and Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan. The new U.S. guidelines are meant to bring order to the technology’s development. Proponents say such technology can make cars safer because machines can react faster and they are less prone to human error. But even experts remain cautious. Among the recent forays into self-driving technology are the partnership between Chinese-owned Volvo Cars and the Swedish-based automotive safety group Autoliv Inc., as well as Volvo teaming up with U.S. ride-hailing company Uber. Ford has announced a $75 million investment in Velodyne Inc., which makes laser sensors. BMW Group, Intel Corp. and Mobileye have joined together to develop and sell autonomous driving technology. Hans Greimel, Asia Editor for Automotive News, believes the new U.S. guidelines are an important “proactive” step in seeking powers to approve autonomous vehicles before they’re brought to market, marking a departure from the past, when regulators enforce rules after the cars are already sold. “They are a clear step toward clearing the way for the next generation of automobiles. The technology of autonomous vehicles is mostly there. What is lacking is a clear guideline for how the technologies should be applied,” said Greimel.

However, an iOS 10 security flaw can compromise it. Elcomsoft, a Russian forensics research firm, has discovered a dangerous loophole in iOS 10 which can allow hackers to crack the otherwise password-protected iPhone backups 40 times faster than before. These backups contain your passwords and other authentication data related to your phone as well as the apps. Apple spokeswoman confirmed to Forbes that the iPhone maker acknowledges the issue and is working on a fix. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing the issue in an upcoming security update.” The iOS 10’s security flaw might raise concern among iPhone users, considering the history of iCloud hacks which lead to theft of their photos and other private data. Apple acknowledges iOS 10 security flaw that makes it easier to access protected iTunes backups https://t.co/2l8XQV8GVj pic.twitter.com/xn40ofen10 — 9to5Mac  (@9to5mac) September 25, 2016 Security researcher Oleg Afonin elucidated on Elcomsoft’s blog that the attack is specific to password-protected local backups (on the Mac or PC) produced by iOS 10 devices. Apple spokeswoman clarified that the loophole doesn’t affect iCloud. “This does not affect iCloud backups.” The security flaw affects the local backups created using the iOS 10 running iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 5s. These iPhone models are safe as Apple has integrated a special security hardware system called Secure Enclave. Implemented since the iOS 9 on iPhones, the Secure Enclave safeguards the sensitive code that deals with hash keys for encrypting phone data and controls Apple Pay as well as Touch ID. This module is responsible for delaying every incorrect password guessing attempt. That’s why the time increases every time someone feeds an incorrect passcode on an iPhone. The module wipes out all data from the iPhone after 10 failed attempts to guess the password. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLGFriOKz6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Unfortunately, there is no similar mechanism employed with the iPhone backups created using iTunes on the Mac or PC. Graham Cluley, a veteran security analyst, noted on Graham Cluley Security News that a hacker will have to target the computer to exploit the security flaw on which the iPhone backup was taken, instead of trying to gain control of the iPhone. Usually, the Mac or PCs protect the local iTunes backups by saving the passwords as hash keys in an encrypted file. In iOS 9, Apple added several security checks which need to be cleared to gain access to the local backup on the Mac or PC. But with the iOS 10, Apple has implemented a weaker algorithm for creating hash keys for storing the passwords. That allows hackers or law enforcers to use a sophisticated software for guessing the best match for the password stored in the hash. Afonin explains that this new password verification method in the iOS 10 appears to be 2,500 times weaker than the one in iOS 9. To prove that, he used an Intel Core i5 processor-based system to conduct a brute-force attack of guessing 6 million passwords per second for the iOS 10 backups. The same tool could guess 2,400 passwords per second for the iOS 9 backups. One way to deal with Apple’s iOS security flaw: jump right ahead to iOS 10 https://t.co/9AbJ80wBVI pic.twitter.com/WeSKA6z7oD — Forbes Tech News (@ForbesTech) August 28, 2016 Such alarming rate of guessing passwords by software can turn out to be a nightmare for Apple. Elcomsoft’s CEO Vladimir Katalov told Motherboard that Apple’s security team reached out to his company seeking more details about the security flaw in iOS 10. “Apple is definitely aware they have implemented [the flaw] themselves :)” The iPhone users are recommended to set strong passwords for their Mac or PC to prevent easy unauthorized access. That should be an ideal practice but in this case, it is necessary. In addition to that, the Mac users can utilize the FileVault feature to encrypt and secure all data on your disk, as suggested on Apple Support pages. You are required to enter your login password, and the FileVault will randomly generate a recovery key which is necessary to access the encrypted file. So make sure you save both details carefully, or else you will be locked out from accessing the encrypted data. Katalov believes that a security update for iOS 10 may not be an easy solution to this security flaw. According to him, a holistic approach is required from Apple to overcome this issue. He told Motherboard in an email, “So I guess that not just iOS update is needed, but also iTunes update as well, and probably some changes to the backup format.” So expect Apple to address iOS 10’s security flaw by releasing updates for several software including iOS, iTunes, and its Mac operating systems.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson New leaks have revealed that the Microsoft Surface Phone will have a fingerprint sensor and an AMOLED display. High-end phones are increasingly sporting the fingerprint sensor and Microsoft too wants to join the bandwagon and increase its market share. The Redmond-based company couldn’t do much with their Lumia series and now they must be extra careful when releasing a smartphone. According to YIBADA, Microsoft has filed a patent for “fingerprint detection with transparent cover” and hence tech experts believe the Microsoft Surface Phone will have the feature. Tech Times confirmed the news. If the said technology is adopted by the company, the Surface Phone will be much thinner compared to other phones due to the absence of a bulky sensor. The WIPO report can be found here. The new scanner is said to provide added security to users as the phones will unlock only when they place their fingers on the display panel. The Microsoft Surface Phone will unlock once the scanner scans the crests of the owner’s finger. The handset will have a sleeker chassis and an AMOLED display panel. Reports further suggest that the Microsoft Surface Phone will be available in two variants, one for the general consumer and the other for the business consumer. The former will have a 5.5-inch screen and the latter a 6-inch screen. The Microsoft Surface Phone will be powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor for heavy-duty performance. The base model will have a 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. The high-end model will feature an 8GB RAM and 512GB internal storage. The Microsoft Surface Phone will run on Windows 10 and will have a 21MP rear and 8MP front camera. Microsoft may release the device early 2017 during its technical event, writes Mobile & Apps. After Lumia failed to deliver, it seems that Microsoft is keeping no stone unturned and will provide only the best of specs to compete with the very best.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Innovation Update: Fortscale User and Entity Behavior Analytics for Healthcare Organizations Innovation Update: Fortscale User and Entity Behavior Analytics for Healthcare Organizations Posted on September 26, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Fortscale Now Preventing Data Theft of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) San Mateo, California (PRWEB) September 26, 2016 Fortscale Security Ltd., the innovative pioneer in machine learning-based user behavior analytics for security (UEBA), today introduced new ways for healthcare security professionals to detect threats and stop data breaches of electronic health records (EHR) and personally identifiable information (PII). Breaches of EHR and PII are a big problem. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which manages and reports on HIPAA compliance reports that: 340% increase in cyber attack volume within Healthcare organizations, compared to other industries. 81% of healthcare organizations have been compromised by cyber attacks within the past 2 years. EHR Systems are the #1 target for malicious insiders and attackers with stolen credentials. “EHR systems are very chaotic and dynamic. Companies lack effective means for tracking and auditing malicious internal user access to HER systems,” explained Idan Tendler, CEO and Co-Founder of Fortscale. “Existing systems such as SIEM and DLP, which are rules-based, are ineffective as they only address known threats.” Steve Katz, Executive Advisor Security & Privacy at Deloitte and former Executive Advisor to Head of Technology Risk at Kaiser Permanente adds, “With machine learning-based algorithms, Fortscale’s UEBA is able to accurately and efficiently detect the non-typical and unknown behavior of users and entities in the healthcare organization that pose a security threat.” For example, Fortscale’s UEBA applies unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous access to restricted or sensitive data. This access would not be detected by SIEMs or rules-based systems, leaving healthcare organization open to unauthorized access and breaches. Fortscale also has new user experience and interface that makes it easier for healthcare security professionals to identify, investigate and stop insider threats. For more information about Fortscale UEBA, you can download the data sheet. Fortscale’s innovation continues to garner recognition for fundamental advancements in UEBA technology. Fortscale was named “2016 Leader in Threat Detection” by Cyber Defense Magazine and a “Cool Vendor” in the “Gartner Cool Vendors in Identity and Access Management and Fraud, 2016” report by Gartner, Inc. About Fortscale Fortscale ends insider threats with a totally new generation of rule-free, autonomous behavior analytics based on machine learning. With no rules to set up, Fortscale’s user behavior analytics engine starts getting smarter the second you turn it on. Fortscale models your users and systems autonomously, on-the-fly. Fortscale spots anomalous behavior quickly, accurately and doesn’t need constant “babysitting.” It might sound like magic, but it’s mostly just really good math – and only Fortscale has it. Backed by Intel Capital and Blumberg Capital, Fortscale ends insider threats, lowers analyst stress-levels and makes your whole security operation work a whole lot better.

News & Analysis Imagination 2.0 Update Ships Profits expected this year after reorg Rick Merritt 9/26/2016 10:45 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — The MIPS core will be used in a new cellular baseband processor shipping next year and a supercomputer in the works in Japan. The two data points are welcome news at Imagination Technologies as it puts the finishing touches on a reorganization and reflects on directions in licensing. Earlier this year the company, which also designs PowerVR cores used in Apple iPhones, posted its biggest loss ever, prompting its chief executive to leave the company. New CEO Andrew Heath has plans by the end of the year to sell three business units that should get the company back in the black. Sales of the Pure digital-audio broadcast unit, Hellosoft and an SoC design services group will bring in less than $10 million and take the company’s headcount down to about 1,200. “That puts us at an opex level paid for by our royalty stream with licensing revenue taking us above that and making us profitable this year,” said Heath, a former non-executive director of the company. Despite rumors earlier this year that Apple might buy the company to ensure its access to PowerVR GPU cores, the two never got into serious discussions and no other deals are in the works. “My agreement with the board is not to go out and sell the business, we are pursuing an independent strategy of an IP licensing business,” he said. The company’s current strategy is a practical one. It does not aim to go head-to head with ARM, “that would be a fool’s errand,” Heath said. Instead it will “build defensible positions around existing markets in networking, home gateways, set-top boxes, automotive” and specific verticals in the Internet of Things that can use MIPS’ capabilities in hardware multithreading and virtualization, he said. The set-top market where MIPS holds sway is set for an uptick in royalties. Broadcom recently reported it cannot make set-top SoCs fast enough, attributing demand to a burst of orders for 4K systems. Heath thinks Broadcom is also gaining sales in China for lower-end products. The company is not saying whose cellular baseband will use MIPS next year, but if revenues will be significant they presumably come from one of the top three players — Qualcomm, Mediatek or Intel. Separately, PowerVR cores will be used in some virtual reality products hitting this holiday season. Japan’s Pezy Computing, a designer of massive multicore processors for high-performance systems, is working on a MIPS-based project. However, it is not likely to be at the level of the ARM-based supercomputer Fujitsu is developing in Japan. Pezy tends to focus on highly power- and cost-efficient systems.
