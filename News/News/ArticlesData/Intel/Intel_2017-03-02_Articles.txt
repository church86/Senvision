BUSINESS Foxconn's broken pledges cast doubt on Trump jobs plan Promised jobs Mark Makela / For the Washington Post Old cars are parked across the street from the Foxconn office in Harrisburg, Pa. Old cars are parked across the street from the Foxconn office in Harrisburg, Pa. (Mark Makela / For the Washington Post) Todd C. Frankel For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn's recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn's chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania's governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn's decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing's strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. "It just seemed to fade to black" after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Can Trump's White House investigate itself? Tuesday is election day in L.A.

What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. "I'm delivering on everything we promised," Trump said Thursday during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. "People are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency." Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump's election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have also made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump's delight. But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge. "They are scrambling to look good," said Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University's East Asian program. "It's a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda." Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. "It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way," Moel said. "They are saying: 'I'm along for the ride. Here's my proposal.'" If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. "The government themselves aren't going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that," Moel said. "What's the downside?" Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It's why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, President Obama visited a new $5-billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as "an example of an America that is within our reach." But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7-billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Two days after Trump's inauguration, Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn't iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be "Made in the USA" — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Foxconn said in a statement that it is "exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations." But the company could not confirm "the number of jobs that might be created." Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. Gou, Foxconn's founder, for years has described the United States as a "must-go market." In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the U.S. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn's investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5-billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10-billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. "There's a pattern here," said Moel, the analyst. Gou's plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan's bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company's history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create "high-precision, high-tech, high-value-added manufacturing in the U.S." Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. "IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US," wrote the China Post. "Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania," CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and that the company was busy scouting sites. "There was this intense buzz," recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. "Lots of us were excited by the opportunity," said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. "Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that's a big deal." For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with the Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30-million factory. "It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction," Manning said. The $30-million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10-million donation to Carnegie Mellon was "moving forward very successfully," with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn's investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn's U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn's $30-million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after the Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement, but "[u]nfortunately, a project did not come to fruition." Foxconn attributed the failure to "material changes to the business and operating climate at that time." "The proof is always in the pudding," said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. "But it is important to be skeptical," Andes said. "I would hope it's not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies." Todd C.

"While this situation is not an immediate cause for concern about the operation of any of these models, we understand that customers might have questions," the company said in a statement. "We will be reaching out to all registered customers of the affected models over the next several months to determine the appropriate actions for their situations." The four product lines – ReadyNAS devices RN3130 and RN3138, and Wi-Fi managers WC7500 and WC7600v2 – happen to have a common component, Intel's Atom C2000 line of chips, which Intel has acknowledged had problems until recently. As many as 16 specific models in this group of four lines may be affected. Intel's chip errata, published in January, identified the B0 stepping of Atoms in the C2000 range as having faulty clock outputs that fail far sooner than they should. When that happens, affected devices will no longer boot. The shoddy chips started shipping in 2013 and continued to be sold until late last year. Intel has refused to disclose how much subpar silicon it has sold. Asked whether Intel's flawed chip was to blame, a Netgear spokesperson told The Register, "We're not naming the vendor but it sounds as if you've done your research." An industry source who spoke to The Register about this issue last month said Intel's customers may be bound by nondisclosure agreements for issues related to Intel technology. Netgear's spokesperson declined to provide the number of affected units, but allowed that the outreach effort to contact customers "is pretty big." Intel's CFO earlier this year indicated that the company had set aside funds to deal with the financial fallout, which presumably involves subsidizing replacement or repair costs incurred by its customers. In a statement emailed to The Register, Richard Jonker, VP of SMB product line management for Netgear, said: "Netgear is taking full responsibility for this component supplier concern and we can state at this time that we are issuing a full-scale recall for the affected products. We will be contacting all registered owners of these products and providing a swap where they will receive a new product and the affected product will be returned to Netgear." Jonker said Netgear takes pride in its supplier relationships and is working with them to provide the best experience for customers. He said the company intends to stand by its warranties and will endeavor to minimize the impact on customers. Other vendors and service providers that have used Intel's Atom C2000 chips and appear to have been affected include: Aaeon, ASRock Rack, Checkpoint, Cisco, Dell, Fortinet, HP, Infortrend, iXsystems, Online/Scaleway, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgate, Quanta, Seagate, Sophos, Supermicro, Synology, and ZNYX Networks. ® Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Regular or premium?

Twitter Facebook IoT and 5G are driving computing to the edge More computing is happening on edge devices to handle the information overload Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 04 March, 2017 08:27 - - - - print email Comments By 2020, an average internet user will use 1.5GB of traffic a day, and daily video traffic will reach 1PB, Intel predicts. A huge amount of data will be generated by autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, and internet-of-things devices. Every day, more information is being collected and sent to faster servers in mega data centers, which analyze and make sense of it. That analysis has helped improved image and speech recognition and is making autonomous cars a reality. Emerging superfast data networks like 5G -- a melting pot of wireless technologies -- will dispatch even more gathered information, which could stress data centers. Servers are already being redesigned to handle more data, and throughput technologies like Gen-Z and fiber optics will reduce latency. At Mobile World Congress this week, computing on the edge was a big topic among infrastructure providers. Edge computing involves light processing on intermediary servers or on the edge of the networks. This type of computing can lead to faster responses for mobile services, without putting stress on servers in the core network. Edge computing can also provide instant analytics to ensure the junk information is discarded and only useful information reaches servers on the core network. Edge computing is also emerging for virtualization, which slices loads of data in smaller packages rerouted to the right servers to be handled. At MWC, many companies showed products and shared new ideas for computing on the edge. Most vendors had a common goal: to better control the flow and make better sense of data, especially with more data being collected by IoT devices. Hewlett Packard Enterprise showed off its latest generation of IoT servers called Edgeline, similar to the company's Proliant servers but slimmed down. The servers sit on the edge and are able to analyze data before sending them to core servers in data centers. The servers can virtualize data packets on the edge, which then makes better use of computing resources. For example, the Edgeline servers can handle mobile computing tasks, like responding to Facebook posts or search requests, on the edge. More intense data tasks, like image recognition, can be routed back to the centralized data center network, which handles machine learning tasks. Nearby, Dell was showing off its Edge Gateway 3000 servers for multiple IoT applications. The servers can analyze data at the point of collection and dispatch them to the data center. These servers use Intel's latest Atom chips, which have up to 16 cores. The Model 3001 is targeted toward industrial automation and energy management; the Model 3002 is aimed at transportation and logistics and fits into large vehicles like trucks; and the Model 3003 is designed for video streaming and point-of-sale applications. The servers use new Xeon-D or Atom chips from Intel, which were shown by the chipmaker on the floor of the show. The chips are targeted at edge servers and networking gear. These chips are not as powerful as the Xeon E5 chips used in mainstream servers in data centers. Ubuntu showed off some Open Compute Project network router designs with edge processing. The routers ran Ubuntu Snappy Core and can run software for edge processing. These routers are servers in their own right and reduce the load on high-end servers. Ubuntu "snaps" -- which are like apps -- can be tuned for specific edge processing tasks. More information about new edge router designs will be shared at Open Compute Project Summit next week. Another interesting demo at the Ubuntu booth showed an ARM server doing edge processing for 5G networks. The ARM servers had 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2 chips that are already being used in networking gear but also could double up as low-power server chips for more powerful edge processing. Powerful CPUs aren't needed for edge processing, but chips need to able to collate large datasets and ensure they are virtualized and redirected properly. ARM servers chips can virtualize data with the ARMv8 64-bit architecture, which has been adopted by chipmakers like Cavium. Edge processing will be important for autonomous cars as well. The ultimate vision is that autonomous cars will be able to connect to superfast servers in the cloud to recognize images, draw up maps, and make better driving decisions. But those connections may not always be possible, which is where edge processing on the autonomous car will step in. Intel and Qualcomm are providing unique circuitry for handling edge processing in autonomous vehicles. Intel is pushing FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) into autonomous vehicles to handle specific tasks, while Qualcomm is relying on digital signal processors. FPGAs and other components are key components for autonomous cars and a flexible 5G infrastructure, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and the Systems Architecture Group. Edge processing is also becoming a priority for telecom providers, which are looking for ways to add flexibility to the services they provide to customers. For example, SK Telecom -- which is testing 5G rollouts in South Korea -- found edge processing valuable in virtualizing its data and radio networks. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Another interesting demo at the Ubuntu booth showed an ARM server doing edge processing for 5G networks. The ARM servers had 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2 chips that are already being used in networking gear but also could double up as low-power server chips for more powerful edge processing. Powerful CPUs aren't needed for edge processing, but chips need to able to collate large datasets and ensure they are virtualized and redirected properly. ARM servers chips can virtualize data with the ARMv8 64-bit architecture, which has been adopted by chipmakers like Cavium. Edge processing will be important for autonomous cars as well. The ultimate vision is that autonomous cars will be able to connect to superfast servers in the cloud to recognize images, draw up maps, and make better driving decisions. But those connections may not always be possible, which is where edge processing on the autonomous car will step in. Intel and Qualcomm are providing unique circuitry for handling edge processing in autonomous vehicles. Intel is pushing FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) into autonomous vehicles to handle specific tasks, while Qualcomm is relying on digital signal processors. FPGAs and other components are key components for autonomous cars and a flexible 5G infrastructure, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and the Systems Architecture Group. Edge processing is also becoming a priority for telecom providers, which are looking for ways to add flexibility to the services they provide to customers. For example, SK Telecom -- which is testing 5G rollouts in South Korea -- found edge processing valuable in virtualizing its data and radio networks.

Tech Industry by Erin Carson March 2, 2017 1:11 PM PST @erincarson Gavin Grimm has a lot of support from Silicon Valley. The Washington Post/Getty Images Tech is throwing its support behind transgender rights in connection with an upcoming US Supreme Court case. The Human Rights Campaign said Thursday that 53 companies signed an amicus brief in support of Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy from Virginia, who sued his school board in Gloucester County over the right to use the bathroom that aligns with his gender identity. More than half the companies that signed the brief are tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, eBay, IBM, Intel, Twitter and Yahoo. "Across the country, corporate leaders are speaking out because they know attacking transgender youth isn't just shameful -- it also puts the families of their employees and customers at risk," said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, in a statement. Chipmaker Intel wrote a blog post in addition to signing the brief, saying, "Intel signed this amicus brief to stand with our LGBTQ colleagues, customers, communities, suppliers and partners, and we firmly believe that equality for LGBTQ individuals is a civil right." Several of the companies that signed the brief didn't immediately respond to a request for comment or said they had nothing to add beyond the brief. Tech has become increasingly involved with social issues. In the past several years, companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have released diversity reports and adopted policies and practices to become less homogenous. Companies also spoke out against President Donald Trump's January executive order on immigration. The topic of who can use which bathroom has been hotly debated. In February, Trump reversed policies former President Barack Obama made in 2016 to let transgender public school students use bathrooms matching their gender identity. A number of tech companies spoke out at the time. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, tweeted, "Rolling back rights for transgender students is wrong. Twitter and Square stand with the LGBTQ community, always." IBM stated at the time of the policy reversal: "IBM has had an explicit policy of non-discrimination based on gender identity or expression since 2002, and we are opposed to discrimination in all its forms, including any policies that discriminate based on gender identity in education." This isn't the first time tech has weighed in on transgender issues. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was a vocal opponent of North Carolina's law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their gender at birth. PayPal protested by nixing plans last year to expand in Charlotte, North Carolina, and companies like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco and eBay signed an amicus brief in 2016 supporting the Justice Department's effort to block the so-called "bathroom bill." "Every child deserves an opportunity to succeed free of fear, anxiety, and threats of discrimination. Salesforce strongly believes that all students, including transgender students, should be treated as equals, and we disagree with any effort to limit their rights. Equality for all," Salesforce said in a statement regarding Thursday's brief. That brief will be submitted with Grimm's case, which is expected go before the Supreme Court on March 28.

Intel is Trying to Manipulate AMD Ryzen Launch? by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 02/27/2017 10:07 AM | Source | 128 comment(s) Yesterday in the forums somebody asked if we received Intel review guidelines from Intel for the Ryzen review as well. A very curious question, I answered no. And if they did we simply never use them as we do things our own way (as we always do). They question itself was already curious but if we dive deeper into the story we see the claims have been made by Semi-Accurate, not the most unbiased source. Then again, we see no reason for them to make this stuff up. Also some other press apparently received that email. So yes, as it seems Intel has been reaching out to certain media in shameless attempt to influence upcoming benchmark scores in their favor. Intel's PR department is contacting media and calling in favors with the press by issuing them  "guidelines" on how to review AMD Ryzen. Intel's PR emails include this line: "call us before you write."  This is the story of the day for sure. It is going to be a rough week for Intel, that's for sure. But if true, come on Intel, really?

Sites doing this favor to intel may as well "close the shop". Because this launch is very important for everyone and people will know truth soon enough. @HH: I am not sure what set of tests you are doing with Ryzen, but would be lovely if we had geekbench included and we could see effect of different DDR4 speeds too. It is very easy to compare different types of workloads. As some people need something particular and others are looking for different instructions.

It's not a hardware limitation, it's just because AMD's focus has been on performance and not overclocked memory compatibility. The benefits from the focus on performance outweighed the potential performance increase of focussing on high speed RAM compatibility. Apparently within a month or so there will be new microcode available, it will then be up the the manufacturer to update the relevant bios. Enthusiasts can update the microcode and other modules manually, but hopefully they won't be slack. So far it may mean that you are limited to mid DDR4-2xxx speeds, after the microcode update supposedly you could use speeds up to mid DDR4-3xxx and probably higher. It would be good therefore that after the microcode is released and bios is available that a comparative review is done between say, DDR4-2400 on the new bios and the review system, everything else the same, and then the benefit of DDR4-3200 and higher on the new bios.

Some tasks are boosted by it, but usualy not much.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD: Ryzen CPU gaming performance inhibited by… AMD: Ryzen CPU gaming performance inhibited by lack of optimization By Jon Martindale — March 3, 2017 9:53 AM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here AMD Ryzen 7 1800X MSRP $499.99 DT Recommended Product Learn More Why it matters to you If the slightly weaker Ryzen gaming performance has put you off AMD's new chips, it could just be a lack of optimization holding them back so far. AMD has responded to the reviewers’ concerns that the new Ryzen CPUs, specifically the top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 1800X, underperform in gaming tests — especially at 1080p. It claims that the reason AMD’s new flagship hardware didn’t quite match up to Intel in gaming performance was due to a lack of optimization on the software end of things. AMD’s new Ryzen CPUs are absolute powerhouses when it comes to multi-threaded support. In many scenarios where it can leverage its many cores and threads, the 1800X can keep pace with Intel CPUs which cost almost three times as much. The single-core performance wasn’t quite as impressive however and gaming specifically seemed to take a hit with the new architecture. AMD claims that is all going to change in the near future, though. “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms — until now,” AMD’s Corporate Vice President of Marketing John Taylor said in a statement to PC Perspective. More: Upcoming AMD Ryzen 7 1800X CPU achieves new Cinebench world record He added that AMD’s Ryzen CPUs were still excellent for gaming and that even without those optimizations in place, it offers “smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU bound gaming.” Moving forward, though, he said that AMD provided more than 300 developers with Ryzen devkit hardware and that by the end of 2017, more than 1,000 developers will have AMD hardware to optimize their games. He also highlighted how developers like Oxide Games and Creative Assembly had individually released statements pointing out that optimizations to their engines have yielded “significant performance uplifts” when running on new Ryzen hardware. Although it’s arguable that new hardware can be optimized for specific games — AMD and Nvidia routinely do this with new graphics driver releases — it’s harder to tell how accurate it is to suggest Intel has had more optimization focus from developers over the years. True, its processors have for the past decade been considered the best choice for gamers, but that is not to say there are no AMD CPU gamers out there. On the other hand, Zen is a brand new architecture, AMD’s first for a long time. Games, too, are rarely optimized for a large number of cores and threads and we have seen results that suggest turning off AMD’s simultaneous multithreading (SMT) does have a noticeable effect on performance, according to Hexus. With that in mind, Taylor’s argument is a plausible one, but not one that we can exactly prove either way. The proof will likely be in the CPU pudding. If we see significant improvements in Ryzen gaming performance in the months to come, we’ll know what was holding it back. As new games appear with more of a lead-in time with Ryzen hardware, we could see the chips perform far better than they do now.

Foxconn said it would build a $30 million factory here in 2013, but t never happened. by Todd C. Frankel, Washington Post Close icon Todd C. Frankel Washington Post HARRISBURG — For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn's recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. Related Coverage Pence jokes with 'enemy of the people' at Gridiron Dinner White House aides defend Trump's wiretapping claim Afghan family detained in Los Angeles are asking for release The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn's chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania's governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn's decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing's strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. "It just seemed to fade to black" after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania's economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. "I'm delivering on everything we promised," Trump said Thursday during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. "People are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency." Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump's election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump's delight.  MARK MAKELA / For the Washington Post David Black, head of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber of Commerce said FoxConn’s earlier promise to build a plant created “intense buzz” in the town.  "Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant," Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, "and probably more than one." But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. "They are scrambling to look good," Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University's East Asian program, said. "It's a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda." Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. "It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way," Moel said. "They are saying: 'I'm along for the ride. Here's my proposal.' " If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. "The government themselves aren't going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that," Moel said. "What's the downside?" Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It's why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, former President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Arizona, citing it as "an example of an America that is within our reach." But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump's inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn't iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be "Made in the USA" — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou's talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is "exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations." But the company could not confirm "the number of jobs that might be created." Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That's why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn's founder, for years has described the United States as a "must-go market." In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the states. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn's investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. "There's a pattern here," said Moel, the analyst. Gou's plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan's bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company's history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create "high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S." Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. "IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US," wrote the China Post. "Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania," CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and the company was busy scouting sites. "There was this intense buzz," recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. "Lots of us were excited by the opportunity," said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. "Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that's a big deal." For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with the Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. "It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction," Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10 million donation to Carnegie Mellon was "moving forward very successfully," with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn's investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn's U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn's $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after the Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. "Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition." Foxconn attributed the failure to "material changes to the business and operating climate at that time." "The proof is always in the pudding," said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. "But it is important to be skeptical," Andes said. "I would hope it's not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies." Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. "We learned something from that," said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn's ambition, real or not. "If you smelled a project like that," he said, "you'd get excited even though you know better."

HUGE Exclusive Interview With DHS Insider!  Posted on February 16, 2017 by Admininstrator http://victuruslibertas.com/2017/02/exclusive_interview_with_dhs_insider/ VL has been fortunate enough to work with some awesome people! We have loyal and awakened followers who help bring us information, and we also have trusted insiders, whistleblowers and leakers who trust us enough to give us information, too. Today, we have an exclusive interview with a special DHS insider who has answered some critical questions we have on PizzaGate. Our insider prefers to call it PedoGate and what he told us blew our minds. We are so fortunate that members of the Intel community like our work and feel they can trust us. We have been trying to get to the bottom of PizzaGate for months and the answers we got from our DHS insider stunned and shocked us. Here we go! Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now? A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it.  It’s the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus. Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump – is this your feeling? A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI.  (The CIA, however,  is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east.) Q. Can you elaborate? A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with it’s “sister”, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause. Q.  So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself? A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, that’s why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly “clean up Dodge”, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weiner’s hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests – in time. Trump’s legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedo’s convicted a second time.  Pedogate is his path to greatness. Q. How does Russia fit into all this? A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces. Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment? A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East. Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration? A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything. Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate? A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you. Q. What do you mean compromised? A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“.  Both tropes come from the same place. Q. Can you explain? A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy. Q.  So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it? A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win. Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel? A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters. Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme? A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone. Q. Wow ! Now its all making sense. A. Yes. lets continue this conversation later. The interview resumes Q. So I checked out Robert David Steele, and he mentions Chuck Schumer being on Lolita Island. So does FBI anon. Is that why Schumer is targeting Trump’s cabinet picks? A. Connect the dots. Q. How many other politicians have been secretly extorted? A. One in three, roughly. It’s not just the Island, its all of their activities. The reason #Pedogate terrifies the media, the CIA, the Israel Lobby, is because they are all part of this “shadow swamp” Q. Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. That’s treason on all levels. A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn.  I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videos Q. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in ‘delicate” situations? A.  No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to “throw a spotlight on the cockroaches”. Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel. A. Theatre.  Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory. Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israel’s influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way? A. The same media screaming “The Russians are coming” is the same media who says “Pizzagate is fake news” That’s CIA and Mossad talking points. Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in? A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt. Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate? A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason. Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests. A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“. It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure? When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow. Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.  I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.  Take care http://globalwarming-arclein.blogspot.ca/2017/03/the-pedophilia-problem.html Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. That’s treason on all levels. A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn.  I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videos Q. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in ‘delicate” situations? A.  No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to “throw a spotlight on the cockroaches”. Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel. A. Theatre.  Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory. Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israel’s influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way? A. The same media screaming “The Russians are coming” is the same media who says “Pizzagate is fake news” That’s CIA and Mossad talking points. Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in? A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt. Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate? A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason. Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests. A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“. It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure? When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow. Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.  I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.  Take care http://globalwarming-arclein.blogspot.ca/2017/03/the-pedophilia-problem.html Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

AMD, the underdog, has for too many years struggled to keep up with Intel, allowing the latter to put up its feet and focus on mobile parts while charging eye-watering amounts for many-core desktop hips based on previous-generation architecture. Competition can be crucial to long-term innovation and better value in the marketplace, and it is for these reasons that legions of AMD fans continue to hope that Ryzen will re-establish the chip manufacturer as everyone's favourite dark horse. The new processors, spearheaded by the Ryzen 7 1800X, don't quite have the ammunition to surpass Intel in the all-out performance stakes, yet given AMD's misfires in previous generations, the fact that Ryzen is at all competitive is an achievement in itself. And the new chip is competitive in more ways than one. We won't dig through the modernised Zen architecture all over again - our initial review has that covered - but as a reminder we know that while Ryzen's single-thread performance is reasonable, the chip's real party trick is to offer massive multi-thread potential and to do so for an agreeable fee. The Ryzen 7 1800X that first passed through our test bench offers eight cores, 16 threads and a peak frequency of 4.0GHz for £490. An Intel chip with that number of cores would cost over twice as much, so the 1800X looks a comparative bargain, or at least, it does until you start to consider other parts in the Ryzen 7 portfolio.

The Ryzen 7 1700X costs just £390 and loses out to its sibling in but one area: 0.2GHz of clock speed. A £100 saving for the sake of 200MHz? Seems an acceptable trade-off, and with support for XFR, there's every possibility the chip will automatically boost closer to the 4.0GHz mark with a meaty cooler attached. And remember, all Ryzen processors are multiplier unlocked, so those of you who like to dabble in a bit of overclocking won't have your choices artificially limited. The question that remains, then, is how much of a difference does that additional 200MHz make? Let's put the 1700X to the test and unearth some more real-world Ryzen numbers.

Photo by Mark Makela for The Washington Post HARRISBURG, Pa. • For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn’s recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Donald Trump in the first weeks of his administration. The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office there, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania’s governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn’s decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing’s strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said Thursday during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple of thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have loudly announced their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and reality can be huge — and frequently overlooked. “They are scrambling to look good,” said Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University’s East Asian program. “It’s a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda.” ‘Along for the ride’ Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. “It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way,” Moel said. “They are saying: ‘I’m along for the ride. Here’s my proposal.’” If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. “The government themselves aren’t going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that,” Moel said. “What’s the downside?” Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It’s why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, former President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as “an example of an America that is within our reach.” But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last month, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump’s inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn’t iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be “Made in the USA” — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou’s talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is “exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.” But the company could not confirm “the number of jobs that might be created.” Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, most in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That’s why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn’s founder, for years has described the United States as a “must-go market.” Empty promises? In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of an LCD display factory in the States. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn’s investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. “There’s a pattern here,” said Moel, the analyst.

Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Gou’s plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan’s bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company’s history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create “high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S.” “There was this intense buzz,” recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. “Lots of us were excited by the opportunity,” said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. “Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that’s a big deal.” For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter . According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. “It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction,” Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Phantom factories And yet, none of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn’s investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn’s U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn’s $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after The Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition.” Foxconn attributed the failure to “material changes to the business and operating climate at that time.” Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. “We learned something from that,” said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn’s ambition, real or not. “If you smelled a project like that,” he said, “you’d get excited even though you know better.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:48 Jeremy Laird says: You must have missed these excerpts!: “Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. ” “Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games.” “the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers” “for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs” For the most part, if you run at high res and graphical detail, the gap is inconsequential in most games. Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

This isn’t that, not by a long chalk. I get the desperate need to provide Intel with some meaningful compatition but why hype a cheap so so mid range chip?

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The contest is a good place to spot the talent for the next generation of games. Carnegie Mellon won the prize for best gameplay in a national bake-off that pitted students from 12 college teams with student game projects. The Carnegie Mellon team created a zany title called Beat Step Cowboys, a turn-based game where two cowboys duel on a pseudo chess board. In gameplay, second place went to Mouse House by SMU Guild Hall. Third place went to Kyon by the Savannah College of Art & Design. The University of Wisconsin Stout won for best visuals with Everend, a 3D puzzle platformer. In visuals, second place went to Beat Step Cowboys by Carnegie Mellon.

Here are the descriptions of the projects. I’ve also put my comments after each game description. Carnegie Mellon University Above: Beatstep Cowboys Image Credit: Carnegie Mellon University Project Name: Beatstep Cowboys Project Description: You are in the duel of your life. You have four beats to decide what moves to make. Your opponent is making their move. What do you do? This is the life of the Beatstep Cowboys. In this quirky wild west duel, players quickly plan moves that are then carried out simultaneously to the beat of the music. Read your foes’ mind, make quick decisions, and shoot them before they shoot you. Team Members: Amy Stewart, Minoong “J.D.” Ji, Xuelai “King Kong” Zhang. Comments: This title was a hilarious blend of a gunslinger duel and a chess game. The music was paced to increase the tension of the duel. Rochester Institute of Technology Above: Magnolia Image Credit: DigiPen Project Name: Magnolia Project Description: Magnolia is an interactive story dedicated to the memory of a three-year-old girl where you play as her experiencing things she loved in her real life.

Team Members: Mark Moukarzel, Aji Suprana, Deepak Chennakkadan, Manas Kulkarni, Kim yoon young, Hsi-Hung Shih, and Justin Jacox. Comments: This game was made in the memory of a girl who died. The team said it was an emotional rollercoaster to make the game over eight months. It had a touching song as its soundtrack. It reminded me of That Dragon, Cancer. Drexel University Above: Sole Image Credit: Gossamer Games Project Name: Sole Project Description: Sole is an abstract, aesthetic-driven adventure game where you play as the only source of light in a world shrouded in darkness. Wander through desolate environments, painting the land with light as you discover its mysterious past.

Team Members: Nabeel Ansari, Nina DeLucia, Vincent De Tommaso, and Thomas Sharpe. Comment: This game was pretty, and it reminded me of titles from Thatgamecompany, like Flower or Journey. New York University Above: Consume me Image Credit: Jenny Jiao Hsia Project Name: Consume Me Project Description: Dieting is awkward and strange. It’s empowering sometimes, horrible sometimes, and we need a conversation with nuance and honesty. Consume Me is a darkly humorous personal game about my relationship with food and my body. These prototypes are part of a larger experience that draws on my past with disordered eating. Fit, slap, and control are just some of the ways the player experiences this dieting mindset expressed through mechanics. Team Members: Jenny Jiao Hsia. Comment: This game has a noble purpose of teaching people to learn how to eat on a good diet and accept their bodies. Rochester Institute of Technology Above: Gibraltar Image Credit: RIT Project Name: Gibraltar Project Description: Gibraltar: a lunch-time strategy game.

This unique take on strategy games and board games allows players more freedom in crafting their own strategies and experiences. Team Members: John Miller, Danielle Carmi, Elena Mihajlov, and Angela Muscariello. Comments: This title was an ode to old turn-based strategy games. It was funny that the creator, who had been working on it more than three years, no longer remembered why he called it Gibraltar. Savannah College of Art and Design Above: Kyon Image Credit: SCAD Project Name: Kyon Project Description: Kyon is a top-down, third-person action/adventure game set in mythological Ancient Greece.

But when the line between criminality and the everyday struggle is blurred, the player must look to their own conscience to arrest or exonerate the targets he or she is surveilling. In all, Perfect Citizen seeks to take the player on a thought provoking journey through the personal lives of imperfect citizens in order to push the bounds of games as a storytelling medium and create a tense yet intimate gameplay experience that directly engages with the conversation of privacy and security. Team Members: Mark Biundo, Alex Vincent, Andy Baden, Brandon Gomez, Daniel Luna, Michael Lowe, Nader Sleem, Jason Brisson, Austin Enoch, and Pilar Costabl.

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. Sunday could become a huge day for Oklahoma recruiting if Tulsa (Okla.) Union safety Patrick Fields does indeed pick the Sooners. http://www.scout.com/player/209431-patrick-fields?s=73 Not only does it end nearly seven months without a pledge for 2018, but it does absolutely feel like it could be setting the tone for a major March coming up in Norman for #SavageTeam2K18. Fields announced Monday evening his final three of OU, Texas and TCU. Although there is no doubt at all his trip to Austin last weekend was sensational, the prevailing thought in speaking to numerous sources and the gut feel of Sooners Illustrated is OU will be the choice. Fields is going to make his selection Sunday afternoon following the Dallas Opening regional event in Frisco, Texas. Not sure the exact particulars of how he’s going to do it, but that remained his intention as of Thursday. Ranked No. 6 in Sooners Illustrated’s OKPreps top 25 and a high three-star safety, Fields’ potential commitment would once again be a sign of OU keeping its top in-state priorities home. Yes, there are times when OU makes an offer to someone from within the state and the prospect goes elsewhere. It does occur, but not usually when OU vies so hard to acknowledge that recruit as early as it did with Fields. Defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks has put in the time and effort throughout this process to make sure Fields becomes the next Redskin in OU’s secondary, joining 2017 signee Tre Brown. Fields became a name to circle in the spring last year and then was officially offered at the #ChampUBBQ in late July. The way Fields played his junior season justified the offer and ranking and then some as Fields was an integral part in Union earning the state championship. Looking at it from OU’s side of things, again, the seeds have been planted with several prospects and now it’s time to start reaping those rewards. OU learned from #SoonerSquad17 how crucial it is to not only have a good chunk of early commitments but to also have at least a few of those guys be ringleaders and vocal guys and guys respected by peers and top recruits nationwide. Nobody is disputing the talent of Brey Walker or Cameron Rising, but Fields fits it perfectly in terms of being good enough on the field with the respect enough on the trail from top-level recruits to listen to what he has to say. He can help anchor the class and start recruiting for #ST2K18. And when you look at the group, it is one that should get significantly bigger in the next few months. Sooners Illustrated has already predicted March commitments from: *Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy RB T.J. Pledger *Mansfield (Texas) High’s S Cam’ron Jones *Tulsa Union DT Jordan Kelley If the Sooners pull off that trio to go with Fields, it would put OU at seven commits heading into April with five of them in the Scout 300 and three of them (Walker, Pledger, Rising) in the Scout 100. That doesn’t even take into consideration certain in-state prospects OU has already put itself in great position with like Putnam City’s Ron Tatum and Midwest City’s Jalen Redmond. OU locked down its borders in 2017 with all five in the Scout 300 and six signees overall. Walker is in the bag, and if OU can lock down Fields on Sunday afternoon, the trend could continue in a hurry.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Przybylo: Opening regional review Patrick Fields commits to OU Sooners Illustrated Chat - March 6, 2017 Yes, The Niners Have Interest In Siemian OU Opening regional review: Commits Share & Embed Patrick Fields commits to OU Full Story Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Przybylo: Opening regional review Sooners Illustrated breaks down The Opening regional in Frisco, Texas. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 9:49 AM OU Opening regional review: Commits A look at what OU's commits did at Sunday's Opening regional in Frisco, Texas. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 8:58 AM Breaking News Patrick Fields commits to OUOU adds No. 4 for 2018 class with three-star safety Patrick Fields. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedSunday at 2:30 PM Sooners earn win on senior dayOU earned a win on senior night, 73-68, vs. TCU. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedSaturday at 2:20 PM Jalen Redmond set for whirlwind weekend Intel returns with an update on Jalen Redmond, who has one busy weekend ahead of him. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedFriday at 6:09 AM OU 17-for-2017: Caleb Kelly's potential?

Frankel March 3 Follow @tcfrankel A Donald Trump campaign sign remains atop a pile of gravel in Harrisburg, Penn, where Foxconn said in 2013 it’d build a $30 million factory. It didn’t happen, but more promises have returned. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said, “and probably more than one.” (Mark Makela/For The Washington Post) HARRISBURG, Pa. — For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn’s recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania’s governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn’s decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing’s strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said last month during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. David Black, head of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber of Commerce said FoxConn’s earlier promise to build a plant created “intense buzz” in the town. (Mark Makela/For The Washington Post) “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. “They are scrambling to look good,” Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University’s East Asian program, said. “It’s a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda.” Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. “It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way,” Moel said. “They are saying: ‘I’m along for the ride. Here’s my proposal.’ ” If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. “The government themselves aren’t going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that,” Moel said. “What’s the downside?” Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It’s why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as “an example of an America that is within our reach.” But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP) Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump’s inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn’t iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be “Made in the USA” — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou’s talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is “exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.” But the company could not confirm “the number of jobs that might be created.” Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That’s why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn’s founder, for years has described the United States as a “must-go market.” In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the states. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn’s investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. “There’s a pattern here,” said Moel, the analyst. Gou’s plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan’s bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company’s history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create “high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S.” Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. “IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US,” wrote the China Post. “Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania,” CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and the company was busy scouting sites. “There was this intense buzz,” recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. “Lots of us were excited by the opportunity,” said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. “Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that’s a big deal.” In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. (Mark Makela/For The Washington Post) For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with The Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. “It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction,” Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10 million donation to Carnegie Mellon was “moving forward very successfully,” with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn’s investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn’s U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn’s $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after The Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition.” Foxconn attributed the failure to “material changes to the business and operating climate at that time.” “The proof is always in the pudding,” said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. “But it is important to be skeptical,” Andes said. “I would hope it’s not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies.” Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. “We learned something from that,” said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn’s ambition, real or not. “If you smelled a project like that,” he said, “you’d get excited even though you know better.” Read more: What happened when a pro-Trump county discovered it was a ‘sanctuary city’ If Trump wants pipes built in America, what does that mean?

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games.

I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Cory Gardner (6 letters) A new computer chip from Advanced Micro Devices could entice consumers to do something they haven’t done in years: Buy a desktop computer. The new Ryzen chip, which was partly developed at AMD’s office in Fort Collins, touts the same speeds and performance as competitor Intel Corp.’s top chips. But at half the price, the Ryzen chip, which went on sale Thursday, should lower the cost of any computer using it. “A $500 chip that is outperforming a $1,000 chip from Intel? That should tell you about the engineering power AMD has. AMD is not shying away from competition,” said Chirag Dekate, a research director for emerging technologies at Gartner, a market research firm. “I’m seeing a new energy from AMD that I haven’t seen in a long time and that’s showing up in customers as well. The gaming customer is quite excited about what AMD has to offer.” Let’s rewind a bit. Desktop computer sales were outpaced by laptops around 2008. Tablets were supposed to overtake laptops around 2015. And if you still use either one, you’re probably in the minority since we’re on the verge of American consumers exclusively relying on their smartphones for their computing needs. As for AMD? The Sunnyvale, Calif. chipmaker, a reliable competitor to Intel in the early 2000s, seemed to disappear from Earth. While it brought new life to the desktop PC market in the mid-2000s with the high-performance and lower-priced Athlon 64 chip, somehow it lost its way. In 2008, it spun off its manufacturing plant to cut costs. It hasn’t introduced a new chip since 2011 and that was considered a disappointment. AMD hit the reset button on its new chip design Four years ago, the company started over — the prior chip architecture wasn’t cutting it. While AMD could have squeezed more life out of the old architecture — a less risky and easier move — the company plowed ahead, seeking to design something new, said Sam Naffziger, a founding member of the Fort Collins office. “Every tech company has periods of wandering in the wilderness. There were some things about the prior architecture that were not efficient. They sounded good at the time but they didn’t pan out,” Naffziger said. “…But we had some bold leaders who joined the company and said this architecture is a dead design. We need to reset.” RJ Sangosti, The Denver PostFORT COLLINS, CO -FEBRUARY 28: Members of the design engineering staff, at Advanced Micro Devices, work on testing a new computer chip in their lab in Fort Collins, February 28, 2017. The company spent the past 4 years developing a completely new desktop computer chip. (Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post) The team in Fort Collins, which numbers about 120 people, worked on the memory design of Ryzen and essentially squeezed more memory into a smaller space. Technically, said Dave Johnson, AMD’s senior director of design engineering in Fort Collins, “The pieces of it that we were responsible for were the floating point computation unit and Level 2 and Level 3 cache.” By making everything smaller, the cost of the chip is lower, as well as its power needs, Naffziger added. “We get three times the work done for the same amount of energy. Some of that was from the density and design; some from the suite of technologies code-named SenseMI,” he said. SenseMI has a learning feature that adapts to the needs of power users, like gamers. The new Ryzen has eight cores instead of the typical four. Each core runs two threads, so Ryzen has 16 threads. That’s like having 16 computers at your whim calculating 16 of your commands simultaneously. Starting from scratch created “some nervousness,” Johnson said. “But my recollection is that it was a very exciting time. I think a lot of us in the engineering community want the best design we can create. We like to create things. That’s what we do,” he said. “Sometimes engineers go a long time in their career where they don’t get to create something brand new.” The audience for AMD’s newest chip includes gamers The top AMD Ryzen 3.6 GHz chip, at $499, sold out Thursday at NewEgg and Amazon. But you could still buy the slightly less powerful 3 and 3.4 Ghz Ryzen chips at midday for $369 and $439, respectively. That bodes well for a market eager for new competition. Shane Rau, research vice president for computing semiconductors at IDC Research, wrote in a recent report: “If AMD executes on the design and production, they will have the greatest potential to disrupt the PC-class processor market in 2017.” For now, the chips are available to people who want to build their own computers. PC makers like Dell and HP need to integrate the chip into computers for consumers to purchase. The target audience is gamers, video editors and content creators who rely on high-performance machines to get work — or serious game play — done. The first reviews were shared Thursday. Arstechnica called it “an excellent workstation CPU, but it doesn’t game as hard as we hoped.” ExtremeTech also gave Ryzen props as a workstation but called it a weaker gaming machine (reviewer Joel Hruska reminds readers that AMD may need some time since it didn’t jump from 1990s budget chip maker to Athlon 64 X2 “in a single bound”). AMD is working on a laptop version of the chip, which is expected for release in the second half of this year. Analysts are interested in seeing how Ryzen will serve the data center and server markets, or deep-learning technology and internet-of-things devices. But with the chip so new, analysts are cautious. “I mean this with all due respect. AMD is a phenomenal engineering company, but at the end of the day, they’re running with limited firepower. They sold off quite a bit of their internal fab structure and must rely on others to manufacture,” said Dekate. “Intel not only designs but manufacturers. … And while this does add quite a bit of pricing pressure to Intel, keep in mind that Intel’s products are being compared to what is in the market right now. This is not likely Intel’s latest chip set.” By re-inventing the desktop PC chip, Rau said AMD may be following the route it knows best, instead of chasing the mobile or IoT market first. “Those people who can buy this tend to be the most vocal of what they’ve chosen. Gamers, content creators, the people who buy this for work or home hopefully say good things about it. That word of mouth is very effective,” Rau said. “This is high end. If you need to ramp up, you can’t go from zero to 10 million right away. You might as well sell that first million at the highest price.” RJ Sangosti, The Denver PostFORT COLLINS, CO -FEBRUARY 28: Sam Naffziger, left, and David Johnson, both of Advanced Micro Devices, are getting ready to announce a new desktop computer chip the company is working on in Fort Collins, February 28, 2017.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:48 Jeremy Laird says: You must have missed these excerpts!: “Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. ” “Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games.” “the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers” “for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs” For the most part, if you run at high res and graphical detail, the gap is inconsequential in most games. Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more.

I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming.

That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck.

I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Attacks on Intel across different segments could help the company extend its market share gains in 2017. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 3, 2017 at 8:00AM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is giving both NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a run for their money, as the latest market share numbers for graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) indicate. Jon Peddie Research shows that AMD's overall GPU market share -- including both discrete and embedded graphics -- increased to 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. That is a gain of 2.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, outpacing both its peers. Intel, meanwhile, saw its share decline 3.6 percentage points to 68.1% as consumers appear to gravitate towards powerful discrete GPUs over integrated units. The bad news for the market leader: Intel is not losing market share only in graphics processors. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. Mercury Research points out that AMD also gained on Intel in the CPU market. Its x86 processor market share increased to 13.6% from 12.7% in 2015. On the other hand, Intel saw its market share fall accordingly to 86.3%. In 2017, both Intel and AMD will duke it out with new CPU products -- will the underdog be able to gain on Intel once again? AMD's smart strategy AMD has devised a broad strategy of tapping both the high-end and budget markets for growth. While its latest and greatest Ryzen architecture has been designed to compete in the high end segment, AMD has decided to consolidate its lower-priced offerings to meet demand from users on a budget, according to Mercury Research. As it turns out, most PC growth until 2020 will take place in emerging markets. IDC predicts that they will account for 54.3% of PC market share in 2020, compared to 51.2% last year. Currently, the GDP per capita in most emerging markets is under $10,000, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), so having budget offerings is a smart move for AMD. According to Forbes contributor Antony Leather, AMD's baseline 4-core CPU -- the Ryzen 3 1100 -- will cost $129. By comparison, Intel's entry-level Core i3-7100 Kaby Lake processor, launched this year, is selling for just under $120 at many online retailers though its specs are not quite as strong with two fewer cores. Competing at essentially the same price point, AMD is hoping to win over budget-minded consumers, giving it a leg up in this segment of the market. What about the high end? Though Intel has already launched its Kaby Lake processors, its top-of-the-line Core i7-7700K is expected to sport weaker specs than AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X processor. In response, Intel is rumored to be launching its Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K processor in August this year. However, it will be late to the market with something that truly competes against the flagship Ryzen, which AMD is launching this month, giving it about six months to rack up sales before Intel can respond. Additionally, rumors on Taiwanese site BenchLife indicate that to tap the premium market, Intel might come out with a 10-core high-end processor that could sell for as much as $1,700. Details are sparse, but such a price point generally indicates that Intel would eclipse AMD's own top-of-the-line processor (expected to retail for $499). The gaming hardware market is expected to grow 6% annually through 2019, and the majority of that growth will take place in the high-end segment where AMD will be able to enjoy a running start.  With these impressive releases offered at competitive prices, it won't be surprising if AMD manages to steal additional market share from Intel in 2017.

The company has spent years in the proverbial desert, struggling with Bulldozer improvements while simultaneously designing its new Zen architecture. It’s no exaggeration to say AMD’s future as a PC company literally depends on Ryzen’s success. AMD has positioned Ryzen aggressively with price points that match extremely favorably with Intel’s Core i7 family and HEDT desktop parts, but there have always been questions about how well Ryzen would perform. It’s been years since AMD fielded a high performance CPU design and the company doesn’t have the same market share it once commanded. If the company is serious about pushing Ryzen into workstations, consumer PCs, and servers, it’s got a very high bar to clear. Today’s review will focus on the Ryzen 7 1800X‘s performance, rather than rehashing Ryzen’s design or architecture. Anyone with questions is invited to peruse those articles or ask in comments below. Before discussing Ryzen’s performance, however, we need to talk about its launch. Normally, a manufacturer gives us 7-10 days at minimum; the more significant the product, the longer the review window. AMD bucked this trend by launching Ryzen less than a week after we received our hardware kits. Because I’d previously committed to attend Nvidia’s GTX 1080 Ti launch at GDC, I only had 60 hours to test the Ryzen 7 1800X. AMD plans to hit Intel where it hurts — its wallet. As short as our review window was, I may have gotten lucky. In at least a few cases, reviewers didn’t receive their kits until 24-48 hours before the launch. I’ve run enough benchmarks on the Ryzen 7 1800X to feel comfortable characterizing this article as a review, but it’s also something of a hot mess. I suspect you’ll see wide variation in reported benchmarks and experiences; don’t be surprised if different people have different results. The limited testing time was exacerbated by the motherboard AMD shipped us for testing. Asus has a well-deserved reputation for quality, but my Crosshair VI Hero threw so many errors, AMD ultimately concluded I might have a bad board, not just a wonky BIOS. To be clear: I was scarcely the only reporter to experience problems or see odd performance, but our board seems to have been at the low end of the bell curve. Both Asus and AMD helped troubleshoot our problems, but the hours we devoted to this cut deeply into test time and required us to repeatedly benchmark certain tests rather than moving on to other hardware. After switching to a Gigabyte Aorus X370 motherboard I retested our game benchmarks, beginning around 12 AM this morning. While the Gigabyte motherboard did improve the situation slightly and was markedly more stable, it didn’t resolve the gaming Achilles heel I referred to in the title (we’ll be exploring that issue in greater detail below). As a result, our tests are not as thorough as we would have liked. We redesigned our CPU benchmark suite in preparation for Ryzen, but didn’t have time to run every CPU through every new test. Because we needed to test in parallel, not every CPU could be benchmarked with the same cooler or the same SSD. We chose the tests we did partly to ensure that these differences would not meaningfully impact our results, and our future deep dives into the chip will standardize on common hardware once again. With those caveats in mind, let’s check the numbers. Test setup: We’ve expanded our CPU test suite since the Core i7-7700K launched. Our Intel Core i7-6700K, 7700K, 6900K, and 6950X all used 32GB of G-Skill DDR4-3200 (F4-3200C14Q-32GTZ) clocked at that frequency. Neither of the Ryzen testbeds we tested, however, was capable of running four DIMMs at these clocks. Since we’d already tested the Intel systems, we had to make a choice: 16GB of DDR4-3200 or 32GB of DDR4-2133. Since none of our benchmarks require >16GB of RAM and AMD isn’t using quad-channel memory for Ryzen, we opted for 16GB. All of our GPU and 3D benchmarks were run using a GeForce GTX 1070. All of our game benchmarks are run at 1920×1080. While this isn’t considered an enthusiast resolution anymore, the point of these tests is to stress the CPU, not the GPU. All of our testbeds ran Windows 10 with the latest patches and updates installed. All of our GPU benchmarks were performed with Nvidia’s ForceWare 376.88. We’re going to split our benchmark results between workstation and application tests and 3D benchmarks with workstation and content creation tests up first. Our test results and analysis are in the slideshow below. As always, you can click on any slide to expand it in a new window. In workstation and computation tests, Ryzen is a beast to be reckoned with. Even when it doesn’t match Intel in raw performance, its performance-per-dollar gives it a huge advantage over its much larger, more expensive, rival. That said, there’s a narrow case to be made for chips like the Core i7-7700K, particularly in lightly threaded workloads. If you’re still dealing with single-thread or dual-threaded applications, the Core i7-7700K can still deliver the best performance per dollar. In most cases, however, the Ryzen 7 1800X is in a class of its own. That’s also true for gaming — but in very different contexts. Results like these are guaranteed to raise questions, and we’ve spoken to AMD extensively over the past few days to explore the issue. According to AMD, there are three issues collectively contributing to these problems. First, Ryzen’s SenseMi technology and Precision Boost are extremely fine-grained controls that offer significantly finer granularity than any previous AMD solution, which means BIOS implementations of these features are new and not necessarily working at 100% efficiency yet. Second, AMD has been out of the high-performance market for so long, virtually no software is written explicitly for or optimized to perform well on AMD CPUs. Ryzen puts AMD on a far better footing, but software patches don’t arrive overnight. Third, there are some games that are far more sensitive to the differences between AMD and Intel CPUs than others. We happened to pick a test suite that had more of these slowdowns in it than others, and even we don’t see it every test (Vulkan, for example, runs quite well). The other reason AMD missed it is because they chose 1440p for a minimum resolution, figuring that no one with a $500 CPU would still be gaming in 1080p. I can understand that argument even if I don’t normally find it persuasive (I prefer to keep a lower resolution to allow CPU performance to shine through). According to AMD, the difference in performance between itself and Intel is much reduced at 1440p and completely eliminated in 4K. I haven’t had the opportunity to verify those figures yet, but it does make sense — as resolution rises, the bottleneck in the system moves from the CPU to the GPU. If you game at 1440p or above, these results may not have much bearing on your experience. I had a number of conversations with AMD on the game performance question as well as discussions of board stability in general. Having tested a second motherboard, I think many of my stability and performance concerns were driven, at least in part, by faulty hardware. That said, Ryzen’s relative weakness in gaming while being such a vast improvement over the FX-9590 and offering extremely strong application/workstation performance is a bit odd. It’s possible that AMD’s heavy reliance on multi-threading, while effective in non-gaming tests, made it take a whack in game tests. This last, however, is merely speculation on my part. Last but not least, here’s a touch of icing for the proverbial cake. There is one caveat to be aware of. Remember, all of our Intel rigs used 32GB of DDR4-3200, while the AMD systems could only use 16GB of the same RAM. While this is undoubtedly having an impact on the results, it’s not going to tilt them in some crazy direction; 16GB of RAM doesn’t consume 42W of power, and that’s how much it would have to draw to bring the 1800X and 6900K into line with one another. Even with this caveat in mind, when was the last time you saw AMD hitting lower power consumption figures than Intel? Conclusions We still have plenty of questions about Ryzen and its performance, and we’ll be revisiting these topics in days to come. How strong Ryzen is, in an absolute sense, depends on where your interests lie. Evaluated strictly as a gaming chip, Ryzen is a good (but not great) option, due to its significant deficits against Intel. Evaluated as a workstation processor or 3D rendering solution, it’s extraordinary. The formal list price on the Core i7-6900K is $1089 – $1109. List price on the Ryzen R7 1800X is $500 bucks. I still think AMD should’ve held off launching until its partners had a bit more time to improve their boards, but that’s not my decision. If you’re unhappy about Ryzen’s gaming weaknesses relative to Intel, I’d suggest taking a walk down memory lane. When AMD began to gain ground on Intel in the late 1990s, it didn’t leap from budget chip manufacturing to the Athlon 64 X2 in a single bound. The K6 and K6-2 were adequate chips for budget-conscious gamers and Windows desktop software, but they weren’t going head-to-head with Intel’s Pentium II’s and winning the competition. It took years, and multiple product iterations, before the Athlon 64 was ready to tackle Intel in the server room. Given how far AMD’s market share has fallen, it’s going to take the company at least a year to build up any serious market share. I’ve said for years that Ryzen didn’t need to beat Intel in every particular, it simply needed to offer a viable alternative at a good price. Ryzen more than does that. It may not be the best chip at everything, but it’s more than good enough to help AMD win back some badly-needed market share. Even more importantly, this is a CPU core that AMD can scale up and out as the need arises. It’s great to have competition back in the CPU market.

Building on momentum of a successful trial announced in December where the launch the first 5G business customer trial at Intel’s Austin, Texas, facility was announced, AT&T announced its plans to kick off another 5G trial with Intel and Ericsson in Spring 2017. This second trial will focus on residential and small-to-medium business customers, who will be able to stream DIRECTV NOW and access next-gen entertainment and enhanced broadband services. Spreadtrum Communications launched a new 5-mode LTE system-on-chip (SoC) based on Intel Airmont architecture and 14nm process technology. Spreadtrum’s new integrated CAT 7 modem SoC (SC9861G-IA) is designed to not only be power-efficient, but with Intel® Virtualization Technology, it also supports a multi-domain security system architecture, providing security for smart devices. Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA is scheduled for mass production in the second quarter of 2017 and targets the global mid-level and premium smartphone markets. The week before, Intel also announced a 5G Innovators Initiative to brings together leading technology companies, industry leaders and academia to explore, test and innovate with 5G network and distributed edge technology in the U.S. In cooperation with Ericsson, the initiative was launched with Honeywell, GE, and the University of California, Berkeley. Asha Keddy, vice president and general manager of Next Generation Standards, Intel Communications and Devices Group, says: “5G is not simply about making smart phones faster. It’s about the machines and things that will deliver an entirely new smart and connected future. Building our 5G future requires a new approach to industry collaboration and development. The 5GI2 initiative combines technological strengths and intellectual capital from each of the participants to build step-by-step blueprints for how early applications of 5G connectivity, IoT and cloud services will bring new forms of value to multiple industries.” The 5GI2 will first focus on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) and develop pilots for application of technologies including augmented and virtual reality for first responder drone surveillance of hazardous environments and other uses. The pilots will include step-by-step blueprints of the network, cloud and 5G connectivity requirements – from speed and responsiveness to security and analytics.

(list/comparison) Gaming PCs 14 Steam Machines Are Here, but Which One is for You? (list/comparison) Shawn Sanders Updated August 3, 2015 Shares It began with a Big Picture-idea. No literally! Valve’s grand scheme to snatch the rug out from under the console competition and cement themselves as the new kings of living-room gaming began with the launch of their Big Picture feature for their Steam digital distribution and social networking platform. Big Picture is a great way to play your Steam PC games in a Xbox Live-like TV-ready user interface. Now with this “Big” substantial foot in the door, Valve moves on the living room like a lioness on a gazelle–having developed a Linux-based operating software dubbed SteamOS and a unique companion controller. The haptic-heavy controller can be bought on its own and the SteamOS can be installed on any modern PC for the do-it-yourself crowd. Valve has also worked with 14 PC providers and encouraged them to build their own Steam Machines around the newly forged SteamOS to offer gamers a more hands-off approach akin to a plug-n-play PS4 or Xbox One console experience. These systems vary in size, price, performance and customization potential. Here we list them all with specs where provided. We also try offer a tiny morsel of insight for where you should focus your Steam Machine curiosity. First up…? 1. Alienware Steam Machine Valve themselves say this version of the Steam box will offer “The full potential of what a Steam Machine should be.” But price and specs are TBD. It has a familiar console-style form factor. We do know it will feature an Intel CPU and an Nvidia GPU. I’m betting those will be a GTX 780 or 780 Ti and a Haswell CPU from Intel. This is definitely one to watch coming with Valve’s seal of approval. More can’t be said until we have more pricing, specs and info on availability. Price: TBA Specs: TBD – Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU. 2. Alternate’s Steam Machine Alternate is not familiar to many so their lofty price tag will be a major hurdle for such an unproven system. Adding insult to injury, their specs are very middle of road for such an expensive system. Wait for reviews to circulate on this one, before taking the plunge. Price: $1339 Spec: Intel Core i5 4570, 1TB Solid State Hybrid Drive, Gigabyte GTX 760 GPU, 16GB of memory, HDMI-out, 4x USB and optical out. 3. CyberPowerPC CyberPowerPC did more to make their Steam Machines seem unique. They are called “Steam Machine A” and “Steam Machine I”. These products of nomenclature wizardry each wield a 500GB of HDD and 8GB of DDR3 memory. But GPU and CPU are still to be determined. Those choices will clearly dictate the $200 cost difference. Of the 14, I would pass on CyberPowerPC. Their premium PCs have never impressed. So I wouldn’t hold my breath for their Steam Machine. Alas, time will tell for sure. Price: $499/$699 Specs: 500GB HDD, 8GB DDR3 RAM (Full specs TBA) 4. Digital Storm – Bolt II Digital Storm is a name you can trust given their long history of quality boutique PC builds. Yet one is hard-pressed to tell the difference between the Bolt II and your garden variety tower PC. It may not be a looker by set-top living room standards. But the Bolt II from Digital Storm packs the inner-muscle to feed the most ravenous gaming appetite. Nonetheless, I fear the Bolt II does little to sway traditional PC gamers with a design similar to a do-it-yourself PC build. Moreover the look may  further scare away console gamers looking for easy entry into PC gaming. Still, this is Digital Storm we’re talking about. Good quality is a given. So, if living space and financials are not an issue then I suggest you investigate the Bolt II. Price: $2584 Specs: Intel Core i7 4770K (unlocked Haswell), Nvidia GTX 780 Ti, 16gb RAM, 1TB HDD + 120GB SSD 5. Gigabyte – Brix Pro We don’t have a price on Gigabyte’s Brix Pro Steam Machine. What we do know…? It will come minus the one PC component Gigabyte excels at and that’s video cards. The Brix Pro will sport a i7 4770K, one of the most coveted CPU’s on the market today. But Gigiabyte is relying on Intel’s integrated Iris Pro 5200. The Iris Pro competes at a very casual level–too casual for a dedicated gaming machine in our honest assesment (no hands-on time ATM). It is definitely THE best integrated graphics solution on any CPU. Yet I fear it will not be sufficient. It will surely keep overall cost down, however, well below many other Steam Machines. Well… At least it should if Gigabyte is serious about competing in this madcap new arms race. Price: TBA Specs: Intel Core i7 4770K (unlocked Haswell), Intel Iris Pro (integrated graphics), 2x 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD SATA3 drive 6. Falcon Nothwest – Tiki You don’t make it in the cutthroat boutique PC racket as long as Falcon Nothwest without being damn good at what you do. These folks have been cranking out high end PC’s since ’92. Now say hello to the company’s Tiki Steam Machine. The Tiki line features premium wallet-crippling prices all the way up to $6000. The Tiki boasts wide customization in some areas and flat out creme de la creme components in other areas. The performance and support will undoubtedly be superb. Money left over for games after this purchase…? That’s a whole other ball of wax. Price: $1799 – $6000 (configuration dependent) Specs: CPU is optional (selection TBA), Nvidia GTX Titan, 8-16GB RAM (configurable), Up to 6TB (selection TBA) 7. iBuyPower (Product Name TBA) Similar to CyberPowerPC, the iBuypower Steam Machine is much more consumer friendly. This is largely due to the consumer level components housed within. These will both serve as solid affordable test beds for what a Steam Machine can do. To be effective, each of these companies will need to ensure quality customer support and performance if they hope to sway early adopters. These are for those with considerably less disposable cash, and want to test the waters of the new SteamOS platform. Price: $499 Specs: Quad Core AMD or Intel processor, Radeon GCN Graphics, 8GB RAM, 500GB+ Storage (type TBA) 8. Materiel.Net (Product Name TBA) I’m not familiar with Material.net or their unnamed Steam Machine. So I reserve my opinion…well mostly. This unit will ship with an Nvidia GTX 760 OC card from MSI. That’s a great card for 1080p gaming or below. The form factor is another unattractive square and the price point is not as competitive. I’m curious about these lesser known companies. So we’ll keep a keen eye on this one. Price: $1098 Specs: Intel Core i5 4440, MSI GTX 760, 8GB RAM, 8GB+1TB SSHD 9. ORIGIN PC – Chronos ORIGIN PC may be one of the newer kids on the boutique PC block. But they’ve proven themselves to be a leader at this game in a very short time. I’m only recommending a few of these Steam Machines to customers, since we have yet to go hands-on. But ORIGIN, like Falcon Northwest, is a company I trust having been spearheaded by some of the original Alienware guys. ORIGIN PC only use the very best components in their builds. The engineering on this Steam Machine has produced a slightly original stlying. Additionaly, the ingredient make for some mouth-watering gaming potential. Just expect an equally 4-Star price tag. Price: TBA Specs: Intel Core i7 4770K (3.9-4,6GHz), 2x 6GB Nvidia GeForce Titan cards, Ram and storage – TBA. 10. Next SPA That big green X on this Steam Machine is sure to confuse someone. I would assume it was a modded Xbox if I didn’t know better. But few of these Steam Machines win the “Design Innovation” award. So no harm, no foul. We have here, another new comer and my guess is not a State-side one at that. The innards are middle of the road, which speaks to a sub-$1000 price point. But I’m all speculation on this one. Time will tell. Price: TBA Specs: Intel Core i5, Nvidia GT 760, 8GB RAM, 1TB storage (type TBA) 11. Scan – NC10 Now this is what I’ve been waiting to see. A diminutive Steam Machine more akin to a portable HDD than a PC or console. The Scan NC10 even uses a 765M GPU, the type found in laptops and All-in-One PCs. That helps keep size down. The CPU is not all that exciting, using an Intel Core i3 4000M. But supreme CPU power may not be required for the Linux based SteamOS. Our eyes will be glued to this little guy come launch. Price: $1090 Specs: Intel Core i3 4000m, Nvidia Geforce GTX 76M, 8GB RAM, 500GB 12. Webhallen (name TBA) I don’t know about this folks. The company Webhallen is a e-commerce store in Sweden. It was formerly owned by Amazon. What is worrisome, PC building  is not the company’s bread and butter. Sure they pull from their stock to build PCs. But I would hardly go to an e-commerce equivalent of Best Buy, CompUSA, or even GameStop for definitive gaming machine. Like most of the other Steam Machines, Webhallen is using components from other companies and housing them in a custom PC chassis. Adequate tech and customer support would be my initial questions. Sounds like a gamble that should be watched instead of adopted early. Price: $1499 Specs: Intel Core i7 4771, Nvidia GTX 780, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSHD 13. Zotac (name TBA) This thing looks more like a network router than a Steam Machine. Zotac products are not sold in the U.S. but I’ve used them first hand and vouch for their reliability. The company has been serving gamer component needs for many years. The price tag on this one also shows promise. It’s not dirt cheap but highly affordable. Too bad we don’t have a specific specifications list. More on this one as it comes in. Price: $599 Specs: Intel Core (TBD), Nvidia GeForce GTX (TBD), RAM and Storage are also TBD 14. Maingear – Spark The Spark was the most recent Steam Machine to come onboard. While it doesn’t look much different than the other square form factors, it weighs less than 1-pound. Connectivity options were mentioned as well — 4x USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI-out port, Mini DisplayPort, 801.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 are all in attendance. Surprisingly, Maingear is showing AMD a lot of love in this unit for both the CPU and the GPU. Maingear is another name you can trust. But AMD is not my personal choice for gaming — especially on the GPU side. Again, that’s a personal preference based on my experience with their poor driver support. Also the R9, while a very powerful video card, is a incessantly loud one at that. You’re sure to hear it too, in a box that weighs less than 8-ounces. That said, we have every confidence Maingear is making the best decisions for their particular Steam Machine. Time will tell if they’re right for gamers.

By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor The number of U.S. retailers ranked at the most-distressed level of the credit-rating spectrum has more than tripled since the Great Recession of 2008-2009 and is heading toward record levels in the next five years, Moody’s Investors Service said Monday. Don’t miss: Nordstrom says Trump’s tweets after Ivanka’s collections were dropped didn’t hurt results The rating agency is the latest to weigh in on the state of the sector, and has 19 names in its retail and apparel portfolio, or 14% of the total, that are now trading at Caa/Ca. That’s deep into speculative, or “junk,” territory. It’s also a percentage close to the 16% considered distressed during the 2008/2009 period, said a Moody’s report led by retail analyst Charles O’Shea. The rise is part of a wider trend affecting sectors across Moody’s coverage that has retail replacing oil and gas as the most-troubled industry. Retailers are in the midst of a secular shift to online sales led by juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.38% and that’s forcing many of them to spend heavily on their e-commerce operations. At the same time, mall traffic has slowed dramatically as consumer behavior changes, forcing many to discount heavily, hurting profit margins.

Intel's Michelle Tinsley joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero with a printed sweater and a look at other innovations that will improve the retail customer experience. Photo: Intel The 19 issuers on Moody’s list have more than $3.7 billion of debt maturing in the next five years, with about 30% of that total coming due by the end of 2018. The number is even higher when private credit is included. Read now: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas “While credit markets continue to provide ready access for companies spanning the rating spectrum—allowing many to proactively refinance debt and bolster balance sheets—that could change abruptly if market conditions or investor sentiment shift,” said O’Shea. The increase in distressed retailers comes after a long period of low interest rates, during which sponsor activity speeded up to meet investor appetite for yield. Each leveraged buyout cycle tends to produce a new pool of B2/B3 companies, a number of which inevitably get downgraded to Caa, said O’Shea. That was the case for Claire’s Stores Inc., J. Crew Group parent Chinos Intermediate Holdings A Inc., Tops Holding II Corp., and Rue 21 Inc., all of which now have weak credit metrics after taking on high levels of leverage to fund buyouts. LBOs almost always start life with high leverage, because sponsors are incentivized to minimize equity and maximize debt in each deal to ensure their own returns. “These companies are frequently challenged from the start, with weak credit metrics,” said O’Shea. “Exacerbating this is the cadence of distributions to boost sponsor returns that typically follow, pushing the leverage envelope. When a highly leveraged company faces operating difficulties, Caa is the usual result.” That makes companies more vulnerable to default if credit markets tighten, as they tend to tap external sources of uncommitted capital to fund maturities. Moody’s is expecting the overall speculative-grade default rate to fall to 3.5% in January 2017 from 5.8% last January. It did not provide a default rate forecast for retailers alone. But Fitch Ratings said recently it expects the default rate for the sector to spike to 9% in 2017 from its current 1% trailing 12-months level. S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the majority of outlooks across retail and restaurants are stable but the ratings trends are negative. “Shifting consumer preferences and patches of global economic and policy uncertainty are contributing to the increasingly negative outlook bias,” the agency said in a recent report. The main factors causing downgrades are stressed liquidity, weak credit profiles, challenged competitive positions, sponsor ownership and erratic management structures, said Moody’s. Anytime there is a sudden change in the C-suite, credit risk rises and the rise will be exacerbated if there is no clear successor in sight. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.21% and Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, -2.07% two of Moody’s highest rated retailers, have changed CEOs in the past few years without any bumps because of succession planning, said O’Shea. A bigger pool of low-rated retailers also poses challenges for their stronger competitors, he said. “As they struggle to survive, distressed retailers can take more desperate measures, including highly promotional pricing that can border on irrational. This leaves stronger firms with the choice of either competing in a race to the bottom, or giving up sales in order to preserve margin.” See also: Sears is ‘one sick puppy,’ and there may be no remedy Other retailers on Moody’s list include Sears Holding Corp.

Some offer software, some offer components, and some offer complete platforms. In an interesting marriage of partners, Intel, AT&T, and Sonim Technologies fall into that third “systems” category. I say it’s interesting because I don’t generally expect to see end systems from Intel. But of the goal is to help accelerate time to market, they’ve clearly hit the nail on the head. While it’s essentially a Sonim end product, the communications requirements were driven by AT&T and the reference board design came from Intel. Sonim pretty much picked it up from there, including the industrial design. Dubbed by Intel as its LTE IoT Quick Deployment (LIQD) program, the program lets device OEMs like Sonim develop pre-certified, deployment-ready LTE solutions for commercial and industrial IoT applications. AT&T is the first carrier certified by Intel, and also the third partner in the Intel-Sonim product deployment. The end box is called the XPi, and because of AT&T’s involvement, it’s pre-certified and pre-integrated into the carrier’s platform services. This enables remote sensor management and faster deployment in the field. Designed for demanding industrial environments, the XPi can operate in such applications as transportation, logistics, agriculture and construction. It can detect changes in temperature, humidity, ambient light, acceleration, and movement. To extend functionality, a sensor interface has been implemented to provide modular extensibility via accessories that can be securely mounted to the unit. The XPi is based on the Intel Quark SE microcontroller C1000, and offers users a scalable IoT sensor platform with Bluetooth Smart connectivity and the ability to access AT&T’s platform solutions, aka M2X. It runs a version of the Zephyr Project real-time operating system, which is a deterministic flavor of Linux. A later version may include some form of Android. According to Intel, “We will enable OEMs and carriers to deliver smart and connected devices that can deploy in weeks instead of months. Customers utilizing Intel LIQD devices will also be able to move from concept stage to large deployments without the engineering or technical burden of building a custom solution.” Sounds like a win for everyone. Sonim XPi is expected to be available by the middle of the year for around $149. When successive generations arrive, significant price reductions may come with them, possibly even below $50.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater!

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games.

I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 25 AMD says seeding of dev kits will boost Ryzen gaming performance by Mark Tyson on 3 March 2017, 10:00 Tags: AMD (NYSE:AMD) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadewn Add to My Vault: Yesterday we saw the launch of the AMD Ryzen 7 range of CPUs. I'm sure that has not escaped many HEXUS reader information radars. Overall we concluded that the new high-end AMD processors offered "massive multi-core performance, [and] aggressive pricing," but single thread performance trailed Intel by a smidgeon, and probably most controversially there were gaming optimisations needed going forward. SMT seems to be a problem for AMD right now with the disabling of this feature was actually seen to result in better performance in games. Here at HEXUS we tested Total War: Warhammer at Ultra settings QHD, and disabling SMT increased the average frame rate from 79fps to 85.8fps. With Hitman (again Ultra settings at QHD) a similar uplift was observed, with frame rates improved from 91.4fps to 95.6fps. Other reviewers did quite a few FHD 1080p gaming tests and this again showed AMD performance anomalies. As PC Perspective reports gaming at 1080p on Ryzen "shows a deficit in performance compared to Intel Kaby Lake and Broadwell-E processors," in many AAA games. Now, regarding this issue, PCPer has received an answer of sorts from John Taylor, CVP of Marketing at AMD. In a nutshell he told PCPer that developers simply aren't used to AMD Ryzen yet, and AMD's seeding of a targeted 1000+ developer systems in 2017 will help address the performance anomaly. In contrast, developers are already leveraging optimisations that uniquely apply to the Intel platform. For reference and clarity, the full statement by AMD's Taylor is directly below: As we presented at Ryzen Tech Day, we are supporting 300+ developer kits with game development studios to optimize current and future game releases for the all-new Ryzen CPU. We are on track for 1000+ developer systems in 2017. For example, Bethesda at GDC yesterday announced its strategic relationship with AMD to optimize for Ryzen CPUs, primarily through Vulkan low-level API optimizations, for a new generation of games, DLC and VR experiences. Oxide Games also provided a public statement today on the significant performance uplift observed when optimizing for the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 CPU design – optimizations not yet reflected in Ashes of the Singularity benchmarking. Creative Assembly, developers of the Total War series, made a similar statement today related to upcoming Ryzen optimizations. CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all 'CPU-bound' games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR. With developers taking advantage of Ryzen architecture and the extra cores and threads, we expect benchmarks to only get better, and enable Ryzen excel at next generation gaming experiences as well. Game performance will be optimized for Ryzen and continue to improve from at-launch frame rate scores. John Taylor, AMD. It's hard to know what if any differences might emanate from the dev kit seeding program but the 'years of Intel optimisations' assertion does ring true. Already AMD is confident that two developers are making the right moves to optimise for Ryzen CPUs. Oxide Games and Creative Assembly, developers of Ashes of the Singularity and Total War respectively, are acting to improve threading and performance on Ryzen systems "very soon" says PC Per. The source article also includes some 'testimonials' from Oxide Games and Creative Assembly about what they are doing to improve Ryzen performance in their games engine / games. Also remember that AMD's new partnership with Bethesda in Vulkan game development will help show AMD CPUs and GPUs in a good light.

Posted by Corky34 - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:16 To say it's caused by "optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms" seems more like sour grapes to me, it's not that games have been optimised uniquely to Intel platforms, that's unless AMD are positing that developers never optimised for any AMD platforms, it's that games have not been optimised for the new Zen architecture, yet. Posted by CAPTAIN_ALLCAPS - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:35 One theory I have read somewhere is that task schedulers may be shuffling threads from one four-core module to another. Since L3 cache is not shared across the modules (8+8 arrangement) this will cause cache misses and hit performance. I am also sure that memory latency will improve going forwards as motherboard manufacturers get to grips with the IMC. All told I am not actually too worried. I don't believe it can do so well in 3DMark Firestrike/Timespy and yet be bad for games in general, even if that is a synthetic benchmark. Now that Ryzen is in the open, games programmers will pay more attention in time for the more game-oriented CPU releases. Still, I have always thought there should be an option in operating systems along the lines of “disable SMT for this program”. Plenty of software loses performance when using SMT - many EPS modelling HPCs/clusters have to disable SMT globally. It would be nice to keep the SMT cores for background tasks. Posted by Mtomi - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:40 Corky34 To say it's caused by "optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms" seems more like sour grapes to me, it's not that games have been optimised uniquely to Intel platforms, that's unless AMD are positing that developers never optimised for any AMD platforms, it's that games have not been optimised for the new Zen architecture, yet. It's actually sounds like a really plausible scenario. First Ryzen is a whole new architecture so its unlikely any game could be optimized for it. Secondly, if you see the reviews the benches show that the single core performance is just there where AMD said it will be, on par with Broadwell, and the multi core performance is even better given the SMT is better scaling than intels HT. So the grunt is there in the CPU, it won't disappear by starting a game instead of a benchmark. It needs optimization. I expect alot of patches in the next 1-2 months and a lot of performance from those in games. Posted by Irien - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:42 Can't help feeling compiler optimisations might also come into play. Intel spend a lot on compiler tech and integrating patches etc into the main line compilers, and that must surely give an advantage. With Zen so new, perhaps the toolchains simply haven't been updated as aggressively for AMD's architecture? Posted by Corky34 - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:50 Mtomi It's actually sounds like a really plausible scenario…. I'm not saying it's not but they way AMD seem to be couching it is that developers have optimised for Intel platforms while ignoring AMD when that seems implausible at best, like i said it's not that developers have only ever optimised for Intel platforms while ignoring AMD, it's that they've not had time to optimise for the new Zen architecture. It seems like the sort of answer you'd expect from a PR representative whose more concerned about protecting the brand than letting people know they recognise the problem and are working to fix it.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores.

I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours.

For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck.

I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

While its announcement did not come from Barcelona, Xiaomi officially unveiled its first in-house designed mobile SoC, which will power its own Mi 5c smartphone. While in Barcelona, Spreadtrum announced a new 14nm SoC produced on Intel's Airmont architecture. Xiaomi's announcement about its Surge 1 chipset comes after over two years of development through its Pinecone subsidiary with development beginning in late 2014. The specifications of the chip include an integrated five-mode Cat4 LTE modem supporting 23 frequency bands. Although the modem is five-mode it may not support WCDMA right away with that functionality coming via an OTA update after the release of the phone. Other specifications of the SoC include an 8-core ARM Cortex A53 CPU with four cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four more clocked at 1.4GHz. The GPU is a four-core ARM Mali T860. Also in the SoC is a 32-bit DSP supporting high-quality voice calls with 16kHz sampling and which also supports VoLTE; as well as a 14 bit dual ISP that enables increased light sensitivity and noise reduction algorithms. The Mi 5c itself sits at the lower end of the mid-range smartphone market as its prices start around US$220 at release, which is slated for March 3, 2017. In its announcement, Spreadtrum bills its new SC9861G-IA as a mid-range and high-end LTE SoC platform. The SoC was produced via Intel's custom foundry services. Intel announced Spreadtrum was designing on its 14nm foundry platform in fall 2016. The octa-core 2GHz SoC has an integrated Cat7 modem capable of 300Mbps on the downlink and 100Mbps on the uplink. This is the second mobile SoC from Spreadtrum capable of Cat7 LTE, the company announced the previous-generation SC9860 which was also capable of Cat7 during the 2016 Mobile World Congress. The GPU in the 9861G is the PowerVR GT7200 GPU as opposed to an ARM Mali T880MP4 which was used in the previous-generation LTE chip, this marks another win for Imagination Technologies which displaced ARM's Mali on MediaTek's newly-announced Helio X30 as well. The SC9860 was built on TSMC's 16nm FFC process. Overall this is the third LTE SoC from Spreadtrum since April 2015, when the SC9830 was announced. The SC9830 powered some non-flagship lower cost smartphones from market leader Samsung in 2016. The Surge S1 and the SC9861G-IA are more examples of SoC that are best suited for mid-tier and below smartphones, IHS suggested. The SoC will likely be competitive with the MediaTek Helio X30, Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and 400 series products, Samsung Exynos 3 and 7 ModAP, and the Kirin 650 from HiSilicon. While Xiaomi is a newcomer to the SoC/LTE baseband market, Spreadtrum's own experience in the relatively early days of its LTE portfolio may prove how difficult it is to gain market share. Spreadtrum's LTE baseband market share has failed to exceed 4% since it entered the market in the second quarter of 2015. Xiaomi will face a different situation as its SoC will be tied to the performance or market acceptance of its own phones in which it is used, starting with the Mi 5c, IHS identified. For third-party mobile SoC suppliers like Spreadtrum, relationships with large OEMs are critical as there are several examples of other companies who have entered and exited the market after failing to reach the necessary scale with their businesses to justify the expensive continual investment to compete in the market, IHS said. Broadcom, Marvell and Nvidia are just three such examples of companies which for all intents and purposes decided to exit the mobile SoC market before reaching very high shipment volumes. If Xiaomi is successful with its Surge S1 SoC and Spreadtrum has a hit with its own SC9861, suppliers like MediaTek and Qualcomm will most likely be adversely affected, IHS said. Both companies currently power phones from Xiaomi where a home-grown solution could limit future penetration and the product from Spreadtrum could compete strongly in China and other highly contested developing markets.

Often times, when trolling YouTube or playing a quick round of Overwatch the limitations on performance seem tied to something else. Your internet is too slow, or you need a new graphics card. Computer processors have gotten faster - every year Intel unveils a microarchitecture with breathless claims of mighty performance improvements, but CPUs haven't had a real leap forward in a while. AMD's new Ryzen processors comes perilously close to changing the game. In recent years, AMD has kind of become the ugly cousin to competitors Intel and Nvidia. While AMD may power the Xbox One and the PS4, the company has languished in the traditional computer market. On the graphics side, Nvidia has stomped AMD to hold the majority marketshare — Nvida's cards are found in most gaming laptops, and a lot of workstations too. On the CPU. side Intel is practically ubiquitous with the word computer. Seeing the tiny AMD sticker on a good laptop is an oddity, not a regularity. AMD desperately wants that to change and the Ryzen CPU is the first step. AMD's Ryzen processor is based on the company's new Zen microarchitecture. Zen is nearly half the size of AMD's last microarchitecture, the six-year-old Bulldozer. And Ryzen, running on Zen, is much, much faster. Not just faster than the chips running on the ageing Bulldozer. Ryzen is also significantly faster than much of what Intel has to offer. Today, only three Ryzen chips are available, and they're only going to work with desktop computers. There's the 1700, which retails for $US330 ($436), the 1700x, which retails for $US400 ($529), and the top of the line 1800x, which retails for $US500 ($661). It feels almost like a gamble for AMD to launch its new microarchitecture with desktop CPUs. Work places are increasingly moving to laptops, and that's what most consumers look for when they head to the big box store to buy a new computer. But it makes sense when you see how the top of the line Ryzen 1800x stacks up against Intel's best Kaby Lake CPU, the i7-7700K. This thing flies when rendering 3D images in Blender or videos in Handbrake, or even the game Rise of the Tomb Raider. In all three instances it was nearly twice as fast as the i7, despite costing just $US150 ($198) more. From top to bottom: Blender, Handbrake, Rise of the Tomb Raider. Much of the Ryzen's speed comes from the number of processor cores it packs into the CPU. It has eight cores, capable of running 16 threads concurrently. The i7-7700K has just 4 cores that run 8 threads concurrently. So the Ryzen can handle twice as many processes concurrently — which is especially useful when you have to render giant chunks of media in programs like Blender and Handbrake. According to both Intel and AMD, the processor that is most comparable to the 1800X is Intel's i7-6900K. But the i7-6900K runs on the older Broadwell-E architecture...and it currently retails for $US1000 ($1,322). Which means the Ryzen 1800X can give the same performance for half the price. That's magic! That's money saved! That also has to mean there's a catch. In the case of AMD's miracle new ultra fast processors there are two catches. The first is related to speed — Ryzen is still slow in a lot of instances. Intel has dominated so much of the computer market than many software designers have optimised their product to run especially well on Intel CPUs. Which is why it took the 1800x twice as long to render images in Photoshop, and why it was neck and neck with the i7-7700K in both our WebXPRT and Civilizations VI benchmarks. It's also why it scored only 2000 points higher in Geekbench 4 despite having twice as many cores. Clockwise from left to right: Geekbench 4, WebXPRT, Photoshop, Civilizations VI. Until software designers start optimising for Ryzen it will only be able to brute force its way into winning benchmarks, and software designers may never do that unless AMD can gain more of the CPU marketshare. Though AMD reps assured Gizmodo that software designers will soon be able to incorporate many potential optimizations tailored for Ryzen. Yet that won't help with Ryzen's other issue: the integrated GPU. The Ryzen CPUs don't have one. There's no way to get video out. If you want to view anything on your computer built with Ryzen inside — browser, operating systems, even BIOS — you'll have to spend additional money on a graphics card. That's not a problem for gamers, or editors and designers rendering huge files. They will have already invested in a video card. It is a problem for budget conscious PC builders. And it will continue to be a problem until AMD drops its Accelerated Processing Units (the name for AMD's CPUs with integrated graphics) later this year. The APUs and other mobile friendly chips are certainly on the horizon — AMD has promised as much, but right now what AMD has delivered is incredible speeds that will benefit only a small portion of computer users. Which is a damn shame. Ryzen runs cooler than Kaby Lake or Skylake, and it sucks up less power, and it's faster. In nearly every way that counts Ryzen seems superior to what Intel is currently offering. But it's going to need more than raw speed if it ever wants to truly win. The 1800X's price to power ratio has me nearly convinced AMD has a contender — now stick this in a laptop that goes for less than the Intel version and we might have a winner.

Chris Jager 06 Mar 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lifehacker, I've been a smoker since I was 14. I'm now 22 and I consider myself to be smoking hot (pun intended). I've heard that smoking cigarettes can age you prematurely. However, judging by the before-and-after photos I've seen, most of these people were pretty rough to begin with! Will smoking really ruin my good looks, or will I just go from a 9 to an 8.5? (I whiten my teeth professionally, so that's not a problem.)

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

Apologies for my approximate reading and thanks for pointing out those paragraphs to me :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 ZippyLemon says: Off topic but, as an English teacher living in Germany, I’m curious and would like to ask: by “past 22” do you mean “past the age of 22” or “after 10pm”? The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:28 Solidstate89 says: From what I’ve seen, playing at 1440 resolutions (I play at either 3440×1440, or 2560×1440 for those games that don’t like 21:9) is basically inconsequential (as the article states) with only a few exceptions of being really far behind Intel’s offerings. But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 22:28 Jabberslops says: Ryzen still isn’t compelling enough to me to upgrade my gaming computer when what I have is still able to get 100+fps in most games I play. I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - In its annual report, Intel Israel said that it had exported $3.3 billion of high-tech equipment in 2016 – 8 percent of all of Israel’s tech exports for the year. According to Daniel Ben Attar, head of production of Intel Israel, much of that was in the form of processors and equipment made in the company’s facility in Kiryat Gat. “This facility is considered one of Intel’s best in the world,” said Ben Attar. “The exports from this site make a great contribution to the Israeli economy, and provide a good source of income for Intel worldwide. Some 56 percent of our annual exports come from this facility.” Intel Israel currently has 10,200 workers in Israel, 67 percent of them (about 6,900 workers) working in development, with another third in the manufacturing facilities, which churn out processors for the “Intel Inside” laptops and desktops sold by manufacturers around the world. According to the company, it is directly responsible for an additional 30,000 jobs in Israel in companies that provide supplies and services to Intel Israel. “Intel’s facilities have had an enormous impact on Israel,” according to Yaniv Gerty, CEO of Intel Israel. “Over the past 43 years we have exported some $46 billion in goods and services, a huge amount that has had a major impact on Israel’s economic growth and on the lives of Israelis.” Filed under: Economy, Export Print Email Gmail Related Finance Ministry Mulls Intel Grant Intel to Shutter Yerushalayim Production Facility Intel Bails Out Kiryat Gat Factory High-Tech, Pharmaceutical Exports Jump Tech, Pharma Exports Fall Sharply, Report Says More in Israel Antiquities Theft Foiled Near Shaalvim Netanyahu Meets With Israeli Envoys in Asia-Pacific Security Forces Kill Terrorist in Shootout Near Ramallah U.S. Warning to Israel Signals New Backpedaling by Trump Switzerland Allegedly Funding Radical Anti-Israel NGOs OP-ED Name-Calling in the Name of Civil Rights How’s He Doing?

The answer to that, as it turns out, is a bit complicated. Before I dive into the details of the reviews, you might want to brush up on a couple of things: For a quick refresher on what Ryzen is, head here. For a very basic outline on how processors work, head here. So, now that you know what Ryzen is, you also know why I’m excited for it. Intel has been ruling the CPU market for a decade now and all AMD has managed to do so far, is struggle to keep its head above the water. Intel, taking advantage of this, simply monopolised the market and did what any monopoly would do, it kept prices high. Now I’m not against anything that Intel has done, it’s done a stellar job with its CPU design over the years and filled a gap that AMD was simply incapable of filling. While Intel may have completely ruined AMD’s future with shady marketing tactics in AMD’s Athlon 64 days, Intel’s Core architecture and Sandy Bridge in particular, took CPUs to another level of performance. That said, Intel didn’t did extract a high price for this GigaHertz goodness and I owe the company no loyalty. AMD, for its part, should also have done better. And now it has, finally. Ryzen 7 compute performance As expected, Ryzen 7 thrashes Intel in just about every benchmark that benefits from a high core count. This includes 3D rendering, number crunching, video editing, etc. At the same time, Ryzen 7’s clock speeds are lower than Intel’s and its IPC (instructions per clock) is also lower. This lower’s gaming performance as modern games, even today, don’t need 8 cores. Intel’s integer operations performance is also higher, resulting in better gaming performance. As ArsTechnica found in its review, the Ryzen 1800X beats the Intel i7 6950X – which is more than double the price – in tests like Cinebench and video encoding. Tests which focus on integer performance, like 3DMark, definitely appear to favour Intel. Again, integer performance is essential for gaming. To get a bit technical, AMD’s Ryzen will benefit tasks that require a large number of floating point operations, such as raw math tasks and rendering. Just about everything else will need integer performance, which Intel can offer thanks to its AVX 2 (advanced vector extensions) instruction sets. The bottom line is this, in pure computational tasks, AMD is either way better or just a tad slower than Intel. In terms of value for money, Ryzen is phenomenal as it does this at half the price of Intel’s best offering. Even if Intel’s architecture is better, it’s just priced too high. Ryzen 7 gaming performance This is what we’ve been waiting for, isn’t it? Sadly, there is bad news on this front. As mentioned earlier, a higher core count doesn’t affect games. A higher clock speed and a higher IPC does. Benchmarks on various sites show that AMD’s Ryzen 7 is slower than even Intel’s quad-core i7 7700K, which is cheaper than the 1800X, by the way. The difference in performance in games like Rise of the Tomb Raider, Ashes of the Singularity, Hitman, etc., ranges from 4 percent to almost 30 percent. This is very significant to a gamer, especially if you’re building a high-end gaming rig. For those who stream their games live on Twitch and the like, there is still no good news. Apparently, AMD Ryzen doesn’t suffer as much of a performance drop as Intel when streaming games, but despite that, the overall performance of the flagship Ryzen 7 1800X is lower than that of the Intel’s 7700K. For gaming, nothing beats Intel, yet. I’m building a new PC, should I buy Ryzen? AMD’s Ryzen 5 and 3 haven’t yet been announced, so I can’t comment on the lower end of the spectrum. If you’re building a high-end rig, however, the choice is clear. If you’re building a high-end workstation for real work, i.e., 3D rendering, video encoding, etc., AI research, etc., AMD Ryzen 7 just offers too much value for money. Taking a Ryzen 7 for this is literally a no-brainer. If you’re building a PC for gaming, however, the Intel i7 7700K is still the way to go. The performance difference is simply too great. It’s also cheaper than the 1800X. If you’re looking for in-depth Ryzen reviews, head here. For a slightly more layman friendly version, head here.

The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more.

Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck.

I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

You Need To Know About Ryzen, AMD's Shot At An Intel-Killing Chip Alex Cranz Mar 3, 2017, 3:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  cpus intel kaby lake microarchitecture ryzen zen Share Sometimes it feels like computers have reached peak speed. Often times, when trolling YouTube or playing a quick round of Overwatch the limitations on performance seem tied to something else. Your internet is too slow, or you need a new graphics card. Computer processors have gotten faster — every year Intel unveils a microarchitecture with breathless claims of mighty performance improvements, but CPUs haven't had a real leap forward in a while. AMD's new Ryzen processors comes perilously close to changing the game. In recent years, AMD has kind of become the ugly cousin to competitors Intel and Nvidia. While AMD may power the Xbox One and the PS4, the company has languished in the traditional computer market. On the graphics side, Nvidia has stomped AMD to hold the majority marketshare — Nvida's cards are found in most gaming laptops, and a lot of workstations too. On the CPU. side Intel is practically ubiquitous with the word computer. Seeing the tiny AMD sticker on a good laptop is an oddity, not a regularity. AMD desperately wants that to change and the Ryzen CPU is the first step. AMD's Ryzen processor is based on the company's new Zen microarchitecture. Zen is nearly half the size of AMD's last microarchitecture, the six-year-old Bulldozer. And Ryzen, running on Zen, is much, much faster. Not just faster than the chips running on the ageing Bulldozer. Ryzen is also significantly faster than much of what Intel has to offer. Today, only three Ryzen chips are available, and they're only going to work with desktop computers. There's the 1700, which retails for $US330 ($436), the 1700x, which retails for $US400 ($529), and the top of the line 1800x, which retails for $US500 ($661). It feels almost like a gamble for AMD to launch its new microarchitecture with desktop CPUs. Work places are increasingly moving to laptops, and that's what most consumers look for when they head to the big box store to buy a new computer. But it makes sense when you see how the top of the line Ryzen 1800x stacks up against Intel's best Kaby Lake CPU, the i7-7700K. This thing flies when rendering 3D images in Blender or videos in Handbrake, or even the game Rise of the Tomb Raider. In all three instances it was nearly twice as fast as the i7, despite costing just $US150 ($198) more. From top to bottom: Blender, Handbrake, Rise of the Tomb Raider. Much of the Ryzen's speed comes from the number of processor cores it packs into the CPU. It has eight cores, capable of running 16 threads concurrently. The i7-7700K has just 4 cores that run 8 threads concurrently. So the Ryzen can handle twice as many processes concurrently — which is especially useful when you have to render giant chunks of media in programs like Blender and Handbrake. According to both Intel and AMD, the processor that is most comparable to the 1800X is Intel's i7-6900K. But the i7-6900K runs on the older Broadwell-E architecture...and it currently retails for $US1000 ($1,322). Which means the Ryzen 1800X can give the same performance for half the price. That's magic! That's money saved! That also has to mean there's a catch. In the case of AMD's miracle new ultra fast processors there are two catches. The first is related to speed — Ryzen is still slow in a lot of instances. Intel has dominated so much of the computer market than many software designers have optimised their product to run especially well on Intel CPUs. Which is why it took the 1800x twice as long to render images in Photoshop, and why it was neck and neck with the i7-7700K in both our WebXPRT and Civilizations VI benchmarks. It's also why it scored only 2000 points higher in Geekbench 4 despite having twice as many cores. Clockwise from left to right: Geekbench 4, WebXPRT, Photoshop, Civilizations VI. Until software designers start optimising for Ryzen it will only be able to brute force its way into winning benchmarks, and software designers may never do that unless AMD can gain more of the CPU marketshare. Though AMD reps assured Gizmodo that software designers will soon be able to incorporate many potential optimizations tailored for Ryzen. Yet that won't help with Ryzen's other issue: the integrated GPU. The Ryzen CPUs don't have one. There's no way to get video out. If you want to view anything on your computer built with Ryzen inside — browser, operating systems, even BIOS — you'll have to spend additional money on a graphics card. That's not a problem for gamers, or editors and designers rendering huge files. They will have already invested in a video card. It is a problem for budget conscious PC builders. And it will continue to be a problem until AMD drops its Accelerated Processing Units (the name for AMD's CPUs with integrated graphics) later this year. The APUs and other mobile friendly chips are certainly on the horizon — AMD has promised as much, but right now what AMD has delivered is incredible speeds that will benefit only a small portion of computer users. Which is a damn shame. Ryzen runs cooler than Kaby Lake or Skylake, and it sucks up less power, and it's faster. In nearly every way that counts Ryzen seems superior to what Intel is currently offering. But it's going to need more than raw speed if it ever wants to truly win. The 1800X's price to power ratio has me nearly convinced AMD has a contender — now stick this in a laptop that goes for less than the Intel version and we might have a winner. Correction: The original piece identified the i7-6900K as Skylake. It is, in fact, Broadwell-E. Comments Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja Mar 3, 2017, 4:25pm i weas sad to see it was only just scraping past intel chips. but im glad to know its mainly due to software optimisation, which is what i suspected in the first place. and i guess its also amazing that its winning by brute forcing most of the time. i didnt realise there was no integrated gpu, seems like a shot in the foot and an area that could have helped with their sales. im glad i cant afford to upgrade my 9yo pc right now, gives me time to wait it out for the rest of the year and see how things change down the track. i hope AMD goes from strength to strength in the coming months when theyre supported by software optimisation and have their other products out. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 4, 2017, 7:16am I think people are overestimating compiler optimisation. No developer explicitly targets AMD64, and very few target Intel64. Most compilers include a favour setting but it's almost always left on blend: optimisations are included for both architectures but only if they match or benefit both. It remains to be seen, but I wouldn't expect more than a percent or two difference based on what we know so far.

The company introduced three, 8-core Ryzen 7 models, available on Thursday, which are based on the new AMD Zen core microarchitecture and are targeted for PC gamers and enthusiasts. "We are extremely enthusiastic about AMD’s new Ryzen chips. Our testing shows that they provide an often times superior alternative to Intel’s Kabylake and Broadwell-E processors," said Andrew Kretzer, director of sales and marketing at Bold Data Technology, a Fremont, Calif.-based systems builder. "Indeed, this is the first processor that our gaming, enthusiast and prosumer customers have been excited about for a while." [Related: The 10 Biggest Intel Executive Moves Of The Last 12 Months] AMD's three Ryzen 7 chips, which all have 8 cores and 16 threads, range in base clock from 3 GHz for the 1700 model to 3.6 GHz for the 1800X model. The chips also range in suggested pricing, from $349 for the 1700 to $499 to the high-end 1800X. AMD's pricing and performance specs target Intel's new seventh generation Core i3, i5 and i7 Kaby Lake products, which were released last year. For instance, the company's high-end 95W TDP Ryzen 7 1800X is only $499 – while its equivalent Intel silicon chip, the 140W TDP i7-6900K, costs $1050. The company pitted its products against Intel to appeal to enthusiast customers – for instance, AMD said its Ryzen 5 bested Intel's Core i5 7600K processor, saying that the chip beat out Intel's flagship product by more than 60 percent in multi-threaded CPU testing. "With Ryzen 7 desktop processors, AMD delivers to PC gamers, prosumers and enthusiasts both the highest performance and the lowest power 8-core desktop PC processors, bringing the absolute best PC experience to millions of people," said AMD CEO Lisa Su in a statement. Partners, for their part, hope that AMD will tighten its focus on channel partners along with its new Ryzen chips. "I think a lot remains to be seen on whether AMD can deliver the product," said one AMD partner, who wished to remain anonymous. "They’ve been absent from this market for a very long time so they’ll need to regain some [market] share but I think resellers will be open to listen and explore the opportunities with the product." Intel responded to AMD's new processor pricing through dropping its own products' prices. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company dropped its six-core Intel Core i7-6850K price on Micro Center from $700 to $550 this past week.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:48 Jeremy Laird says: You must have missed these excerpts!: “Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. ” “Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games.” “the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers” “for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs” For the most part, if you run at high res and graphical detail, the gap is inconsequential in most games. Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games.

I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well.

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest Can AMD’s Ryzen deflate Intel? Jack Gold, J.Gold Associates@jckgld March 2, 2017 5:40 PM Above: AMD's new Ryzen processor brand. Image Credit: AMD AMD today released its highly anticipated Ryzen desktop processors aimed squarely at high performance computing needs — as well as at Intel. Its Ryzen 7 devices will go head to head with Intel’s Core i7, and its newly announced Ryzen 5 will go head to head with Intel’s Core i5. AMD has been behind almost across the board in processor design over the past few years. Can Ryzen really propel it back into a viable competitive position with Intel? AMD has had a difficult struggle over the past several years as it tried to find its footing in a highly competitive market. Its PC oriented CPUs fell short as competitive products to Intel’s, and it was essentially forced to become the discount processor company for lower end products. Its GPUs also suffered due to a resurgent Nvidia, who not only extended a lead in graphics but refocused its efforts in multiprocessing extensions targeted at AI and ML (e.g.., in autonomous vehicles, drones, etc.). AMD’s dabbling in ARM, including in ARM-based servers that were supposed to threaten Intel’s dominance in cloud-centric data centers but never really materialized, has not produced any dramatic improvements in AMD’s business. And its recent realization that it needed to play in the AI space has yet to bear any significant fruit. With all this as background, AMD is making a major push with its new Zen architecture based Ryzen CPUs, starting at the higher end desktop space targeting high-performance “junkies” needing the best and fastest performing chips. Mostly driven by the gaming market, these users force their chips to do unnatural acts – pushing them past their limits with overclocking, voltage/power manipulation, and bleeding-edge cooling schemes. While this demographic makes up a relatively small percentage of the overall PC market (10-15 percent at best), it is nonetheless important as it’s highly lucrative compared to the cutthroat competition in consumer mainstream machines. These high performance chips sell in the $500-$1000 range and are a highly visible way for vendors to get “street creed” for their brands. AMD has a need to be seen not only as the “low cost spread” but also as a viable competitor to Intel across the full spectrum of chip requirements. And if early tests of the new Ryzen chips are any indication, the company has done a great job of upping its game. The 8 core, 16 thread devices, although not very svelte in the power department with a draw of 95 watts, have shown impressive benchmarks for gaming and content creation that rivals or exceeds some of Intel’s high end Core i7 products. But is this enough for long-term success? A few hurdles still exist for AMD. First, while its current chips are very capable, getting AMD back into the game, the chip business has always been one of competitors leapfroging each other. Intel will soon release a new generation that will, in all likelihood, improve upon what it (and AMD) currently offer. Further, AMD is still targeting the lower price points. Rather than increase it margins, it believes it can vastly increase its market share by undercutting Intel on price, albeit with what it believes are superior products. But if a price war ensues, Intel can weather the storm better than AMD can. And AMD runs the risk of being seen as the low cost solution rather than the best product. I don’t mean this to be overly negative. AMD has made very significant progress over the past couple of years and under its revitalized management headed by Lisa Su. There is little doubt that its Zen architecture is a breakthrough in reestablishing its competitiveness with Intel and that it will be applying this architecture to more than just high-end gaming systems. I’d expect to see Ryzen derivatives make their way to all corners of the AMD product line in the coming few quarters. And it’s highly likely the new chips will be very well received by the builders and high-end gamers who have been looking for true alternatives to Intel’s dominance. I’d expect to see a significant uptick in AMD’s sales once Ryzen makes its way fully into the channel. But as Ryzen/Zen move into other segments of the PC and server markets, AMD will still need to prove itself a worthy competitor to Intel with products that challenge Intel across their full product breadth – something that may be easier said than done. Bottom Line: With Ryzen, AMD has shown that it isn’t a moribund old-line company that is living on the edges of the PC market. Clearly the new products are something that Intel will take notice of and the market will reward. The question is, can AMD become a full line viable competitor to Intel in the x86 space. I am optimistic it can, as doing so would be good for the entire market, including Intel who will be spurred on by the competition. But we’ll have to wait several quarters to see if it can execute.

During his confirmation hearing for the attorney general post in January, Sessions said that he never spoke with any Russian officials during the campaign. Sessions has since argued that he met and talked with Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Schiff dismissed that notion on Thursday, saying the attorney general would have to be “extraordinarily naive or gullible to believe that the Ambassador was seeking him out in his office for a discussion on military matters.” “Sessions is neither,” he said.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

Apologies for my approximate reading and thanks for pointing out those paragraphs to me :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 ZippyLemon says: Off topic but, as an English teacher living in Germany, I’m curious and would like to ask: by “past 22” do you mean “past the age of 22” or “after 10pm”? The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Justin Mitchell reports. March 2nd 2017 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ US President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in Washington, DC. Picture: Jim Lo Scalzo/AFP Photo news.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend DONALD Trump is being praised for his uncharacteristically positive maiden speech to congress. The US President’s address before the joint session of US politicians in Washington was, well, more presidential than anyone was expecting. But while yesterday’s appearance hinted the new leader was growing into his role, President Trump may have also set himself up for disaster. Disguised by moderate language and a calm delivery, Trump’s over-the-top promises and sensational ideas were still there. He made some big calls, just in a less blusterous tone than usual. These are the big promises Trump made in the speech that’s been labelled his most restrained yet. SAVE JOBS Mr Trump promised he was going to “bring back millions of jobs” to the US and claimed he had already started. “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs,” he said. But analysis by Associated Press indicates Mr Trump may have jumped the gun taking credit for those positions. The corporate job decision that Mr Trump is referring to largely predates his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama’s presidency, AP reported. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high- powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Mr Trump also mentioned that he had withdrawn the US from the “job-killing” Trans-Pacific Partnership, although this was met with less enthusiastic applause. LIFT WAGES AND LOWER TAXES The President also said protecting workers meant reforming the system of legal immigration. This leads to his next job-related promise — to lift wages for the nation’s poorest citizens. “It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class, and they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy indeed. “I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It’s been a long time since we had fair trade,” he said. “The current outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.” The president also said he would “provide massive tax relief for the middle class”, but is yet to explain how he plans to do this. US President Donald Trump’s address sounded measured, but his promises were sensational. Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP SPEND SPED SPEND Mr Trump bagged the previous administration for its spending in the Middle East, which he reckons would have been better invested on local infrastructure. He said America had spent about $6 trillion in the Middle East, while the country’s own infrastructure crumbled. “With $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice,” he said. So despite slamming the spending of his predecessors, the President pledged to come up with $1 trillion for new infrastructure. “I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.” He said this effort would be guided by two core principles “buy American and hire American”. STOP DRUGS Mr Trump pledged to dismantle criminal cartels and “stop drugs from pouring into our country”. The President said he had directed the Department of Justice to form a taskforce of reducing violent crime. “I have further ordered to co-ordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels,” he said. “We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” Mr Trump said construction would start soon on his campaign promise to build a wall between the US and Mexico, and it would be an “effective weapon against drugs and crime”. He says his administration is removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals from the United States. Trump said “bad ones” were going out as he spoke. The address received an unexpectedly positive response. Picture: Mike Theiler/AFP PhotoSource:AFP DESTROY ISIS Mr Trump will be left red-faced if he doesn’t destroy Islamic State while he’s president, and sooner rather than later. “As promised, I directed the Department of Defence to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children, of all faiths and all beliefs,” he said. “We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. “I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.” FIX HEALTH CARE Mr Trump spent a significant chunk of his campaign time and material rubbishing the previous president’s health care package Obamacare, setting a challenge for himself to better it. Mr Trump called on members of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. “We should help Americans to purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government,” he said. He said legal reforms should be implemented to protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs. “The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines,” he said. But time will tell if President Trump will be able to deliver.

Back in 2014 when AMD first announced it was pursuing an all-new microarchitecture, old hands recalled the days when the battle between AMD and Intel was fun to be a part of, and users were happy that the competition led to innovation: not soon after, the Core microarchitecture became the dominant force in modern personal computing today. Through the various press release cycles from AMD stemming from that original Zen announcement, the industry is in a whipped frenzy waiting to see if AMD, through rehiring guru Jim Killer and laying the foundations of a wide and deep processor team for the next decade, can hold the incumbent to account. With AMD’s first use of a 14nm FinFET node on CPUs, today is the day Zen hits the shelves and benchmark results can be published: Game On! Gaming performance seems to lag behind Intel, while for workstation tasks, it has them beat. For me, an upgrade to Ryzen from my i5-4440 would amount to a total sum of about €900 (processor, motherboard, RAM, and cooling), so I'm going to wait it out for now - especially since gaming is what my processor is most used for. That being said - give it a year, and Ryzen will be up there on all fronts with Intel's best, but at a lower price point. AMD is definitely back, and I'm very excited to see what competition will bring to the market.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater!

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:48 Jeremy Laird says: You must have missed these excerpts!: “Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. ” “Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games.” “the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers” “for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs” For the most part, if you run at high res and graphical detail, the gap is inconsequential in most games. Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Tech Industry by Erin Carson March 2, 2017 1:11 PM PST @erincarson Gavin Grimm has a lot of support from Silicon Valley. The Washington Post/Getty Images Tech is throwing its support behind transgender rights in connection with an upcoming US Supreme Court case. The Human Rights Campaign said Thursday that 53 companies signed an amicus brief in support of Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy from Virginia, who sued his school board in Gloucester County over the right to use the bathroom that aligns with his gender identity. More than half the companies that signed the brief are tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, eBay, IBM, Intel, Twitter and Yahoo. "Across the country, corporate leaders are speaking out because they know attacking transgender youth isn't just shameful -- it also puts the families of their employees and customers at risk," said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, in a statement. Chipmaker Intel wrote a blog post in addition to signing the brief, saying, "Intel signed this amicus brief to stand with our LGBTQ colleagues, customers, communities, suppliers and partners, and we firmly believe that equality for LGBTQ individuals is a civil right." Several of the companies that signed the brief didn't immediately respond to a request for comment or said they had nothing to add beyond the brief. Tech has become increasingly involved with social issues. In the past several years, companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have released diversity reports and adopted policies and practices to become less homogenous. Companies also spoke out against President Donald Trump's January executive order on immigration. The topic of who can use which bathroom has been hotly debated. In February, Trump reversed policies former President Barack Obama made in 2016 to let transgender public school students use bathrooms matching their gender identity. A number of tech companies spoke out at the time. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, tweeted, "Rolling back rights for transgender students is wrong. Twitter and Square stand with the LGBTQ community, always." IBM stated at the time of the policy reversal: "IBM has had an explicit policy of non-discrimination based on gender identity or expression since 2002, and we are opposed to discrimination in all its forms, including any policies that discriminate based on gender identity in education." This isn't the first time tech has weighed in on transgender issues. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was a vocal opponent of North Carolina's law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their gender at birth. PayPal protested by nixing plans last year to expand in Charlotte, North Carolina, and companies like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco and eBay signed an amicus brief in 2016 supporting the Justice Department's effort to block the so-called "bathroom bill." "Every child deserves an opportunity to succeed free of fear, anxiety, and threats of discrimination. Salesforce strongly believes that all students, including transgender students, should be treated as equals, and we disagree with any effort to limit their rights. Equality for all," Salesforce said in a statement regarding Thursday's brief. That brief will be submitted with Grimm's case, which is expected go before the Supreme Court on March 28.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffJuan Williams: Time for a special prosecutor House intel chief: Russia probe will include potential surveillance of campaigns Schiff: Not even Spicer wants to speak about Trump's wiretapping claim MORE (D-Calif.) says FBI Director James Comey is holding back information about his bureau’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “I would say at this point we know less than a fraction of what the FBI knows,” Schiff told reporters after a briefing with Comey Thursday, according to Politico. “I appreciate we had a long briefing and testimony from the director today, but in order for us to do our investigation in a thorough and credible way, we’re going to need the FBI to fully cooperate,” added Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “[The FBI must] be willing to tell us the length and breadth of any counterintelligence investigations they are conducting. At this point, the director was not willing to do that.” During the briefing, Schiff said Comey faced “repeated questions about the scope of any investigation they were doing” and “individuals that may be the subject of any counterterrorism investigation.”  “The director declined to answer those questions,” he said. "It was unclear whether that decision was a decision he was making on his own or a decision that he is making in consultation with the Department of Justice.” “That can’t persist. Because we’re gonna need that information. And we’re better off getting that through the voluntary cooperation of the FBI than having to contemplate whether we need to subpoena the FBI.” Schiff added that an independent special prosecutor must investigate ties between President Trump’s 2016 election campaign and Russia in the light of the new controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsTrump makes key changes to travel ban Grassley: 'Too soon' for decision on special prosecutor in Trump-Russia probe Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey, Trump at odds on wiretapping | Obama advisers press Trump to act on cyber MORE. Reports emerged late Wednesday that Sessions spoke twice with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak last year. Sessions did not disclose talking with Kislyak during his confirmation hearings for attorney general, testifying under oath that he “did not have communications with the Russians.” The attorney general said Thursday he would recuse himself if necessary from any federal probe into links between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. “I have said whenever it’s appropriate, I will recuse myself,” the former GOP senator from Alabama told NBC News. "There’s no doubt about that.” Democrats are now calling for Sessions to recuse himself from any probe into the matter, and some are calling for his resignation.

Artificial intelligence and automation were edging out IT outsourcing models, putting pressure on the entire industry. Internally, Sikka discovered that while Infosys scored high on quality, professionalism and delivery excellence, clients did not perceive it as being proactive and innovative, and it lacked strategic relevance. This became a primary driver of Sikka’s “Zero Distance” strategy: Get close to the client’s needs to “go beyond the charter of the project and do something innovative to delight the client, and do something that they did not expect.” As the first non-founder CEO of Infosys, Sikka has instituted other reforms as well that are turning around the company. Under his leadership, consolidated revenue rose by 17% and operating profit by 13% in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Sikka met with Knowledge@Wharton in Palo Alto, Calif. He spoke about sweeping changes in technology because of the emergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Sikka explained the zero distance concept and how it fits into his strategy for Infosys. He also discussed the leadership challenge of transforming Infosys’s culture without abandoning its innovative roots or the vision of its founders. An edited transcript of the conversation follows. Knowledge@Wharton: You were appointed CEO of Infosys in June 2014. Since then, how have the challenges that companies have been trying to solve through technology changed? Or are they pretty much the same that they were back then? Vishal Sikka: They have become more intense, more accelerated and more severe. With every passing day, the rate of change gets faster. The impact of Moore’s Law [the idea that computing power doubles every two years] becomes more pronounced. … Not only the famous Moore’s Law but all the variations of it, in all the different parts of the industry. The advance of automation and digitization across the world have become more severe, more intense. The need for computing and computing awareness has become more intense everywhere. Knowledge@Wharton: What is driving that intensity? Sikka: The divide between people who truly understand the impact of the digitizing world and those who don’t is just becoming bigger. Over the last two-and-a-half years since I started at Infosys, the top five companies in the world by market cap [have changed and now comprise] technology companies — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook — which is quite staggering. … If you look back over the last 10 years — the iPhone was barely out and Barack Obama was not president yet, Uber wasn’t around. Tesla wasn’t around — the Fortune 500 [companies] that were there at that time, something like 35% or 36% of those companies are not on the list anymore. The people who make technology companies are no different than us [or past Fortune 500 incumbents]. [Former Apple co-founder] Steve Jobs used to say that the important thing in life is to remember that everything around us was built by people who are no different or superior to us. It’s not as though there is some magic in technology. I find it incredible that all these companies have lost their Fortune 500 status. They all had huge budgets with large consulting companies and innovation departments. So what happened? My wife runs our foundation here in the U.S., and she found this amazing statistic that if computing — programming a computer or being able to work with a computer — is the new literacy, and if you relate that conceptually, although they are vastly different, to reading and writing, the literacy rate on the planet slumps. In the Dark Ages, the [literacy] rate was around 6%. Today about 0.5% of the world can read and write with a computer — the computer literacy rate is less than the actual literacy in the Dark Ages. So when [computer scientist and pioneer] Alan Kay says that the computer revolution hasn’t begun yet, I think we are advancing into a world that is going to be completely defined by software, by digital. And we don’t have a society that is literate in these technologies. Knowledge@Wharton: You mentioned digital transformation and automation. You hear those buzzwords, along with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a lot these days. Almost every company is talking about them. Companies like IBM with Watson, Google with their Brain group and Microsoft are active in this field. How do you see Infosys differentiating itself in this world, to set a value proposition that is unique? Sikka: I studied AI. Marvin Minsky, one of the fathers of AI, wrote my recommendation letter for my admission to Stanford. John McCarthy was at Stanford. He was known as [another] father of AI. He actually coined the term ‘artificial intelligence.’ John was one of my teachers. So I sort of grew up in AI. Back then it was the AI winter; people did not really want to be associated with AI. I look back over these past 25 years that I’ve been working on it — my Ph.D. is in a part of AI called Turing-proving, logical reasoning, and so on. I also worked in neural networks and machine learning. I spent a memorable summer at Intel, and the Intel AI lab … and working on neural networks for the Intel manufacturing process. What has happened in the past 20 years is that there has been a tremendous advance in computing. Back when I worked on the neural networks at Intel as a student, computers were probably more than a million times worse in performance than they are today. That is one vast change that has happened. “So far, the work in AI is largely focused on the consumer world. … The enterprise world is wide open, rich with applications and so forth.” There have been some conceptual advances in techniques in AI. Deep Learning has become very popular in the past few years because of the success of a few techniques — CNNs (convolutional neural networks) are what they are called, and reinforcement learning and so forth. But they are not such significant advances conceptually. The real advances are in computing and the availability of massive amounts of data, like when you look at YouTube or Instagram there is a massive amount of data, and the computers are ridiculously more powerful. And some of these techniques — in fact Deep Learning itself — are possible because of the huge power of computers that is creating applications in a vast number of areas across industries. So far, the work in AI is largely focused on the consumer world, and in some areas like robotics and autonomous driving. The enterprise world is wide open, rich with applications and so forth. When we look at AI, I would say there are three important aspects we have to think about. One is that there have been breathtaking applications. Recently, one of the Carnegie Mellon poker AI programs beat the four best poker players in the world. … And there is no doubt that as a result of AI advances, many of the jobs that we have today are going to go away. A lot of those jobs are in my part of the world, in my industry. Also, the jobs that we would not normally think of, like doctors, lawyers, legal researchers — the mechanizable parts of these jobs — will go to AI. The second point is that we are still very early in the development of AI. There is deeper AI, the ‘society of mind’ that Minsky talked about [in which interactions of mindless components come together to form intelligence]. We are still not close to that. Probably in our lifetimes we will not see a truly [deep] AI, despite the hype. I don’t think this is going to happen; this is longer term. The third point is that we tend to get scared of and mystified by technologies like AI. But the reality is that people are building AI, and so there is no reason why everybody cannot learn how to build AI systems. We have to teach people AI; this is not dropping from the skies and into our hands, people are writing code that is intelligent code. For every truck driver who will lose his job to a truck-driving system, there is a person writing the truck-driving system. And so that human potential to build AI is still in front of us. We will see the same duality play out. If we sit still, there is absolutely no doubt that our jobs are going to be wiped out by AI — 60% to 70% over the next 10 years, or maybe less than 10 years, of the jobs that we do today are going to be replaced by AI unless we continue to evolve ourselves, unless we continue to develop better technology and faster automation. I have been working furiously on ways to teach machine learning and AI techniques. I did a class myself; I prepared it for our kids. We have a great university at [the Infosys campus in Mysore, India]. We teach AI here at a huge level. And we want to bring AI into two dimensions. One is to help improve our productivity in our existing services. If you look at the evolution of Infosys, 35 years ago we started with application development and maintenance, which to this day is a very human, cognitive job. But the dramatic growth that happened in the IT industry in the past 20 years is more mechanical than that, like infrastructure management or BPO [business process outsourcing], software verification. “Problem-finding is still a human frontier. To be able to look into a room and be able to see what is not here, what is missing.” The tons of jobs that were created in these areas are all [vulnerable to] automation. Depending on the nature of your business mix, huge parts of your business are prone to automation. It’s already happening. In the first nine months of this financial year, we have saved 8,000 people’s equivalent work using automation. There is that carving out — eating up of the existing mechanizable work using AI — that’s a big part of it. The other big part of it is the new applications of AI. Earlier today, our folks here [in Palo Alto] were showing me a remarkable application that they have built for one of the big train companies, railroad companies, where they feed the contract documents into our AI platform, and then they automate the process of complying with these contracts. [It applies] also in HR — with jury duty and vacation and strikes and overtime and all these kinds of things that in unionized workforces you have to comply with. How do you ensure that you are continually compliant with that? This is a beautiful application of AI. Similarly, consider forecasting profits or revenue. Understanding customer behavior down to the level of an individual customer. Things of this nature. So that’s what we are doing, using AI to improve our work, keep up our existing services, and release people’s imagination to be creative and innovative. And at the same time, we are building new kinds of applications. Knowledge@Wharton: What is the most striking example of how AI has made someone that Infosys is working with more innovative? Sikka: We have a very large apparel retail footwear company [as a client]. We have helped them dramatically accelerate their product innovation process. Generally, what happens when you make a shoe or a piece of apparel is that a designer comes up with an idea. You see that this is something that will work. So now you have to [decide to] make this or not, and then determine the cost of the ingredients and where to source them from. This is a very complex problem. … The raw materials for these kinds of products tend to be very complex, and then you’re to source them to make it for millions of consumers. Generally, the processes around that are very surprisingly weak. With AI, we can dramatically amplify people’s ability to understand those costs, forecast those costs, and then to accelerate. We can bring down the time it takes to bring a new product to life from six months to two weeks. This is one amazing example. Another one is in the relatively mundane area of financial closing. The time it took to close monthly books was 11 days; we brought it down to 14 hours. The CFO of the company is a huge fan of this. Sponsored Content: … So there are applications like that. There is a very large insurance company and they send out policy documents to their policyholders. There is a team of 1,000 people including about 100 to 150 people from Infosys that goes through these documents and extracts 30 or 40 fields manually. Within two days of work on our AI platform, we were able to completely automate this. … This is one of the most striking examples of the power of automation, that literally in 48 hours, with the work of one of our engineers, we were able to essentially eliminate the work that was being done by 1,000 people. Knowledge@Wharton: Let me bring you back to the question of jobs since this seems relevant to what you just said. If so many jobs are going to be eliminated, first what should be done about that at the social level? Secondly, are there jobs that computers can’t do that can now be done by people? How do you think about these things? Sikka: Technology has been doing this for a long time. If you look at agriculture, if you look at industry, automation has happened. We now get more scared of AI because of the white-collar nature of the jobs that are at risk, but the reality is that AI is another one of these technologies in this long list, the long pantheon of technologies that have amplified human ability. When we think about jobs, our brains are wired by nature to think about things in terms of the past. Our vocabulary, our metrics, our concepts are all based on what we have seen in the past. So every time we look backwards and we think that all these jobs will go away, what we don’t realize is that there are also new kinds of jobs that are being created, which [before] we had no idea would exist. AI is one of these. When people are writing AI, all kinds of AI systems are developed, and amazing applications are built. And there will be enough jobs — if we have enough trained people. Right now, there are 18 million open IT jobs in the world. We don’t have enough people. Part of the reason this debate exists is it’s not so much that you bring in people because they are cheaper than others, this is not true. It may be true in pockets but as a whole it is not true; it is simply that there are not enough skills, and people with the skills are not there. Fundamentally the answer is education. Now everybody says, ‘of course, everybody talks about education.’ The reality is that in order to do something, we have to learn to do that thing [that would let us accomplish the task]. We have to teach people, and we have to teach them lifelong learning. I am co-chair, together with Missy Cummings [Duke University’s director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab], of the World Economic Forum’s Council on AI and Robotics. This is one of the big issues: How do we retrain people, especially the older people who are affected by this and who have families, and so on? In the end, the answer comes down to training, re-skilling, education. It could be that because of the pace of change, we have to help people during the time it takes them to re-skill themselves. There is a lot of thinking around that — universal basic income and other forms of social fabrics to help people. Broadly speaking, it is my sense that there is plenty of opportunity to build AI systems and so on. We tend to overlook the fact that all these technologies end up amplifying ourselves, they end up improving our abilities. When I started at Stanford, I had a remarkable experience. I went to see my advisor and I asked him, what do you want me to work on? He said, “I have no idea.” I was shocked by that. I said, there is supposed to be this list of problems and you are supposed to tell me one of them and I’d work on it. “I deeply believe that saying that there is an innovation department ensures that you don’t innovate anywhere else.” He said, “No, you find your own problem, then we will judge if this problem is good enough or not. You solve that problem and then we judge if the solution is good enough. This is how it works. If this is not what you had in mind, then this is not the right place for you.” That put me into a tailspin. I went to school in Syracuse, [New York] but I had grown up in India — all of your life, you learn to follow orders, follow authority, and do what you are told. That lesson informs and guides a lot of what I do at Infosys in terms of transforming a culture of doing what we are told. At that time, I started thinking about finding my own problem. John McCarthy who I mentioned earlier, he did a seminar [where he] said that articulating a problem is half the solution. It opened my eyes to the fact that there is such a thing as problem-finding. I talked to another professor, Bob Floyd who was also a Turing Award winner. He is the Floyd of Floyd’s Algorithm, for network logistics. I told him that McCarthy said this and he said, “Oh that’s not it. I frame a problem, then I solve it. Then I go back to see if I can reframe that, and I re-solve it until I can no longer improve the solution. That’s when I know I have found a beautiful solution.” … In those days, there was the Center for Design Research at Stanford that was starting to think about this problem, finding design thinking and problem synthesis kind of things. So I sort of grew up as I opened my eyes to this idea that there is problem solving, but there is also problem-finding. That was a very big lesson for me. … Design thinking is a very powerful idea around problem-finding. My sense is that within our lifetimes we will be able to build AI systems that are able to solve a problem that can be articulated, that can be mechanically defined. But problem-finding is still a human frontier. To be able to look into a room and be able to see what is not here, what is missing. What if we were to bring here something that would be desirable, visible and viable, that the world needs? All innovation is like that. Earlier when I was talking about [companies in] the Fortune 500 disappearing, it [shows that there] is a very profound failure of problem-finding, of not being able to see what is the right problem for our future, and to be able to then solve it, which is going to be easier and easier with AI. Knowledge@Wharton: You’ve talked about AI and what is happening in the world of technology. I wonder if we could take a step back again to two-and-a-half years ago when you were thinking about a strategy for Infosys. What was your assessment at that time of Infosys’s strengths and weaknesses as an organization, dealing with this world of technology and challenges? And how does the idea of Zero Distance fit into that strategy? Sikka: It is very fundamentally linked to what I have talked about, and in that sense it has been a homecoming in more ways than one. When I started, there was of course the big force of automation, technology, digitization, AI and so on, and you could see that. There were also some local issues within Infosys. The company was not doing so well and there was a lot of attrition and a sense of anxiety in the workforce. The iconic founders left at the time when I started. So there was a sense of anxiety in the company, which was very local. But the other big force was the nature of the IT services industry, and the nature of Infosys in the face of the technological disruption. … We [did] an annual survey of our clients and their satisfaction levels, [and what we found] was very revealing. It was actually very depressing. The [clients] would give us high scores on quality, on professionalism, on delivery excellence, but every one of them would give us the lowest scores on strategic relevance, on being proactive, on being innovative. I thought, ‘We are not innovative? We have 150,000 software engineers.’ That was really shocking. While I was reading this, I met with a client, chief operating officer of a huge mining company who was a friend of mine, and he asked me, ‘How are you doing? What have you found?’ And I told him, ‘I went through the survey and it’s really depressing. Is this what you have found?’ He said, ‘This is exactly what I have been telling your guys — that you don’t tell us proactively what we could be doing better. You do a great job of doing what you are told, but not of coming up with ideas.’ … Zero Distance was born out of that idea. There are about 9,500 main projects going on in the company, and I basically inspired every project to do something innovative. Knowledge@Wharton: Can you explain what Zero Distance actually means? And how do you tell whether it’s working? Sikka: The idea is that we don’t just do what we are told, but in every single project, no matter what it is, no matter how mundane, no matter what area it is in, you do something innovative. You find some problem and you solve that problem, you go beyond the charter of the project and do something innovative to delight the client, and do something that they did not expect. Something bigger than what you were thinking about. Knowledge@Wharton: For example? Sikka: For example, you are working on managing a loan process and you realize that because of this, that, or some other innovation this process can be simplified dramatically. So you go and tell the client that, look if I did this, that, or the other I can [significantly improve efficiency]. … And it is shocking, you know? [You can] take out two weeks out of a process just by applying your mind. So the idea of Zero Distance itself is that you focus on the teams that are in constant contact with the outside world. Those are the teams that can execute the transformation, because they are the ones living in the world outside. “There is no doubt that as a result of AI advances, many of the jobs that we have today are going to go away.” … People always ask me, why do large organizations stop being innovative? You pay consultants tons of money and then they come and tell you that middle management is broken, and it’s always the middle management that is broken. But in reality, it is not the middle management, it is the fact that in a large organization there are a whole bunch of people who have never seen the outside world. They have never sold anything, they have never built anything. And so you always have to flatten the organization as much as possible so that the maximum number of people have outside contact. … In our case, that is the project teams, and the heartbeat of our company is our projects. We have close to 10,000 projects going on. The amazing thing was that that thing just took off. We are approaching two years of Zero Distance. In March 2015, I launched it, and it was amazing to see how rapidly it was adopted. The project managers are young, about 31 to 32 years old, and the teams are even younger. Going down to that level, and creating that idea, that spark, was key. Part of the enabler was the design thinking. We just crossed 130,000 people that we train on design thinking. Everyone who comes in is trained on it, and we have been going around to our DCs (development centers) — also here in the on-site locations — and teaching people design thinking. Not to turn them into designers, but to create the spirit of problem-finding, the spirit of looking at the world and seeing what is not there, of exercising our imagination. The basic idea is to elevate [Infosys] from a cost-oriented service delivery culture towards an innovation culture at the grassroots. The bigger idea of course is that AI is coming, and we have to automate everything that we do as much as possible, and we have to become innovative, we have to become problem finders. Knowledge@Wharton: But how do you do that? You have a company, as you said before, where people are used to doing what they are told. How do you transform the culture of an organization from that to becoming innovators, so that they can act upon the strategy that you described? There’s an old saying that culture eats strategy for lunch. How are you dealing with that problem at Infosys? Sikka: It is very, very tough. Everybody says it is tough, but when you do it in reality, when you exercise it, you realize that it is much more difficult than it seems. The good news is that a culture of learning always helps. We had that — it comes from our founder [N.R. Narayana] Murthy. … He used to talk about ‘learnability,’ the ability to learn, as one of the key hiring criteria. The good news is that the youngsters are really willing to [learn]. They feel a sense of inspiration. Ironically, the desire to change [diminishes], as you go up the organizational levels and as you [get older]. [However,] there are some tremendous innovators who are [quite senior]. Hasso [Plattner, SAP’s chairman] used to say that at 70, he was just getting started. So it has nothing to do with age, but it has to do with how set we have become in our ways. Generally, I have found that the youngsters are much more open to embracing these ideas. I think that every one of us has that creative spark in us. Somehow our education, our schooling sort of beats it out of us by the time we are nine or 10 years old, and we forget about asking questions, and every once in a while [risking] looking stupid to ask some really silly question. People ask me why [we do] this one-day design exercise. On October 31 of 2014, less than 100 days at Infosys, I started this design training. Three of the faculty from the Stanford business school [got together] to create the training curriculum for design thinking. It’s a day-long experience that all these kids go through, and they make something. They understand what problem-finding and synthesis are all about as well. It serves to ignite a spark in their head: ‘Hey, why don’t I do this or why don’t I do that?’ One of the teams did this exercise [where] this technician has to make two rounds. One, go to the place where there is a problem to find what the problem is. Then he comes back, takes the stuff he needs and goes back to solve the problem. What if we forecast the problem so he just makes one trip? This was one of the ideas, and there have been thousands and thousands of these ideas, and it’s really amazing how it got adopted. To change the culture, one part was enabling it through education. But that doesn’t make you inspired. To do that, you have to constantly demonstrate that this is something serious, this is something rewarding. People don’t find compensation as important as recognition. So you have to recognize people. “Right now, there are 18 million open IT jobs in the world. We don’t have enough [trained] people.” In the two years since I started Zero Distance, I have probably held 35 Zero Distance meetings with various teams around the world. I do this every time I go to India — I do a Zero Distance meeting and sometimes 20,000 people show up in these meetings. I, and many of our senior leaders, show up there whenever we are around. I always do it. Whenever the leadership team is with me, they come with me. For the people, it is very important to see that, ‘Look, he is actually looking at five, six actual projects out of 10,000 projects,’ and that matters a lot. Things of this nature really help. We did a very interesting exercise to identify the most passionate people inside the company. Knowledge@Wharton: How did you do that? Sikka: Well, there is unfortunately no metric for passion. It’s one of those things where you know it when you see it. We found 20 or so people that we all agreed were supremely passionate, and we asked them to find — and tell us — who the other passionate people were, and we built up [an organizational] tree like that. Knowledge@Wharton: I would like to wrap up with a few questions on leadership. Before you became the CEO of Infosys, you were part of the leadership team at SAP. What was the difference between being a leader at SAP and being a leader at Infosys? What carries over and what is different? Sikka: People instincts carry over, they are the same, [as well as] the culture, the principles. There are the tasks before an organization — the A, B, and C. Those are the things that we do, those are different from company to company. Then there is the how we do the things we do, the processes, the mindset and the systems. Those are generally similar. They can still vary depending on what industry you are in. And so there is more similarity there. Then there is the C-task, which is why you do the things that you do: the purpose, the culture, the reason. Generally, people lose sight as they go through a change, they lose sight of the C-tasks. Of course, SAP was older than Infosys. Back when I was at SAP I think it was something like 43 and very different as a product company. And, of course, the culture [also differed with] Infosys being in India. At SAP, it has German roots but it was much more international, much more global. Here, although we have 22,000 people in the U.S., it’s very much an India-centric company. So many differences, but some principles, some of the ideas, transcend the differences. Knowledge@Wharton: If you were to think back about your leadership journey, what would you say is the biggest leadership challenge that you have faced? How did you deal with it and what did you learn from it? Sikka: The biggest leadership challenge that I have faced – and there have been many — was the transformation of a company. When we were building HANA (a relational database management system) at SAP, the core team of HANA was [at the company’s German offices in] Walldorf. Very entrepreneurial, very innovative. It was like a family atmosphere. One of my memorable pictures from the HANA days was around Christmas time. There was this one building — building three of SAP — and around 10 o’clock on a Friday night, every single wing of the building was dark except one wing. Every single light of that wing was on, and you could tell which one was the HANA team. I was so proud of that — the culture. It was in the heart of the company. That kind of a transformation from within is very difficult. It can be done, which is what we are endeavoring to do here with Zero Distance and with Mana [Infosys’ knowledge-based AI platform] and so on. I think the biggest challenge is ensuring that we transition ourselves to a new generation without losing our values, without losing our ethos. “The biggest challenge is ensuring that we transition ourselves to a new generation without losing our values, without losing our ethos.” People debate culture and values. Do the values change? I had a very interesting debate recently with a very good friend of mine who is the CEO of a large company here in the U.S. He said that values change all the time; ethics don’t change. That was a very interesting perspective on values. That transformation is a very big challenge. People call it cultural transformation. Knowledge@Wharton: I thought you would say bridging the culture of the old Infosys with the new Infosys. Is that accurate? Sikka: I think there is no old or new. I deeply believe that saying that there is an innovation department ensures that you don’t innovate anywhere else. Saying that there is a new department ensures that everybody else thinks that they are old. This we cannot do. There are businesses that we never did before as a company that we got into, but there are always new things happening in every business. It has to. If you look at nature, there is constant [change]. I was looking at some cherry blossoms around my house. Nature is constantly renewing itself. The fruit that falls off the trees, they grow into new trees — these are new things. So I think we have to have a culture [of innovation that permeates the company and is constantly renewed]. That is one of the biggest lessons I have learned — that we cannot differentiate. Everyone in the company, everyone in the organization, in all corners of the company, has to innovate. One of the most amazing examples of innovation and emphasis has come from our finance team. A lot of our core processes — the OTR (order to remittance) process, the order to cash, the accrual process in our company — we have managed to cut it down to 50% … without compromising in any way, shape, or form. That was a great example of a process transformation from within. This innovation that I talked about in identifying the most passionate people, identifying the highest performers: We value the highest performers who are on the frontlines more than anybody else in the company. So you have to create a culture which is pervasively innovative, and not create silos of innovation. Knowledge@Wharton: Let me end with one last question. Several years ago, I think it was about 11 years ago, Knowledge@Wharton had the good fortune to interview [former SAP CEO] Henning Kagermann, who I think you have described as the best boss you ever had. The question toward the end of the conversation was, what do you do to relax? And his answer blew me away. He said he likes to listen to rock music. He is a big fan of Deep Purple and even took the entire board of SAP to a concert. Sikka: Henning is a real metal head, to this day. Knowledge@Wharton: So let me ask you the same question, what do you do to relax? Sikka: Oh, boy. Sleep would be a good idea these days. I live a very frantic lifestyle. My home is here, near where we are sitting in California but the company’s headquarters are in India, so I am constantly on the road. Last year I made 99 [trips] plus 17 flights. … I made 99 commercial trips amounting to about 800 hours or something like that, and 17 private flights of 39 hours. That is an insane amount of travel — and no sleep. Just to calm myself down, to reconnect, every once in a while I will take a day and go to a temple, a Buddhist temple, and just relax and be peaceful. I love to surf. Last year at spring break, my wife managed to get a few days off to take us all to Hawaii. I managed to surf after a long time. Now you’ve got me thinking about surfing.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / AMD explains why Ryzen doesn’t seem to keep up in 1080p gaming AMD explains why Ryzen doesn’t seem to keep up in 1080p gaming Matthew Wilson 5 days ago CPU, Featured Tech News Today was the official launch day for AMD’s Ryzen 7 CPUs and as you may have noticed already, plenty of reviews are now up, including our own review of the Ryzen 7 1800x. While the flagship 1800x has been deemed by many as an excellent CPU for productivity, 1080p gaming results have been less impressive when compared to Intel’s mainstream Core i7s. It turns out that there is a reason for this and it all comes down to the way games have been optimised over the last few years. Ryan Shrout over at PCPer was able to get in touch with AMD’s CVP of marketing last night with an explanation as to why the Ryzen 7 1800x lags behind in 1080p gaming. The reasoning essentially boils down to developers mainly optimising games for Intel’s CPUs over the last few years as AMD has been less competitive. “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all ‘CPU-bound’ games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR. With developers taking advantage of Ryzen architecture and the extra cores and threads, we expect benchmarks to only get better, and enable Ryzen excel at next generation gaming experiences as well.” With that in mind, AMD expects game performance for Ryzen to continue to improve over time as new games get released and old games get additional optimisation tweaks. This is why AMD has been making partnerships with studios like Bethesda, to ensure popular games are properly tuned to make proper use of Ryzen going forward. KitGuru Says: It was odd to see the Ryzen 1800x beating Intel in so many areas only to falter in games at 1080p resolution. However, as noted in our review, Ryzen does have plenty of power ‘in reserve’ for additional tasks, so it seems perhaps games just aren’t tapping into Ryzen’s full potential just yet. It will be interesting to see how much that changes over the next year.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags 1080p performance 1800x AMD news ryzen 7 Previous It turns out Apple may already have 1000 engineers working on Augmented Reality Next MSI starts teasing GTX 1080Ti Gaming X Check Also Biostar shows off first Mini-ITX X370 AM4 motherboard AMD’s new Ryzen 7 processors are already turning out to be very popular with 60 … Rocky40 Yep this is what I was thinking when looking at the reviews how can a CPU that beats intel in most benchmarks then lose in some of the games. I also noticed that the Ryzen does differently from review to review in the game tests it all boils down to how the system was setup and the mainboard used to do the tests. I think when I see the tests done this CPU has a lot to offer and also what AMD said here does make a lot of sense about optimized code for Intel CPU’s because lets face it Intel has rules the roost for the last few years so it goes without saying the game code would be optimized for Intel. Those that say well a lot of these games are also on the PS4 and Xbone so they should be optimized for AMD already. What I say to that is PS4 and Xbone do not have Ryzen in them they actually have the older AMD core Arch which has nothing to do with Ryzen at all. I am hoping to see either firmware bios updates that fix the latency issues some site have noticed as well as Windows OS updates and AMD CPU driver update that will enhance the performance in some of the games they lagged in a bit. I am sure this CPU has the grunt to keep pace with Intel but only time will tell I guess. I am still planning on getting a new gaming Ryzen system built but I had already planned on waiting until this fall to pull the trigger and get the new setup because I want the whole meal deal new Ryzen and RX Vega all at once. I am sure that by this time we will be on new revised board or second release boards or just bios updates to fix the current teething problems of the new platform. If not I will wait for Ryzen 2 my old i7 3770K @ 4.7Ghz is still doing just fine for now. Kevin Backalive I have been watching many reviews too and saw some strange variations. I do honestly believe it is a high end cpu and that news softwares should take advantage of the ryzen codes. muziqaz Who buys a high end 8 core to play a damn game at 1080p? Raphael Silva ✔️ A lot of people plays 1080p 144hz using HEDT, specially now with 34″ 2560×1080 Kane Bunce Also, as AdoredTV said the BIOSes are still new and not as optimal as for older CPUs (both from Intel and AMD) which is to be expected for a brand new architecture with massive changes. Motherboard manufacturers will no doubt update their BIOSes for better Ryzen performance over the next few months as they get a better idea of how Ryzen works. EDIT: As BIOSes improve I expect compute performance to get at least minor boosts in performance as well not just gaming. Cristiano Reis 34″ 2560×1080 144hz ips* lol Evil_Betox I dunno, maybe people who uses the same PC for work and gaming? BaronMatrix I don’t see a problem.. We all knew Intel would have the most optimal code paths since game companies have been working more on GPU optimization while using Intel for test boxes… Now it’ll be more than worth it to optimize for Ryzen going forward… It’s clear that’s the issue as some games improve when turning off SMT… Adnan Popara AMD: let’s blame Intel for our incompetence! Ryzen was nothing but hype. AngryGoldfish They would be fair to blame Intel in the past. In fact it was so fair it became legally binding and Intel had to pay AMD millions for harsh anti-competitive tactics. Camm Shrug, artificial benchmarks showed the IPC is there. And not like it was incredibly behind intel in CPU bound gaming. Or do you really need to be running at 270fps in CSGO? Adnan Popara and even with all those millions of $ and all the time on their hands and all this hype, AMD still created something that can only compete with haswell but is behind skylake and kabylake… at least when it comes to gaming. All I care (majority probably) is gaming. Sander Manzoli Pro’s Tyrann but are you part of the new generation who might also want to try streaming while gaming? if so, Ryzens new architecture and extra cores will certainly do better. We need to wait till we get some reviewers who can show us the real use cases for these 8-core chips. The truth is that there is still less than 5% of gamers out there who have more than 6 cores (based on steam) but soon that will change. For sure if you only game then intels high clocked quads will be the best. prometheus001 Its a whole new architecture, it is bound to have some issues at first… but as a new architecture i bet it have a huge improvements potential… Zen+ will have more performance improvements than intel had from generation to generation. Comrade_Anon If I’m going to professionally stream, I’m going to have a dedicated rig for pulling the content from my gaming rig. Sure, maybe that’d be Ryzen… but this launch is rather yawn inducing compared to the hype it had behind it. Djemboed Their own extreme edition i7 can’t even beat mainstream i7 in gaming, atleast amd is back in competition and a sandy bridge era from amd. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fc897e4d43085cfffc7ccbc0662a0ca6bd8da71bd5e32a602708e0f33ad27c2e.jpg aidanjt 2560×1080 isn’t 1080p, 1080p is 1920×1080. That’s 691,200 more pixels to push which shifts the burden onto the GPU. Nor is ultra-wide a common display. His point is valid. Nobody in their right mind who can shell out $500 on a CPU is going to have a dingy 1080p display. It’s a completely unbalanced system. aidanjt Pro’s at what? Having a hopelessly outdated display and an unbalanced system? aidanjt Why have two separate machines when one machine will do the same job at a fraction of the cost? Especially since the two machine setup is going to mean sacrificing adaptive sync. Plus this is literally day 1, every new leap in technology inevitably has teething problems. And this is just one specific edge case that there’s a minor loss of framerate, 1080p gaming. Oh wow, so bad, it does a little worse in a woefully outdated resolution. Back to the drawing board, lads! Daniel Crispin Your missing the point. Testing them at 1080p ensures that CPU performances are tested, not GPU bottleneck. When the next generation of graphics cards drop, it might be possible to test CPUs at higher resolutions such as 4K, but right now it’s not possible. Daniel Crispin To be fair, Ryzen is a monster for productivity. It is disappointing for gaming but if you want to build a workstation, I would say it’s a very good choice. This will especially be true when multi-CPU motherboards start to hit the market. Also there seems to be a lot of issues with the Bios of most motherboards, so once Bios revisions start rolling out the overall performance spectrum might change. I think we need to let the platform mature a little before deciding if it is good or not for gaming. I wanted to build a system ASAP but now I will wait for revisions to come out. Hansel Law Anyone that sees a high end 8 core at the price of a Intel 4 core. TessellatedGuy What if the lower end 1600x and 1500x also have this problem? This excuse won’t work then. Ryzen is great and all, but it’s not a good deal for gamers. Szabados Istvan Guys that want to play on high refresh rate monitors. Usually people that are playing FPS competitive or other competitive games like myself. 144Hz is the meta when it comes to FPS games, and it’s only getting better and better. Edward Kinsella Hang on the frames per second are quite close in most cases. All the consoles are AMD 8 Core. (I know jaguar cores) I would prefer more cores than an extra 5-15 FPS as future proofing. If you record video, stream or encode, 8 core ryzen is a no brainer @ the price. Intel is switching to more cores in its new mainstream processors that are coming down the line. Granted if you have a fairly new INTEL CPU it obviously wouldn’t be 4 u. I for 1 am adding a ryzen build to my. Also if you are gaming at 1080p, thats just bonkers complaining about RYZEN. Should be going for new monitor/video card first. muziqaz G, guys, thanks for the obvious. Also those pros are already sponsored by whoever pays the bills, and those who are not already are sitting with 5ghz 7700ks. The message here is, if you want a high end CPU for 1440p+ gaming and heavy work, plus streaming Ryzen is perfect for you. If Intel did not advertise their HEDT as such that doesn’t mean the market doesn’t exist. Where were all of you when Intel’s HEDT was launched and was slower in gaming from normal chips? None of you could afford one, now we have cheap chips from AMD which are murdering everything except small pro gamer market and you all suddenly come out of the woodworks and start stating the obvious. By the way I’m not having a dig at Kitguru Ryzen review, you guys were the one of few who actually took Ryzen for what it is 😉 kyle939 I am 1080p 144hz 1ms…. it’s okay for me! I do not need it want anymore as I am happy with 1080p until games start looking like Pixar movies…. there is no point for me Allan Actually I know a few people who use an asus PG258Q 240hz 1080p screen and they are using overclocked GTX1080’s. It might be uncommon, but it certainly does happen. Allan At least Daniel gets it! Raphael Silva ✔️ Go argue with LG http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UC79G-B-ultrawide-monitor 34″ Class 21:9 UltraWide® Full HD IPS Curved And i know more people using 1080 with 1080p then other resolutions. TristanSDX That’s true what AMD said. Game logic is quite complex, and cannot be easily destributed among cores, like in cinebench or handbrake. Best way to get higher performance is to optimize code for given CPU architecture. But downside is that such optimised code is pretty inefficient on other architecture. TristanSDX Ryzen is great for those who want to stream games. Without these additional cores, gamers must lower quality, which is more devastating for FPS and image quality than Ryzen Gaz Wkd People who see it for the bargain it is. muziqaz Have you seen the FPS numbers? They are all in 100s. It’s not like Ryzen does 75fps and the rest are doing 140fps. Teslas_Pigeon There isn’t any question in terms of raw power, Ryzen is capable of destroying Intel’s current offerings on all fronts. However, it has the same Achilles Heel as Bulldozer, in that it relies on a heavy core/thread count, while most software will only use 1-4 threads. Hopefully AMD has learned from Bulldozer, and will work with developers more closely, offering open source software and dev kits optimized for Ryzen. This looks to be to the case already, since AMD has already announced their partnership with Bethesda. AngryGoldfish At 1440p, the resolution I play at, the difference between the 1800X and 6900K is unnoticeable. The 7700K still consistently takes the lead, but not by a wide margin. It’s only in CPU-bound instances where Ryzen is falling short. There are people that buy GTX 1080’s for 1080p gaming, but I’m not one of them. I own an R9 Fury and play at 1440p with an i5-4670K. I am not CPU-bound. So yes, if you play Watch Dogs 2 at 1080p and have a 144Hz panel with a GTX 1080 or higher and don’t stream or do anything other than game, don’t buy Ryzen 7. It’s a poor choice. But if you play at 1440p or higher, want to support AMD’s more cost-effective platform and not Intel’s shady practises, hope to scale well in the future, stream, create any content or edit detail laden files, Ryzen 7 is either a better or equal option. nonsense2596 The question is: will the situation improve? Unless people buy A LOT of $500 Ryzen 1800X CPUs which scores a lot lower, especially in DX12 games instead of the $350 7700k, what would be the incentive of the software developers to optimize for AMD more than today? Thomas Ashley Beynon I play games at 1920×1080.. and while I care more about single core performance considering games are still moving towards using more cores then a 8 core CPU is welcome (I hope the Ryzen 1600/1500 will be good for me) Thomas Ashley Beynon I’m interested in a new monitor and been told 144Hz is a must but that’s not double the fps minimum I was looking and I doubt a RX480 will manage that at 1080p 🙁 ShroomGoon Just a random lurker, saw the comment and had to add, think more about the $330 Ryzen 1700 w/ wraith ($30ish) 100$ cheapest mobo vs $350 7700K no cooler and cheapest mobo around $150 I believe could be wrong. Ryzen you are getting around 50% more work power for content creation and streaming, on top of future proofing your rig which I guarantee WILL happen, vulkan is already a thing. If you ONLY game then sure go with 7700K and when games use more than 4 cores you will suffer, how much is debatable but it will make a difference. Maurice Fortin that and many reasons for such, not enough space for a massive monitor, cant justify cost increase at time of purchase, the pixel pitch not always making the higher res monitors quality as “good” as the lower ones, I know for myself, 1080p is sweet spot, cause when scale resolution, some things such as text in some games or the way it “looks” makes much harder to see everything, sure it more clear and defined, but sometimes things appear zoomed out and tiny then they would normally appear on a lower resolution. Alas they do and should test low and high resolutions to accommodate as many scenarios as possible, not every game loads the gpu heavy as other games even when at high resolution, and other games even if low resolution may not load the cpu as heavy, hence need many tests over as many scenarios as possible. It is a brand new platform, will have own issues and subtleties need to work out, AMD will do as best they can am sure of that, it will just take them a bit more time then it would take their multi billion $ funded competitors. even they have issues, crap solder/TIM, thin dies to save $, poor component selection causing failures where there should not be etc. lehpron Software takes years to develop, and I don’t think developers had a few months extra against many of us, so it’ll be a while. lehpron This isn’t about compatible software, this is about programs being CPU-heavy Vs GPU-heavy. It’s been a law of the jungle, so to speak, over the last decade that games at high resolution and details put more weight on graphics cards. Yet people expect more CPU cores to mean something. To expect that a Broadwell-E equivalent 8-core to do magic against a faster quad-core Skylake or Kaby Lake is a failure of logic. Everyone knocking Ryzen for not beating Kaby Lake is guilty of not seeing where the load of improvement is based on. lehpron The only reason Ryzen 7 loses is due to low base, turbo, and overclock frequencies. It’s a scenario no different than how Broadwell-E stacks. Gaming just happens to favor less cores at a higher frequency. JJ Doesn’t make any sense. You had a $500 CPU and a $600+ video card just to play games at 1080p?! Sam Johnson AMD Ryzen 8% behind Kapy-Lake in IPC and 12%behind Kapy-Lake in clock speed. That’s mean 20% Delta behind Kapy-Lake in single core performance. *These information from AMD not from my pocket* Coffee-Lake should as usual bring 5% in IPC 10% in IGPU 15% in total , that’s mean Ryzen will be 25~30% Delta behind Coffee-Lake single core performance and that’s huge deal in games. Coffee-Lake also will bring 6C/12T and 24~30 PCI-E3.0 lanes to mainstream, plus the IGPU will support 4K HD10, Dolby Vision [H.265 ,Vp9 4K 12bit Encode and Decode]. AMD did great job with Ryzen but they have a lot of work to do with Zen2. First they have to close the IPC gab between Zen and Coffee-Lake (10% higher IPC will be really good news). Second they have to close the gap between Zen and Coffee-Lake in clock speed (10% will be amazing) [That’s will but Zen2 just 8~10% Delta behind Coffee-Lake in single core performance] . Third they have to add the missing features from Zen architecture like AVX256, 28~40 PCI-E 3.0 lanes. Fourth they have to fix memory bandwidth issue from what AMD said it’s look like they will not add Quad channel memory anytime soon, but they can increase the bandwidth buy supporting higher RAM speed out of the box 3200 MHz with two Dimm slots and 2699 MHz with Four Dimm slots that’s will bring huge improvements to the performance plus support RAM OC up to 4000 MHz. AMD have to do that next year to close the gap because in 2019 Intel will release Ice-Lake with new architecture using 10nm, we will see at least 10% higher IPC than Coffee-Lake, that’s will but Ryzen 40% Delta behind Ice-Lake in single core performance, just in two years With support for DDR5 and DDR4, PCI-Express 4.0, and many other features, not to mention Optan X will be available for consumers. In 2019 AMD should release Zen3 on 7nm FinFET not on 14nm FinFET and add all the features from Ice-Lake and keep the 5~8% Delta behind Intel in single core performance. AMD also have two years to work with games developer to support Ryzen 8C/16SMT, 6C/12SMT maybe also 12C/24SMT to make sure First generation Ryzen will not be end up 40% behind Intel Ice-Lake in games, that’s possible specialy if Xbox Scorpio will end up using Ryzen CPU that’s will help AMD a lot in optimization issues. [if AMD will not bring down the 40% Delta gab in performance between Ryzen and Ice-Lake, most of the people will jump in Intel train and will never go back to AMD train even if they will offer Quantum computer for free for each person bought Ryzen in 2017-2018]. We know also Tiger-Lake in 2021 will be the last Intel (Cor I7,I5,I3) architecture after that they will move to new architecture from the ground, AMD have a lot of work to do to keep up with Intel. AMD APU’s before end of the year should give us big example about how AMD will fix the RAM bandwidth issues, if they will use HBM2 to feed the CPU and GPU they should do that with Zen 2 as L4 cash to avoid all the problems from RAM speed, timing and channels. If they will use DDR4 Dual channel memory to feed the APU, like what they did with old APU’s and DDR3 single channel and dual channel it will be epic fail to AMD in performance. Buy the way AMD APU’s still better than Intel IGPU but both suffered from RAM bandwidth limitations, Intel still has the problem. Coming months will give us some answers about next Zen architecture. [Just hope it’s good not bad]. Why Ask Some people want to have high refresh rates for their high refresh rate monitors. The higher the resolution the harder that is with a single GPU. His point is invalid, most points are invalid (unless really crazy) cause there are various types of people. Why Ask I’m sure lots. Especially with these low prices don’t you think budget gamers (not completely low budget) are itching to get a 8-Core HEDT. Then there will be a upgrade to GPU and Monitor Jimmy Q “Ryzen does have plenty of power ‘in reserve’ for additional tasks, so it seems perhaps games just aren’t tapping into Ryzen’s full potential just yet.” We already knew this from Intel 6+ core gaming benchmarks. The consumer 4C/8T i7’s have always been the enthusiast gamers’ choice. AMD used so many cores, because they didn’t have the frequency. G7r9T3 Here is the proof of lack of optimisation from most of game devs: http://techreport.com/review/31366/amd-ryzen-7-1800x-ryzen-7-1700x-and-ryzen-7-1700-cpus-reviewed/7 Crysis 3, maybe the best game in both GPU and CPU utilization works fine for all high performance CPUs. disqus_GB8lUuziuG Ryzen is on par with the 7700k and 6900k for the vast majority of user experiences and will likely remain so for it’s “life time”, yes even gaming. It also doesn’t have to be the “best” to be good at something. Combine that with it’s workstation performance and it’s a fantastic chip for the price. All this nonsense about how the 7700k will keep up with faster gpus as you upgrade is a red herring. Unless you plan on Not upgrading the cpu for like 6ish+ years, while regularly upgrading your GPU, not upgrading your monitor, games not becoming more multi threaded, games not becoming more demanding on gpus. The users who want/need 144fps or higher minimum are a minority. Christopher Lennon No offense, but what kind of person buys an 8 core 1800x and uses it for 1080p gaming? I ordered an 1800x, but for content creation and SOME gaming, but in 4K. I would expect anyone buying a $500 8core CPU would at least be gaming in 1440p, after all, who would buy a $500 CPU to game on a $100 monitor? Christopher Lennon how can you honestly say that? Daniel Crispin I agree that the Ryzen platform is a good overall chip as it is. We will know it’s true performance and potential once Bios updates start rolling out and they fix the bugs related to memory and performance. As for it being slower for games, I disagree with you. Games for most home users are the most demanding task they will need a fast CPU for. While I do some video editing, I game a lot more. So if I have to choose between waiting a bit more when I render a video and have better gaming performance, for me at least gaming comes first. As for upgrading the system, since 2011 I have not upgraded my CPU but upgraded my GPU twice. I usually go for performance mid-tier cards such as the GTX 970. I doubt that will change in the future, Ever since I switched from Amiga to PC about 20 years ago, I have upgraded graphic cards far more often than CPUs, For me the next big step is virtual reality and I have no idea what requirements will be needed to keep up with that. All I know is that right now my system can’t do it and when I decide to build my new computer it will be an entry level system for VR. At the moment top of the line GPUs are the bare minimum, and I am not sure how much headroom current CPUs have when it comes to VR because nobody is doing VR benchmarks for reasons that escape my comprehension. Artimus Weisser Ryzen in Australia is just not worth the price right now for gaming as a 7700K is much better value for money compared to any of AMD’s offerings based on current performance. Sander Manzoli All Pro´s care about is Frame Per Second. Most play at 720p to ensure no drops below 240Hz. AND looking to a 23″ monitor, 720p is really not that different from 1080p… and 4K looks like a waste. Jacob Smith AMD is inferior as usual. If they ever make a processor which is actually better for gaming then sure, I’ll buy it. Until then there is no point. Polls How old will you be next birthday?

Introduction 2. Performance and overclocking 3. Verdict Recommended Our Verdict AMD really has nailed it with this core. Pricing, performance, and featureset are all there. In AMD's most disruptive move since the Athlon 64 days, Ryzen is set to shake the consumer stage. For Stunning multi-core performance Competitive single core performance Sturdy Chipset Solid power draw Insane Price Against Overclocking is touch and go Temperatures are ‘unique’ Where do you start with a processor like Ryzen? The hype for this product has been unprecedented since its first mention. AMD has been long absent from mainstream competitive processor performance, and for the last five years Intel has sat on a positive monopoly of incremental 10% increases and 15% price hikes.  That’s not to say that AMD was entirely absent, purely that its design ethos with the Bulldozer line of mainstream processors just wasn’t anywhere near as competitive as its Intel counterpart. The choice was an illusion.  AMD knew this, to the point that in 2011 they began work on an entirely new processor design, that of Ryzen. Recruiting famed chip designer Jim Keller (successfully crafting both AMD’s legendary Athlon 64 and Apple’s A4 processor), AMD set to work on creating what is likely the biggest shake up in processor technology within the last ten years. The best AMD Ryzen deals: cheap Ryzen CPUs, motherboards and bundles in the US The best AMD Ryzen deals: cheap Ryzen processors, motherboards and bundles in the UK So, Ryzen, what is it? In short it's a brand new architecture based on the 14nm manufacturing process. At launch we’re introduced to three new processors, known as the 7 series.  The 1800X, king of the hill with 8 cores 16 threads, 16MB of L3 smart cache, a base clock of 3.7 GHz turboing up to 4.0 GHz, and a TDP of 95W coming in at £500 ($499, around AU$650).  The slightly slower cousin, the 1700X, another 8 cores, another 16 threads, still with 16MB of L3 featuring a lower core clock of 3.4 GHz turboing up to 3.8 GHz at £400 ($399, around AU$520) . And lastly there’s the 1700. Again 8 cores, 16 threads, 16MB of L3 with a core clock of 3.0 GHz boosting to 3.7 GHz, however this time featuring a TDP of 65W and a sweet price of £325 ($329, around AU$430). That’s three 8 core processors, all with AMD’s SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading), and all within spitting distance of Intel’s highest performing 4 core and 6 core chips. AMD Ryzen release date, news and features: everything you need to know Specs & chipsets But, what is a processor without its supporting plethora of inputs, outputs and connections? Notably AMD’s AM3+ and FM2+ platforms were typically archaic when it came to connection standards and updates, so how does the new series of boards look aligned alongside these processors? Well taking a look at the chip first, we have dual channel memory, with support for up to 64GB of DDR4 (supporting 2400 MT/s officially, and up to 3600 MT/s on the board), 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 16 dedicated to graphics, 4 for PCIe SSDs, and 4 for chipset communication, and support for up to 4 USB 3.1 devices solely on the chip.  On top of that the X370 chipset, supports an additional 2 USB 3.1 Type C, 6 USB 3.1 Type A, 6 USB 2.0, 4 SATA 6Gb/s ports, 2 SATA Express ports (or another 4 SATA 6GB/s), and an additional 8 PCIe 2.0 lanes as well. Meaning if you want to run two way SLI at 8x8 with a single M.2 PCIe SSD you can do that. It’s not quite up to Intel’s Z270 standards just yet, however overall processor performance trumps anything on Intel’s level right now, but we’ll get to that later. Next up on the list of things we have to cover is AMD’s SenseMI software suite. And in particular that’s the XFR (extreme frequency) feature enabled by default on any of the 'X' offerings. So until the 5 and 3 series launch later this year, that’s the 1700X and 1800X. Think of it as GPU Boost for your processor. Thanks to a true cornucopia of sensors embedded into each CPU the BIOS can detect when certain temperature and voltage parameters are being met, and in turn overclock a number of cores by 50-100 MHz to improve performance in the programs or applications that are utilizing those cores.  For instance, the 1800X in this review, on a full render benchmark will happily hit 3.7 GHz across all of its cores, but in gaming titles, two to three cores can hit 4.1 GHz and sit there quite happily thanks to our cooling solution and the applications demand or lack of utilization of more than four cores. 1 2 3 Current page: Introduction Next Page Performance and overclocking Topics Asus Load Comments Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

It marks the re-emergence of AMD as a manufacturer of high-performance CPUs. This renaissance is down to a processor that you have heard much about during febrile rumours and activity in the preceding weeks. That processor is Ryzen. Such an opening statement is not hyperbole. Intel, through its excellent Core microarchitecture, has had almost unfettered access to the premium desktop and lucrative workstation and server spaces for more than half a decade. Once strong in both areas, if your memory is long enough, AMD, arguably through a lack of focus and therefore poor architectures, has seen its performance parity eroded and market share decimated. This remained the status quo at the turn of this year. Ryzen is the consumer brand name given to the first Zen-based microprocessor. Other, related processors will follow, such as Naples for the workstation and as-yet-unnamed offerings for laptops and fanless computers. AMD is betting a large part of the house on Zen being able to stand toe-to-toe with Intel's present and upcoming CPU architectures in every space, so it simply has to succeed in order to give AMD the much-needed platform on which to bring enhanced iterations of Zen in years to come. Zen, or Ryzen, is therefore an understandably big deal. The brains behind Ryzen We'll focus on the architecture behind Ryzen first. It is important to do so because this 'clean-sheet' design will be around in some form for a number of years. AMD hopes Zen will do for it what the impressive Core architecture has done for Intel. click to enlarge There's very good reason for a ground-up design that borrows very little from the previous generation; the incumbent wasn't nearly good enough, and spending significant resource redesigning it wasn't deemed the correct way forward. Intel's Core was, and remains, faster, more efficient, more elegant, and just about better in any metric that truly mattered, other than price, than Bulldozer/Excavator - the architecture brains behind the cores used by AMD until Zen came along. AMD says it has spent the best part of five years and over two million engineering man-hours on Zen, hoping it would meet the moving Intel target years from inception. Let's examine just how well AMD has done. Front-end: Branch Prediction Starting at the top of the core engine, the branch-prediction unit (BPU) is always a key area for a CPU architect. Spending time and resource on this section improves the processor's ability to streamline the flow of instructions going into the fetch, decode and dispatch areas, charactertised by moving down the right-hand side of the below graphic. Any stalls in this area inhibit a processor's ability to run efficiently - the pipeline needs to be flushed out - and AMD has taken a number of steps to improve it from the previous generation. The BPU needs to guess which way a branch is likely to go so AMD has implemented a self-training perceptron algorithm that assigns a set of weights based on branch outcome. In short, the chip pre-loads instructions based on recent behaviour and optimises their flow through the processor. This is effectively more accurate speculation made possible through machine learning. Zen also features improved prediction by increasing the capability and size of the branch target buffer, which can be considered a pool of cache. Going hand in hand is what AMD calls Smart Prefetch, where Zen has made key improvements in how it identifies data streams, strides and regionality of data. What this means in practise is that required data can be loaded into the chip's large caches more quickly than before. Per-core improvements and SMT The holy grail of modern CPU architecture is to fundamentally increase the IPC (instructions per clock) whilst, in the interests of employing it in a diverse range of environments, ensure that it is also energy efficient. These goals appear to be mutually exclusive on first glance - more throughput and performance without shunting lots more power through it - yet AMD has found a way through modern improvements to the core, caches and power. Let's focus on the performance side first. Zen can fetch and decode four instructions per clock cycle. Intelligent design dictates that the same work is not done again - for example, decoding and dispatching the same instructions over and over again, as was the case with Bulldozer. This is where the new op-cache comes in. It is able to store eight instructions, in flight, and push out six (Bulldozer had four) to the micro-op queue and then out to the dispatch unit. The relatively simple addition of a buffer, as Intel has implemented in recent designs, enables Zen to keep a higher throughput efficiency. AMD is clearly taking a different approach to previous generations. Mike Clark, principal engineer for the Zen core, said that a primary goal was to have a balanced architecture, removing the bottlenecks that appeared you know where. AMD identified that wider is better for Zen in this context, thus increasing the register files, scheduler and reorganising the balance of arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and address generation units (AGUs) from two each to a 4:2 combination. It is thought that limited ALU throughput contributed heavily to Bulldozer's inability to squeeze more out of the design.

I picked out a Core 2 Duo E6400 and a proper motherboard, guided by a friendly-sounding article from some PC hardware site I'd found while Googling around. My elation with that PC—Dual cores! 4GB of memory! A graphics card that can run Half-Life 2! Free Windows Vista!—probably wasn't shared by the AMD boardroom at the time. The Conroe cores in that E6400 and its friends helped touch off an Intel CPU performance lead that AMD hasn't much challenged since. 2007's Phenom family of chips suffered from a performance-robbing TLB erratum, and the Phenom II series only duked it out with Intel chips from prior generations in its time. Famously, 2011's ambitious Bulldozer architecture trailed Intel's seminal Sandy Bridge CPUs substantially when it launched aboard the FX-8150, and the Piledriver refresh of that architecture in 2014 didn't help much. Our move to frame-time benchmarking between Bulldozer and Piledriver made the refreshed architecture's shortcomings especially clear for gaming performance. Then-AMD CEO Rory Read eventually conceded that Bulldozer "was not the game-changing part [sic] when it was introduced three years ago," but the 'dozer's derivatives have had to soldier on in various forms in AMD's CPUs ever since. It didn't help that AMD's bet on the fusion of Radeon graphics and traditional CPU cores over seven generations of APUs didn't find many takers in the lower end of the market. We can't forget the company's long slide into data-center irrelevance, either, an attractive and high-margin business that Intel basically has to itself these days.  So, yeah. After 10 years and change, the Zen microarchitecture that's launching this morning aboard AMD's Ryzen CPUs has a lot riding on its shoulders. The entire company's future, if I had to guess. No biggie. Not to spoil things too much, but Zen is solid. Go ahead and breathe a sigh of relief now. We've had three Ryzen CPUs in the TR labs this past week: the Ryzen 7 1800X, the Ryzen 7 1700X, and the Ryzen 7 1700. We've spent nearly every waking hour of the past few days turning every knob and dial we can to make our Ryzen CPUs sweat. Before we see whether or how the first Zen chips live up to the deafening hype that AMD has drummed up over the past few months, it's worth taking a peek under the hood to see just how the company fulfilled the promises it's made about Ryzen's performance. From the ground up The Zen microarchitecture is a complete re-imagining of what an AMD x86 processor should look like. The company's engineers have tossed the tightly-coupled "module" concept of Bulldozer and friends on the scrap heap. Instead, Zen is a sleek, shiny new chassis that looks a bit like Sandy Bridge and its derivatives if you squint a bit. AMD has consistently touted a "40% IPC speedup" in its discussions of Zen from the beginning, and I'll do the best I can to briefly explain how AMD got there with its latest and greatest. At the highest level, I want to draw your attention to two clusters of rectangles in this high-level block diagram of the Zen CPU core. The first point of interest is that each core will have its own integer and floating-point units to work with. This coprocessor layout is quite a bit different from the dual-integer-unit and shared-floating-point-unit structure of the Bulldozer core. Another new AMD trick for Zen is simultaneous multithreading, or SMT—better known as Hyper-threading in Intel parlance—to take advantage of otherwise idle execution resources. Much of the Zen core can be competitively shared between multiple threads of execution, and only a few resources—a new structure for AMD chips called the op cache, the store queue, and the retire queue—are statically partitioned. The op cache is one of the biggest improvements to Zen's fetch-and-decode stage. This structure first made its appearance in Intel's Sandy Bridge architecture, and it serves as a temporary home for the internal micro-ops generated as part of the decode stage. This bit of cache is important because it can let the core leave its power-hungry fetch-and-decode hardware spun down. Instead, recently-decoded micro-ops can be dispatched straight into the maw of the core's execution units for processing if they're needed again. That shortcut has benefits for both latency and power consumption. You can read more about the benefits of op-caching in David Kanter's incredible Sandy Bridge deep-dive. (David's deep-dives have been indispensable in laying the foundations for this article, and they're required reading for anyone with even the slightest curiosity about modern CPU architectures. Do go check them out.) Zen also features an improved hashed-perceptron branch predictor compared to its predecessors. AMD (accurately) calls this a "neural network" instead, because neural networks are cool right now. It's also not a new concept for AMD chips: Bulldozer, Piledriver, and Jaguar have all used similar technology in their predictors. AMD didn't share many details of what it changed in the Zen predictor relative to its prior architectures. In any case, better branch prediction is critical for allowing the chip to speculatively execute instructions without choosing the wrong path in the instruction stream. Get it wrong, and you have to flush the pipeline, an extraordinarily wasteful and performance-degrading operation in most cases. You can read more about the hashed-perceptron predictor in Daniel Jiménez's introductory paper on the subject. Intel has trumpeted better branch predictor accuracy in virtually every one of its recent microarchitectures, and it's been quite reluctant to share any details of what it's changed to get there. That guardedness suggests the company's branch-prediction secret sauce is a major competitive advantage. Given Haswell CPUs' uncanny accuracy in branch prediction, for example, there's a reason for that. Zen features a ton of other architectural improvements that contribute to its impressive performance gains over prior generations of AMD CPUs. We'd love to cover them all in depth for you, but we've been running tests on Ryzen right up until the NDA lift this morning and beyond. If you'd like to know more, be sure to check out David's Zen write-up at the Microprocessor Report for more detail than we can possibly offer.

In the market for a midrange or budget PC but don't want Intel inside? You'll soon have some new CPU options: AMD's Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3, which the company unveiled today after months of speculation and leaks. Unlike the flagship Ryzen 7, which is now on sale for use in high-end gaming rigs, the midrange Ryzen 5 and budget-oriented Ryzen 3 aren't yet available, but they are shaping up as viable competitors for the Intel Core i5 and Core i3, respectively. The six-core Ryzen 5 1600X, which is slated for release in the second quarter of 2017, will have a base clock speed of 3.5GHz and can be boosted to 4GHz. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but AMD said the 1600X will land in the sub-$300 bracket. In AMD's internal testing, it achieved a score of 1,132 on the industry-standard Cinebench performance benchmark, handily besting the Core i5 7600k's score. Independent benchmark scores are not yet available (see this guide for more on how we use benchmark tests at PC Labs), but AMD's own results certainly give Intel cause for concern. The Ryzen 5 will also come in a four-core variety, the 1500X, with a base clock speed of 3.5GHz, boostable to 3.7GHz. Related AMD Unveils Cheap, Powerful Flagship Ryzen CPUs AMD Unveils Cheap, Powerful Flagship Ryzen CPUs In the second half of the year, AMD also plans to release the Ryzen 3 for budget PCs, although it hasn't yet announced performance and pricing for those chips. Once the lineup is complete, AMD hopes Ryzen will challenge what it sees as Intel's ho-hum approach to mainstream processor innovation. "One of the worst afflictions you can have is incrementalism," AMD's General Manager of Computing and Graphics Jim Anderson said at a press event in San Francisco last week. He was talking about Intel, and suggested that its chips have seen modest 10 percent performance boosts between generations even as they get more expensive. Of course, it's relatively easy for the Ryzen family to bring better performance at a lower price right out of the box, because AMD is essentially starting from scratch—the company said it spent four years and more than 2 million engineering hours developing the Ryzen chips. What will be more impressive is if successive Ryzen iterations also offer performance improvements reminiscent of the late-90's heyday of CPU innovation.

We round up the rumours about new iMacs coming in March, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready, and the possibility that Apple is preparing to switch from Intel to AMD processors by Ashleigh Macro | 02 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Tech specs Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? Complete guide to 2015 iMac launch When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other tech specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? Lastly, how much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost in the UK? Apple's last iMac update came back in October 2015, when it introduced a Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipped the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. It's been a while, then, which is why we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - an early-2017 iMac update, hopefully. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 2 March 2017, with rumours that Apple will switch from Intel to AMD processors for the next iMac Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Next month (March 2017), we hope, but nothing official has been announced yet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook veers away from using the word "Mac" in his response. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get more of a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place from 5-9 June this year - here's how to get WWDC tickets) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Tech specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. In early January, Intel used CES 2017 in Las Vegas to introduce its Kaby Lake processors officially, after announcing low power versions of Kaby Lake processors in August of 2016. The chips shown off in January are powerful enough to be used in Apple's Macs, suggesting that updates are imminent. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might annoy the early buyers. Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. The AMD Zen processor, launched in 2016, boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. At the end of February 2017, in the response to news of a recording-breaking benchmark performance by the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X processor, Architosh discussed the possibility of Apple switching from Intel to AMD as its Mac chip supplier. The site was particularly interested in AMD's superior power efficiency, something which fits in with Apple's recent philosophy. "Today's current iMac 5K model," the site points out, "uses an Intel 14nm Skylake 4-core i7-6700K processor with a TDP of 91W. Based on the iMac's actual frequency, the TDP is possibly low 80s W range. But AMD's RYZEN 7 1700 is at 65W already and has 8 cores." Architosh even ponders if AMD's recent development work has been geared towards catching Apple's eye: "Is it possible that when AMD decided to work from a clean state four years ago that they began the RYZEN line with the possibility of wooing Apple at some point in the future?" As we said above, switching to AMD processors for the next iMac would be a surprise, but it no longer seems impossible. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac New iMac 2017 rumours: Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

The AMD Ryzen 7 1800X is the top-of-the-line processor from AMD’s new Ryzen range of CPUs that’s launching today. Boasting eight cores, it’s a monster chip that’s designed to power through the heaviest of workloads – and take on the likes of the Intel Core i7-6900K. AMD releasing a CPU isn't new, but this time round the company has delivered on its promises by way of a leap in performance and power efficiency. As a result, the AMD Ryzen 1800X and the rest of the AMD Ryzen lineup bring true competition to the CPU market for the first time in a decade. Not that the 1800X comes cheap. It will set you back £500, while the cheapest Ryzen 7 processor launching today costs £330. However, it undercuts the competition from Intel by a significant margin, and suggests bargains await when the rest of the AMD Ryzen range launches later in the year. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X – Ryzen and Zen To recap, Ryzen is the new brand name for AMD’s fresh line of CPUs. It’s akin to Intel’s Core branding and either replaces or sits alongside AMD’s older Athlon and FX models. Since these are CPUs only, with no built-in GPU, they sit apart from the company’s A-series APUs. Like the older brands Ryzen will cover a wide range of CPUs, running from the top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 chips that have just launched, down through Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3, which will be arriving later in the year. If you're just into gaming and won't be embarking on big video editing projects, it's probably worth waiting for those to launch instead. All the Ryzen chips will be based on the company’s completely new CPU micro-architecture – the underlying design that makes up the chips – known as Zen. This is a significant change from previous AMD designs and it brings with it huge leaps in power efficiency and raw performance. The biggest development is that the number of instructions per clock – the calculations for each tick of the CPU’s internal many-GHz clock – that Zen is capable of has leapt 40% over previous AMD designs. Zen also brings support for simultaneous multi-threading for the first time. This is where each core of the chip can deal with two threads at once, making it appear to your software that it's a dual-core, or in the case of these Ryzen 7 chips, 16-core chip. It’s analogous to Intel’s Hyper-Threading technology. Along with these improvements, Zen is also far more power efficient than before, thanks in part to more granular control of the processor’s speed and voltage; it's able to ramp up and down far faster than before. The technology for managing this is called SenseMI. Also crucial is the move to a new 14 nanometre (nm) FinFET manufacturing process. This brings AMD in line with Intel’s current lineup of CPUs – the Kaby Lake range – that also use a different but equally small 14nm technology. The general rule is that the smaller the manufacturing technique, the greater power efficiency and the lower the price of manufacture; generally, this is in area where Intel has led over AMD. This time round, however, Intel hasn’t been able to keep up its usual pace of development, allowing AMD to catch up. What’s more, this doesn’t look set to change any time soon. Kaby Lake only just launched, and Intel’s smaller 10nm technology isn’t expected to arrive until well into 2018, with the Cannonlake range of processors. Other features to arrive with Zen and Ryzen include support for DDR4 and a new auto-overclocking feature called XFR (eXtended Frequency Range). Like Intel, AMD’s chips have a base clock frequency and a boost clock frequency that allow the chip to ramp up and down in response to the workload. XFR is the last bit of auto-overclocking that can be applied to a single core, if the processor isn’t too hot. It can apply up to 100MHz on top of the boost clock speed on X chips and up to 50MHz for non-X chips. This should mean the processor is always working to very near its maximum capability. The Ryzen 7 range There are just three Ryzen chips launching today: the Ryzen 7 1800X, the Ryzen 7 1700X and the Ryzen 7 1700. These are set to be the top three chips that will be available for the foreseeable future. However, cheaper chips will be making an appearance later in the year. All three are 8-core/16-thread chips, which are also multiplier unlocked for easy overclocking. This is great, but it rather begs the question of what differentiates the three and what defines the numbering/naming system AMD has used. So let’s break it down. The easy bit is the first number. Just like Intel has Core i7, i5 and i3 to denote a general overarching summary of the performance level of the chip, so is the case with Ryzen. Ryzen 7 is "prosumer", Ryzen 5 is high-end consumer and Ryzen 3 is mainstream. Next is the second number, which is split into three parts. Like Intel, the first digit is the generation of the chip, so all the new Ryzen chips will start with a 1. The next digit is essentially then a repeat of the first number, giving a broad indication of the performance level. Then follow two more numbers for further differentiation of the performance level. Finally, at the end is an optional letter (normal processors don’t get a letter) An X denotes the extra XFR speed bump, plus there are various other options for low-power and mobile variants. Product Line Model Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) TDP (Watts) Included Cooler Suggested Price Ryzen 7 1800X 3.6 4 95 N/A $499/£480 inc VAT Ryzen 7 1700X 3.4 3.8 95 N/A $399/£384 inc VAT Ryzen 7 1700 3 3.7 65 Wraith Spire $329/£316 inc VAT It seems logical enough, but when applied to the three chips launching today, it isn't exactly clear. All three chips are essentially identical except for clock speed and XFR, but the numbering system seems to suggest they have different features. In contrast, if you're familiar with Intel’s labelling scheme then you can look at the name of a chip and pretty much determine its features and roughly the speed of which it’s capable. This isn't the case with AMD’s system. Regardless, the 1800X, 1700X and 1700 are priced at £499, £399 and £330 respectively, and AMD is pitching them as direct competition to the Intel Core i7-6900K, 6800K and 7700K. However, while the 6800K and 7700K are roughly the same price as the 1700X and 1700, the 6900K is more than twice the price of the 1800X. As such, if it can deliver similar performance, the 1800X is going to be quite the bargain. Meanwhile, the 7700K is only a quad-core chip going up against the eight-core 1700, which again suggests a possible big win for AMD. However, the 7700K is clocked considerably faster, and so will have the edge in single-threaded applications; it will be interesting to see how it performs. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X – AM4 platform Launching alongside Ryzen is the AM4 platform and five new chipsets. This will mean buyers have to get both a new motherboard and CPU if they want to invest in a Ryzen processor. However, AMD has committed to continuing to support AM4 for future CPUs, so you won’t have to upgrade your motherboard again too soon. Moreover, AMD is using a single-socket and motherboard platform for its full range of CPUs. So even though there are no cheap CPUs available yet, when lower-priced Ryzen chips eventually launch, you’ll be able to buy a cheap motherboard and quad-core processor and still have the option of later upgrading all the way to the top-of-the-line eight-core chips. In contrast, Intel requires you to jump to an expensive X99 motherboard to gain access to any of its processors with more than four cores. That said, Intel still has an advantage when it comes to the raw power of its chipsets. The X99 chipset has a whopping 40 PCI-E lanes, allowing for huge multi-graphics card configurations and storage arrays. The current top AM4 chipset – the X370 – has just 20. This remains enough for a single x16 graphics card and x4 PCI-E SSD, but for truly extreme performance Intel still has an edge. Otherwise, AMD’s new chipsets are essentially just playing catch-up. You get DDR4 support, USB 3.1, PCI-E 3.0 and all the usual SATA ports and other connectivity options you’d expect. Both the X370 and B250 chipsets will also support overclocking, but only X370 will be able to handle multiple graphics cards. Meanwhile, the A320 chipset drops overclocking support. The X300 and A300 chipsets are meant for small-form-factor systems, and they take an interesting approach. They’re essentially nothing more than a PCI-E interface to the CPU, with all other I/O and features left to motherboard manufacturers. This makes the chips tiny, in turn making them very low power and leaving plenty of room for motherboard manufacturers to optimise their board designs to fit the features they want. AM4 uses a new cooler-mounting system. As a result, three new CPU coolers will be launching alongside Ryzen – although AMD freely admits that it expects users to buy alternatives. Indeed, the 1800X won’t be available at all with a cooler included. The new cooler-mounting system will mean that, depending on how existing coolers affix to the motherboard, many existing coolers won’t fit. Many will work with small tweaks, though. Finally, thermal design power is another area AMD has made some gains. The 1800X and 1700X are 95W TDP chips, but the 1700 is just a 65W. In comparison, the Intel Core i7-7700K has a 91W TDP, while the 6900K and 6800K have a 140W TDP.

Often times, when trolling YouTube or playing a quick round of Overwatch the limitations on performance seem tied to something else. Your internet is too slow, or you need a new graphics card. Computer processors have gotten faster-every year Intel unveils a microarchitecture with breathless claims of mighty performance improvements, but CPUs haven't had a real leap forward in a while. AMD's new Ryzen processors comes perilously close to changing the game. In recent years, AMD has kind of become the ugly cousin to competitors Intel and Nvidia. While AMD may power the Xbox One and the PS4, the company has languished in the traditional computer market. On the graphics side, Nvidia has stomped AMD to hold the majority marketshare-Nvida's cards are found in most gaming laptops, and a lot of workstations too. On the CPU. side Intel is practically ubiquitous with the word computer. Seeing the tiny AMD sticker on a good laptop is an oddity, not a regularity. AMD desperately wants that to change and the Ryzen CPU is the first step. AMD's Ryzen processor os based on the company's new Zen microarchitecture. Zen is nearly half the size of AMD's last microarchitecture, the six-year-old Bulldozer . And Ryzen, running on Zen, is much, much faster. Not just faster than the chips running on the aging Bulldozer. Ryzen is also significantly faster than much of what Intel has to offer. Today, only three Ryzen chips are available, and they're only going to work with desktop computers. There's the 1700, which retails for $330, the 1700x, which retails for $400, and the top of the line 1800x, which retails for $500. It feels almost like a gamble for AMD to launch its new microarchitecture with desktop CPUs. Work places are increasingly moving to laptops, and that's what most consumers look for when they head to the big box store to buy a new computer. But it makes sense when you see how the top of the line Ryzen 1800x stacks up against Intel's best Kaby Lake CPU, the i7-7700K. This thing flies when rendering 3D images in Blender or videos in Handbrake, or even the game Rise of the Tomb Raider . In all three instances it was nearly twice as fast as the i7, despite costing just $150 more. From top to bottom: Blender, Handbrake, Rise of the Tomb Raider. Much of the Ryzen's speed comes from the number of processor cores it packs into the CPU. It has eight cores, capable of running 16 threads concurrently. The i7-7700K has just 4 cores that run 8 threads concurrently. So the Ryzen can handle twice as many processes concurrently-which is especially useful when you have to render giant chunks of media in programs like Blender and Handbrake. According to both Intel and AMD, the processor that is most comparable to the 1800X is Intel's i7-6900K. But the i7-6900K runs on the older Skylake architecture...and it currently retails for $1000. Which means the Ryzen 1800X can give the same performance for half the price. That's magic! That's money saved! That also has to mean there's a catch. In the case of AMD's miracle new ultra fast processors there are two catches. The first is related to speed-Ryzen is still slow in a lot of instances. Intel has dominated so much of the computer market than many software designers have optimized their product to run especially well on Intel CPUs. Which is why it took the 1800x twice as long to render images in Photoshop, and why it was neck and neck with the i7-7700K in both our WebXPRT and Civilizations VI benchmarks. It's also why it scored only 2000 points higher in Geekbench 4 despite having twice as many cores.//what does 2000 points mean? Clockwise from left to right: Geekbench 4, WebXPRT, Photoshop, Civilizations VI. Until software designers start optimizing for Ryzen it will only be able to brute force its way into winning benchmarks, and software designers may never do that unless AMD can gain more of the CPU marketshare. Though AMD reps assured Gizmodo that software designers will soon be able to incorporate many potential optimizations tailored for Ryzen. Yet that won't help with Ryzen's other issue: the integrated GPU. The Ryzen CPUs don't have one. There's no way to get video out. If you want to view anything on your computer built with Ryzen inside-browser, operating systems, even BIOS-you'll have to spend additional money on a graphics card. That's not a problem for gamers, or editors and designers rendering huge files. They'll have already invested in a video card. It is a problem for budget conscious PC builders. And it will continue to be a problem until AMD drops its Accelerated Processing Units (the name for AMD's CPUs with integrated graphics) later this year. The APUs and other mobile friendly chips are certainly on the horizon-AMD has promised as much, but right now what AMD has delivered is incredible speeds that will benefit only a small portion of computer users. Which is a damn shame. Ryzen runs cooler than Kaby Lake or Skylake, and it sucks up less power, and it's faster. In nearly every way that counts Ryzen seems superior to what Intel is currently offering. But it's going to need more than raw speed if it ever wants to truly win. The 1800X's price to power ratio has me nearly convinced AMD has a contender-now stick this in a laptop that goes for less than the Intel version and we might have a winner.

The company has spent years in the proverbial desert, struggling with Bulldozer improvements while simultaneously designing its new Zen architecture. It’s no exaggeration to say AMD’s future as a PC company literally depends on Ryzen’s success. AMD has positioned Ryzen aggressively with price points that match extremely favorably with Intel’s Core i7 family and HEDT desktop parts, but there have always been questions about how well Ryzen would perform. It’s been years since AMD fielded a high performance CPU design and the company doesn’t have the same market share it once commanded. If the company is serious about pushing Ryzen into workstations, consumer PCs, and servers, it’s got a very high bar to clear. Today’s review will focus on the Ryzen 7 1800X‘s performance, rather than rehashing Ryzen’s design or architecture. Anyone with questions is invited to peruse those articles or ask in comments below. Before discussing Ryzen’s performance, however, we need to talk about its launch. Normally, a manufacturer gives us 7-10 days at minimum; the more significant the product, the longer the review window. AMD bucked this trend by launching Ryzen less than a week after we received our hardware kits. Because I’d previously committed to attend Nvidia’s GTX 1080 Ti launch at GDC, I only had 60 hours to test the Ryzen 7 1800X. AMD plans to hit Intel where it hurts — its wallet. As short as our review window was, I may have gotten lucky. In at least a few cases, reviewers didn’t receive their kits until 24-48 hours before the launch. I’ve run enough benchmarks on the Ryzen 7 1800X to feel comfortable characterizing this article as a review, but it’s also something of a hot mess. I suspect you’ll see wide variation in reported benchmarks and experiences; don’t be surprised if different people have different results. The limited testing time was exacerbated by the motherboard AMD shipped us for testing. Asus has a well-deserved reputation for quality, but my Crosshair VI Hero threw so many errors, AMD ultimately concluded I might have a bad board, not just a wonky BIOS. To be clear: I was scarcely the only reporter to experience problems or see odd performance, but our board seems to have been at the low end of the bell curve. Both Asus and AMD helped troubleshoot our problems, but the hours we devoted to this cut deeply into test time and required us to repeatedly benchmark certain tests rather than moving on to other hardware. After switching to a Gigabyte Aorus X370 motherboard I retested our game benchmarks, beginning around 12 AM this morning. While the Gigabyte motherboard did improve the situation slightly and was markedly more stable, it didn’t resolve the gaming Achilles heel I referred to in the title (we’ll be exploring that issue in greater detail below). As a result, our tests are not as thorough as we would have liked. We redesigned our CPU benchmark suite in preparation for Ryzen, but didn’t have time to run every CPU through every new test. Because we needed to test in parallel, not every CPU could be benchmarked with the same cooler or the same SSD. We chose the tests we did partly to ensure that these differences would not meaningfully impact our results, and our future deep dives into the chip will standardize on common hardware once again. With those caveats in mind, let’s check the numbers. Test setup: We’ve expanded our CPU test suite since the Core i7-7700K launched. Our Intel Core i7-6700K, 7700K, 6900K, and 6950X all used 32GB of G-Skill DDR4-3200 (F4-3200C14Q-32GTZ) clocked at that frequency. Neither of the Ryzen testbeds we tested, however, was capable of running four DIMMs at these clocks. Since we’d already tested the Intel systems, we had to make a choice: 16GB of DDR4-3200 or 32GB of DDR4-2133. Since none of our benchmarks require >16GB of RAM and AMD isn’t using quad-channel memory for Ryzen, we opted for 16GB. All of our GPU and 3D benchmarks were run using a GeForce GTX 1070. All of our game benchmarks are run at 1920×1080. While this isn’t considered an enthusiast resolution anymore, the point of these tests is to stress the CPU, not the GPU. All of our testbeds ran Windows 10 with the latest patches and updates installed. All of our GPU benchmarks were performed with Nvidia’s ForceWare 376.88. We’re going to split our benchmark results between workstation and application tests and 3D benchmarks with workstation and content creation tests up first. Our test results and analysis are in the slideshow below. As always, you can click on any slide to expand it in a new window. In workstation and computation tests, Ryzen is a beast to be reckoned with. Even when it doesn’t match Intel in raw performance, its performance-per-dollar gives it a huge advantage over its much larger, more expensive, rival. That said, there’s a narrow case to be made for chips like the Core i7-7700K, particularly in lightly threaded workloads. If you’re still dealing with single-thread or dual-threaded applications, the Core i7-7700K can still deliver the best performance per dollar. In most cases, however, the Ryzen 7 1800X is in a class of its own. That’s also true for gaming — but in very different contexts. Results like these are guaranteed to raise questions, and we’ve spoken to AMD extensively over the past few days to explore the issue. According to AMD, there are three issues collectively contributing to these problems. First, Ryzen’s SenseMi technology and Precision Boost are extremely fine-grained controls that offer significantly finer granularity than any previous AMD solution, which means BIOS implementations of these features are new and not necessarily working at 100% efficiency yet. Second, AMD has been out of the high-performance market for so long, virtually no software is written explicitly for or optimized to perform well on AMD CPUs. Ryzen puts AMD on a far better footing, but software patches don’t arrive overnight. Third, there are some games that are far more sensitive to the differences between AMD and Intel CPUs than others. We happened to pick a test suite that had more of these slowdowns in it than others, and even we don’t see it every test (Vulkan, for example, runs quite well). The other reason AMD missed it is because they chose 1440p for a minimum resolution, figuring that no one with a $500 CPU would still be gaming in 1080p. I can understand that argument even if I don’t normally find it persuasive (I prefer to keep a lower resolution to allow CPU performance to shine through). According to AMD, the difference in performance between itself and Intel is much reduced at 1440p and completely eliminated in 4K. I haven’t had the opportunity to verify those figures yet, but it does make sense — as resolution rises, the bottleneck in the system moves from the CPU to the GPU. If you game at 1440p or above, these results may not have much bearing on your experience. I had a number of conversations with AMD on the game performance question as well as discussions of board stability in general. Having tested a second motherboard, I think many of my stability and performance concerns were driven, at least in part, by faulty hardware. That said, Ryzen’s relative weakness in gaming while being such a vast improvement over the FX-9590 and offering extremely strong application/workstation performance is a bit odd. It’s possible that AMD’s heavy reliance on multi-threading, while effective in non-gaming tests, made it take a whack in game tests. This last, however, is merely speculation on my part. Last but not least, here’s a touch of icing for the proverbial cake. There is one caveat to be aware of. Remember, all of our Intel rigs used 32GB of DDR4-3200, while the AMD systems could only use 16GB of the same RAM. While this is undoubtedly having an impact on the results, it’s not going to tilt them in some crazy direction; 16GB of RAM doesn’t consume 42W of power, and that’s how much it would have to draw to bring the 1800X and 6900K into line with one another. Even with this caveat in mind, when was the last time you saw AMD hitting lower power consumption figures than Intel? Conclusions We still have plenty of questions about Ryzen and its performance, and we’ll be revisiting these topics in days to come. How strong Ryzen is, in an absolute sense, depends on where your interests lie. Evaluated strictly as a gaming chip, Ryzen is a good (but not great) option, due to its significant deficits against Intel. Evaluated as a workstation processor or 3D rendering solution, it’s extraordinary. The formal list price on the Core i7-6900K is $1089 – $1109. List price on the Ryzen R7 1800X is $500 bucks. I still think AMD should’ve held off launching until its partners had a bit more time to improve their boards, but that’s not my decision. If you’re unhappy about Ryzen’s gaming weaknesses relative to Intel, I’d suggest taking a walk down memory lane. When AMD began to gain ground on Intel in the late 1990s, it didn’t leap from budget chip manufacturing to the Athlon 64 X2 in a single bound. The K6 and K6-2 were adequate chips for budget-conscious gamers and Windows desktop software, but they weren’t going head-to-head with Intel’s Pentium II’s and winning the competition. It took years, and multiple product iterations, before the Athlon 64 was ready to tackle Intel in the server room. Given how far AMD’s market share has fallen, it’s going to take the company at least a year to build up any serious market share. I’ve said for years that Ryzen didn’t need to beat Intel in every particular, it simply needed to offer a viable alternative at a good price. Ryzen more than does that. It may not be the best chip at everything, but it’s more than good enough to help AMD win back some badly-needed market share. Even more importantly, this is a CPU core that AMD can scale up and out as the need arises. It’s great to have competition back in the CPU market.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 2, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (06:00 PST) | Topic: Hardware For almost a decade AMD has yielded ground to Intel when it comes to processors, but the new Ryzen 7 chips change all that -- on paper at any rate. Must read: Has AMD thrown Intel off its chip game? Today, March 2, AMD will carry out a hard launch of three new Ryzen 7 chips that not only outperform Intel's high-end silicon, but do so at a fraction of the price. Here are the three chips AMD is releasing today: Model Base clock (GHz) Boost clock (GHz) Cores/Threads TDP (Watts) Included cooler Suggested price Ryzen 7 1800X 3.6 4.0 8/16 95 N/A $499 Ryzen 7 1700X 3.4 3.8 8/16 95 N/A $399 Ryzen 7 1700 3.0 3.7 8/16 65 Wraith Spire $349 Two more Ryzen processors are scheduled for release during the second quarter. Model Base clock (GHz) Boost clock (GHz) Cores/Threads TDP (Watts) Included cooler Suggested price Ryzen 7 1600X 3.6 4.0 6/12 95 Wraith Spire - Ryzen 7 1500X 3.5 3.7 4/8 65 Wraith Spire - Here is the lineup, with each new AMD Ryzen chip matched up with its equivalent Intel silicon: Model Cores/Threads TDP (Watts) Suggested Price Intel chip Cores/Threads TDP (Watts) Suggested Price Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 95 $499 i7-6900K 8/16 140 $1050 Ryzen 7 1700X 8/16 95 $399 i7-6800K 6/12 140 $440 Ryzen 7 1700 8/16 65 $349 i7-7700K 4/8 91 $329 AMD Ryzen: Everything you need to know SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 26 NEXT PREV Three things stand out from that chart: AMD is taking the 8 cores/16 threads approach across the board TDP (Thermal Design Power) is down across the board compared to Intel, so less cooling needed Prices for AMD silicon are significantly lower than that of the corresponding Intel chip The strength of AMDs silicon is better multithreading. Even benchmarked clock-for-clock against Intel's Core i7 6900K Broadwell-E and Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake chips (with all processors frequency locked to 3.5GHz), the Ryzen 7 1800X showed a 2.7 and 6.5 percent performance advantage respectively over its rivals in the Cinebench 1T benchmark. However, when running at stock frequency things were a bit different. While the Ryzen 7 1800X could match the performance of the Core i7-6900K, the Core i7-7700K outpaced it by 15 percent in the same benchmark in single-threaded performance. Ryzen's power is clearly down to AMD's more efficient leveraging of multithreading using SenseMI, a set of sensing, adapting, and learning technologies built into Ryzen chips. This allows a 40+ percent increase in instructions per clock. SenseMI is comprised of five components: Pure Power - more than 100 embedded sensors with accuracy to the millivolt, milliwatt, and single degree level of temperature enable optimal voltage, clock frequency, and operating mode with minimal energy consumption; Precision Boost - smart logic that monitors integrated sensors and optimizes clock speeds, in increments as small as 25MHz, at up to a thousand times a second; Extended Frequency Range (XFR) - when the system senses added cooling capability, XFR raises the Precision Boost frequency to enhance performance; Neural Net Prediction - an artificial intelligence neural network that learns to predict what future pathway an application will take based on past runs; Smart Prefetch - sophisticated learning algorithms that track software behavior to anticipate the needs of an application and prepare the data in advance. Ryzen chips that have the X moniker (1800X and 1700X) not only have a higher base and boost clock speeds, but also double the XFR boost overhead. The focus on multithreaded performance makes Ryzen chips ideal for modern workloads 3D rendering, virtualization, video editing, and tasks such as streaming video games to the internet, and allows the chip to get more done per tick of the clock. And speaking of gaming, every Ryzen chip will come an unlocked multiplier to allow overclocking (depending on motherboard support). And speaking of motherboards, here are the chipsets broken down by segment: Segment Chipset USB 3.1 Gen 2 SATA GP PCIe Overclocking PCI Bifurcation Enthusiast X370 Native yes yes yes yes Mainstream B350 Native yes yes yes Essential A320 Native yes yes Enthusiast SFF X300 yes yes yes yes Essential SFF A300 yes yes There will be over 80 motherboards supporting Ryzen available from the usual suspects (ASRock, Asus, BioStar, Gigabyte, MSI, and such), and complete systems available from the top-tier OEMs. "Four years ago we began development of our 'Zen' processor core with the goal to deliver unprecedented generational performance gains and return choice and innovation to the high-performance computing market," said Su. "On March 2, enthusiasts and gamers around the world will experience 'Zen' in action, as we launch our Ryzen 7 family of processors and reinvigorate the desktop computing market." "We deeply appreciate the ways in which our partners and customers came together to build a high-performance ecosystem for Ryzen," said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD. "With an anticipated 82 new motherboards from ODMs worldwide, Ryzen-based designs from top global PC OEMs expected soon, and boutique SIs and OEMs showing extreme-performance PC designs, this will be a launch like no other. Unprecedented pre-order support from etailers globally shows that our ecosystem and partners are fully behind AMD and our commitment to return innovation and competition to high-performance PCs."

AMD exiting the high performance desktop computing market was a shock to many and it left Intel Corporation with no competition. With Intel left all alone in the desktop processor market it has allowed them to dominate the ever growing PC market. While the PC industry in general has been slowing down year after year, the PC gaming industry is booming and topped $30 billion in 2016. Desktop computers are mainly used for gaming and content creation these days and by not offering a high-end processor it let Intel rule the roost for over half a decade. Without competition the prices on Intel’s flagship processors have gone up and generational IPC gains are usually no more than 10% annually. Gamers have been dreaming about the day that AMD would return the market as they hoped it would lower prices and rejuvenate the chip designers and maybe force them to do better than the 5-10% IPC improvements that we’ve all become so accustomed to. While AMD turned tail and left the market they went back to the drawing board and came up with a new ‘clean-sheet’ x86 microarchitecture design called ‘Zen’ that they feel will be able to power flexible, high-performance platforms that are used for content creation during the work day and then hardcore gaming in the off hours. One of the other key design goals with Zen was to create an architecture that they could build on for the future. AMD Zen will be around for some time and Zen 2 and Zen 3 are already on the roadmap. AMD Ryzen processors will be released in three series; Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3. The AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 1700 are being released today and are $300+ processors that each are 8-core, 16-thread parts. AMD Ryzen 7 CPU Landing Page on Amazon Ryzen 7 1800X – $499 – Amazon.com Ryzen 7 1700X – $399 – Amazon.com Ryzen 7 1700 – $329 – Amazon.com For those that aren’t looking to spend over $300 on a processor, the AMD Ryzen 5 series is coming in Q2 2017. Ryzen R5 is aimed at the sub-$300 CPU market and feature either 4 or 6-core processor designs with SMT. Right now we’ve been told of the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X (6-cores and 12-threads at a 3.6GHz base/4.0GHz Boost clock) and the 1500X (4-core, 8-thread at a 3.5GHz base/3.7GHz boost). AMD sees the Ryzen 5 series being very disruptive at this price point as the Ryzen 5 1600X would be lined up across the Intel Core i5-7600K. AMD sees the Ryzen 5 series being the most popular of the three series due to the price point alone.

AMD isn’t giving out any specific details on this series since it is still at least several months away, but we’d expect it to consist of dual-core and quad-core parts aimed that the lower-end of the market in the sub-$140 market wild guess at it. With the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X being priced at $499 it appears AMD will have the desktop processor market covered from that price point all the way to the lowest entry-level processor. All three AMD Ryzen processor series are built using Global Foundries 14nm FinFET process, so they are using the latest manufacturing process available today to mass produce a desktop CPU. AMD hopes to be a force to reckon with with the Ryzen processor series based off the ‘Zen’ CPU architecture as they are lining them up against Intel Broadwell-E and Kaby Lake processors! To use the new AMD Ryzen processor you’ll need an AMD AM4 platform to run it and that means you’ll need a new motherboard, a dual-channel DDR4 memory kit and an CPU cooler that has AMD AM4 compatible brackets. AMD X370 and B350 chipset based boards will be the most popular and the only models available at launch, so be sure to read our 1,000+ word article on picking the right AMD AM4 chipset for your system. The price range for ATX form factor AMD B350 motherboards will be $99.99 to $129.99 with Micro ATX boards being in the $79.99 to $89.99 range. Prices for AMD X370 based boards start at $144.99 and go all the way up to $299.99. So, building a new system for Ryzen shouldn’t break the bank! An AMD Ryzen 1700 processor with a Wraith cooler runs $329 and then you are looking at around $130 for a nicely loaded AMD B350 motherboard, so for around $459 you can have a nice core platform for your new 8-core 16-thread Ryzen system at less than half the price of just a bare Intel Core i7-6900K processor. When it comes to dual-channel DDR4 memory kits the highest we’ve seen support right out of the box is 3200 MHz and we’ve seen 3600 MHz overclocks, so you can get some pretty healthy clock speeds on the new AMD AM4 platform and it will likely only get better as the BIOS/UEFI builds are improved by the board makers. We did all of our testing at 2933 MHz with CL14 1T timings and had no issues at all running at those higher clock speeds on this platform. Let’s take a closer look at the new Zen Architecture and then move straight into the testing! Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

Thank you for the balanced and professional review of the AMD Rysen CPU’s. The real and synthetic benchmarks of Ryzen CPU are essentially “twins” compared to Intel’s i7 6900K. I am puzzled thou. The gaming frames per second lags against the Intel CPU’s. One would expect there would be not much difference between the CPU’s during game testing which leaves one to think that this maybe is an game engine optimization issue (drivers etc.,). Did your testing evaluate the SMT on and off during game testing for AMD’s Rysen CPU, and to be fair likely wise for Intel’s HT for Intel’s CPU’s? I am wondering if the Rysen CPU’s are hampered because of combination of bios (UEFI), lack of game engine optimization, windows driver updates, and memory lattice issues. If there is a significant improvement with SMT turned off this would indeed unfortunately invalidate the gaming testing of your report. Could you please repeat some of the game testing for comparison. Thank you. Terry koenshaku I was more interested in seeing how these performed against intel’s 4+ core processors in gaming. We all know games are optimized for quad-core processors and performance falls off for processors with more than 4 cores… Coach Ryzen is a beast in multi-core workloads and it will only get better. Here are my Geekbench 4 numbers comparing my i7-4790k @4.9 oc and Ryzen 7 1800X @3.99 oc with SMT disabled (8c/8t only) 4790K=5631 single core, 18227 multi-core (I was in the high 80s C) 1800X=4349 single core, 18600 multi-core (I maxed out @72 C) This is 8 cores vs 8 threads which puts the 4790k at a bit of a disadvantage, I know, but it is also almost a whole gig faster clock-wise. Other Ryzen scores on Geekbench 4 show it scoring around 27450 @4ghz, with SMT enabled I assume. Eric Marshall Are those vengeance DIMM’s used for the test setup single or dual rank? Reason I ask is; previous generations of AMD chips have benefited from rank interleave a lot more than Intel counterparts. In other-words, if the test was performed without rank interleave on any of the systems, then Ryzen may have been at a greater disadvantage than if all the systems were tested with dual rank DIMM’s. Also, seems a bit odd to be comparing the X99 system with only a dual channel kit. Not like anyone building that sort of system would skimp on the quad channel arrangement anyway. Coach My bios gives me the option (Gigabyte-AMI) to enable channel interleave and rank interleave. I believe I have them enabled. I’m guessing other board partners have those options. Naeem ur Rehman i am grad you guys didn’t join the 720p and 480p low settings benchmarks hype i have seen this famous tech review website they only posted 640 x 480 gaming benchmarks showing 7700k beating ryzen 1700 by like 50 60 fps Coach Some of my initial Ryzen 7 1800X (w/RX 480gpu, 16gb ddr4 3000, Gigabyte Aorus Gaming 5 mobo) **Note: I’m not sure if the ram is running @ correct speeds–bios says 2933, but cpu-z shows 2133 (which is the default) I have it set on XMP. This BIOS is new to me, but it seems quite limited in ability to tweak memory. On my Asrock mobo, I can change each and every memory clock & setting. This is very limited in comparison. ** Cinebench R15 @3.6 stock=1540, @3.8ghz=1613. TimeSpy=4543 (compared to my i7-4790k @4.4ghz=4339) (TimeSpy gpu=4241, cpu=7623–CPU not recognized by Futuremark) I got the Steam achievement for “mystery machine” because of that. 😉 CPU-z @3.6ghz, single core bench=2137 (i7-4790k@4.4=2003) CPU-z multi @3.6=14504 (i7-4790k=8387) SuperPi Mod 1.5XS 1M=11.903s @3.6ghz (stock) SuperPi Mod 1.5XS 32M=10m 21.343s @ stock I cannot wait for optimizations, etc. As an experienced builder and mediocre overclocker with AM3 and Intel, this is new and I need to learn more about my system to get a good and stable setup. I believe there is a new bios out for my mobo, even though the bios is very new. I have not yet flashed the newer version, but will do so and re-test as I go. The CPU generally runs pretty warm. I’m not sure why, etc. I’m using a Corsair H110i to cool the system. Regardless of thermal paste setup/burn-in, I would expect cooler temps. I’m @ 52C most of the time at idle but when I ran Cinebench R15 @3.8ghz, I hit 73C max, which isn’t necessarily crazy hot, stock was 60-something(?). Again, time will tell us all more. Coach SMT was left at stock setting (enabled) for tests above. Dylan Disable SMT and run the gaming benchmarks again. Until Microsoft issues the Windows 10 gamers update, this is the only way around the issues right now. AMD is also working on releasing patches over the next few months to fix other issues such as system memory support and buggy turbo boost. It seems you were one of few reviewers who had the Precision Boost and XFR features working properly, scoring 163 cb in Cinebench R15 ST; the highest I’ve seen thus far at stock. Mike – KnightRid After reading the whole review I do see how price/performance is a bit better in most cases with ALL the cpus and really shines with the 1800X due to the price point being half of Intel’s counterpart. I do not understand why the driver was not ready at launch. I mean, people see the first numbers and go, ok it’s not bad, when with the drivers it could be a HUGE game changer…maybe…..who knows if it is just a lot of hot air until they (the drivers) are actually released. It is unfinished yet pushed out to meet a deadline, that’s a shame. Also the 1080P gaming debacle is just sad. Sweet spot for gaming is still 1080P – http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/ – so shouldn’t they have focused on that? I would still be happy buying one of them as I don’t game much on the computer anymore (ps3 and ps4 for most of my gaming) and it is a nice price point for performance that should get better when the drivers (which should have already been ready) are released that fix the problems (maybe, hopefully). I quoted myself from the forums – http://forums.legitreviews.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=46494&p=225005#p225005 – hop on in and discuss it further. Riptor I want to know how this is a disappointment? The Ryzen 1700 is a $330 CPU that is 40% faster than the i7-7700k, all while using less 30% power. You can overclock it and have a CPU within spitting distance of a $1,000 intel CPU. An excellent processor which in my opinion even exceeded the hype. David Hall Seems pretty darn good for me on price and performance. I’d happily sacrifice some fps today for gains later as the use of multigpu rises, drivers and BIOS mature. Can’t wait open play with the RAM timings. Who would have thought you could get a fast 8C16T cpu and mobo combo for such reasonable prices. It’ll make a nice addition to my Intel, Nvidia and AMD family. jojigzaw Thanks for putting in KeyShot. It will be great if SolidWorks and Inventor was on the test to. Ed It’s launch day…can’t expect everything to be perfect on an entirely new CPU. I am a bit disappointed in the gaming numbers but feel better seeing the feedback from Oxide and CA both saying the CPU optimizations are coming. I think I will hold off 60-90 days an see how things shake out with Ryzen before building a new gaming rig… Vanesa Fernandez Intel is altering those test-ers. cris levin at 1080p, as long as it is >60fps, does it really matter if its 200 or 300fps? Pui Ho Lam 144 or even 240Hz monitors exist Coach fps and hz are two different things. Pui Ho Lam fps means frames per second. Hertz means per second without specifying the unit of what you’re counting. On monitors, it’s apparently the refresh rate of pictures, ie. frames. Coach http://www.avadirect.com/blog/frame-rate-fps-vs-hz-refresh-rate/ I don’t have time to educate you, so here…read this link. They ARE different. Pui Ho Lam LMAO, you think I don’t know when the output is not perfectly in sync with the refresh rate? But that’s not the point in this case. Abedsbrother All right, everybody can relax. AMD fanboys: Ryzen is miles better than FX. Intel fanboys: Intel is still better overall. Btw, the i3 7350k, currently selling at $178, doesn’t count as a low-cost processor (bottom of page 11 of the review). That would be the Pentium G4560 ($62). Dusan This is good, this is competition. It will make Intel work harder next time to give us more than just 1% performance increase. Go AMD! Nathan Kirsch exactly! gamersglory I look at this and think most of the gaming setbacks can be fix with mature chipset drivers and BIOS. I am curious though if ryzen work better with the latest windows insider build as the most up to date codebase would be in it Nana Hermawan look at power consumption, ryzen not realy work hard in gaming test, maybe 20% lost potential Toss -1% tbh. John Or you could just buy the AMD solution and not worry about Intel’s next offering. tacominnie It is even slower then an i5 7600k on games, ofc if you bench at 4k you will be gpu bound and you wont notice a difference even when compared to a G4560. Mahesh Walatara Fairly Disappointment- but the 1800x is great for Photoshop Premier Pro use. Mark Puka nodi palayan ponnaya … english grammer danneth na tho, wesi … Andrew S A little disappointed considering the hype. Seems that at 1080p these CPUs can’t keep up with even the likes of the 7700k. But at 1440p/4k it’s much better. Maybe the extra cores/threads make the difference there. Yes Indeed nothing keeps up with the 7700k. clock speed rules in most games and that cpu gets 5ghz. Abedsbrother Clock speed combined combined with great IPC, you mean. If just clock speed were the primary determinant, the FX-9590 would be king. al No, extra cores/threads are not making the difference there. The reason is that the system goes from cpu-bottleneck to gpu-bottleneck. The sad part for me is that the Windows CPU drivers, UEFI bios were not ready, and in a month most people will not see that review. That the games were not optimized was expected, most of them are probably using at max 2-4 cores, and maybe some Intel compiler cheat magic on some libraries is still there. Nathan Kirsch You hit the nail on the head on all your comments. I really wish the Windows drivers were ready before we were given the parts to review. Instead we got a statement 24 hours before launch from AMD saying that they’ll be coming in 30 days if all goes well. Game optimizations will be hit or miss when they come, but they appear to be coming. That takes time though and we’ll see what happens. Tyrann where did they state that? i wanna read it 🙂 Nathan Kirsch I put it in the conclusion on the last page. The quote came direct from AMD’s John Taylor. There was talk of it coming with Ryzen 5 and then they said ‘in the next month’ in an official statement that was e-mailed out last night. Tyrann thank you epigramx > intel compiler cheat That’s a stupid meme. Most benchmarks are compiled on either gcc or vstudio. Let alone even if that meme was even true – which it isn’t – those CPUs are 99% identical on instructions anyway so even if it’s optimized well for an Intel it’s de facto optimized 99% well for an AMD. tacominnie Amd fanboys are famous for excuse finding…That’s a good sign right? disqus_GB8lUuziuG intel fanbots game at 1080p with TitanXP then bitch on the internets that their 7700k is uber fastest cpu of all time.. disqus_GB8lUuziuG only if you play 1080p with a gtx 1080 or titan.. these are misleading reviews. look at 1440p or 4k if you game with a 1080 or titan. If you game at 1080p look at reviews with 1070 or less for more accurate results. Andrew S Yep completely agree with that statement. I’m personally waiting to see the 1300, 1400 and 1400x perform with something like a gtx 1060/RX480. That’s where the market is the most interesting in my opinion. haralampi nedelin yeah, it does better comparatively at 1440p/4k, due to GPU bottlenecking. an i3 gets similar framerates on most titles here, so no point in spending $350 or more on ryzen. The 1080ti will widen the bottleneck and reveal, once again, that higher IPC and clock is what makes the difference, not core count disqus_GB8lUuziuG Exactly buy the R5 or R3 Ryzen if you need a gaming chip, good point. Nah 1080ti won’t do that at all, it will be just as things are now. haralampi nedelin both intel and AMD run into GPU bottlenecks at those resolutions. The 1080ti will widen that bottleneck, and maybe we’ll see true performance differences. gerwingr well that was quick, ,6.09 Am Pacific Time Vancouver Canada, and i am reading your report, exciting, thanks, Check out LegitReviews' Polls on LockerDome on LockerDome Tweets by @LegitReviews Explore Editorial Events Interviews News Forum Folding Shop Content Bluetooth Cooling Editorial Events Interviews Memory Misc Mobile Mods and Ends Motherboards News PC Cases Power Supply Press Releases Processors Reviews Storage Video Cards About Contact Us Disclaimer About Us Follow Us         Copyright © 2002-2017 LegitReviews.com - All Rights Reserved.

Mark Williams takes us on a deep dive into what we know about Ryzen to find out. Pluto! I bet you weren’t expecting this article to start with that word, but there’s a good reason - here's a fun fact for you. AMD’s Ryzen is actually named after NASA’s little New Horizons spacecraft, which zipped by Pluto not long ago, giving us those magnificent pictures of the planet that turned into a dwarf after Horizon had launched. AMD wanted to originally use the architectural codename “Zen,” but legalities intervened preventing this, so - inspired by Horizons - AMD tweaked the name a bit to keep the zen, leading to “Horizen”, which gave way to “Rizen” - which the company liked - but to avoid confusion with the word “risen,” it added the Y, giving us the Ryzen name we know today. Neat eh? Alright, onto the juicy stuff. AMD has been handing out NDA-ed slides to the press, giving some more detailed information about the Ryzen CPUs and what makes them tick. Today that NDA lifts so we’d like to go over some of the details included within these slides - and some of what’s not. First things first, a recap of the upcoming Ryzen CPU models: Ryzen 7 1800X – 8C/16T, 16MB L3, 95W TDP, 3.6GHz base - 4.0GHz turbo, US$499 Ryzen 7 1700X - 8C/16T, 16MB L3, 95W TDP, 3.4GHz base - 3.8GHz turbo, US$389 Ryzen 7 1700 - 8C/16T, 16MB L3, 65W TDP, 3.0GHz base - 3.7GHz turbo, US$319 Ryzen 5 1600X - 6C/12T, 16MB L3, 95W TDP, 3.3GHz base - 3.7GHz turbo, US$259 Ryzen 5 1500 - 6C/12T, 16MB L3, 65W TDP, 3.2GHz base - 3.4GHz turbo, US$229 Ryzen 5 1400X - 4C/8T, 8MB L3, 65W TDP, 3.5GHz base - 3.9GHz turbo, US$199 Ryzen 5 1300 - 4C/8T, 8MB L3, 65W TDP, 3.3GHz base - 3.6GHz turbo, US$175 Ryzen 3 1200X - 4C/4T, 8MB L3, 65W TDP, 3.4GHz base - 3.8GHz turbo, US$149 Ryzen 3 1100 - 4C/4T, 8MB L3, 65W TDP, 3.2GHz base - 3.5GHz turbo, US$129 Now of those, only the top three are launching immediately. The 1800X, 1700X and 1700 can all be pre-ordered right now for $699, $569 and $469 respectively in Australia. That’s still a lot of money for a CPU but when you consider that the $700 1800X is going toe-to-toe with Intel’s i7 6900K, which currently sells for over double the price at $1500, you'll start to appreciate the magnitude of the new price/performance curve AMD is creating here. Even the 1700 (non-X) model, at $469, is $15 less than Intel’s latest i7 7700K, a CPU with half the core and thread count! Save some money and double your core count? Mind, blown. We’ve waited a long time for this and AMD is so far delivering in spades, exposing Intel’s price gouging for what it is, and showing why many enthusiasts and industry professionals wanted AMD to do well with Ryzen. Lack of competition leads to monopoly behaviours, like charging whatever you like. Over $2300 for the ten core CPU? Ha! No thanks! From very early on AMD was up front in stating it wanted the Zen architecture to obtain a 40% uplift in instructions per clock (IPC) performance over its latest Bulldozer iteration “Excavator”. Since launching, AMD announced it actually exceeded this target and achieved a greater than 52% increase; which when you think about Intel’s typical 5-10% increase each generation, AMD has pulled off something special. Mind you it has taken them far too long to get here, but that’s another story. Even with this IPC boost it only just pulls AMD up to par with Intel’s latest, highlighting just how far behind the performance curve AMD had become. AMD is claiming IPC in Ryzen, in single threaded tasks, is just 2.5% below Broadwell and 6.5% below Kaby Lake. However, looking at AMD’s own benchmarks, and those that have leaked around the internet, once multithreading comes into play AMD easily makes up and even exceeds this slight IPC gap. This is something to keep an eye on and learn more about down the track, as AMD appears to have implemented Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT, or Hyperthreading in Intel parlance) better. IPC is one thing; there’s no point doing huge amounts of instructions each clock cycle if you’re clock speed is no faster than your Zimmer-frame-using-granny at walking pace. And that is where Intel still has the advantage. Where Ryzen still lives in the 3GHz range, Intel has products that have base clock speeds starting in the 4GHz range, before you even talk about turbo speeds. Against Ryzen’s main competitor, Broadwell-E, that’s not a problem, but facing off against the likes of the 7700K, single- or lightly-threaded tasks will easily make use of those extra MHz. Another exciting part about Ryzen is the power consumption and, by extension, boost clocks. AMD’s SenseMI technology employs the use of over 100 voltage, amperage and temperature sensors embedded directly into the CPU die to help AMD shut off various areas of the CPU as and when they’re needed. This tech is being dubbed Pure Power by AMD, and is part (but certainly not all) of the reason why AMD’s Ryzen 7 1700, an 8-core 16-thread part, has a TDP of just 65W compared to Intel's beastly i7 7700K 4-core 8-threaded CPU, which needs 91W! Using this sensory platform AMD has also implemented its Precision Boost tech, AMD’s equivalent to Intel’s Turbo Boost. Offering clock speed increments as small as 25MHz at a thousand times a second, Ryzen can increase core clocks (so far) upwards of 700MHz, and of course all the way down to idle speeds. Those things are all well and good but it basically only matches Intel’s current variable clock speed feature-set; however Ryzen has an extra ace up its sleeve. To understand it best, we oddly need to look to Nvidia as a reference. XFR (eXtended Frequency Range) is a technology AMD is using to raise CPU clock speeds even higher than the boost clocks, if there is sufficient cooling headroom available. Sound familiar? It should, because Nvidia’s Boost 3.0 on the likes of the GTX 1080 already does a similar thing, wherein you have a base clock and a higher turbo clock speed, but depending on loads, temperatures and power usage, Nvidia’s Boost 3.0 can push core clocks even higher than what they’re rated at out of the factory. XFR is essentially AMD’s version of this for CPUs. At this stage, Ryzen’s implementation of this doesn’t seem to offer as much of a boost as Nvidia’s Boost 3.0 does, but it’s still early days. Disappointingly we’ve only seen at best an extra 100MHz increase when XFR kicks in, but how far it’ll go in the real world, with some hefty cooling applied, will have to wait until reviewers get their hands on actual samples. Interestingly, is seems the models with the X on the end of their names won’t be the only ones that have XFR support (as was previously thought). The above slide shows that models with the X simply have a doubling of how much more XFR will boost clock speeds, should conditions permit. It seems Ryzen is AMD’s equivalent of Intel’s HEDT CPU lineup. Lots of cores but no integrated GPU. Enthusiasts won’t care about such things as they’ll be sticking in their own dedicated GPUs anyway, but for mainstream users this will be a sticking point. However, it looks like the venerable Athlon brand name will live on in some form again when AMD bring its Zen-powered APUs online in the second half of this year. Speaking of release dates of other AMD products, Zen-powered mobile products will come to market in the second half of this year too. Sooner than that, in the second quarter of this year, we’ll get Vega (AMD’s GTX 1080 competitor) and Naples, AMD’s upcoming Ryzen-based Xeon competitor for servers (32 cores anyone?). Motherboard chipsets have received a much-needed spruce up. AMD has segmented them much like, and against, Intel’s mainstream lineup with the X370, B350 and A320 facing off against Intel’s Z270, B250 and H210 boards respectively. As an interesting side note, I wonder if Intel’s next-gen motherboard range will move into the 300 numbers, seeing as AMD has pulled a quick one and started its platform in that number range. B350 motherboards could be a thing from both vendors otherwise. Sly AMD, very sly. Native USB 3.1 Gen2 is a big selling point for AMD’s motherboards. Even Intel’s latest Z270 requires an ASMedia USB hub chip to provide this capability. Somewhere Ryzen apparently can’t compete directly against Intel is on the PCI-E lane-count front. Ryzen has 24 PCI-E 3.0 lanes that come directly from the CPU, which is indeed more than Intel’s mainstream i7 7700K for example, with 16 lanes, and far less than Intel’s HEDT line-up that sport some 40 lanes. The trick, however, is that Intel has its own proprietary chipset interconnect which uses DMI for communications, meaning the CPU’s PCI-E lanes don’t get touched. On Ryzen however, those 24 lanes are used by the entire system. So, 16x lanes is reserved for use with graphics cards (yes that means only two 8x is available in dual-card setups), 4x is reserved for or given priority to NVMe applications (ie M.2 slots), and the remaining 4x lanes are used to connect the X370 chipset to the CPU, leaving a serious bandwidth gap compared to the Z270. Having a quick look at two high-end Asus motherboards for the two chipset types, the Z270 effectively makes 22x PCI-E 3.0 lanes available to the user, whereas the X370 only gives 16x PCI-E 3.0 lanes, and around 7x PCI-E 2.0 lanes (as a reminder, 2.0 is half the speed of a 3.0 lane). Quite a difference. On top of that the X370, when a 4x NVMe device is plugged in, only supports four SATA drives, and just two on the B and A series chipsets! It seems AMD will severely need to increase PCI-E lane counts next year, or whenever the next Ryzen iteration comes, if it wants to remain competitive on the connectivity front. Z270 beats it handily and X99 is simply just laughing at this point. Something to note, SLI and Crossfire will only be supported on the top tier X370 chipset. One of the saving graces of AMD's new platform is that overclocking is available on the entire Ryzen CPU range, top to bottom. The only limiter is which motherboard chipset you use, with the lowest end A320 and A300 chipsets disallowing CPU overclocking. So, avoid the A-series motherboards and get yourself a B- or X-series chipset and you’ll be ready to go. It seems AMD’s overclocking will be getting the Radeon Settings graphics driver style software treatment, too, with official Ryzen overclocking software to be available, meaning no reliance on sometimes sketchy motherboard manufacturer overclocking software. Something to keep an eye on is memory support. While Ryzen supports up to 64GB in dual-channel mode, like Kaby Lake does, at least in this slide there could be a speed problem when you actually do fully populate the RAM slots, with four dual-rank DIMMs slowing down to just 1866MHz. Two single-rank DIMMs, however, exceed Intel’s latest supported RAM speeds at 2666MHz, compared to 2400MHz; however Intel motherboards support XMP profiles well into the 3GHz range. We’ll have to wait and see if AMD’s boards will be able to match that. AMD’s revamped stock air cooler, dubbed the Wraith, has had a facelift, with a smaller version created for the less demanding processors in the line-up. The two higher end coolers have also had a lick of RGB included in them too. Not all CPUs will come with a cooler though. While the 1800X and 1700X can come with the Wraith Max cooler (rated for 140W), there will also be versions of those CPUs sold without the cooler, which should be around $30 cheaper. The 1700 gets the Wraith Spire cooler (rated for 95W). Aside from those three CPUs it’s unclear at this stage which models below those will get the Spire or Stealth coolers included. A safe bet would be that all quad core Ryzen CPUs (1400X and down) will have the Stealth cooler. Ryzen is certainly shaping up to be the disruptive force we're all hop[ing it can be. All of AMD’s channel partners are gearing up to strongly support AM4 and Ryzen. Now, all we need to do is get our hands on some products and get testing! Something we aim to do ASAP.

The Ryzen 5 and 3 lines are named to correspond to competing iCore 7, 5 and 3 families from rival Intel. The flagship Ryzen 5 1600X uses six of AMD’s Zen cores handling 12 threads and running at a 3.6 GHz base data rate. It beats Intel’s Core i5 7600L by 69 percent in a Cinebench nT multithreaded benchmark and will ship before June, AMD said. The Ryzen 5 line also includes four-core processors. The chips fall in a broad $100-$300 price range. AMD provided no details on the Ryzen 3 family except that it will ship in the second half of the year. The new AMD families will “bring Zen to more mainstream x86 price points,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). All Ryzen chips are unlocked and come with tools for overclocking and tuning their performance, with some hitting rates up to 4.1 GHz in liquid-cooled systems. By contrast, Intel sells a special unlocked version of its CPUs. AMD seeded 400 high-end developers with Ryzen 7 machines, targeting high-end video and games producers. It expects to supply processors to several thousand targeted developers before the end of the year. Before June AMD also will ship its first Zen-based server chip, a 32-core CPU dubbed Naples. Before the end of the year it will roll out Zen-based CPUs for notebooks. The company reported at ISSCC on a four-core Zen chip that had at 44mm2 a 10 percent better area efficiency than a similar Intel CPU. It claims its Zen core delivered a 270 percent Cinebench nT improvement over its prior Excavator core. Looking ahead, AMD has Zen 2 and 3 generations on the drawing board, said chief technology officer Mark Papermaster. “We are back and we are committed to stay back,” he said. Ryzen will fuel an estimated 26-percent rise in AMD’s unit sales for PC chips this year while Intel’s unit sales will fall five percent, according to Ross Seymore, a financial analyst with Deutsche Bank who follows both companies. So far, Intel has not announced any price cuts to its Core desktop line, said an Intel spokesperson, something market watchers anticipated at the Ryzen 7 launch last month. Intel is focusing on profitability in its client x86 business, anticipating continued single-digit unit sales declines in PCs over the next three years, Seymore said in a research report. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: AMD Fires Volley in x86 War AMD Licenses X86 to China JV AMD Reveals Zen of X86 Intel Shows 2.5D FPGA at ISSCC Email This Print Comment More Related Links Intel, Spreadtrum Demo Brainchild TSMC Joins Chip Research Consortium ASML Revs EUV Engines EUV Progress, Hurdles Cited Qcomm, Samsung, MTK Offer Hints on iPhone 8 Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Rookie Re: It doesn't matter goldstone77   3/5/2017 11:22:38 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I think it is remarkable to not that we are dealing with an advertised node of 14nm. For AMD this is actually 17nm, and Intel is 13nm. Intel has been shrinking the process node smaller than the other 3 semiconductor manufacturers. Intel has used this strategy of shrinking the process smaller than anyone else for a very long time now. Not much change in architecture, but increases in clock speed. 5nm difference and actually coming back with a whole new architecture, and increasing its performance across the board and reducing power consumption vs. Intel has been a pretty spectacular feat for AMD. Sure, there are issues with motherboards bios, windows, and gaming engines not fully supporting AMD right now. That is going to change like usually bios will get update over the course of the next few weeks and months. Windows will release fixes for problems no recognizing real core and logic core memory allocation. AMD was smart and has made partnerships with a few prominent gaming manufactures Bethesda being one of the most recognized who promises to optimize games for Ryzen and Vega. Also, you will get an increase in API's like Vulkan which take advantage of the extra cores! While all these problems are getting hashed out, be on the look for Intel's 10nm (9.5nm actual) to come out. It will be a small victory for Intel if they make it to market before Global Foundries drops their 7nm (9.2nm) due around 2019. This will almost cut AMD's process node in half, which will bring another huge performance gain and reduction in power consumption! And for the first time AMD will have a process node smaller than Intel! By the time that drops most of the problems AMD has had with lack of bios, windows, and gaming engines adaptation would almost all be gone! Then another 50% increase in performance and 80% reduction in power consumption!

We'll see on server boards, this core power disasvantage could give some issues in perf/watt. Under the infamous Cinebench the Zen core is power hungry and only the low plataform power save the flag. Performance has a cost and AMD has opened the internal buses too much to sport great peak scores IMO, we'll se what this will translate in a real server workload with a lot of threads. Hopefully the power consumption will not go out of control.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: It doesn't matter Gondalf   3/5/2017 3:57:57 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I am not a gamer at al but 4K games are now pretty of niche and they are absolutely GPU bound. In 4K every cpu is the same so no reason to purchase a cpu more expensive than $150/200 but high clocked or overclocked. It is a fact Ryzen is a disappointment in games and all forums around the web are saying the cpu was hyped more than necessary. In this moment Intel has no competition from AMD unfortunately in entusiast segment. Nothing is changed, in average Ryzen is slower than a cheap i5 cpu in games.

I have or have had foundry partnerships with most fabs and that includes Intel. The 14nm FinFet process in question is a pretty decent process. It does not matter iff it is 10% less optimal than Intel. Total power and CPU throughput is the only thing that matters. And I design OO processors for a  living. So I run my own CPU perf. lab. I am simply pointing out that AMD has focused more on core counts and gotten rid of a GPU. For performance in integers and FP, a GPU is wasted space. So unless you are running GPU accelerated tasks (for which an external GPU is a better choice anyway), the AMD approach does make sense. And yes, more cores does mean more performance. The drop in single core performance due to lowered speed is more than compensated by increased throughput. HT in fact uses the wide issue arch a lot better than single threaded workloads.core based pricing for SW exists for a reason. Most enterprise workloads, most engineering workloads , most new games prefer more cores and threads. Legacy PC SW does not but who needs anyhthing more than 2 Ghz there anyway. Come up with some data and we will have a useful discussion. In any case, the high core speeds do not sustain, try running at 3.6 Ghz full tilt on any processor on all cores and you will see thermal throttling push the speed down a lot and it it stays there for a  while. So for sustained workloads, I do not trust 3+ Ghz speeds. Again this is data from my benchmarking. And yes Ryzen does show its worth outside a lab in non gaming workloads.

Smaller die size does not mean better processor nor performance. AMD is using LiarFoundries for Ryzen, which has inferior specs compared to Intel (78 CPP versus 70 CPP). Intel's process is superior to LiarFoundries', which is not a surprise. Therefore, on average Intel can pack more inside a chip than AMD/LiarFoundries can. If AMD did not fill in the full 49mm2, they are losing on precious space. So no, it is not an advantage at all. Lastly, if you already committed to just released Ryzen/Core for High Performance, you are clearly a novice. More cores/threads does not automatically mean better performance/reliability under load. In modern architectures there is a lot more that goes into that. Gaming/Real time graphics is a High Performance application of sorts. In fact, it looks head to head in that application space where it matters most. Most normal applications, however, can't even utilize that many cores. If Ryzen proves to be significantly better outside of the lab, it will force Intel to lower prices, and come up with a better processor soon. Intel's release early next year already looks to beat Ryzen. Price is the biggest advantage for AMD Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: It doesn't matter GSMD   3/4/2017 5:38:24 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Actually the area does make a lot of difference if you think about it a little more. I am getting twice the no. of cores for the same area and lesser power. Naturally this is because of the lack of a GPU. But ignoring 1080p gaming,which is a niche by itself (if you are a serious gamer, you will use a higher resolution where for some reason, AMD specs are better), AMD creams Intel in multi-threaded performance (twice the cores, so a non-brainer). For the folks in this forum, I am assuming MT performance is everything. Most  eng.  tools (simulators , parallel makes, analytics engines)  tend to devour cores and threads. That is why in my lab, we stopped buying Intel processors as of this week ! My SW teams especially will not go back to a sub 8 core processor. Memory bandwidth is a concern but has not hit our workloads. So for engineers, there is very little reason to buy an Intel processor unless you have single threaded workloads (there are a few around) but even here an OCed Ryzen would be close. The benchmarks have been gaming oriented and hence misleading since the world presumably does a lot more with their PCs than just play 1080p games ! Maybe everyone does, who knows ....   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Rookie It doesn't matter paul.jhnson   3/3/2017 12:50:24 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate "Ryzen has 44mm2 area - a 10 percent better area efficiency than a similar Intel CPU". It's a meaningless measure. I don't understand why AMD likes to bring this up like it's an accomplishment. Nobody cares if their system die size is 44mm2 versus 48mm2. All other specs (CPP, etc) are inferior when compared to Intel IMO. Realworld benchmarks will tell if AMD really has something. So far it looks like a close call to me, which doesn't favor AMD all that much.

Back in 2014 when AMD first announced it was pursuing an all-new microarchitecture, old hands recalled the days when the battle between AMD and Intel was fun to be a part of, and users were happy that the competition led to innovation: not soon after, the Core microarchitecture became the dominant force in modern personal computing today. Through the various press release cycles from AMD stemming from that original Zen announcement, the industry is in a whipped frenzy waiting to see if AMD, through rehiring guru Jim Keller and laying the foundations of a wide and deep processor team for the next decade, can hold the incumbent to account. With AMD’s first use of a 14nm FinFET node on CPUs, today is the day Zen hits the shelves and benchmark results can be published: Game On! [A side note for anyone reading this on March 2nd. Most of the review is done, bar an edit pass or two. Most of the results pages have graphs, but no text. Please have patience while we finish.] Launching a CPU is like an Onion: There are Layers As AnandTech moves into its 20th anniversary, it seems poignant to note that one of our first big review pieces that gained notoriety, back in 1997, was on a new AMD processor launch. Our style and testing regime since then has expanded and diversified through performance, gaming, microarchitecture, design, feature-set and debugging marketing strategy. (Fair play to Anand, he was only 14 years old back then…!). Our review for Ryzen aims to encompass many of the areas we feel pertinent to the scale of today’s launch. An Interview with Dr Lisa Su, CEO of AMD The Product Launch: A Small Stack of CPUs Microarchitecture: Front-End, Back-End, micro-op cache, GloFo 14nm LP Chipsets and Motherboards: AM4 and 300-series Stock Coolers and Memory: Wraith and DDR4 Benchmarking Performance: Our New 2017 CPU Benchmark Suite Conclusions Before the official launch, AMD held a traditional ‘Tech Day’ for key press and analysts in the past week over in San Francisco. The goal of the Tech Day was to explain Zen to the press, before the press explain it to everyone else. AMD likes doing Tech Days, with recent events in memory covering Polaris and Carrizo, and I don’t blame them: alongside the usual slide presentations recapping what is already known or ISSCC/Hot Chips papers, we also get a chance to sit down with the VPs and C-Level executives as well as the key senior engineers involved in the products. Some of the information in this piece we would have published before: AMD’s machine of tickle-out information means that we know a good deal behind the design already, but the Tech Day helps us ask those final questions, along with the official launch details. So, What Is Zen? Or Ryzen? A Brief Backstory and Context  The world of main system processors, or CPUs in this case, is governed at a high level by architecture (x86, ARM), microarchitecture (how the silicon is laid out), and process node (such as 28HPM and 16FF+ from TSMC, or 14LP from GloFo). Beyond these we have issues of die area, power consumption, transistor leakage, cost, compatibility, dark silicon, frequency, supported features and time to market. Over the past decade, both AMD and their main competitor Intel have been competing for the desktop and server computer markets with processors based on the x86 CPU architecture. Intel moved to its leading Core microarchitecture on 32nm around 2010, and is now currently in its seventh generation of it at 14nm, with each generation implementing various front-end/back-end changes and design adjustments to caches and/or modularity (it’s actually a lot more complex than this). By comparison, AMD is running its fourth/fifth generation of Bulldozer microarchitecture, split between its high-end CPUs (running an older 2nd Generation on 32nm), its mainstream graphics focused APUs (running 4th/5th Generation on 28nm), and laptop-based APUs (on 5th Generation). High-Performance and Mainstream x86 Microarchitectures AMD Year Intel Zen 14FF 2017   ?

Bulldozer doubled the integer scheduler and throughput capabilities, and allowed the module to accept two threads of instructions - this meant that integer heavy workloads could perform well, other bottlenecks notwithstanding. The perception was that most OS-based workloads are invariably integer/whole number based, such as loop iterations or true/false Boolean comparisons or predicates. Unfortunately the design ended up with a couple of key issues: OS-based workloads ended up getting more floating-point heavy, traditional OSes didn’t understand how to dispatch work given a dual-thread module leading to overloaded modules (this was fixed with an update), general throughput of a single thread was a small (if any) upgrade over the previous microarchitecture design, and power consumption was high. A number of leading analysts pointed to design philosophies in the Bulldozer design, such as a write-through L1 cache and a shared L2 cache within a module lead to higher latencies and increased power consumption. A good chunk of the deficit to the competition was the lack of a micro-op cache that can help bypass instruction decode power and latency, as well as a process node disadvantage and the incumbent’s strong memory pre-fetch/branch prediction capabilities. The latest generation of Bulldozer, using ‘Excavator’ cores under the Carrizo name for the chip as a whole, is actually quite a large jump from the original Bulldozer design. We have had extensive reviews of Carrizo for laptops, as well as a review of the sole Carrizo-based desktop CPU, and the final variant performed much better for a Bulldozer design than expected. The fundamental base philosophy was unchanged, however the use of new GPUs, a new metal stack in the silicon design, new monitoring technology, new threading/dispatch algorithms and new internal analysis techniques led to a lower power, higher performance version. This was at the expense of super high-end performance above35W, and so the chip was engineered to focus at more mainstream prices, but many of the technologies helped pave the way for the new Zen floorplan. Zen is AMD’s new microarchitecture based on x86. Building a new base microarchitecture is not easy – it typically means a large paradigm shift in the way of thinking between the old design and new design in key areas. In recent years, Intel alternates key microarchitecture changes between two separate CPU design teams in the US and Israel. For Zen, AMD made strides to build a team suitable to return to the high-end. Perhaps the most prominent key hire was CPU Architect and all-around praised design guru Jim Keller. Jim has a prominent history in chip design, starting with the likes of Freescale, to developing chips for AMD when they fighting tooth and nail with Intel in the early 2000s, then moving on to Apple to work on the A5/A6 designs. AMD were able to re-hire Jim and put a fire in his belly with the phrase: ‘Make a new high-performance x86 CPU’ (not in those exact simple words…. I hope). From left to right: Mark Papermaster (CTO AMD), Dr Lisa Su (CEO AMD), Simon Segars (CEO ARM) and Jim Keller (former AMD, now Tesla) Jim’s goal was to build the team and lay the groundwork for the new microarchitecture, which for the long-term will revolve around AMD Processor Architect Michael (Mike) Clark. Former Intel engineer Sam Naffziger, who was already working with AMD when the Zen team was put together, worked in tandem with the Carrizo and Zen teams on building internal metrics to assist with power as well. Mark Papermaster, CTO, has stated that over 300 dedicated engineers and two million man-hours have been put into Zen since its inception. As mentioned, the goal was to lay down a framework. Jim Keller spent three years at AMD on Zen, before leaving to take a position under Elon Musk at Tesla. When we reported that Jim had left AMD, a number of people in the industry seemed confused: Zen wasn’t due for another year at best, so why had he left? The answers we had from AMD were simple – Jim and others had built the team, and laid the groundwork for Zen. With all the major building blocks in place, and simulations showing good results, all that was needed was fine tuning. Fine tuning is more complex than it sounds: getting caches to behave properly, moving data around the fabric at higher speeds, getting the desired memory and latency performance, getting power under control, working with Microsoft to ensure OS compatibility, and working with the semiconductor fabs (in this case, GlobalFoundries) to improve yields. None of this is typically influenced by the man at the top, so Jim’s job was done. This means that in the past year or so, AMD has been working on that fine tuning. This is why we’ve slowly seen more and more information coming out of AMD regarding microarchitecture and new features as the fine-tuning slots into place. All this culminates in Ryzen, the official name for today’s launch. Along with the new microarchitecture, Zen is the first CPU from AMD to be launched on GlobalFoundries’ 14nm process, which is semi-licenced from Samsung. At a base overview, the process should offer 30% better efficiency over the 28nm HKMG (high-k metal gate) process used at TSMC for previous products. One of the issues facing AMD these past few years has been Intel’s prowess in manufacturing, first at 22nm and then at 14nm - both using iterative FinFET generations. This gave an efficiency and die-size deficit to AMD through no real fault of their own: redesigning older Bulldozer-derived products for a smaller process is both difficult and gives a lot of waste, depending on how the microarchitecture as designed. Moving to GloFo’ 14nm on FinFET, along with a new microarchitecture designed for this specific node, is one stepping stone to playing the game of high-end CPU performance. But returning to high-end CPU performance is difficult. There are two crude ways to measure performance: overall throughput, or per-core throughput. Having a low per-core throughput but using lots and lots of cores to increase overall throughput already has a prime example in graphics cards, which are mainly many small dedicated vector processors in a single chip. For general purpose computing, we see designs such as ThunderX putting 64+ ARM cores in a single chip, or Intel’s own Xeon Phi that has up to 72 x86 cores as a host processor (among others). All of these have relatively low general purpose single-core performance, either due to the fact that they focus on specific workloads, their architecture, or they have to run at super-low frequency to be within a particular power budget. They’re still high-performance, but the true crown lies with a good per-core performance. Per-core is where Intel has been winning, and the latest Skylake/Kaby Lake microarchitecture holds the lead due to the way the core is designed, tuned, and produced on arguably the most competitive manufacturing process node geared towards high performance and efficiency. With the Zen microarchitecture, AMD’s goal was to return to high-end CPU performance, or specifically having a competitive per-core performance again. Trying to compete with high frequency while blowing the power budget, as seen with the FX-9000 series running at 220W, was not going to cut it. The base design had to be efficient, low latency, be able to operate at high frequency, and scale performance with frequency. Typically per-core performance is measured in terms of ‘IPC’, or instructions per clock: a processor that can perform more operations or instructions per Hz or MHz has a higher performance when all other factors are equal. In AMD’s initial announcements on Zen, the goal of a 40% gain in IPC was put into the ecosystem, with no increase in power. It is pertinent to say that there were doubts, and many enthusiasts/analysts were reluctant to claim that AMD had the resources or nous to both increase IPC by 40% and maintain power consumption. In normal circumstances, without a significant paradigm shift in the design philosophy, a 40% gain in efficiency can be a wild goose chase. Then it was realised that AMD were suggesting a +40% gain compared to the best version of Bulldozer, which raised even more question marks. At the formal launch last week, AMD stated that the end goal was achieved with +52% in industry standard benchmarks such as SPEC from Piledriver cores (with an L3 cache) or +64% from Excavator cores (no L3 cache). Moving nearer to the launch, and with more details under our belts, it was clear that AMD were not joking but actually being realistic. Analyzing what we were told about the core design (we weren’t told everything to begin with) would seem to suggest that AMD, through this long-term CPU team and core design plan, have all the blocks in place necessary to do the deed. Aside from getting an actual chip on hand to test, analysts were still concerned about AMD’s ability to execute both on time and sufficiently to make a dent and recreate a highly competitive x86 market. Throughout the lifetime of the Zen concept at AMD, they have seen a couple of corporate restructurings, changes at the high C-level executives, time when the company value dipped below the company asset value, restructuring of manufacturing and wafer deals with GlobalFoundries (which was spun out of AMD before Zen), sale and re-lease of major corporate buildings, and the integration/de-integration of the graphics team within the company. Within all that, Bulldozer didn’t make the impact it needed to, in part due to pre-launch hype and underwhelming results. Sales volumes have been declining (partly due to lower global PC demand), and server-based revenues have dropped to almost nil as we’ve not seen a new Opteron in five years. In short, revenue has been decreasing. AMD’s ability to get their finances under control, and then focus and execute, has been under question. In the past few months, that outlook has changed. The top four executives involved in Zen, Dr. Lisa Su (CEO), Mark Papermaster (CTO), Jim Anderson (CVP Client) and Forrest Norrod (CVP Server), have been stable in the company for a few years, and all four have that air of quiet confidence. It is rather surprising to see three traditional processor engineers at the top of the chain for a CPU launch, rather than a sales or marketing focused executive – typically an engineer releasing a product with a grin on their face is often a good sign. Apart from that, AMD’s semi-custom revenues have increased through securing deals with the leading consoles, the GPU side of the company (Radeon Technology Group, headed under Raja Koduri) successfully executed at 14nm with mainstream parts in 2016, and for that confidence has AMD now trading at over $12/share, just under their 2004/2005 peak. At the minute a large number of individuals and companies are invested in AMD succeeding, both consumers and financials alike, and recent performance on execution has been a positive factor. Since August, AMD has been previewing the Zen microarchitecture in actual pre-production silicon, running Windows and running benchmarks. With the 40%+ gain in IPC constantly being quoted, and now a +52% being presented, most users and interested parties want to know exactly where it sits compared to an equivalent Intel product. Back in August AMD performed a single, almost entirely dismissible, benchmark showing equivalent IPC of Zen with Broadwell-E (read our write up on that here, and reasons why it’s difficult to interpret a single benchmark). AMD had a ‘New Horizons’ (Ho-Ryzen, get it?) event in December and announcements at CES in January showing performance in gaming and encoding, in particular Handbrake. It is worth noting that Intel, as you would expect any competitor, went through each open source project AMD had used an implemented updates to assist dead/bad code (e.g. coalescing read/writes to comply with AMD/Intel design guidelines) or offer improvements (adding in 256-bit vector codes to combine consecutive 128-bit compute*), which is why some of the results from the launch today are different from what AMD has shown. (If anyone thinks this is ‘unfair’, it begs a bigger question as to how IPC is a good measure of performance if the code is IPC limiting itself, which is a topic for another day.) At the Tech Day, AMD went into further detail regarding various internal benchmarks, both CPU and gaming related, showing either near parity or a fair distribution of win/loss metrics, but ultimately giving better price/performance. *In this instance, having 4 x 128-bit vector math usually creates 4 ops. Arranging code to 256-bit can give 2 x 256-bit for two ops, which takes two cycles on Zen per core but only one cycle on Intel’s latest. Recently AMD held a talk at ISSCC (the International Solid State Circuits Conference), which we’ll go into as part of this review, but one thing is worth mentioning here. Along with AMD requiring Zen to have good single thread performance, they also wanted something small. At ISSCC, AMD showed a slide comparing a Zen die shot to a ‘competitor’ (probably Skylake) die area: Here AMD is comparing a four-core part to a four-core part, showing that while AMD’s L2 is bigger, the fin pitch is larger, the metal pitch is larger, and its SRAM cells are larger, the quad core design on 14nm GloFo is smaller than 14nm Intel. This is practically due to the way the Zen cores are designed vs. Intel cores – the simple explanation is that the Intel cores have wider execution ports (such as processing a 256-bit vector in one micro-op rather than two) and, we suspect, a larger area dedicated to pre-fetch logic. There’s also the consideration of dark silicon, to help assist the thermal environment around the logic units, which is undisclosed. I mention this because one of AMD’s goals, aside from the main one of 40%+ IPC, is to have small cores. As a result, as we’ll see in this review, various trade-offs are made. Rather than dedicating a larger die area to execution ports that support AVX in one go, AMD decided to use 2x128-bit vector support (as 1x256) but increase the size of the L2 cache. A larger L2 will ensure fewer cache misses in varied code, perhaps at the expense of high-end compute which can take advantage of larger vectors. The larger L2 will help with single thread performance (all other factors being equal), and AMD knows that Intel’s cache is high performance, so we will see other trade-offs like this in the design. This is obviously combined with AMD’s recent work on having high-density libraries for cache and compute. AMD has already set out a roadmap for different markets with products based on the Zen microarchitecture. Today’s launch is the first product line, namely desktop-class processors under the Ryzen 7 family name. Following Ryzen 7 will be Ryzen 5 (Q2) and Ryzen 3 (2H17) for the desktop. There is also AMD’s new server platform, Naples, featuring up to 32 cores on a single CPU (we’ll discuss Naples later in the review). We expect Naples to be in the Q2/Q3 timeframe. In the second half of this year (Q3/Q4), AMD is planning to launch mobile processors based on Zen, called Raven Ridge. This processor line-up will most likely be with integrated graphics, and it will be interesting to see how well the microarchitecture scales down into low power. As Ryzen CPUs are geared towards a more performance focused audience, and the fact that they lack integrated graphics, AMD will also maintain its line of ‘Bristol Ridge’ platform (Excavator based processors that also support the 300-series socket). The goal of Bristol Ridge is to fill in at the low end, or for systems that want the option of discrete graphics. Given what we’ve seen in benchmarks, despite recent statements from AMD to the contrary, the FX-line of AM3+ CPUs seems to be coming to an end. For users looking to go buy parts today, here’s the pertinent information you need to know. The Ryzen CPUs will form part of the ‘Summit Ridge’ platform – ‘Summit Ridge’ indicates a Ryzen CPU with a 300-series chipset (X370, B350, A320). Both Bristol Ridge and Summit Ridge, and thus Ryzen, mean that AMD makes the jump to a desktop platform that supports DDR4 and a high-end desktop platform that supports PCIe 3.0 natively. These CPUs use the AM4 socket on the 300-series motherboards, which is not compatible with any of AMD’s previous socket designs, and also has slightly different socket hole distances for CPU coolers that don’t use AMD’s latch mechanism. Despite the socket hole size change, AMD has kept the latch mechanism in the same place, but coolers that have their own backplates will need new supporting plates to be able to be used (we’ve got a bit on this later in the review as well).

Intel needs massive price cuts on their 2011-v3 chips. Well done AMD, best price/performance CPUs on the market and as fast or faster than Intel performance. Reply sans - Thursday, March 02, 2017 - link Hey, what you have found which features improving on AMD's crap has been found in Intel's products for years. Reply Nem35 - Thursday, March 02, 2017 - link Yeah, and it's beating the Intel. Funny, right? Reply Sweeprshill - Thursday, March 02, 2017 - link Yeah these new AMD chips are monsters. Wondering how large the price cuts are that Intel will bring to their 2011-v3 chips to compete. Reply czerro - Friday, March 03, 2017 - link Intel already slashed prices pretty drastically 4 days ago, to kinda deflate Ryzen's release. Before price cuts, Ryzen had a huge price and performance advantage at all metrics, and Intel would have looked ridiculous. I can't believe people aren't reporting the price-cutting right before Ryzen release more. Intel only did it to save face on graphs and confuse people. Ryzen definitely had Intel by the balls a week ago before the price cuts. It's great that we all have options now, but this really smeared Ryzen's release in a cheap way that anybody can point out all those Intel chips were 100-200 dollars more expensive less than a WEEK ago. Reply SodaAnt - Saturday, March 04, 2017 - link No, Intel hasn't slashed prices. There was a sale at microcenter a few days back, but there's no across the board official price cut on Intel chips. Reply Notmyusualid - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link @ SodaAnt Agreed, I see no Intel price drops either. Reply Notmyusualid - Friday, March 03, 2017 - link @ Nem35 Incomplete review. After seeing a gaming-focused review, I'd say the AMD procs are just OK. I welcome AMD is back with a fighting chance, but about half my purchase choice will be game-inspired. Quote: "For gaming, it’s a hard pass. We absolutely do not recommend the 1800X for gaming-focused users or builds, given i5-level performance at two times the price." I'm not a 'fanboi', as I'd have no trouble fitting a 1700X in a build I wouldn't game in. But otherwise, like another reviewer said, its a hard pass. Reply Alexvrb - Saturday, March 04, 2017 - link For gaming builds the upcoming Ryzen 5 and 3 series will offer a lot more bang for your buck and will compete much more aggressively. However, the Ryzen 7 still offers decent gaming performance and excellent performance everywhere else. The gobs of cores may come in handy in the future too, even in games - as more threads will be available on more rigs, devs will take notice. This year AMD is definitely lowering the pricing for 8-16 thread processors, clearing a path for the future of gaming. With that being said I still think that when strictly considering gaming, their Ryzen 3/5 quadcore models will be a far better value, especially as current-gen games aren't often built in such a way that they can take advantage of the Ryzen 7.

The success of these products is critical to AMD, which hasn’t had a competitive high-performance CPU to offer in nearly a decade. AMD is the only company - other than Intel of course - capable of designing and producing x86 computer processors, partly because of the sheer scope and scale of the engineering involved, and partly because of its complicated history of cross-licensing the required technology with Intel. Gadgets 360 was present at an international gathering of the tech media in San Francisco last week to hear all about the Ryzen architecture and platform directly from AMD’s top management. Here’s a deep dive into all the information that was disclosed, plus everything you should know about the new motherboards, chipsets and coolers before you rush to the market. Also check out our detailed review of the Ryzen 7 1800X along with the MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium motherboard, including test scores and usage notes. The Zen architecture is brand new, not an iterative improvement upon the previous Bulldozer and Excavator designs which have underpinned AMD’s CPUs and APUs for the past decade or so. Zen is a single design which can scale across chips for everything from thin fanless notebooks to high-powered workstations and servers. AMD is particularly proud of this, saying that performance scales in an almost perfectly linear fashion. While products for different segments will roll out through the year, AMD is kicking it off with three high-performance desktop CPUs, named Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700. There will eventually be Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 CPU lines as well, mirroring Intel’s Core i7, i5 and i3 positioning. All three Ryzen 7 CPUs have eight physical cores and can run 16 threads, using a technique called Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), much the same as Intel’s Hyper-Threading. AMD thinks that developers, especially game developers, are really starting to embrace the power of multiple cores thanks to Vulkan, DirectX 12, and the fact that they target development for game consoles which now have multi-core CPUs.   The Ryzen 7 1800X is clocked at 3.6GHz and can go up to 4.0GHz on all cores when needed. The Ryzen 7 1700X runs between 3.4 and 3.8GHz, while the Ryzen 7 1700 can scale from 3.0 to 3.7GHz. However, one of Ryzen’s best features is that speed isn’t hard-capped at the upper ends of those ranges.The CPU can decide for itself that there is enough headroom within its TDP envelope to push the clock speed even further on demand. AMD calls this XFR, or eXtended Frequency Range, and says it only makes sense to take advantage of the beefy air coolers or liquid solutions that enthusiasts often employ. XFR is completely transparent to users and will be disabled if you do any manual overclocking – speaking of which, every Ryzen CPU is multiplier unlocked. Ryzen CPU models with an X suffix both have 95W rated TDPs and a much wider XFR range. While the R7 1700 still does support XFR, its lower 65W TDP doesn’t allow for much headroom. “X” models don’t ship with a cooler – AMD believes that enthusiasts will want liquid cooling or something exotic, or will be choosing their cooling solution based on aesthetics.  The Ryzen 7 1700 will sell with a quiet cooler called the Wraith Spire, which as a neat RGB LED ring in keeping with today’s trends. AMD has also designed a beefier Wraith Max cooler which will work with the 95W models (and also has the RGB LED ring), but there are no current plans to sell it in the retail market. It exists so that OEMs and system integrators have a reference, and will probably ship with pre-built systems. There’s also plenty going on at the chip architecture level. Zen is an all-new design; created from scratch. AMD claims a 52 percent increase in instructions per clock compared to the previous Excavator architecture on which recent AMD CPUs have been based, and a 270 percent improvement in performance per Watt. That’s a result of multiple factors: the architecture itself, the 14nm finFET manufacturing process, the sensors that allow power to be regulated, and overall design improvements that reduce overheads. Ryzen CPUs have a feature called Precision Boost which refers to their ability to clock up and down in increments of 25MHz rather than the usual 100MHz. This means that control over power and performance is much more fine-grained, and switching between states is quicker. AMD describes Ryzen as the first “smart” processor because it can inspect workloads and adjust itself in real-time to respond to them.  The controversial "module" design of previous architectures, which shared a single floating-point unit between two cores and caused bottlenecks in some situations, has been discarded. Instead, Ryzen CPUs are divided into "complexes" of four cores, each with its own L2 cache and a "slice" of a shared 8MB L3 cache pool. All cores can access each other’s cache slices at high speed. Each core’s power consumption can be tweaked independently, and the L3 cache voltage can also be adjusted depending on feedback from the embedded sensors. Octa-core Ryzen 7 CPUs feature two such complexes, which communicate over a high-speed interconnect called Infinity Fabric. Other Zen CPUs might have different numbers of complexes, with individual cores within them enabled or disabled.   Efficiency is improved by making sure that a CPU can predict which bits of data and which instructions need to be available for processing, and in what order. AMD says it has employed artificial intelligence learning algorithms to pre-emptively fills lower-level caches with what’s going to be needed, optimises multi-threading to fill processing capacity, and greatly reduces misfires and wasted cycles. These details apply to the Zen architecture overall, so it will be interesting to see how things play out for AMD across the spectrum from ultraportable laptops to datacentre servers. The Socket AM4 platform With this new generation of CPU comes a new platform, called AM4, and new controllers (also known as chipsets). This generation’s top-of-the-line platform is called X370, and below it are the B350 and A320  - names that cheekily suggest they’re one step better than Intel’s current x2xx platforms. Because of the amount of time that has passed since AMD’s AM3 platform was modern, AM4’s features seem like a massive jump. There’s PCIe 3.0, USB 3.1 Gen 2 with support for the Type-C connector, NVMe, and more. There are two possibly confusing things about AM4 to note. First, it is designed to work not only with Ryzen CPUs, but also APUs, including the ‘Bristol Ridge’ range released last year. For this reason, a motherboard might have physical video outputs, but you can’t use them with Ryzen CPUs which lack integrated graphics.  Secondly, Ryzen CPUs feature a limited amount of integrated IO and can function without a chipset – i.e. as Systems on a Chip (SoCs). There will soon be motherboards labelled X300, B300 and A300, which will be smaller and lower cost, and will probably show up in OEM systems. These pseudo-chipsets only handle hardware security and booting, leaving the rest to the Ryzen CPU. PCs that use them will have somewhat limited features, such as a lack of USB 3.1 Gen 2, even with the same CPUs. However, the four PCIe lanes used to link the CPU to a traditional chipset become free for other uses, such as onboard Wi-Fi and storage.  While new chipsets should accompany new processors over the next few years, AMD doesn’t expect its physical socket to change till around 2020 when PCIe 4.0 and DDR5 RAM should begin to appear, so expect a wide range of compatibility questions.     Only the X370 can support multiple Nvidia graphics cards, though that’s now a high-end niche feature that no one will really miss. AMD CrossFire works on the X370 and B350. Interestingly, the low-end A320 loses overclocking support even though all Ryzen CPUs are unlocked, for the sole reason that low-cost motherboards often can’t handle high voltages well enough, and the experience is generally poor. Mainstream users should find that the B350 offers the best balance of cost and features. Availability, pricing, and strategy While Intel focuses its strengths on the ultra-portable notebook market and 2-in-1s, AMD has very deliberately chosen to start the Ryzen rollout with high-end desktop CPUs. According to the company, this segment is growing, and gamers and content creators are a huge overlapping market. The Ryzen rollout will progress rapidly through 2017, and Ryzen 7 allows it to get its CPUs right before mixing in the Vega graphics architecture with APUs for desktops and laptops later this year.  The Ryzen 7 1800X is officially priced at Rs. 37,999 in India, undercutting Intel's Core i7-6900K by a huge margin. The Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700 cost Rs. 29,499 and Rs. 24,499 respectively, and compete with the Intel Core i7-6800K and Core i7-7700K respectively, which are priced more closely.  AMD knows very well that its CPUs have a historical reputation of running hot, and that Ryzen marketing will have to take care of that, especially in India. The Wraith series coolers are designed to combat this very perception. Also for India, AMD wants to target content creators in the film, visual effects and 3D modelling industries and so it will be pushing Ryzen CPUs on the basis of their multiple cores and how cool and quiet they run.   All three Ryzen 7 CPUs as well as a raft of motherboards from Asus, Gigabyte and MSI are already available in India.

View All Pages The wait is finally over for what seems to be one of the most eagerly-anticipated pieces of computer hardware in recent history. Four years in the making and over 2 million engineering hours put into bringing it to life, AMD’s Zen is finally here. Leading the pack for AMD’s new Zen-based processors are three eight-core, sixteen-thread Ryzen 7 SKUs. Fabbed on Global Foundries’ 14nm FinFET process and sporting a transistor count of 4.8 Billion, the new AM4-based chips are targeting prosumers who would have otherwise been tempted onto Intel’s High-End Desktop (HEDT) platform. With pricing starting at $329 (around £320), we can now finally say that CPUs with eight high-performance cores have hit a level that will be considered affordable to many, rather than a select few. First in line for review is the flagship Ryzen 7 1800X – an 8C16T, 95W TDP chip with a base clock of 3.6GHz, boost clock up to 4.0GHz, and a 4.1GHz Extended Frequency Range (XFR). “I’m still happy with my *insert Sandy Bridge or Haswell-based CPU model name here* quad-core processor” is perhaps the most common quote that I read any and every time we publish a new CPU-related article. Sandy Bridge was legendary, AMD’s Piledriver couldn’t compete in many respects, and Haswell offered a well-timed upgrade path. With Intel’s mainstream processors, that sell by the truck load to enthusiast PC builders, still limited to four physical cores, many people simply do not see the need to upgrade their ageing piece of silicon. Add in the ~£400 buy price for Intel’s cheapest more-than-four-core enthusiast CPU and it’s easy to see why so many people are holding on so tightly to their ‘good enough’ processor and investing that upgrade budget elsewhere. Of course that’s not the entire picture, as many prosumers have already jumped to higher core count chips in order to improve productivity. It is, however, a fair even if somewhat crude depiction of the current mainstream, affordable CPU market. You want more than four cores from Intel? Be prepared to pay up. An eight-core Broadwell-E chip tick the right boxes for you? Don’t expect any change out of a four-figure payment. AMD is aiming to change that with Ryzen 7. Eight cores, sixteen threads thanks to Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), and retail pricing spanning $329-499 (around £320-490) are some of Ryzen 7’s notable head-turning points. You could quite comfortably add a high-performance graphics card or a decent 4K monitor to your shopping list simply by re-allocating the Ryzen 7 cost differential against Intel’s 8-core HEDT offering. That six-core 6800K you were planning on dropping £400+ on; it now goes up against an 8C16T Ryzen 7 chip that is punching close to a 4GHz clock speed. On the face of it, AMD is set to give the consumer processor market a significant shake-up with the introduction of its Zen-based 8C16T Ryzen 7 offerings. We got our first look at Ryzen in-the-silicon last week at AMD’s Ryzen Tech Day in San Francisco. The headline features, such as a 52% IPC increase versus Excavator and an 8C16T chip with a 95W TDP, had a large proportion of the technical press surprised. When the slides showing computational performance against Intel’s $1000 8C16T LGA 2011-3 Core i7 were shown, the reaction changed from surprised to one that was bordering speechless. In Ryzen 7, AMD is bringing more-than-four-core CPUs to a price point that is as low as a third of the purchase fee for Intel’s comparable octa-core options. And the Austin-based chip vendor is doing so while reducing the TDP below triple figures to 95W – a 32% reduction compared to Intel’s 6-, 8-, and 10-core consumer LGA 2011-3 offerings. This is not the first time that we have seen affordable eight-core ‘enthusiast’ CPUs – AMD released Bulldozer over 5 years ago, though we’ll not get into the debate of exactly what determines a core. It is, however, an interesting change to the processor landscape to be faced with the prospect of a true 8-core CPU that doesn’t have a four-figure dollar price and is being touted as offering performance that lives up to its core count.

Is this too good to be true? Cheong Kian Kok Intel is dead. racistmalaysian AMD is back. Gonna grab 1700 with R9 Nano. Greg Bryett Interesting, although i admit to being disappointed with performance in the gaming arena. No faster than my overclocked 4790K. I’ll wait this one out for now or until Intel brings Kaby Lake priced down. the 7700K or 6800K may be a better buy with a price reduction… Jason Kane It’s a very mediocre gaming chip, I’d be better off just moving up to a 4790K from my current 4690K on my Z97 rig rather going to all the hassle & expense of installing new CPU, Mobo & RAM. Ariel Jersey Jr. Damn… The Gaming performance is disappointing. :'( Ephraim Ugarte I’m kind of disappointed with its gaming performance. mazty Something just doesn’t seem right here. How can a chip score so well in benchmarks (both single and multi-core) and then do rather poorly in gaming performance? Is this an issue to do with the quality of how the games are programmed? Marcos Voy looks to me like a optimisation issue, Ryzen wasn’t out when those games were launched, also, the platform is very young etc, so looks to be something that will solve itself with updates to BIOS, drivers and windows, still don’t expect to see 1800x beating 7700k it will just more closely compete with the x99 6900k, 6950x etc. lower-end ryzen SKUs may have better single core performance with higher frequency (that’s a guess) translating into better gaming performance. I mean DX12 should scale better with higher core counts shouldn’t it? but Ryzen looks to be doing even worse at DX12, that’s the main reason that I think there’s a lack of optimisation, not horsepower. Gary Jones You are indeed, a kok. AngryGoldfish From the wide array of tests I’ve seen in the last hour I wouldn’t recommend the 1800X for 1080p gamers unless they’re streaming or performing other CPU-intensive tasks. The 1800X is clearly perfectly competitive at 4k as you’re more GPU-bound, but at 1080p I think the 7700K is going to be better value for money, which is not something I thought I’d ever say about Intel. Intel have been on the top for too long. If game developers had had Ryzen for the last two-three years then AMD might be more competitive, but sadly they do fall behind in these gaming tests. Maybe the lower core models will be better options for gamers as theoretically the clock frequencies could be higher. Jason Kane All those games will have been compiled using the Intel tool set, which will naturally favour Intel CPU’s. Because AMD simply have not been competitive for the last few years in the CPU market, all the game development studios will be using Intel’s compilers, so it will hurt AMD gaming performance. At least that’s what I suspect is going on. mazty That does sound about right because regardless of what benchmarks are used, across the board it hammers most CPUs, so to say that then translates into lower performance for games like Witcher 3 and GTA V does seem to be more of an optimisation issue than crap architecture. Malcolm Galloway Agreed.. 4790K + GTX 1070, I’m good for now. Malcolm Galloway Agreed. 100%.. mark lois But i’m sure AMD will beat Intel XD now is that AMD 1 step a head… 😀 Tyrann Can you do some gaming benchmarks while doing other background tasks like streaming. I wanna see how well it does for my next streaming build. Logic First LOL of course this is right, why do you think AMD didn’t let anyone release reviews until the chip was actually shipping? chieftain20 Fucking called it. AMD is on par with i7 cores of roughly same price range. Lacking in gaming power, but with great encoding points. Thanks, but no thanks. My $210 (USD) i5 6500 is well within tolerances of price per performance. AMD didn’t fail to let my mediocre expectations down. Maybe the next iteration of Ryzen 7 chips might be interesting to look at. For now, I’d still rather go with Intel if this is all that AMD’s top of the line can offer. 6/10 would definitely buy a 7700k before the 1800X. Maurice Fortin very early on for it to be fully optimized by their development team, but even as is not at all optimized compared to now old to very old highly optimized Intel flagship chips, I still think Ryzen is outstanding, need more reviews from many sites to make a valid opinion as everyone does testing differently for many reasons claiming it can only push around 60FPS in some of the listed games while others are reporting same games pushing north of 90-120. TitanX though powerful might be inducing some AMD hateon 😛 anyways we shall see how the landscape changes in a few weeks/months once things have been polished and AMD various partners have had a chance to tune and optimize as well as the other variants come around. For AMD to even be within spitting distance with Ryzen of flagship or even midrange Intel dominated space speaks volumes of Ryzen being very well engineered, compared to previous offerings many years now that were at best another choice rather then truly competing with 🙂 Luke This is something I want to look into though I’ll openly admit that I am not a game streamer and am therefore not proficient with operating (never mind testing with) OBS and the likes. If you have suggestions for the sort of gaming+streaming tests you’d like to see, please get in touch using the contact form (http://www.kitguru.net/contact/) and we can discuss some test procedures via email :). Luke the_refillable DX12 benefits AMD graphics but hinders AMD CPUs? For the purpose of “shifting the load to the GPU” and “distributing load into many threads” it seems that DX12 failed here, miserably. Absurd stuff that seems to have gone unnoticed. I’m glad you didn’t neglect this issue like other reviewers (sadly some of them are big-name). Josh You dont’ need 4K. All it takes is 1440P and the gaming performance gap closes to non existent in most games. Look at at the Guru3D review. All these reviews only showing 1080P with titan Xs are doing Ryzen a HGUE disservice. No one plays games like that unless they are playing competitive CSGO or something. For the VAST VAST majority Ryzen will offer the same gaming perforce as intel for practical puposes. Matthew Elvidge Only 4.1GHz at 1.44v damn, thats gonna suck for games that require that singlecore speed. My 7700K at 4GHz takes 1.03v by stock and runs great at -0.1v offset, resulting in 0.93v at 4GHz, and much much cooler. These chips are great powerhouses but will suffer from that dreaded issue of single threaded performance for games that dont support multi threading. Half tempted to switch… almost… maybe a few years down the line when my 5.3Ghz 7700K starts to struggle… if it ever struggles. mazty Learn to read – I wasn’t saying the results are a lie, but how it’s very bizarre that benchmarks put the 1800X at the top, whereas for games it’s at the bottom. It only makes sense if the games have been created focusing solely on Intel architecture. Logic First Most games are ports from consoles, PS4 and Xbone run AMD hardware, so the guy’s assertion above that they are optimized for Intel is completely false. mazty So you recon the PC ports aren’t optimised for Intel? They’re just “ported”? Stick to KFC m8, outta ur depth here. Marcos Voy man, if it was a simple matter of bringing the game code to the PC don’t you think there would be simulators for the PS3, 4 and Xbox 360, one? That’s not this simple, the game IS INDEED optimised to run in PC otherwise the port would just be BAD remember that last Batman game? That game wasn’t optimised for PC that’s why it launched so badly on PC. Also, again we have lots of things not yet optimised for ryzen, if you read other reviews like gamer nexus’s reviews you’ll see that turning SMT off gives a rather considerable performance increase (same thing happened when intel introduced hyper-treading) which means a future windows/BIOS update will remove this bottleneck and free that performance for us even with SMT ON plus other tweaks that certainly will come our way. Guru3D benchmarks are also interesting since they’ve tested 1440p as well goldenboy77 more amd hype another faliure games are 20 to 30% slower this is not good Xtreme AMD explains why Ryzen doesn’t seem to keep up in 1080p gaming http://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/matthew-wilson/amd-explains-why-ryzen-doesnt-seem-to-keep-up-in-1080p-gaming/ sassafras15 If AMD chips are exactly the same as Intel’s then I don’t see any fault in your statement. But the fact of the matter is, they are different. They may have similarities thanks to the cross licensing agreement but they’re both different architectures and will run differently from the other. sassafras15 they do have a point though. 1080p is like the minimum resolution people play at now. nonetheless, it’ll get fixed soon enough. Logic First LOL I’m the one out of my depth? You’re the one that didn’t see this coming and you’re surprised grasping at straws as to why this CPU sucks. Just look at AMD’s history. Bulldozer optimized for integer and binary calcs and used clustered multi threading and got crushed on floating point, Excavator tried to fix that problem by using SMT instead of clustered multi threading but still failed miserably. Now we have a new CPU that guess what? Sucks at multi threading. Shocker that it works better with SMT disabled. LOL. You salty AMD fanboys are just hilarious. Hope you enjoy cinebench! sassafras15 or maybe like, do encoding while gaming? just so we could see how it would perform under that kind of load. in the Ryzen official launch, they had a demo called “Megatasking” or something like that where they would run multiple benchmarks at a time. though they’re all productivity benchmarks, we’d like to see some with gaming. Zoltán Kemény it seems to me on 1080p there is something issue maybe it can corrected with some software update. in 2560×1440 resolution everything is alright. mazty Lol magic port button. Doesn’t exist. Go back to Wendy’s bruh. Josh Yes but they don’t do it with a 1080 or Titan liek the reviewers are using. They do it with 1060s,1050s,460s,470s,and 480s which again will make a GPU bottle neck. In any realistic use case for 99% of people it will be the GPU deciding the FPS not the CPU. Logic First Someone is butt hurt because they don’t know wtf I just said mazty Says the burger flipper who thinks there’s a magic port button. Salty logic bruh. Logic First LOL, you’re just salty AMD couldn’t come out with a decent CPU and your mom can only afford a Ryzen 1700 which is garbage. Good luck with your “optimizations” just like bulldozer right? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Tyrann AMD said they’re working on Windows drivers that they hope to be released next month. It is said to improve gaming performance specifically. Yorgos The Nano is so sexy. Yorgos Facepalm. karappo I’ll probably wait a month or two before making my own assessment. By then, the hype surrounding Ryzen would have subsided. What I’m more interested to see is a compatibility test for Ryzen on Windows 7 seeing AMD isn’t keen on supporting it. Hoping for slim chance that Kitguru will do one soon. Tyrann The link gave me error 404 🙁 I would suggest doing a live stream using twitch of a game like For Honor or Battlefield 1 at 1080p/1440p. Do the same for Intel’s i5 and i7 kabylakes and then of course throw in a broadwell-E. We may also need to see dual screen setup of playing an HD youtube vid with 2-3 tabs for like tech sites on one screen while doing gaming/streaming on the second. Also try to clock all cpu’s to something like 4Ghz so we can see clock for clock performance along with stock clock comparisons. Thanks! BaronMatrix This is one of the better reviews I’ve seen… But all DO point to an optimization issue with AMDs SMT implementation… Some games show higher perf without SMT turned on… But I will give up a few fps for the scientific and compiling level of work… I guess we’d need to see execution traces to tell where it’s bottlenecking… But it SEEMS like they are trying to load the second thread and it takes too long to return… I watched a video of gaming which showed thread number two barely getting any work… BaronMatrix As close as it is and the way it performs at 4K, once they get the threading model right in game engines it may get another 10-20% of perf… This review makes it clear that there is plenty of CPU % left on the table… cromicacid solution: Offer the R7 1850x, clock it at 4ghz, and sell it at $375. Boom Hossein Almet Sorry, my 6800K, 4.1 GHz @1.199 V, 100% stable, how much voltage the destroyer 1800X has @ 4.1 GHz? Heat and power consumption do count, mind you. Najeeb Shah lol pethetic! 4.1 max over clock? while you can get a skylake that is much cheaper now and go all the way to 4.5ghz easy Allan http://www.kitguru.net/contact/ code_break When I noticed that EVERY review site only listed 1080p I thought to myself something was WRONG here. There is certainly something going on here most likely and I am glad other people are seeing it too. I think Intel is playing dirty games with enthusiast data and offering incentives for unfavorable / mis-leading reviews. It is just a little too convenient that all the sites list only 1080p… Allan We know a ton of people using high refresh monitors, we have reviewed plenty of 120hz and 144hz panels,- so those ultra high frame rates are important to get the most from those screens. 1080p is still the most popular resolution in our polls. We even have a new 240hz panel from asus in our labs to test! We also showed 4k resolution which is a good indication of gpu limiting. Its not like we downscored the processor for the 1080p gaming results – it won our highest award as we think this will improve over time. There is simply not enough time before these reviews to run muliple games at every resolution on many gpus. simply leaving out 1080p testing with a powerful gpu would be sloppy work for any professional review site, we are here to find problems with any product and report on them, not hide them behind limiting situations. Amd have even answered the issue publicly. http://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/matthew-wilson/amd-explains-why-ryzen-doesnt-seem-to-keep-up-in-1080p-gaming/ Luke 1080p is still by far the most popular resolution for PC gamers: (http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=pc). Granted it is unlikely that people using such high-end hardware will be gaming at 1080p but they can be using any number of resolutions – 1080 ultrawide, 1440p, 2560×1600, 1440 ultrawide, 4K UHD, 5K, triple screen. We simply cannot test all of those eventualities so sticking to the ‘industry standard’ 1080p resolution makes sense, while also adding in 4K to show performance in a GPU-limited gaming scenario. The reason a Titan XP is used is because testing hardware is all about eliminating bottlenecks. We could have used an RX 480, or any other GPU from our stack, but that doesn’t do any good because the GPU will be limited before CPU limitations come into play. The Titan XP and fast RAM put the performance onus solely on the CPU so that we can observe its performance and analyse it. That’s what our testing allowed us to do and, as written in the review, if you don’t want to game at high refresh rates above 60FPS, Ryzen is a perfectly capable CPU. If you game at a resolution, or with a GPU, where you can’t even get anywhere close to more than 100FPS, Ryzen is a perfectly capable CPU. If you game at 120FPS+ high refresh rates, Ryzen can start to show some issues against Intel’s competitors. 1080P allows us to show that as GPU power is in such excess at the resolution and it’s down to the CPU to keep pace. This logic is the same across other resolutions if it is only enhanced GPU power required to operate at those higher resolutions (not like some open-world games where a higher resolution means more on-screen action and possibly more NPC or background physics calculations). As we showed with 4K, Ryzen will keep pace in GPU-limited scenarios. That point scales – if your gaming resolution is highly GPU-limited and less than 100FPS, Ryzen looks good. If you GPU isn’t as fast as a Titan XP and you cannot get anywhere near 100FPS+, Ryzen looks good. 1440P strikes a middle ground between 1080P and 4K, but it won’t be entirely GPU-limited if you are pushing past 100FPS in some games. I use a 3440×1440 100Hz monitor myself and therefore made interpretations as to Ryzen’s performance for my own gaming PC. The 1080P result for GTA V (my favourite game) showed Ryzen hitting less than 100FPS average. At 1440P there will be higher GPU load which will reduce the performance difference between CPUs but what if you simply want to throw more GPU power at your gaming PC (not unreasonable when spending £1k on a high-end gaming monitor)? You are still going to be limited by the pace set by the Ryzen CPU in that case. If I want to play GTA V at 100Hz, the 1080P test data in this review showed that Ryzen is going to struggle more than some modern Intel competitors, even if I add more GPU power. I want to do some more gaming-focussed testing over the coming weeks/months with Ryzen so that I can test more of these scenarios that gamers are curious about (1440P, more 4K, less GPU power, more GPU power through XFire/SLI, etc.). As it stands, this review contains more than four months worth of gathered, validated, and re-validated test data so adding 1440P resolution (as well as 4K which I specifically added for this review) would have simply been impossible in the given timescale. TL;DR – thanks for the feedback. 1080p and a fast GPU are used to eliminate system and GPU-induced bottlenecks and put the performance onus on the CPU, not anything else. As we wrote in the review, Ryzen is a good gaming CPU is you stick to 60FPS. If, however, you want ultra-high refresh rates (whether at 1080p or 1440p with more GPU power), Ryzen does show performance differences against some modern Intel chips. This may, however, change with AMD’s suggestion of patches and optimisations: http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitguru.net%2Fcomponents%2Fcpu%2Fmatthew-wilson%2Famd-explains-why-ryzen-doesnt-seem-to-keep-up-in-1080p-gaming%2F%3A6KEii0Xu6xlH6zRzAf1Hzn5zThM&cuid=3103389 Luke Look at the Steam survey data. That’s why 1080P is used. 4K data was added specifically for this review (which was very tough to do in the given time frame) to show the point of Ryzen keeping pace when you have GPU-limited performance. I have been working on nothing but gathering test and comparison data for this Ryzen review for more than four weeks. Adding 1440P performance with all of the comparison data would have not been possible in the allocated time. It can, however, be interpreted from the 1080P and 4K performance data. If your 1440P monitor is 60Hz, Ryzen will be fine and your gaming performance will primarily be driven by the GPU. If your 1440P is ~100Hz and you have sufficient GPU horsepower to drive that refresh rate, Ryzen will largely be fine though some games like GTA V may still show minor performance differences to modern i7 CPUs. If your 1440P monitor is 120Hz and you have sufficient GPU horsepower to drive that refresh rate, Ryzen will be largely fine in the games we tested but some may show performance disadvantages against some Intel competitors (GTA V, ROTTR, Total War: Warhammer). If your 1440P monitor is 144Hz+ and you have sufficient GPU horsepower to drive that refresh rate, Ryzen will be fine in some games and will struggle against Intel in some others (add Gears of War 4 to that previous list). This can be interpreted from the 1080P performance where GPU horsepower is in excess and the focus is being put on the CPU performance. At 1440P, of course frame rates will be reduced due to higher GPU load, but what if you simply add another graphics card to once again put GPU power in excess? Then a similar pattern as the 1080P performance results will be shown, showing Ryzen to generally be perfectly good up until around 120Hz. Nothing to do with Intel (seriously, how did Intel enter the conversation? We haven’t spoken to Intel or their PR agency since late 2016 and that was only to decline our i7-7700K sample from them. We haven’t worked with them since the i7-6950X launch in May 2016). There’s no need to try to look for tin-foil hat stories. I don’t care whether AMD is faster or whether Intel is faster. I simply want to find out who is faster in which scenarios and present those facts. Luke Great suggestions, thanks. I will try to look into these kinds of tests and usage scenarios and address them with some performance numbers for Ryzen vs Kaby Lake vs Intel HEDT in the future. There will be A LOT of data to gather with your suggestions but they are very good, so thanks for that and I’ll try my best to work with them. Obviously with standard benchmark testing we try to minimise background tasks etc. in order to get accurate results for the test in question. However, we also understand that this isn’t how most people play games in reality hence why I tried to add comments relating to spare CPU cycles and how they will be useful, when analysing the gaming performance data in this review. Luke Thanks for the suggestion. The AMD Megatasking demo was Blender rendering, plus Handbrake video conversion, plus Octane web browsing at the same time. That was a good test scenario for showing multi-core advantages. Perhaps not realistic that people will be doing all that while gaming but I guess it’s also not unreasonable that you may fire up a game while waiting for Handbrake to convert the Bluray you are ripping onto your home media server or while your cool design is being rendered at high resolution. As with the above suggestions, I’ll look into these usage scenarios over the coming weeks and try to get some test data for them. Thanks. Luke Voltages used for AMD chips aren’t really comparable with those used for Intel CPUs. For example, the 6950X at 1.275V (or 5960X at 1.30V) draws more power than Ryzen 7 1800X at 1.44V loaded. Heat (thermal energy) is tied more closely to power consumption than temperatures (which are a factor of material properties used in the design of the heat exchange system). High power consumption will mean more heat (thermal energy) being pumped into your room. Hossein Almet Well, according to Tom Logan at OC3D, the 1800X OC consumes 108 w more than the the 6850K OC. By my book, It’s way too much. mazty Seen the news or too busy being salty as f? CUZ UR WRONG AH M8 WELL WRONG! #Saltynwrong John According to Tom Logan? You are not seriously using that guy as a yardstick for anything with any kind of credibility are you? Last time I read his site he was on his soap box about some brand being terrible – probably related to the fact they don’t advertise with him. If it was called the ASUS Ryzen 1800X it would have gotten top marks. I skimmed his Ryzen review and to even compare it to some of the better ones, including Anandtech and KitGuru is a joke. His power figures look completely off based on people I trust, but its not a shock – he is too busy building his personality on youtube and facebook to actually test things properly. John I think its a great looking CPU, gaming performance is a bit off, but its still playable for me based on whats ive read – I wanted a new X99 system, but I hated paying £1000 for the CPU which has held me back so long. Just ordered the 1800X for £480 and I have to say im really excited. Dont know about you, but playing games is just a part of my day. John Jesus, another idiot with conspiracy theories who doesn’t even read the review properly. Once I saw ‘ONLY 1080p’ I had to hit my head on the wall. Comments from people on being paid by Intel when there is actually 4K testing in this review makes me smile. Doh. John Josh – if I saw KitGuru testing this CPU at 1080p with a 460 graphics card I wouldn’t be here – because I want a review of the CPU, not a video card – it is after all a Ryzen review, not a graphics card review, right?. You want a CPU review but its actually not really a CPU review but its more ‘a CPU review being held back by the GPU’? yeah, thats idiotic. beyond idiotic. Always best to get a grip of what you are talking about in public before you attack others with retarded comments showing that you really are struggling to even figure out how this all works. ‘KitGuru you suck, you actually tested the CPU properly without GPU limiting and other factors influencing the actual results for the CPU. Me and my buddies think Intel are paying you. How much did Intel pay you to give The Ryzen 1800X your highest gold award? £50,000?’ John I dont think it was ever designed as a £500 ‘gaming processor’ Just like the 5960X and 6950X were never £1,000 and £1,500 processors designed to just play games. The 1800X is clearly targeting the X99 platform, and with a processor half the price of the 5960X and outperforming it, seems they did a good job. Hell it even keeps up with the 6950x which is more than THREE times the price. Can’t believe so many people are missing the point! John Did you read the results? A Core i7 Skylake processor has half the cores and a fraction of the performance OUTSIDE gaming – look at the 7700K v the 1800x in anything apart from games. If ALL you do is game the 1800X is not for you, and I doubt someone who doesn’t understand the architecture, or even the greater review details in any way would spend £500 on a 1800X so move on and stop trolling. An i3 is all you deserve. Muppet. Hossein Almet What about Guru3D that shows @ 4.1 GHz, the 1800X ‘s voltage is 1.526 V. Anyway, my original comment stands. And I’d rather believe Tom Logan than the users’ comments. Mind you, Tom Logan has full praise for the 1800X. Matthew Elvidge Nano is very sexy John No your original comment doesn’t stand. you only think it does because you are a Tom Logan fanboy – using 1.526V!! (thats dangerous based on what I have read!) Trust me, if it was ASUS and not AMD, he would have already shagged the processor on youtube for advertising dollars. Hossein Almet I had made my comment before I read Tom Logan’s review, and Tom Logan’s voltage reading is Lower Kitguru’s voltage reading, his CPU-Z voltage is 1.384 V at 4091.71 MHz. 1.526 V is the one at Guru3D, head over there and looking for it yourself. And if 1.526 V is dangerous, the more my original comment stands. John You seem to want your comments to stand, like its a pride thing. Yet you are just putting faith in other people. Why don’t you buy one, try it out for yourself and see who is right? You don’t believe anything apart from what Tom says so I would suggest you go over there and give him some lovely compliments on his work (which you can’t guarantee is right, but ‘want’ it to be right). How about you put all the bias in your head to the side and do a proper job yourself. I can’t really put faith in Logan’s Or HIlberts reviews and people testing power consumption on any site which is actually falling outside AMD’s recommended voltage guidance settings (which as far as I know from hearing one site comment on AMD reviewers guide is 1.45v). Sure AMD could be aiming for safe voltage, but until some processors potentially start failing due to voltage settings above their spec, people won’t know. Also when factoring in possible silicon degradation over time, who knows?). I think the 1800X power consumption looks pretty good – especially when is close to the 5960x and 6950X which are more than double and three times the price. Its certainly no bulldozer. Luke Power consumption (therefore heat) depends on the voltage AND current (Power = Voltage multiplier by Current, in a simple form. Obviously there are other elements such as ‘copper’ losses for power too.). A higher voltage operating at a significantly lower current may result in lower power consumption than a lower voltage operating at higher current – it depends on the numbers for both, not just voltage. This is potentially what is happening with the Intel voltage vs AMD voltage comparison. The power draw figures in the review show that lower voltage on some Intel chips (vs AMD) can still result in higher power draw (5960X OC @1.3V, 6950X OC @ 1.275V consume more power than Ryzen 7 1800X OC @ 1.44V). Your 4.1GHz @ 1.2V 6800K is a pretty good OC indeed. That’ll draw less power than the 4.2GHz 1.275V 6800K OC data in the power charts, but it’s also slower than a stock Ryzen 7 1800X and 5960X and 6950X in multi-threaded applications due to fewer cores. Heat and power consumption certainly matter, as does performance in the workloads being put on the processor. Hossein Almet Now tell me, which one will produce more heat, 1.199V or 1.45V? And if you don’t believe what Guru3D’s CPU-Z screenshot and what this review says, that review said why bother reading at all. John Bother with what? Who said I ever read Guru 3D? I don’t. You know my views on 0C3D. Problem is your opening comment is also idiotic – so I don’t think you deserve a really detailed comment. You say ‘Sorry, my 6800K, 4.1 GHz @1.199 V, 100% stable’. So what? its a 6 core CPU, not 8 core. It gets absolutely CREAMED by the 1800X in anything outside gaming. Ask Tom, give him a call – see if he agrees. Hilbert might even agree too, between banning people on his forums for saying anything they say that he doesn’t like. You are focusing on about the only thing that you think will help discredit AMD’s new release because you know you own a turkey of a processor now. Just look at the performance – and when you come back and look at that 1.199V reading just pretend you are getting anything close to the same performance the X1800 would give you. Yeah, I agree, it sucks when new, better models come out and you realise what you own was too expensive, and now is much too slow for what you paid for it. Its just life Hossein. Hossein Almet And my 4.2GHz is at 1.251V. What I was trying to say was that the 1800X didn’t actually destroy the 6800K. Of it certainly outperforms the 6800K. Hossein Almet I’m not sure who is the idiot here. If you read my comment carefully, you’d know that my contention was that the 1800X didn’t destroy the 6800K, outperforming, yes, but not destroying. Hossein Almet And you didn’t answer my question as which one will produce the less heat, 1.199 V or 1.45 V? John Not sure what review you have been reading, but if you read ONE that shows anything outside gaming where your 6800k is not getting absolutely ARSEMAULED by the X1800 then you need to pick your sources better. Perhaps the Cartoon Network do Tech reviews now for kiddies? Seriously though, all the intel fanboys are up in arms today as they realised their fortunes spent for X99 and a workstation style CPU was wasted. So at least you know its not just you that is seriously pissed off today. The crying yourself to sleep will only last a week, the pain eases soon. Hossein Almet What are u smoking, mate? Cheers:) John Smoking a big fat cigar in celebration! very happy Intel have a competitor now and that arsehats who have been willing to pay £1600 for a 6950X CPU finally can realise that Intel have been ripping them off for years. Competition is good for everyone. Although I think that should be appended to ‘competition is good for anyone with a brain’. Honestly though, the 6800k is a pretty good deal compared to the 6950X. Most 6950X owners got ripped off by around £1000 over price. You only paid about £250 more than it should be sold for. Consider yourself lucky. Medallish That was already refuted by the very first reply you got! Logic First The one where he said ‘test our cpu at 4k so that way the test is gpu bound’ LOL. Are you saying you don’t understand how benchmarking works either? Josh NO I never said don’t test at 1080P. I want people to understand how to apply a review like this. Naminly that in the exception of a tiny,tiny minority use case, Ryzen will not be behind in gaming for real world use. Even at 1080P with a gtx 1080 in most cases it is still above 100fps anyway so again for real world gaming, it makes NO difference. These two important points are being ignored by most readers and reviewers alike. Also I never said anything critical of Kitguru who actually tested in 4K nor siad that anyone was being paid. All I pointed out was the difference disappears even at 1440P since they didn’t’ test it and said reviewers who only tested in 1080P were doing a disservice and they are. You really like to straw man dont’ you? Anyway since Kitguru tested in 4K it doesn’t apply to them obviously. Did you not read their review or are you just lying about what I said to prop up your non point? But the majority tested at 1080P with a Titan or GTX 1080 and then started painting the narrative that Ryzen is behind in gaming while never even bothering to mention that for anyone who plays at 1440P or above or with a weaker GPU, the far and away majority of gamers, the difference will be a few fps to none between all the cpus. John Well unless you game at 1080p and like very very high frame rates to match that high refresh screen which can now hit 240hz. I mean its a small audience, but its still an audience, or ASUS wouldn’t have released the PG258Q panel to target serious gamers who want any kind of edge over opponents online. I would say Including those results isn’t so much a disservice but a ‘service to readers who think differently to Josh and want constant 144fps+ at 1080p’. The more results the merrier I say, but after looking at the KitGuru review it does look like Luke was probably testing for several weeks before this launch. In the end I think you made it sort of clear what you were trying to say all along, but fuck me with a wet lettuce and barbed wire, it took you some fucking time getting there. Josh First anytime you over 60fps a high refresh rate display is useful not just for the max fps possible. Many people use these monitors at 1440P in conjunction with Freesync/Gsync to eliminate screen tearing in the 60-100 fps range. Second n most reviews and in most games while behind Ryzen still gets over 100fps which again will take full advantage of a high refresh monitor and frankly means the differences will be unnoticeable for most people while playing a game. it’s not like 100-120fps or even 80fps is a bad experience. Even when it is the goal and even with a 7700k staying right at the monitors refresh rate at all times is near impossible anyway. 240hz is such a fringe thing it’s not even worth commenting on. Third. Yes 1080P is most popular but the fact is for the vast majority it is because they own low end-midreange gpus. People using a gtx 1080 or Titan as some reviews have used to paly at 1080P in order to get the highest fps possible are a small minority of the already small minority of people who own such cards. Fourth when did I say you didn’t show 4K? When was I critical of your review at all? When did I say you should leave out 1080P results?. Oh that’s right I didn’t say any of that and wasn’t critical of you . 1 I say only showing 1080P results is a disservice. 2 you showed 4K results as well. So 3 my statement doesn’t apply to you does it? Yes time is a concern but all it takes is one disclaimer sentence saying that at resolutions above 1080P or with lower end gpus the gpu bottle neck will mean the fps will equalize among the tested processors. Guru3D managed it and to even go the extra mile and show some 1440P results. YOU even showed 4K. So unless you have a time machine you’re keeping under your hat, it’s possible despite time constraints. In fact I think you deserve a lot of credit for being one of the few who actually showed results at higher resolutions. I think the problem here is people are missing my point. I am trying to bring much need context and rationality back to this discussion. People to include many reviewers,(note I didn’t say you were one of them) look at what number is higher without considering the real world effect it will have which is often little to none, or if the test even applies to how they use their computer. Again which in this case it wont unless you are using a 1080 or titan or MAYBE 1070 at 1080 or below resolution AND want get as many fps above 100 as you can regardless of practical impact on your gaming experience. Which, as I’m sure we both know, that is not what the vast majority do. All I wanted to do was point out that the way reviewers were conducted meant that while they showed what the CPU could do when the GPU wasn’t taxed, they didn’t apply to the vast majority of gamers. I also wanted to make sure people knew that even at 1440P the difference goes away for the most part. You only showed 4K so I wanted to make sure people didn’t get the impression it was only at 4K that the gap closed. Again My goal is proper context. In this case that being actually playing game instead of just looking at numbers and declaring a winner. People are saying Ryzen is bad for gaming when that is simply not true for the vast majority of gamers. Josh Well I had to be verbose because the clear and concise version you, and others, inexplicably couldn’t comprehend to save your life/lives. Josh Thanks for the reply but you have missed my point entirely and seem to erroneously think I was being critical of your review. Read my other replies below to sort that out. SMH. I also know why you test the way you do so I’ll skip over kindergarten stuff and tire to be more concise and just hope that doesn’t lead to ore misunderstanding again SMH. My point was the vast, vast majority are always going to be limited by their gpu making the difference between the cpus academic. So while a review like this is good to show the technical progress of a CPU, people need to understand it will not reflect the real world gaming experience for all but a small minority. Najeeb Shah you are an idiot . 1: gaming is the biggest market and thats where this is aimed 2: kabby and skylake can both hit 4.8ghz on a majority of models 3: intel has gotten 25% cheaper all across i3 ? my 4790k running at 4.9 ghz is enough for all my gaming needs , if you want to talk about mini workstation , sure ryzen is great. you amdfangirls get butt hurt too quick Lars Passic I have at theory that there could be an issue with the current NVIDIA GPU driver. Almost every review tested with an NVIDIA GPU. It’s possible that AMD’s GPU driver is better optimized for it’s new CPU. Hugo Bravo broadwell. e 32 gb vs ryzen 16 gb TheDizz Source for the ETA? lupuradu I have a different theory. The difference between being able to play a game or not by choosing the ryzen over intel’s midrange i5 or i7 doesn’t exist. Yes, you get lower FPS by going with ryzen on current, unoptimized titles, but if you think about it, you get a better and more powerful cpu that’s more future-proofed than intel’s quad core counterparts. If i were to build a pc now, i’d actually trade in those fps for a better overall product. lupuradu You’re an idiot yourself. The 8c/16t ryzen CPUs were not designed with gaming in mind, they were designed for productivity or enthusiast maket at an affordable price. Their high end 1800x blows almost anything intel has to offer in that segment at half or even 1 3rd the price. Not everyone games, many people are content creators, just because you play CS GO all day doesn’t mean everyone does so. Besides, you’d be much more future-proofed with a ryzen rather than your overclocked 4c/8t skylake/kabylake chip. Intel stupid fan at its best, you’re the perfect example, failing to understand the article and the targeted market of a given chip. lupuradu If you game, and you game now and you’re also using the best gpu there is, yeah, go intel, as long as you play on 100hz+ panels. If you on the other hand produce content or work with your pc rather than simply playing a game, or if you play a game on a midrange GPU or the entry level of high-end gpu market, then going amd ryzen will benefit you more, games will offer virtually the same performance while encoding and any other high-threaded work will rip your intel’s 4c/8t apart. Of course, to be able to do this math, you need a brain so you can think about what you pay and what you get in return, if you’re simply a fanboy, then there’s no cure, just buy intel and be happy about it. Cagarruto At this point, I think it’s an optimization issue, but not from games themselves, but the graphics drivers. If it was from the games, not every one of them would follow the same pattern (much in the same way of all the rest of the software). It’s not a matter of PCI-E/GPU performance (since making it the bottleneck with resolutions/settings remove the difference), it’s not a problem with threads/clocks (since it trails behind in games where 6900K outperforms 7700K), the SMT thing doesn’t explain most of it (disabling it helps a bit here and there, but doesn’t change the whole picture a lot)… The elephant in the room is the graphics drivers, the one super-micro-optimized (quite possibly with the overwhelmingly dominant Intel architecture in mind) piece of software that each and every one of them use under the hood. Every single test I’ve seen have been with Nvidia cards/drivers, testing with Radeon might shed some light on the issue changing that variable (especially because they could have had access to Ryzen sooner, and even if not, they have always been less super-optimized than Nvidia’s to begin with) Tyrann http://www.legitreviews.com/amd-ryzen-7-1800x-1700x-and-1700-processor-review_191753/15 mazty So salty your eyes aren’t working properly!! LEARN TO READ M8 AH STATE OF YOU!! Robert Johnson OK here is what AMD’s John Taylor told PCWorld: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms—until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all ‘CPU-bound’ games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR. With developers taking advantage of Ryzen architecture and the extra cores and threads, we expect benchmarks to only get better, and enable Ryzen to excel at next-generation gaming experiences as well. Game performance will be optimized for Ryzen and continue to improve from at-launch frame rate scores.” AngryGoldfish I would too. The problem is, the claim for current highest performing gaming CPU still resides with the 7700K, the 6700K, and maybe the 6900K depending on the game. So while I would suggest that anyone who is upgrading seriously consider Ryzen’s future precedence, there is no denying that if you want the best performance now in all games at 1080p, Intel is the one that offers that. Even the 7600K beats the 1800X at a significantly lower price. That’s Intel’s niche. AMD’s niche is again more to do with the fine wine theory and overall value for money, something they are now synonymous with. Luke I have updated some of the gaming charts to include test data for the i3-7350K at stock and overclocked now that it has been obtained and validated. Adam Kinsella Well to be fair if you are gaming at 1080p what speed does your monitor even run at? Because lets face it most monitors top out at 60hz so anything over 60FPS is just pointless. Also if you don’t have the money to get a higher resolution monitor then buying a premium graphics card or the 7700k are also pointless. An i3 and a 1060/480 will give you the frames you need for 1080p gaming campdude Just looking at these benchmarks. The performance is mostly well below that of an i5. However, on other websites it shows the 1800x beating the stock i5’s in F1 2016, Shadow Warrior 2, Watchdogs 2, Anno 2205, Dishonored 2, and just sub par equal in Doom Vulkan. I’m not angry because that particular website is missing some of the ones where AMD is losing like Gears of War 4 etc. Anyhow, I understand they can’t benchmark ‘everything’. That is why there are so many different review sites. The other website was not cherry picking good benchies as they had the Tomb Raider loser in there. The goods to take from this website is the difference between an OC’d i5 and 1800x. The ones that claim AMD is marginally beating the i5’s dont include the OC of the i5. Seeing all these signifigant losers changes the viewpoint of performance… but then when I look at winners… I have dual personalities… YESS… NO…. So how is this going to be solved. I’m just guessing the 1600x will perform similar to 1800x (same clock speeds). So its will be a battle of price and performance ratio. Mike Well a lot of us Intel Fanboys owe an apology I guess. I am sorry, I was wrong. Zen is actually pretty good! Oh wait, I’m a gamer, I don’t care about AMD still, cause they lag on that! OH HECK YEAH! Hope you go bankrupt AMD, your products are probably made in asian sweat shops in terrible conditions and low wages WHOOOO!!! *spins shirt like muscle man* I DOUBTED AMD!!!! Can you blame me? Buttdozer and Poopscavator really stunk, and it just seemed like more cheap talk from AMD yet again when they talked about ZEN. SO enjoy your elation and temporary victory AMD nerds. My dark side boys are hard at work over at intel on their DEATH STAR! You rebels are gonna pay DEARLY for this travesty! And by pay, I mean, not pay as much as us intel fans, cause we are overcharged at the moment, but STILL! YOU WILL PAY! *shakes finger at you* Intel is working on super secret chips that run at 100,000 ghz. I am telling you! Watch out! We’ll be back! There can ONLY BE ONE in the PC MASTER RACE! In the meantime I WILL let the door hit me on the ass on the way out. Have a nice day. Robin But 7700K is cheaper than 1700…. sassafras15 sucks at multi-threading? have you even watched any reviews? even Gamers Nexus would give the multi-threading award to the 1800x vs the 6900k. sassafras15 As much as I’m rooting for AMD, I don’t think that’s the proper way to test a CPU. When testing a cpu, they need to remove any bottlenecks from the gpu as much as possible. Hence, the titans or 1080’s. Also, I think you misunderstood how graphics are rendered. The gpu alone cannot “decide” what’s the fps is. There’s this thing called “Draw Calls”. You can read it up here: https:[email protected] /draw-calls-in-a-nutshell-597330a85381 This is just the first week of Ryzen out in the wild. Like what AMD has said, it still needs optimizations like any other new architecture. AngryGoldfish Yeah, that’s another point altogether. The market of guys who buy 7700K’s and 1080’s and still game at 1080p are not massive, but they are still alive and kicking. That’s what I mean when I say that is Intel’s niche. There is a large enough market for Intel there, something AMD’s CPU’s are not as competitive in. Also you have to consider the negative outlook people now have of Ryzen when it comes to 1080p gaming. A less savvy consumer might misconstrue that with overall performance. And then you’ll have Intel fanboys using Ryzen 1080p performance as fuel to further their agenda. That negativity will hurt sales even if it’s unjustified. Josh I know what draw calls are. SMH. I was using terms to make it easy to understand since people seem to be willfully misunderstanding what I am saying. Like you for example. So I’ll just try again. My point is for the vast majority they will have about the same fps no matter what they use cpu wise when we’re taking Ryzen,Braoadwell E and Sky/Kabby lake 4 cores. This is because their gpu is the bottle neck. The problem with only testing with a Titan or GTX 1080 at 1080P is that you than have to explain that it doesn’t represent real world gaming performance if you use a higher resolution or lower end gpu and is only done to show the technical capability of the processor. But almost no reviewers did that. You don’t seem to grasp the concept of applying test data to real world use cases. The most common of which is 1080P with like a 1060 or 1050 Ti or older gpus. Even among owners of 1080s it is far more common to be playing at 1440P or 4K where the CPU is making little difference . When you consider the way the vast majority of people actually play games, you can see that even as it is now without optimizations and launch day bug fixes Ryzen is more than enough for gaming and will before at least as long as the 7700K but probably longer due to it’s cores. Adam Kinsella I’m sorry but i would say that market is in fact non existent, if you have a 1080 and are playing on a 1080p monitor then you are an idiot. Even if you are the ryzen still deliver enough frames for you not to notice a difference in performance. All these Intel fanboys going on and on about 1080p performance would not be able to tell the 2 systems apart in games side by side because the difference between 90FPS and 150FPS is negligible at best. Also you did not respond to the fact that most monitors cannot refresh fast enough to even display more than 60FPS making anymore just bragging rights Thaddeus White Different microarchitecture. 3d software and benchmarks can be highly paralelized while games are serialized, and that ends up following amdahl’s law and throwing more cores at it wont necessairly give more performance, it might even make performance get worse by bottlenecking the main game thread. The major problem confusing people is exactly this one, they think that because Ryzen does so great on 3d software or cinebench, that it should do the same in gaming, except game if an entirely different beast and can’t be compared directly. Unfortunately isnt’t in AMD’s interest to explain this, they prefer to keep things confusing since there are so many reviews with GPU bottlenecks that make Ryzen close in to i7’s in performance, and AMD fans themselves got their pitchforks agains reviews they dont like. Its not just a matter of quality of programming, that does have an impect however, the major issue is how game design works. Even Ashes of singularity, the techdemo for DX12 and multithreading for games shows that. Also, AMD has given the same excuses in the past for visheras and prior, blaming game optimizations, windows scheduling, etc. And after some time passed it was shown nothing changed. I dont expect them to change once again. Its an awesome CPU for work, “bad” choice for gaming. Thaddeus White Different microarchitecture, cant compare that easily with Intel cpus, they dont work the same way.

AngryGoldfish There are a lot of idiots out there. 😉 In all seriousness, some people will buy new hardware and keep playing with the same monitor because they want every setting at the max (without exception) and want it at very high frame rates. 60 FPS is not enough for some folks. They want 144 FPS in GTA V at 1080p with every setting cranked. You need more than a GTX 1080 to achieve that consistently in GTA V even at 1080p. There are always people at the extremes. The reason why they’re not out in public might be because they don’t want to be ridiculed for the way they spend their money and game on their systems. Maybe they’re just happy to stay in the background doing their thing. A lot of people are still gaming on 60Hz 1080p monitors, yeah, but those would not likely be buying a GTX 1080. They’re buying RX 470’s and the like. In that case a Ryzen CPU is no worse than an Intel i5 or i7. But that then falls into the category of who is buying a £330 minimum CPU with a £150 monitor and GPU? Justin Hallett 1440p and beyond was a good reason to start gaming on a PC again. sassafras15 I assumed you have a vague idea of what frame rendering is because you said “for 99% of people it will be the GPU deciding the FPS not the CPU” which is not the case. Alright, look. Fact of the matter is they’re testing the high-end CPU lineup here. If they put a mid-range or low-end GPU there then that will be a GPU test as it’s almost hard for the 1800x to bottleneck low-end to mid-range cards. Sure it may be a real-world scenario but they need to consider which of the components are actually being tested on a given scenario. I think what you’re looking for is a gameplay video on youtube. Try looking for gameplay videos with the specs you’d like to see. That, or you just need to wait for the R5 and the R3 lineup. Test data on those would apply more to real-world use cases with low-end to mid-range GPU. You can also wait for GPU benchmarks (if a new GPU line came out) to see benchmarks with high-end CPUs. nissangtr786 How is it more future proof when it is slower and gaming then virtually any 4c 8t i7 since sandy bridge at gaming? You can’t say it is more future proof when intel cpus from years ago beat it and don’t bottleneck the gpu. Marcos Voy You’re not entirely right nor wrong yes games are usually optimised for few cores and yes AMD said that, but if you pay close attention buldozer, vishera, bla bla bla( theres just too many bad designs lol), has never caught up with intel even in synthetic nor 3D apps, etc and we know why it wasn’t delivering, (cuz cores shared caches and other resources) this problem we know is not present in ryzen and as you can see the difference is little, so yes I do believe optimisations will put ryzen to compete in gaming with the 6900k but not with the 7700k not now at least. Whats more is as you know CPU Technology has stagnated theres not much room for single core improvement, yet games keeps getting more and more demanding each year on the CPU so yes, there not programmed to use 16 threads today but they will in 1 or 2 years since there will be no alternative for it! And low level APIs are already here to make this possible. I can see why game developers didn’t bothered optimising games for lots of cores: almost no gamer had a CPU with more than 4 cores and they would need to train people for this, the only processors with high core counts were from AMD and they were garbage so why bother? Now they NEED to bother cuz thats the only source of more compute power and we do have 8 cores on mainstream. From both AMD and Intel (I’m talking about hyperthreaded 4 cores intel CPUs like the 7700k) Logic First AMD basically released a CPU that isn’t compatible with the Windows 10 scheduler, this is why it gets better performance when SMT is disabled. “The scheduler does not appropriately recognize Ryzen’s cache size and cannot distinguish physical cores from SMT threads. This in turn is causing it to often incorrectly schedule tasks in the much slower — approximately 4 times slower — SMT threads rather than primary physical core threads” Thaddeus White ” Whats more is as you know CPU Technology has stagnated theres not much room for single core improvement, yet games keeps getting more and more demanding each year on the CPU so yes, there not programmed to use 16 threads today but they will in 1 or 2 years since there will be no alternative for it! And low level APIs are already here to make this possible. ” Go look into Amdahl’s Law. More cores dont have a lot of gains past a certain point, games are heavily serialized and sometimes more cores can endup having worse performance. Its not my opinion, its a fact of on how game design works. sassafras15 I know about the scheduler problems. You’re talking about multi-threading on games? Most games don’t even fully utilize all threads right now. A good multi-threaded tests are from the productivity softwares such as Cinebench, Handbrake, and the likes which actually uses ALL CORES/THREADS. And guess what? That’s AMD’s territory now. Even if a game were to utilize all threads such as DX12 titles or Vulkan titles, have you even looked on graphs other than max or average fps? Polls How old will you be next birthday?

Mark Walton (UK) - Mar 2, 2017 2:00 pm UTC reader comments 404 Share this story But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and the sun has Ryzen. Sebastian Anthony Sebastian Anthony The sweet box that the review kit was sent in. Sebastian Anthony We were also sent a water cooler with the press kit, but didn't have time to try it out. Sebastian Anthony Sebastian Anthony Sebastian Anthony Sebastian Anthony It's finally happened. Over a decade after Intel's Core architecture launched and began a period of market domination that few would have predicted, competition at the high end of the desktop market is back. AMD Ryzen—a line of desktop CPUs that will soon range from four-core lightweights to eight-core monsters like the Ryzen 7 1800X—aren't the fastest processors in terms of pure instructions per clock (IPC). Nor does every application take full advantage of their multicore prowess. And if you're a gamer, Ryzen in its current state is not the CPU to buy. Further ReadingAMD’s moment of Zen: Finally, an architecture that can compete But the differences in certain tasks are thin enough, and the value proposition strong enough, that for anyone thinking of building or buying a high-performance workstation or home server that doubles up as a competent gaming PC, Intel is no longer the only option. Ryzen puts an end Intel's monopoly on high-performance computing, and—most importantly for consumers—the price gouging that went along with it. Yesterday, an eight-core, 16-thread (8C/16T) desktop chip cost $1000/£1000. Today, it's just £500. Table of Contents What is Ryzen?

The good The bad The ugly What is Ryzen? At the top of the Ryzen stack is the flagship Ryzen 7 1800X processor. For £500 you get a chip with 8C/16T, 3.6GHz base clock, and 4GHz boost clock. It's joined by the £400 R7 1700X, which has the same core/thread configuration but lower base and boost clock (3.4GHz and 3.8GHz respectively), and the R7 1700, a $330/£320 part (the same price as Intel's Kaby Lake i7-7700K) with clocks of 3.0GHz and 3.7GHz. All of the top-end Ryzen 7 chips feature 24 PCIe lanes, with certain motherboards adding up to eight more, and all support modern features like dual-channel DDR4 memory, PCIe X4 storage, and USB 3.1 Gen 2.

In some ways Zen, and by extension Ryzen, has embraced much of what has made Intel's processors since the Core 2 line so successful, including simultaneous multithreading (SMT, called Hyperthreading in Intel-land) across independent cores and a dedicated micro-op cache. But with Ryzen, AMD has thrown in a few innovations of its own. By increasing the amount of low-level cache close to the CPU with 256KB L1 cache, 4MB L2 cache—doubling that of Intel's Broadwell-E—and 16MB of L3 cache, AMD can feed the Zen cores more instructions more quickly for improved single-threaded performance. Then there's "SenseMI" (Machine Intelligence), a cringe-worthy marketing term that brings together many of the engineering tricks AMD deployed in its attempts to rescue Bulldozer, which culminated in the surprisingly capable Bristol Ridge APUs of 2016. Further ReadingAMD’s moment of Zen: Finally, an architecture that can compete with Intel My formerly hirsute colleague Peter Bright has a full deep-dive into the Zen architecture (and I highly suggest giving it a read if you're at all curious about chip design), but at a high level, SenseMI is simply five different features of Ryzen that focus on power, clock speeds, and shuffling data around as quickly as possible. The first, "Pure Power," is a set of temperature, clock speed, and voltage sensors (accurate to 1mA, 1mV, 1mW, and 1°C) that promise more efficient power delivery to the CPU. The second is "Precision Boost," which takes the sensor information and uses it to adjust the clock speed on-the-fly in small 25MHz increments. These 25MHz increments are smaller than what you typically see in a CPU, and are more akin to the aggressive clock gating and power management features of a GPU. The smaller clock speed increments allow for more accurate, and more frequent adjustments to be made, in theory saving power. Indeed, Ryzen's 95W TDP looks impressive compared to the 140W TDP of Intel's 6900K, a similar 8C/16T processor based on the Broadwell-E architecture. But in practice, Ryzen pulls just as much wattage from the wall as the 6900K, in some cases slightly more. Considering just how power-hungry Bulldozer was, that remains a significant achievement, even if it means that overclocking headroom isn't as high as some might have hoped. The multitude of sensors in Ryzen also allow for a feature called Extended Frequency Range (XFR). XFR is an extension of Ryzen's 4GHz boost clock, giving users with a good cooling solution—including AMD's own RGB-laden "Wraith Max" air cooler—an extra 100MHz boost without manual overclocking. The caveat is that XFR only works across two of the Ryzen cores at any one time, rather than all eight. With the exception of highly single-threaded tasks—which does admittedly include a good few games—you won't see the difference most of the time. XFR is only fully enabled on Ryzen "X" parts like the 1800X. Non-X parts like the R7 1700 are limited to a smaller 50MHz boost. A note about Windows power profilesAMD is advising users to use Windows' "High Performance" power profile to ensure that the SenseMI Pure Power and Precision Boost technologies work correctly. The default "Balanced" profile will work, but AMD claims that because the OS requests which P-State (or clock speed) to use, there's around a 30ms delay. "High Performance" hands over control from the OS to the processor, allowing for "fine grain control and maximum performance of the processor." Manual overclocking (which sadly disables XFR) is supported across the entire Ryzen range, and is limited by motherboard rather than chip (there's more on motherboards below, but tl;dr: you need an X-series or B-series board for overclocking). For traditional BIOS/EFI overclocking the process will vary depending on the motherboard maker, but for the most part there's access to per-core clock speeds as well as an overall voltage control, just as with Intel chips. There's no support for XMP (eXtreme Memory Profile), since it's an Intel standard, but Asus motherboards translate XMP over to a compatible compatible AMD (AMP) form shown as "DOCP" in the BIOS. While not supported by default in Ryzen processors, certain Asus and Gigabyte motherboards also enable baseclock (BCLK) overclocking thanks the addition of a third-party clock generator. According to Asus the OC limit tends to be around 106MHz, a 6MHz boost, before PCIe devices stop working correctly. You also have the option to overclock using AMD's new software-based overclocking tool called "AMD Ryzen Master." It's similar to the WattMan software for AMD graphics cards, with a set of sliders that allow for per-core clock speed, voltage, and memory timing adjustments, as well as the ability to disable cores entirely. Like BIOS overclocking, Ryzen Master also disables Precision Boost and XFR, but keeps low-power C-states (idle power saving states) active. Enlarge Due to Ryzen arriving rather late in the Ars Technica offices (thanks, AMD!), I haven't fully tested Ryzen overclocking. AMD claims most 1800X chips will hit 4.2GHz at a voltage of 1.4V. That's higher than the 1.35V typically needed to get a Broadwell-E CPU to 4.4GHz, but not dramatically so, and as always with CPU overclocking some chips will fare better than others. That said, 4.2GHz seems to be the typical overclock for the 1800X, as offered by retailers like Scan, which is selling pre-overclocked systems, and it's unlikely to go much higher. Multiple publications I spoke to with earlier access to chips all report that 4.2GHz is the current limit with standard air or sealed liquid coolers. Still, such speeds would make the £320 R7 1700 an enormous bargain, should it overclock to 1800X speeds. Enlarge / A bonus BSOD that we encountered a couple of times before we got the Win 10 Anniversary Update installed. Suffice to say that Ryzen and the AM4 platform aren't fully stable yet. Sebastian AnthonyBut the many sensors AMD has included in Ryzen aren't just for XFR and power saving: they're for binning chips at the factory too. All 7-series Ryzen chips begin their lives as an 1800X, but only some of them reach the right clock speeds within the 95W TDP. I'm as curious as everyone else to see how good those cheaper chips are, but I wouldn't get your hopes up just yet. The best result so far for the 3.4GHz 1700X (AMD is shipping other chips in the range to reviewers at a later date) is the 3.8GHz system sold by Scan. The final two parts of Ryzen's SenseMI—"Neural Net Prediction" and "Smart Prefetch"—help to shuffle data through the CPU more effectively. AMD claims there's a "true artificial network" and "learning algorithms" inside Ryzen that are able to predict what an application might do next, pre-load instructions, and learn application data access patterns in order to improve performance. These improvements, coupled with others likes the "Infinity Fabric" design, have resulted in a 52 percent increase in IPC over Bulldozer-based designs—and, in CPU-focused tests at least, the benchmarks confirm it. When the first details on Zen were dropped, AMD said it was aiming for a 40 percent uplift in IPC. Regardless of whether it was smart marketing or a genuinely unexpected result, that extra 12 percent increase in IPC means Ryzen performs better than Intel's massively expensive multi-core Broadwell-E line in a range of workstation and productivity tasks, and better than Intel's Kaby Lake 7700K, provided the apps you use can take full advantage of all eight cores. Further ReadingIntel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K review: Is the desktop CPU dead?That makes Ryzen a compelling processor, especially considering AMD's aggressive pricing. However, one thing to note about the current Ryzen line-up is that none of the CPUs are equipped with a built-in GPU, so there's no built-in support for video decoding and the like. Intel's chips with more than four cores don't feature a GPU either, but it does mean that if you opt for a Ryzen 7 1700 instead of an Intel i7-7700K, you may need to buy a graphics card as well. An APU version of Ryzen that incorporates a GPU is promised for later in the year. Further ReadingSamsung 960 Pro review: The fastest consumer SSD you can buy It's also worth noting that even with a suitably equipped motherboard, Ryzen's maximum 32 PCIe lanes—16 for graphics, four for NVMe, four to communicate with the chipset, and an additional eight from the motherboard—is less than the 40 of Broadwell-E and Kaby Lake. It's not a deal breaker right now, particularly as SLI and Crossfire aren't as appealing these days, but the rapid proliferation of PCIe-based storage means PCIe lanes are quickly becoming a prized commodity.

Shares Last week, AMD showed Ryzen to the world, with a limited selection of benchmarks and official specs and pricing. Everyone wants to know how Ryzen will perform in a larger test suite, and rest assured I'm doing my part to be ready for the unveiling. AMD seeded press and industry analysts with hardware at the event. Here's a peek at what we received, along with features and other interesting details. I can't talk benchmarks yet, but this is easily the most exciting AMD processor launch in more than a decade. There's an incredible amount of hype to go along with the performance preview AMD gave last week, but outside of the processor it's also great to see a modernized platform—socket AM3 is eight years old, and the slightly newer AM3+ is still six years old, a virtual eternity in the fast-paced world of technology. AMD shipping everything in a rather nice wooden box, emblazoned with the Ryzen logo. Well, not quite everything as the Noctua cooler came in a separate box. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a CLC (closed-loop liquid cooling) solution, but I think AMD wants to ensure there's no assumption that Ryzen will require liquid cooling to run properly. The CPU is of course AMD's top Ryzen 7 1800X part, a $500 chip intended to go toe-to-toe with Intel's i7-6900K at less than half the price. This is an 8-core/16-thread part clocked at 3.6-4.0GHz, with 16MB L3 cache and a 95W TDP. That TDP is particularly important, as it's 45W lower than Intel's TDP for their X99 enthusiast processors. Unlike Intel's X99 platform, Ryzen uses a dual-channel memory configuration, which also allows AMD to get by with far fewer pins on their CPU socket—Ryzen uses 1331 pins compared to 2011 for Intel's 6900K, and 1151 pins for the 'mainstream' platform (ie, i7-7700K and other Kaby Lake/Skylake parts). The extra pins on Ryzen presumably allow for a dedicated NVMe x4 PCIe slot, plus USB3.1 and a few other tidbits. AMD sampled press one of three motherboards, with mine being the Asus Crosshair VI Hero. Other than the CPU socket and a few other identifying markers, this could easily be mistaken for one of Asus's Z270 boards. It comes with three x16 PCIe slots, three x1 PCIe slots, eight SATA ports, internal USB3.0 and 3.1 headers, RGB LED lighting, a POST code LED readout, onboard power switch, and five 4-pin fan headers. The board also features high-end Nichicon capacitors for the audio and CPU power circuitry. As the name implies, this is Asus's current top-tier AM4 motherboard, at least for the time being. The rear IO panel includes two USB3.1 ports (one Type-C), eight USB3.0 ports, four USB2.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, audio jacks, and BIOS and CMOS buttons. Since this particular board is designed for the initial Ryzen processors, there are no video ports, which is sort of interesting as future APUs will also work in socket AM4. This is something I've noticed on most (all?) of the initial AM4 motherboards, so there will be a second round of boards for users that want to use a Ryzen APU later this year. One thing I want to point out for the Crosshair VI Hero is that Asus includes a small front panel adapter that aids tremendously when it comes time to wire up the case's power, reset, and power/HDD LEDs. This is often one of the most finicky aspects of assembling a new PC, particularly for inexperienced builders. Every case and motherboard seem to prefer a slightly different arrangement of the pins and connectors (or at least, it's not fully standardized), but this handy little adapter allows you to connect everything outside of the case, and then plug it into the motherboard. Easy! More boards should definitely include this little extra. Last up, Ryzen supports a wide range of DDR4 memory, with official support up to DDR4-2667—though unofficial support as usual goes quite a bit higher. For the review kit, AMD provided 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3000 RAM with 15-17-17-37 timings. Faster RAM might improve performance a few percent on average compared to slower DDR4, but typically it's better to put money into a faster graphics card or other components first. That's it for the kit, and I've paired my Ryzen kit with a GTX 1080 FE for graphics and Samsung's 960 Evo 500GB SSD for storage duties. I'm using Rosewill's Quark 750W, an 80 Plus Platinum PSU, and everything is going into Rosewill's stunning looking Cullinan case with tempered glass panels. (Word to the wise: the Cullinan's PCIe retention mechanism makes installing cards a serious pain in the butt. If you're only installing one or two cards and never swapping parts, it's not a problem, but it's a serious omission in an otherwise lovely case.) I've also got the Ryzen 1700X and 1700 parts for review, and the latter could steal the show given its extremely low price and potential for overclocking. Testing is well underway, but check back Friday morning for the full review.

AMD presented the alternative to Intel processors and have had both successes and what many feel are failures. The last time AMD held a dominant performance advantage was during the K8 days and the hey day of the Athlon 64 chips. Intel dropped its Core architecture and AMD has been playing catch up ever since. For quite a while now, AMD had been the laughing stock of the CPU world when it comes to high performance computing. When AMD's Bulldozer architecture was launched back in 2011, all the promises and hype failed to materialize for the most part. When you looked at multi-threaded performance it was not all that bad, but when you looked at the single core/thread performance, the wheels came off the bus. Through successive generations and iterations that pushed clock speed to try and drive performance, it came with power penalties that made the architecture one that could deliver some performance, but at a huge cost in both power consumption and thermal load. I was on hand for the FX series launch of the FX-8150 and witnessed first hand the raw clock speed the processor could run at when subjected to sub zero temperatures. By the end of the day, we saw a world record 8.429GHz. Pretty stout when you get down to it. From that point on, AMD had been on a dim pathway that did not look to have a happy ending. Don't get me wrong here, you could get a CPU at a much lower cost than an Intel chip and still see decent gaming performance across the board. Not everyone had the coin to step up and buy into the Intel machine. After going back to the drawing board, AMD effectively had to get its house in order. At this point, AMD had to step back and go the full clean slate route to build its next generation architecture. In doing so, it spent over two million man hours to come up with the "Zen" architecture targetting a 40% IPC improvement. It was something drastically needed to compete on an even playing field; a field that offers the consumer choice! Today, we get to see the results of that work with the introduction of the Ryzen 7 line of processors for the gamer and prosumer. The R5 and R3 lines will follow at a later date. Over the past week, you would have to have been living under a rock to not know what Ryzen is with all the leaks and targeted informational releases. AMD has gone full press, flooding the market with tidbits and performance metrics about the newest architecture "Ryzen." The Ryzen 7 line will include a trio of 8-core, 16 thread processors with clock speeds ranging from Ryzen 7 1700 sporting a 3.0GHz base frequency with a 3.7GHz boost clock, to the Ryzen 7 1800X with a 3.6GHz base clock and 4.0GHz boost clock. From just the flood of information about Ryzen, it is hard not to get excited for this launch. When you look at the performance metric and then get a load of the pricing, we see that AMD is not just pussyfooting around here. It's going for the jugular. Pricing on the low man on the totem pole, the 1700, starts at $329; the mid level 1700X hits the $399 price point; and then the big kahuna 1800X sits at $499. If you make the direct cost comparisons to Intel's offerings, AMD drew blood! To get the best out of this line up, AMD has put together its new AM4 platform with several varieties for a wide swath of the user base. Let's take a look at this trio of processors that look ready to shake up the high performance computing world.   AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Closer Look: You can tell that AMD was proud of its new baby when it showed up in a custom made walnut box. The front of the container had the AMD and Ryzen logos cut out for added effect! Inside were the contents of the review kit that included the Summit Ridge R7 1800X, Noctua NH-U12S cooler with AM4 mounting hardware, a 16GB kit of 3000MHz CAS 15 Corsair Vengeance memory, and an X370 chipset motherboard motherboard from Gigabyte to be that solid base to build off of.     In all, we received all three SKU's in the R7 line up. The R7 1800X, the R7 1700X, and the R7 1700. This covers the breadth of the R7 Ryzen lineup that looks to compete with Intel's latest chips. These retail boxes are what you should expect to see when your processor shows up. Depending on which SKU you purchase, there are several options as to which cooling system the processor comes with. The Wraith cooler with an RGB coloring is an available option. This package will definitely stand out in the display case at your local brick and mortar retailer. This launch targets the R7 line up, but you can see by the slide below that AMD's Ryzen processor lineup is much more than just the enthusiast and prosumer level parts. Later this year, the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 parts will make their appearance.     The three processor we have today are the Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X, and Ryzen 7 1700 for use in socket 1331 AM4 motherboards. One of the things pointed out over and again are that Summit Ridge R7 chips are all 8-core, 16 thread beasts that come fully unlocked from the 95W to the 65W parts. Packed with 4.8 billion transistors and over two kilometers of signalling wire, there is a lot going on under the hood of these 14nm FinFET processors. Each of these SKU's have a 4MB L2 cache with a 16MB L3 cache. First up is the Ryzen 7 1800X. This little gem comes with a base clock of 3.6GHz and a boost clock speed of 4GHz. As an "X" processor, the R7 1800X gets the benifit of XFR (Extended Frequency Range) that boosts the clock speed up another 100MHz when you have additional thermal headroom. The R7 1700X is clocked a bit lower at 3.4GHz with a boost clock speed of 3.8GHz and XFR boost up to 3.9GHz when you have the thermal head room. Both of the "X" processors in the product stack have a 95W TDP. The R7 1700 is the 65W TDP part and has correspondingly lower clock speeds of 3.0GHz with a 3.7GHz boost clock frequency. Even though it is not an "X" part, the R7 1700 sees an XFR boost of up to 50MHz when, again, you have the thermal headroom. Kind of a recurring theme. This lets you know that by attaching the best cooling solution you can buy will, in most circumstances, improve your boost frequency and CPU performance without overclocking. All three processors are identical as far as pin count and the bottom of the CPU. Each of the processor heat shields are laser etched with the Ryzen logo and SKU specific information, as seen on the Ryzen 7 1700 below.            New for this launch is AMD's AM4 platform that consists of a bifurcated 1331 pin socket that is a combination of the AM3+ and FM2 socket. Therefore we see a slightly higher pin count and spacing between the cooling solution mounting screws and clip style brackets. Five new chipsets with varying capabilities are available for Ryzen processors. The X370 chipset is one of two fully unlocked parts that are built for the enthusiast and mainstream markets. I will be using an X370 board to test these unlocked processors. As the form factor drops, you can see that the capabilities and hardware availability shrink up to allow that smaller form factor.     All of the major partners will have boards available for the enthusiast using the X370 chipset. The X370 Gaming 5 Aorus was supplied with this press kit, so it draws first blood on the test bench. This board is at the top of the Gigabyte 5 series product stack and offers a bunch of gaming centric features. Equally capable are the ASUS Crosshair VI Hero and MSI X370 Gaming XPower. In the past, ASUS ROG Crosshair boards have proven to be the best at getting the most from AMD hardware. It should prove interesting to see if that holds true with this round of hardware, as all three look loaded for bear.       If all the press and rumors pan out, this should be an interesting test! Let's see if AMD has truly delivered on its goals! --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor: Introduction & Closer Look2 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Closer Look: Continued3 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor: Specifications & Features4 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Setup & Overclocking5 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Apophysis, WinRAR, Bibble 56 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Office 2016, POV-Ray, ProShow Gold, HandBrake7 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: SiSoft Sandra, AIDA 648 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Cinebench R15, HWBot X.265 Benchmark, PCMark 8.29 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Gaming10 » AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor: Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor: Introduction & Closer Look AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Closer Look: Continued AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor: Specifications & Features AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Setup & Overclocking AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Apophysis, WinRAR, Bibble 5 AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Office 2016, POV-Ray, ProShow Gold, HandBrake AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: SiSoft Sandra, AIDA 64 AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Cinebench R15, HWBot X.265 Benchmark, PCMark 8.2 AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Testing: Gaming AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor: Conclusion Related Products AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Review Recent Articles Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Review AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Review ASUS ROG Maximus IX Formula Review Galactic Civilizations III v2.0 Review Anonabox FAWKES Tor Router Review MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review NEST Protect and NEST Learning Thermostat Review OCC's Top 3 Video Cards of 2016 Watch_Dogs 2 Performance Analysis GTX 1070 Overclocking Guide » all reviews Forum Posts Backlight bleed ASUS Maximus IX Formula Ryzen 1700X PC Build Help Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Reviewed NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Benchmarks Leaked Latest News NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Benchmarks Leaked IBM Announces Plans to Build Universal Quantum Computing Systems Hardware Roundup: Monday, March 6, 2017, Edition Amazon Explains S3 Internet Outage G.SKILL Announces DDR4 RAM for AMD Ryzen Systems Hardware Roundup: Friday, March 3, 2017, Edition More AMD Ryzen CPUs on the Way Hardware Roundup: Thursday, March 2, 2017, Edition AMD Ryzen Benchmarks Posted Ahead of Release Random Pic Click to enlarge Most Popular Articles AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 Processor Review MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review Galactic Civilizations III v2.0 Review ASUS ROG Maximus IX Formula Review Anonabox FAWKES Tor Router Review Latest Comments Firefox Gets a 64-bit Version for Windows [6] Repairing Nerves with 3D Printed Guides [1] Valve Announces the Vive VR Headset, Built by HTC [1] Sony Announces Premium Sound Memory Card [1] NVIDIA Hit With Class Action Lawsuit Over GTX 970 Memory Issue [1] Predicting the Past in Quantum Mechanics [1] Equation Group Spying Software Found on Hard Drives Across the World [3] Super Bowl Halftime Show Powered by MAINGEAR System with Four GeForce GTX Titan Z GPUs [3] Fake Facebook Porn Links Infect Over 110,000 Users with Trojan in Just Two Days [1] ContactReview RequestsForumsAdvertiseOCC Logos and Banners © 2001-2017 Overclockers Club ® Privacy Policy Elapsed: 0.0302929878   (xlweb1)

He also took credit for corporate job expansion and military cost savings that actually took root under his predecessor. A look at some of his claims Tuesday night: Trump: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." The facts: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO meeting last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. He and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries are meeting the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. • Annotated: Trump declares it's 'time to join forces' to fix U.S. problems In fact, Germany's foreign minister said Wednesday he is skeptical about his country's plans to increase defense spending, saying it could raise concerns in Europe by turning Germany into "a military supremacy." German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her country will meet its commitment to raise defense spending by the 2024 deadline. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. Trump: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." The facts That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services." The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants' children "are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population." This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the "long-run fiscal impact" of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive "if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account." Trump: "We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price" of the F-35 jet fighter. The facts: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 -- after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before he met the company's CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, said there is no evidence of any additional cost savings as a result of Trump's actions. • Annotated: Democratic response to Trump's address to Congress, annotated Trump: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs." The facts Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump's term, on March 10. Trump: His budget plan will offer "one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." The facts: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. Trump: "We will provide massive tax relief for the middle class." The facts: Trump has provided little detail on how this would happen. Independent analyses of his campaign's tax proposals found that most of the benefits would flow to the wealthiest families. The richest 1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly $215,000 a year, while the middle one-fifth of the population would get a cut of just $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project by the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute. • Trump's speech: Minn. delegation hears some places for possible compromise Trump: A White House fact sheet on the nation's infrastructure issued with his speech describes "a desperate need for improvement" of public infrastructure "in poor condition." It cites a report from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association that over 55,000 bridges are "structurally deficient." The facts Trump and many Americans love to complain about their highways and bridges, but data show that the country isn't that bad off when compared either with its global counterparts or the recent past. The World Economic Forum ranks the U.S. seventh out of 138 countries for its transportation infrastructure, ahead of countries such as Germany, Spain, Canada, Britain and China. Countries ahead of it on the list are smaller, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. By the nation's own measurements, bridges have improved over the past decade or so. The trade association for road builders, using government data, indeed says there are 55,710 structurally deficient bridges -- those carrying more traffic than they were designed for. But that number represents a 34 percent decline since 2002. And the share of miles driven on national highways with pavement offering "good ride quality" rose from 50 percent in 2002 to 57 percent in 2012. Trump: "Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force." The facts: That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone aged 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one. So it includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, most economists forecast. It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. Trump: "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center." The facts: It's unclear what Justice Department data he's citing, but the most recent government information that has come out doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were actually born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research revealed last week. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the deadly 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It's true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that's no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. Trump: "Obamacare is collapsing ... imploding Obamacare disaster." The facts There are problems with the 2010 health care law, but whether it's collapsing is hotly disputed. One of the two major components of the Affordable Care Act has seen a spike in premiums and a drop in participation from insurers. But the other component, equally important, seems to be working fairly well, even if its costs are a concern. Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the whole thing, which risks leaving millions of people uninsured if the replacement plan has shortcomings. Some critics say GOP rhetoric itself is making things worse by creating uncertainty about the future. The health law offers subsidized private health insurance along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Together, the two arms of the program cover more than 20 million people. Republican governors whose states have expanded Medicaid are trying to find a way to persuade Congress and the administration to keep the expansion, and maybe even build on it, while imposing limits on the long-term costs of Medicaid. While the Medicaid expansion seems to be working, the markets for subsidized private health insurance are stressed in many states. Also affected are millions of people who buy individual policies outside the government markets, and face the same high premiums with no financial help from the health law. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says "implosion" is too strong a term. An AP count found that 12.2 million people signed up for this year, despite the Trump administration's threats to repeal the law. But a health care blogger and industry consultant, Robert Laszewski, agrees with Trump. He says too few young, healthy people have signed up to guarantee the stability of the insurance markets.

We were told by AMD that we’d have to set memory timings manually with the new Ryzen platform but, at least with Gigabyte’s AM4 motherboards, we don’t have to. Because all of the AMD motherboard makers also make Intel motherboards, they have access to Intel's proprietary XMP profiles that come installed in most computer RAM. As such, the tricky (scary for beginners) process of entering confusing-sounding timings and voltages manually in the UEFI BIOS doesn’t need to happen. Here’s a screenshot from the Gigabyte Aorus GA-AX370-Gaming 5 AMD Ryzen AM4 motherboard’s BIOS. Gigabyte's AMD BIOS uses Intel's XMP memory settings. You can set the RAM timings in one click. No idea what we’re talking about? Here’s what you need to know about the most basic way to set up new computer memory (so that it runs at advertised speeds) once you’ve installed it in your computer.

This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

With rumors stating that the Cupertino-based tech giant is finally looking to update its most iconic desktop computer this March, it is time to see what Apple could do in order to ensure that the 2017 iMac is a device that would attract consumers. After all, with machines such as the Microsoft Surface Studio competing in the same market, the all-in-one industry has gotten a lot more competitive and challenging. Considering Apple’s reputation, however, there is a pretty good chance that its upcoming device, the iMac 2017, would be able to reign supreme in the all-in-one market just the same. In order to overcome devices such as the Surface Studio, here are three things that the iMac 2017 must have. Kaby Lake Processors Specs about the iMac 2017 are pretty scarce, with Apple being very secretive about any developments in the device. Despite this, however, it is almost certain that the Cupertino-based tech giant would be utilizing Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors for its latest all-in-one desktop, according to a PC Advisor report. After all, Apple has developed a reputation for using only the best that the industry has to offer. Fortunately for the 2017 iMac, Intel’s Kaby Lake chips would come in its favor. https://t.co/iOu7lgdAXp : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017: Apple Hard At Work To Deliver Unparalleled Desktop With Performance; Q1 2017 … pic.twitter.com/EYpmP4w3yL — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 12, 2017 This is because its biggest competition, the Surface Studio, still runs Intel’s 6th-generation Skylake chips. While the Surface Studio’s Skylake processors still manage to give the all-in-one massive computing power, the 2017 iMac’s Kaby Lake chips would most likely blow its rival’s performance out of the water. Coupled with Apple’s rather lightweight macOS, a 2017 iMac running Intel’s 7th-generation chips would be no less than a monster. Virtual Reality Support Apple has shied away from virtual reality so far, but it appears that the time is right for the Cupertino-based tech giant to fully embrace the emerging technology. With this in mind, there is no better product in Apple’s lineup that would be more perfect for VR than the 2017 iMac. After all, with the current trends in virtual reality, the iMac 2017’s neat, minimalistic design would be a godsend for users of high-end virtual reality headsets. VR compatibility would most likely be possible, since the iMac 2017 is rumored to feature AMD’s Radeon Polaris graphics chips, according to MacWorld. With AMD’s notable graphics chips in the machine, the iMac 2017 would most likely be capable enough to run premium-grade VR programs. If Apple manages to pull this off, it would no doubt give the best in the all-in-one market a run for their money, including, of course, the Microsoft Surface Studio. My vision of Apple's new 2017 iMac ( 24" & 27" ) #iMac #appleimac #imac2017 #newimac #appleimac2017 #usbtypec #usbc pic.twitter.com/0v7dviWlTX — łobias (@officialitec) December 29, 2016 A Reasonable Price The word “reasonable price” and Apple rarely go together, considering the Cupertino-based tech giant’s reputation for releasing only premium-grade devices that cater to the higher end of the market. However, with regards to the iMac 2017, the time is simply right for Apple to do something different and release a device at a more reasonable price than its rivals. This is because its competitors, such as the Surface Studio, are as pricey as they come. Microsoft’s all-in-one starts at $2,999 and goes as high as $4,199. If Apple could offer the iMac 2017 for a lower price, it would be a far better deal for most consumers than its biggest rival. After all, even if Apple offers the iMac 2017 at a lower price than the Surface Studio, it would still be premium enough to command a price that is worthy of the Cupertino-based tech giant’s brand. With its more advanced processors, the iMac 2017 is already a better deal than its Windows 10-based counterparts. Coupled with VR capabilities and a reasonable price, however, the iMac 2017 could go far beyond the competition. For al intents and purposes, it might very well be the most successful all-in-one desktop this year.

John’s wife wants to replace her Microsoft Surface RT, which she uses in her job as a tutor. Are there any affordable Intel-based tablets up to the job? Microsoft RT users had to be content with Windows Store apps and web-based applications. Photograph: Alamy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Jack Schofield Thursday 2 March 2017 04.59 EST Last modified on Thursday 2 March 2017 05.02 EST My wife has used a Microsoft Surface RT tablet for a few years in her job as a tutor. She has found its size and the touch keyboard invaluable in her planning and writing up of lessons, especially as this often happens in the car between pupils. Unfortunately, it is becoming less reliable, and much slower, and she is looking for a replacement. She has looked at the new Surface Pros, but does not want to spend more than £500. She requires Microsoft Office, a long battery life and portability. By the way, I also wanted to thank you for the advice you gave my daughter in What sort of tablet should I buy for drawing? Niamh bought a Wacom tablet and is very pleased. John Microsoft launched the Surface RT in 2012 when the tablet market looked promising. It was the first tablet to run Windows on an ARM chip, which provided long battery life. It also made it incompatible with all the traditional software written for Intel x86 versions of Windows, including viruses. The Surface RT tablets included Microsoft Office, which was good, but it wasn’t optimised for touch-screen use, which was bad. Otherwise, users had to be content with Windows Store apps and web-based applications. While Surface RT users loved their machines, there were not many of them, and Microsoft abandoned the ARM line in favour of the successful Intel-based Surface Pro versions. However, ARM-based versions will return to the market later this year. Speeding up a PC Your wife’s Surface RT should not have slowed down that much, and a reset might speed it up again. To do this, take a backup of the current system – or at least, all the personal data – and restore it to factory condition. Run the Settings app (cogwheel icon), select Update & security, click Recovery and then hit the “Get started” button under “Reset this PC”. The drawback is that you will have to reinstall all the updates that have been downloaded previously. This could take some time. You could also optimise Windows for speed. Windows has a lot of visual effects: for example, things slide into view instead of instantly popping into view. To change this, type in “advanced system settings” to find the System Properties sheet from the old Control Panel. In the Performance section, click the Settings button and then select “Adjust for best performance”. After that, go through the list of effects and restore any you still want. “Enable Peek”, “Show shadows under mouse pointer”, “Show window contents while dragging” and “Smooth edges of screen fonts” are worth keeping. Unfortunately, the Surface RT is a sealed box, like most tablets. You can’t get the simple improvement that works with desktop and some laptop PCs: just add RAM. Tablets and 2-in-1s The whole tablet market is in decline – Apple iPad sales are roughly half what they were at their peak – and manufacturers are shifting resources to AR (augmented reality, such as the Microsoft HoloLens) and VR (virtual reality, such as the Oculus Rift). Windows PC manufacturers switched to 2-in-1s and then convertibles, where sales are still growing strongly. Unfortunately, the better products are generally more expensive, including the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, the HP Spectre x2, HP Elite x2, and Dell Latitude 11 5175. There’s a huge gap between pro tablets and convertibles with Intel Core processors, 8GB of memory and proper SSDs and the cheap, casual models with Intel Atom processors, 2GB of memory and 32GB of eMMC Flash storage. It can be hard to find affordable machines in the “sweet spot” between the two extremes. These may have Intel Core M processors such as the Core m3-6Y30 and 4GB or 8GB of memory. The best compromise is a Cherry Trail (x3, x5 or x7) Atom-powered machine with 64GB of eMMC storage. The one I’d recommend at the moment is last year’s Lenovo Miix 310, which has an Atom x5-Z8350 processor, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage for a current web price of £249.99 (£30 off). However, this week, Lenovo unveiled the Miix 320 with 128GB of storage, so it might be worth waiting for that. The main alternative is the Asus Transformer Book T100HA, which has a Cherry Trail x5-Z8500 processor, 2GB of memory and either 32GB or 64GB of storage. Currently, eBuyer has the 2GB/64GB model for £229.97 with free delivery. The T100HA has been around for a while, and the Miix 310 has twice the memory and a better keyboard. In both cases, the electronics are behind the screen, so you can detach the screen from the keyboard and use it as a tablet. (The virtual keyboard is built into Windows 10.) The alternative is to keep the electronics under the keyboard and fit a 360-degree hinge. Folding the keyboard behind the screen provides a somewhat thicker tablet. The Lenovo Yoga range pioneered this approach, and your wife could have a look at one to see if the idea is acceptable. Yogas come in dozens of configurations but a Yoga 300 with an Intel Pentium N3710, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage costs £279.99 from PC World. The N3710 is faster than the x5-Z8500, though not by much. Stylus required? Facebook Twitter Pinterest With a Lenovo Yoga Book, you can write and draw on the keyboard. Photograph: Lenovo You don’t say if your wife is using a stylus. I hope so, because a Surface-style device, Microsoft OneNote and a stylus is a terrific system for educational use. However, adding a stylus and a pen-capable screen bumps up the price, usually beyond your budget. The main exception is the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA (x5-Z8350/4GB/64GB) with a stylus, which costs £449.95 at John Lewis, or £398.46 on Amazon. However, Microsoft currently has a Signature Edition (ie crapware free) version for only £349. I believe the Mini T102HA is the cheapest current 2-in-1 with a stylus, unless you are willing to risk a Chinese product such as a Teclast X3 Pro or X5 Pro. These aren’t even included in Tablet PC Review’s invaluable spreadsheet of pen-capable Windows 10 systems. The other possibility is Microsoft’s Surface 3 – not the same as a Surface Pro 3 – if you can still find one at a reasonable price. Microsoft has some at a “student price” of £449.99, if you pre-qualify as a student. Lenovo’s very innovative Yoga Book is also worth a look at £549.99. ARM’s return Windows 10 is a mobile operating system, like Android, and also runs on ARM chips in smartphones, which aren’t expected to run traditional x86 Windows programs. Later this year, however, we expect to see ARM-based tablets and small laptops running Windows 10 on the next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Qualcomm has a Microsoft demo video on its website. These new devices won’t be the same as the Surface RT. The main difference is that they have enough power to run traditional x86 programs under emulation. The Snapdragon 835 also supports touch, pen and the latest wireless standards: LTE, 802.11ad and Bluetooth 5. Early models will probably be designed and priced for corporate use, but consumer versions should follow. Have you got another question for Jack?

Justin Mitchell reports. March 2nd 2017 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ US President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in Washington, DC. Picture: Jim Lo Scalzo/AFP Photo news.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend DONALD Trump is being praised for his uncharacteristically positive maiden speech to congress. The US President’s address before the joint session of US politicians in Washington was, well, more presidential than anyone was expecting. But while yesterday’s appearance hinted the new leader was growing into his role, President Trump may have also set himself up for disaster. Disguised by moderate language and a calm delivery, Trump’s over-the-top promises and sensational ideas were still there. He made some big calls, just in a less blusterous tone than usual. These are the big promises Trump made in the speech that’s been labelled his most restrained yet. SAVE JOBS Mr Trump promised he was going to “bring back millions of jobs” to the US and claimed he had already started. “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs,” he said. But analysis by Associated Press indicates Mr Trump may have jumped the gun taking credit for those positions. The corporate job decision that Mr Trump is referring to largely predates his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama’s presidency, AP reported. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high- powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Mr Trump also mentioned that he had withdrawn the US from the “job-killing” Trans-Pacific Partnership, although this was met with less enthusiastic applause. LIFT WAGES AND LOWER TAXES The President also said protecting workers meant reforming the system of legal immigration. This leads to his next job-related promise — to lift wages for the nation’s poorest citizens. “It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class, and they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy indeed. “I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It’s been a long time since we had fair trade,” he said. “The current outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.” The president also said he would “provide massive tax relief for the middle class”, but is yet to explain how he plans to do this. US President Donald Trump’s address sounded measured, but his promises were sensational. Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP SPEND SPED SPEND Mr Trump bagged the previous administration for its spending in the Middle East, which he reckons would have been better invested on local infrastructure. He said America had spent about $6 trillion in the Middle East, while the country’s own infrastructure crumbled. “With $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice,” he said. So despite slamming the spending of his predecessors, the President pledged to come up with $1 trillion for new infrastructure. “I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.” He said this effort would be guided by two core principles “buy American and hire American”. STOP DRUGS Mr Trump pledged to dismantle criminal cartels and “stop drugs from pouring into our country”. The President said he had directed the Department of Justice to form a taskforce of reducing violent crime. “I have further ordered to co-ordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels,” he said. “We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” Mr Trump said construction would start soon on his campaign promise to build a wall between the US and Mexico, and it would be an “effective weapon against drugs and crime”. He says his administration is removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals from the United States. Trump said “bad ones” were going out as he spoke. The address received an unexpectedly positive response. Picture: Mike Theiler/AFP PhotoSource:AFP DESTROY ISIS Mr Trump will be left red-faced if he doesn’t destroy Islamic State while he’s president, and sooner rather than later. “As promised, I directed the Department of Defence to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children, of all faiths and all beliefs,” he said. “We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. “I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.” FIX HEALTH CARE Mr Trump spent a significant chunk of his campaign time and material rubbishing the previous president’s health care package Obamacare, setting a challenge for himself to better it. Mr Trump called on members of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. “We should help Americans to purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government,” he said. He said legal reforms should be implemented to protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs. “The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines,” he said. But time will tell if President Trump will be able to deliver.

Laptop Processors, Battery Life and USB Type-C Explained Tegan Jones Mar 2, 2017, 10:45am ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories core i7 feature hp intel laptop buying guide 2017 laptops partner content processors spectre usb type-c Share Image: HP When looking for a new laptop, one of the first things that people look at is power and battery life — and it pays to know how the processor comes into play. And that USB Type-C is beginning to revolutionise charging options. Here's what you need to know. Gizmodo's Laptop Buying Guide is brought to you by the HP Spectre x360. Meticulously crafted from the inside out, the Spectre x360 redefines what to expect from technology with four unique modes, and over 8 million pixels on the thinnest convertible PC HP has ever made. Processors The processor or CPU is what drives the performance of your laptop. You need to know what you're looking for so you can get the most appropriate one for you. If you're new to the world of processors, they can be a little confusing. There are different manufacturers and they have their own grading and naming systems. Intel and AMD processors are the biggest contenders if you're in the market for a serious laptop. But because you're more likely to come across the former, let's use them as an example. When it comes to CPUs higher number doesn't necessarily mean a faster unit. A newer generation Intel Core i5 could be more powerful than an older Core i7. Discerning between Intel's processor numbers can be a bit tricky. You'll generally see the processor brand, such as a Core i7, followed by 4 numbers — the first of which is the generation number. If you're looking for power you want to go for the highest number possible. As a handy tip, they're currently up to 7th generation so look for Intel iX 7XXX. Understanding which processor is which is not easy. When you're urgently trying to upgrade, you should remember at least one thing: The newest, 7th gen (codename Kaby Lake) processors will start with the number seven. After these numbers you may find a single letter. M indicates a standard powered laptop CPU whereas U indicates a low powered and Y ultra low powered. With both of the latter options you are sacrificing power for battery life, which may be great if that's what you want to prioritise. To keep it simple, a Core i7 is what you're after if you need to tax your machine with hardcore work such as video editing, a Core i5 is good if you just need a middle of the road rig that can handle basic photoshopping, and an i3 should only really be used for super basic browsing and emailing. Intel's New Kaby Lake Processors: What You Need To Know Better performance can often come as at the price of battery life, yet Intel claims the Kaby Lake family improves battery life across the board. And because the processor is more efficient it also generates less heat, which means it can be crammed into smaller and thinner laptops than a Skylake processor. Read more Battery Life Image: Gizmodo There's nothing worse than your battery going dead at a crucial moment, especially when you don't have immediate access to a power source. If you're lucky, battery life may not be that important — perhaps your commute is minimal or you mostly use it at your desk. But if you travel a lot or are always on the go, then it's critical. This is where the world of processors and batteries intersect. You may be packing an impressive i7, but it's going to suck the life out of your machine faster than a less powerful one would if you're using a high-performance profile in Windows. Other factors also contribute of course — like the screen. A machine with a high res display with the brightness turned all the way up will also drain the battery quicker. For more tips, see: How To Maximise Battery Life On Windows 10. How To Maximise Battery Life On Windows 10 Whether you've upgraded to Windows 10 includes a new native battery saver feature — and there are a few other tricks you can pull to make sure your laptop lasts until you can find a power socket. Read more Your operating system of choice will help to moderate the power and performance in relation to the battery life to a certain degree. But in general, you have to decide what you value more — power or longevity? It's smart to think about what you're after in a machine and see what is currently available on the market. Find out how much battery life sounds right for your needs and be aware of any spec sacrifices you may need to make for it. This may include the size. Smaller doesn't necessarily mean that battery will last longer, regardless of modest and more efficient specs. Compact internal real estate can't accommodate a larger battery. However, some rigs will have batteries built into their shells, which is great for extended life. If you want to keep things simple, look at what the manufacturer claims the battery life is. If you're interested in diving deeper, look for models with more cells and the largest units of measurement, whether that be mAh or watt hours. The bigger the number, the longer it will last. As a general rule when looking at laptops, don't make assumptions and always read the spec sheets. Speaking of which... USB Type-C Image: iStock If you're not familiar with it already, USB Type-C is slowly becoming the port standard in next gen laptops. Don't let the name fool you, it isn't just a USB Port — it's becoming an all round literal powerhouse. The ports and connectors are similar in size to to Micro-B USB, which is why you'll see them cropping up in laptops, tablets, phones and accessories. USB Type-C: I've Never Been So Excited About A Little Port The future of cables is finally coming and it's fantastic. Welcome to USB Type-C. Read more In addition to being able to transfer data, it can also be used for external display and as a replacement for headphone jacks. Perhaps most importantly is its bi-direction power. It can charge the host device as well as peripherals. This means that you don't need plethora of different power cables — because you can use the same one for everything. Less tangled wires makes for a happy tech head. And it's fast. When paired with Thunderbolt 3, it can hit data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps as long as the cable is 0.5m or shorter. For charging, Thunderbolt 3 supports USB 3.1, which has a top speed of 10Gbps and up to 100 watts of power output. Just be wary not to use cheap USB Type-C cables, they can destroy your devices. What Exactly Is USB-C? It can power laptops, transfer data and solve world hunger (okay, maybe not that last one). Read more Comments red_t_rex @red_t_rex Mar 3, 2017, 8:24pm Only problem is that with so few full size usb ports it's a struggle to connect all existing devices. Our office was recently broken into and we lost 5 reasonably new laptops (HP Spectre and Dell XPS 13). We replaced them with the latest model Spectres but with only 1 full size USB we had a challenge putting on the dongle for the wireless mouse and keyboard as well as the USB connector for the docking station not to mention being able to use thumb drives. I know there are adaptors and hubs you can get but it is added expense and complexity especially if the wireless mouse dongle is always in as you always take the mouse with you.

Subscribe TRENDING: MWC 2017 RYZEN AMD Asus Tinker Board Vega Dell XPS 27 GeForce GTX 1080 Ti home Leisure Gaming by Paul Lilly — Friday, March 03, 2017 AMD CEO Says Ryzen Gaming Performance Will Improve With Future Patches And Developer Support Independent testing of Ryzen (including our own in-depth benchmarking and analysis) confirms what AMD has promising all along, that its fancy new CPU architecture is the real deal and it is able to compete with Intel at the high end. The only caveat is that Ryzen's gaming performance is not where many thought it would be, especially considering the architecture's excellent IPC efficiency and performance in other areas, such as Cinebench and POV-Ray. What gives? The short answer is, this is a temporary thing until developers get rolling with optimizations. During an "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) session at Reddit, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su was asked point blank if gaming performance was something the chip designer will work towards going forward with Ryzen. Her reply was an emphatic, "Absolutely!," adding that gamers "should expect gaming performance to only get better with time as the developers have more time with 'Zen." If there is skepticism over AMD's explanation, it's understandable, but we're not so quick to dismiss it as lip service. Just the opposite, there is every reason to believe that AMD is shooting it straight and that gaming performance will in fact improve over time. For one, AMD has been saying all along that Ryzen is a high-performance architecture with a substantial gain in IPC versus Bulldozer, and that turned out to be true. But secondly, the notion that optimizations will make a significant difference is more than plausible. For the past several years, AMD has been an afterthought in the enthusiast market, and has instead focused on the budget sector. It makes sense that game developers optimized their games to run on Intel hardware while for the most part ignoring AMD's slower technology. That is basically the bush AMD is beating around, but with Ryzen closing the gap, developers have reason to optimize for AMD hardware. To that end, AMD is working closely with game developers and a few have shared their current view of Ryzen optimizations with us, in our recent deep dive review...  Creative Assembly's Total War: Warhammer "Creative Assembly is committed to reviewing and optimizing its games on the all-new Ryzen CPU. While current third-party testing doesn’t reflect this yet, our joint optimization program with AMD means that we are looking at options to deliver performance optimization updates in the future to provide better performance on Ryzen CPUs moving forward," said Creative Assembly, developers of the Total War series” It's not just one developer, either... "Oxide games is incredibly excited with what we are seeing from the Ryzen CPU. Using our Nitrous game engine, we are working to scale our existing and future game title performance to take full advantage of Ryzen and its 8-core, 16-thread architecture, and the results thus far are impressive. These optimizations are not yet available for Ryzen benchmarking. However, expect updates soon to enhance the performance of games like Ashes of the Singularity on Ryzen CPUs, as well as our future game releases,” said Brad Wardell, CEO Stardock and Oxide” In other words, game developers are publicly backing AMD's explanation, putting their own credibility on the line when they really don't have a dog in the fight. According to Dr. Su, over 300 developers are now working on optimizations for Ryzen. In the short-term, Dr. Su says she fully expects to see gains in 1080p performance on Ryzen. And looking a little further down the road, this is something that will continue in future iterations of the zen architecture, which Dr. Su refers to as Zen2 and Zen3.

If that's the case, you likely have a gaming PC already, but with the relatively recent release of Intel's Kaby Lake processors and the forthcoming Ryzen CPUs from AMD, a lot of folks are looking at upgrading. As we saw recently in our Core i7-7700K review and Colton's upgrade experience, you might have a lot to gain from finally ditching your trusty old Sandy Bridge or Nehalem machine. Still, there ain't a one of us that's getting any younger. It's 2017, and your ATX full tower that you've customized with a hand-cut glass window, RGB lightstrips, and two separate water-cooling reservoirs still runs great and is cooler than ever. Problem is, it definitely has an insufficient Spouse Approval Factor, especially in the living room. Those of you fortunate enough to have a dedicated den or man-cave can get away with it. For the rest of us, maybe it's time to go smaller, and more subtle. Maybe one of those mini-PCs we've been hearing so much about lately is just the trick. Maybe something like this. So yes, a warm welcome to single, married, and all other gerbils alike, because I'm back again with another miniature gaming PC to review. This time around, I've got MSI's Trident 3 small-form-factor desktop. This is the smallest of MSI's gaming PCs, the others being the Nightblade and the Aegis. MSI calls it "console-sized," and at just 13.63" long by 9.15" deep by 2.83" tall (34.6 x 23.2 x 7.2 cm), the machine is very nearly the same size and weight as a PlayStation 4 Pro. Despite its diminutive dimensions, however, it houses a full-powered desktop gaming PC powered by Intel's four-core, eight-thread Core i7-7700 and a desktop GTX 1060 6GB graphics card. Now, this machine is a fair bit larger than the Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1070 I reviewed a couple of months ago. In fact, it occupies over twice the volume: 5.8L, versus the 2.6L of the Zotac. With the EN1070, I was impressed by the machine's graphics prowess but left wanting more from that machine's low-power CPU. MSI solved the CPU power issue with the Trident 3's 65W chip, but this larger PC trades the mobile GTX 1070 for a somewhat less powerful GTX 1060 6GB. Whether that trade was a good one to make will be a key theme in our investigations. For now, check out the full specifications.   MSI Trident 3 VR7RC-025US Processor Intel Core i7-7700 Memory 16GB Kingston DDR4-2400 (2x8GB SODIMMs) Chipset Intel H110 Express Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 (normally disabled) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB GDDR5 RAM Storage Kingston RBU-SNS8152S3256GG5 M.2 SATA SSD, 256GB Hitachi Travelstar 7K1000, 1TB 7200 RPM SATA HDD Audio Realtek ALC1150 Expansion and display outputs 1 USB 3.0 Type-C 3 USB 3.0 Type-A 4 USB 2.0 Type-A 1 HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2 1 DisplayPort 1 DVI-D Communications Intel I219-V Gigabit Ethernet Intel 3168 Wi-Fi-AC + Bluetooth 4.2+LE Dimensions 13.63" x 9.15" x 2.83" (34.6 x 23.2 x 7.2 cm) Weight 6.9 lbs (3.1 kg) Included cables 230W power adapter, HDMI, DisplayPort OS Windows 10 Home Since the Trident 3's custom motherboard is based on Intel's H110 chipset, we won't be doing any overclocking, and given that it comes with every one of its available expansion slots filled, we won't be doing much upgrading. Those facts shouldn't be much of a problem, though. The Core i7-7700 that the machine includes is lightning-quick, 16GB of RAM is plenty enough, and the combination of M.2 SSD and 2.5" HDD gives us fast storage for the OS and lots of space for games. Clever gerbils will note that further unlike the EN1070, this machine comes as a complete, ready-to-go system. As a result, we can judge the Trident 3 more specifically on its value proposition. We can also talk about the included storage hardware and the bundled software. All of that comes later, though. First, let's have a closer look at the machine.

Elegant case design. Cons Other desktops offer superior raw gaming performance. Bottom Line Loaded with AMD's new flagship Ryzen 7 1800X CPU, the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra is a compelling fusion of gaming and processing performance at a delectable price. By Matthew Murray What Nvidia began with the release of its Pascal graphics architecture last fall AMD is now continuing with its new Ryzen CPUs: Both are changing how much performance you can expect for ever-decreasing amounts of money. The first computer we've seen that fuses both technologies is the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra, a $2,399 gaming desktop that, when it comes to processing chores, can also hold its own against some desktops costing thousands of dollars more. If you're willing to shell out more cash, you can find a better pure gaming system. But if you want something that's capable at work as it is at play, it won't be easy to find something better balanced than this. //Compare Similar Products Compare Acer Predator G1-710-70001   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen X   %displayPrice%%seller% Alienware Aurora (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Origin Chronos VR   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG GT51   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Talon (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Tiki (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Velocity Micro Raptor Z95   %displayPrice%%seller% MSI Trident   %displayPrice%%seller% Design and Features The relatively low price of the Gamer Master Ultra might work in its favor in terms of its aesthetics. Like most boutique manufacturers, CyberPower can sometimes go overboard on the bling, but here the design is restrained and even—dare I say it?—elegant. The case is an Enthoo Evolv ATX, all aluminum and all black along the front and top, except for the light-blue outlining the Power button (on the front of the top panel) and the activity light (on the bottom of the front panel). The center of the front panel is angled inward, bestowing a serious and mature look, and parallelogram-shaped vents along the left and right sides of the top panel add a bit of extra, low-key visual appeal. Tinted tempered glass doors cover not just the side of the Gamer Master Ultra that lets you view and access your components, but the other side as well, in case you want to show off the cable routing. (To open either side, just remove the four thumbscrews holding the door on, and then lift it straight off.) The biggest splash is made by the bright-white CyberPower logo applied to the primary door's glass panel. View All 6 Photos in Gallery There are a few shocks of white on the Gigabyte Aorus X370 Gaming 5 motherboard and the braided power cabling, an occasional flash of silver, and lighting accents (dull orange on the intake and exhaust fans, bright red on the motherboard itself), but otherwise the interior is awash in black. The top-mounted Corsair Hydro H110i GT liquid cooler, the two DIMMs of Corsair memory (totaling 16GB; the board can hold as much as 64GB), the EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 video card, the 850-watt Corsair power supply—all black. The 512GB Samsung SSD 960 Pro (for Windows and programs) and a 2TB 7,200rpm hard drive for storing files are tucked out of sight in the lower-right drive cage (which, of course, is black). There's no optical drive, which is fine given that these days you're more likely to download your PC games from a digital service like Steam or Origin, and having one on the front would only spoil the case's stylish austerity. (As it is, the easy-access ports—two USB 3.0, microphone, and headphone—and the Reset button are hidden by a flip-up door at the top of the front panel.) The back is necessarily a different story, as there you'll find the rear-panel ports: six USB 3.0, three USB 3.1 Type-A, one USB-C, two Ethernet, six audio (including S/PDIF), and PS/2 (for connecting an old-school keyboard or mouse). There's also an HDMI port, but you should defer instead to the ports on the graphics card, which comprise three DisplayPort, one HDMI, and one DVI. Power-Packed Processing Although you can't see it beneath the water block, the raison d'être for this system is the Ryzen 7 1800X processor. This is AMD's new top-end chip, which with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz and eight processing cores (which amounts to 16 threads), is a direct competitor to the Intel Core i7-6900K—but more impressive in some ways. That chip's base clock is 3.2GHz, and it has a higher TDP (140 watts versus 95 watts), but even more than that, it has a higher price. Whereas Intel recommends selling the Core i7-6900K for about $1,089, AMD has priced the Ryzen 7 1800X at only $499—a stunning difference for a processor this comparable. This becomes particularly important when looking at the Gamer Master Ultra's performance. Despite this configuration costing just $100 more than the Acer Predator G1-710-70001, our previous Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops, it soared past that computer on our multimedia tests. It finished our Photoshop filter application test in just 3 minutes, 1 second (the Acer needed 3:21), and our HandBrake video encoding task in 34 seconds (against the Acer's 56), and its CineBench rendering result was 1,621 (more than twice the Acer's 794). The only test on which it fell behind was the PCMark 8 overall system benchmark, with a result of 2,790 to the Acer's 3,623. See How We Test Desktops But the Gamer Master Ultra compares favorably even with more expensive systems, too. Our $2,599.99 review configuration of the HP Omen X scored higher on PCMark 8 (3,931) and was faster at Photoshop (2:38), but less adept at the more highly threaded CineBench (774) and HandBrake (57 seconds). Exactly the same was true of the 2016 Alienware Aurora and the Origin Chronos VR, each of which in our review configurations cost more than $3,600; the $4,182 Falcon Northwest Tiki; the $4,737 Kaby Lake–equipped Digital Storm Velox; and the $4,999 Asus ROG GT51. We've only seen appreciably better results from truly luxury gaming desktops, like the Falcon Northwest Talon and the Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock, both of which use the 10-core, 20-thread Intel Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition CPU. Still Good for Gaming When it comes to gaming, a PC's graphics card generally matters more than its processor, and because the Gamer Master Ultra at this price only has one GTX 1080, it can't really compete with the dual-GPU behemoths on the market. But the hardware that's here ensures the computer is still more than sufficient for full HD or VR gaming. Compared with the Acer Predator G1 and the HP Omen X, the Gamer Master Ultra smoked the 3DMark Cloud Gate and Fire Strike Extreme tests: It scored 45,751 on the former and 10,164 on the latter versus 30,584 and 9,263 for the Acer and 32,071 and 9,469 for the HP. Likewise, on our Heaven and Valley tests at 1,920-by-1,080 resolution with graphics quality set to Ultra, the CyberPower desktop sailed through with 133 frames per second (fps) and 109fps, respectively, versus the Acer's 121fps for both and the HP's respective 126fps and 124fps. It falls a little short, but at full HD, these differences are gravy anyway. Upping the resolution to 4K (3,480 by 2,160) caused frame rates to drop significantly, as you'd expect, but Heaven was still at 33fps and Valley at 42fps—above our 30fps threshold for smooth playability, and, in both cases, above the Acer (30fps and 38fps) and the Omen X (30fps and 40fps). Ryzen Shine The CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra is the first in what will undoubtedly be a long line of desktops challenging conventional notions of where the intersection of performance and budget should lie. For less than $2,500, you're getting a high-end gaming machine that's also adept at handling heavily multithreaded workloads. This has been Intel's exclusive province for years, and the composition (and pricing) of high-end and luxury gaming desktops has reflected that. And if you want to push the gaming envelope to the edge and beyond, with super-high 4K frame rates, you're best off going with a high-end gaming desktop, like our Editors' Choice, the Digital Storm Velox. The Ryzen 7 1800X provides an enormous performance benefit you'll see and feel in most other usage scenarios, particularly with software that can use its prodigious number of cores and threads. And because the chip is such a good deal, the same is true of a computer that uses it and uses it well. The Gaming Master Ultra falls squarely into that category, turning out not just luscious frame rates at 1080p, decent ones at 4K, and solid VR potential, but giving you additional processing capabilities you've never had before at this price. Factoring all this together with its forward-looking potential, the Gamer Master Ultra replaces the Acer Predator G1-710-70001 as our Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops.

Lenovo The new Lenovo Yoga 720 is an example of modern technology done right. The device, which was launched at Mobile World Congress (MWC 2017) in Barcelona, is technically a 2-in-1 gaming laptop thanks to its combination of power, flexibility and portability. The Yoga 720 is a multitasker’s dream machine. For a convertible, it packs a whole lot of power in its relatively slim frame. Boosting the Lenovo Yoga 720’s rep are the latest Intel processors (up to 7th gen Core i7) and up to 1 TB PCIe SSD storage. It carries 8 GB of DDR4 RAM on board, but can accommodate a maximum of 16 GB for double the muscle. The Lenovo Yoga 720 furnishes a 720p HD camera alongside a couple of JBL speakers (backed by Dolby Audio Premium software) and a built-in fingerprint reader for easy and secure log-in through Windows Hello. The device also comes with an optional active pen support for editing, note-taking and sketching. According to Lenovo, the company made it a mission to make the Yoga 720’s versatility cater to the needs of its users in every aspect. “Users need consistency and continuity across every facet of their lives (work, home, school, hobbies) and are weary of switching from one computer to another based on location or activity,” says the Chinese multinational tech company. “The versatile Yoga 720 is ideal for multitaskers who want to effortlessly switch between budgeting on a spreadsheet with full keyboard in laptop mode to sharing a video in tent mode.” The Lenovo Yoga 720 comes with an optional active pen support for editing, note-taking and sketching.  Lenovo Lenovo’s new device comes in two sizes and two display options. The 15.6-inch Yoga 720 and its smaller 13.3-inch brother are available in 4K UHD models (with 3,840 x 2,160 resolution) and FHD variants (with 1,920 x 1,080 resolution). The larger machine packs an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050M graphics card while the smaller unit comes with an Intel HD Graphics 620 video card. The 15.6-inch Yoga 720 can supposedly last up to 8 hours with the 4K UHD display and up to 9 hours with the FHD display. Meanwhile, the 13.3-inch version’s battery life extends up to 7 hours with the 4K UHD screen and up to 8 hours with the FHD monitor. Those who are interested in getting the Lenovo Yoga 720 should wait until its arrival in April.

They’re right to—it was an excellent speech. But the shift actually started a few weeks ago, during a few moments of the president’s Feb. 16 press conference.  While most of the rhetoric during that event was total Trump 2016, the president also gave viewers a rare glimpse into a man struggling to reconcile the bold and divisive promises he made on the campaign trail with the reality of being the person who ultimately must decide how to balance the rule of law with justice and morality. ADVERTISEMENT In the press conference, President Trump pledged to act with “great heart” when considering the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which temporarily stopped the deportation of individuals unwittingly brought illegally into the United States by their parents. The president followed those words a few days later with action, releasing rules that keep DACA in place. Democrats have said they are looking for a sign that President Trump is serious about immigration reform. That was it. The president understands there are policy, political and moral arguments against deporting these young people. Voters largely have rejected the idea of mass deportation. They too want a policy that is humane, one that balances “heart” with law. Even after this past election, polls show voters want federal policymakers to find a path to permanent legal status for undocumented migrants. Surveys also show most voters believe immigrants contribute to our society and that they also don’t buy the argument that immigrants are more prone to crime. (To be sure: DACA doesn’t allow criminals to stay in the United States. Successful applicants must be free of felony convictions and significant misdemeanors and be enrolled in school or in the U.S. military.) Mass deportation, even for the small population of DACA youth, also is costly. About $29 billion, or the price of adding another EPA to our bottom line. That’s worrisome when our national debt is approaching $20 trillion and when research shows immigrants are a net fiscal benefit to the U.S. Treasury. Finally, there’s the moral argument. President Trump made it clear he thinks about this issue as a parent—and he should. I have a seven-year old. She barely grasps the concept of borders and certainly doesn’t understand the rule of law. She follows her parents, trusting we won’t lead her astray. She’d blindly cross a border if I promised her Hogwarts, Harry, and Hermione were on the other side. In short: like those eligible for DACA, she’s an innocent. President Trump has taken the first step, but now he must work with congressional leaders on a more wide-ranging, permanent policy that increases security at the border, removes criminal migrants, and builds a legal immigration system that protects American workers and the productive young men and women who were brought here as innocents. The process won’t be easy. The hardline faction, including some in his own administration, will try to wrestle the president’s heart back, arguing he should reverse DACA. I personally encountered the hardline faction while working on immigration policy a decade ago during the Bush administration. In the first White House blogging effort, we reached out to individuals on both sides to try to correct misstatements (fake news?) about the 2007 reform legislation. Subscribing to the Reagan belief that coming to a new land requires a “special courage”—conservatives usually call this entrepreneurialism—I was surprised by the unwillingness to listen to the essential facts about the bill, and by the personal vitriol directed at anyone who dared dissent from the deportation line.   The fight then was bitter. It will be so again today, but in every presidency there are moments when a commander in chief must follow his heart and decide on his own how to balance humanity, morality, and the rule of law. This moment is yours, Mr. President. Rushton served in the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives from 2007 to 2009 and at the Republican National Committee from 2003 to 2007.

Ryzen's core and thread count look ready to take on Intel's high-end Broadwell-E desktop chips, but the dual-channel memory configuration's peak theoretical bandwidth is more in line with Intel's more pedestrian Kaby Lake Core processors. G.Skill probably saw this scenario coming, and it readied up its Fortis and Flare X lines of memory specifically designed and tested for AMD's AM4 platform. G.Skill markets its Fortis memory modules as a cost-effective solution for builders assembling a gaming-focused AM4 system. Fortis modules come in pairs with total capacity of 8GB or 16GB, allowing for four-DIMM configurations of up to 32GB. The 8GB kits are available in 2400 MT/s speed, and the 16 GB kits are offered in 2133, 2400, and 2666 MT/s configurations. The 8GB and 16GB kits 2400 MT/s kits are available with 16-16-16-39 or 17-17-17-39 timings. The company's Flare X modules are designed for maximum performance. G.Skill is currently offering 8GB and 16GB kits of paired modules, but the manufacturer says 32GB kits are on the way, allowing for Ryzen systems with up to 64GB of memory. The currently-shipping configurations are the same as the Fortis series, but G.Skill says 3200 MT/s and 3466 MT/s models are coming. The top-speed modules will only be available in a maximum capacity of 8GB per DIMM, though. The timings for the 2133 MT/s kit are 15-15-15-35 and the 2400 MT/s set is clocked at 16-16-16-39 or 17-17-17-39. Finally, the 2666 MT/s kit is set to 18-18-18-43. We were unable to locate product pages for the Fortis and Flare X memory modules on G.Skill's web site, but they're already selling at Newegg. The 8GB Fortis kits sell for $67 and the 16GB Flare X sets go for $130. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

(AMD) Stock Became a Market Stunner — Can it Last? AMD stock is defying gravity right now, but eventually, order will be restored By Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 3, 2017, 10:04 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(AMD) Stock Became a Market Stunner — Can it Last? Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock STILL Has What It Takes to Go Higher View All Posts If I’m being painfully transparent, I almost want to call Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) “fake news.” A little more than two years ago, AMD stock was trading for under two bucks. Now, it has been toying with $15 with little sign of slowing down. And I don’t consider a near 5% loss on the day to be a sign of anything. This is especially true considering Advanced Micro Devices is up 22.6% for the year so far. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr I understand the point that rallies can be extremely pronounced from the depths of market volatility. We’ve seen similar patterns in the number one rival for AMD stock: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Those that bought the dips in Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and held on for the big surge were handsomely rewarded. But these are companies that are recognized leaders in their field of specialty. AMD, in contrast, historically has been the discount leader, playing catch-up with the big boys. Still, AMD stock registered an amazing 295% run last year. Even more astounding, speculators that caught AMD in mid-February of 2016 saw their investment rise by around 600%! Go in hard with a couple performances like that and you’ll be out of the rat race in no time. But is there any growth remaining in Advanced Micro Devices? A Game Changer (Literally!) for AMD Stock InvestorPlace contributor Joseph Hargett certainly thinks so. His bullishness isn’t based just on the momentum begetting momentum thesis. Rather, Hargett sees the company’s latest Ryzen CPU as a game changer, something that will put the hurting on Intel. From the initial reports, it’s hard to disagree. Ryzen will go head-to-head with Intel’s flagship i7 processor, which isn’t a surprising move in and of itself. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have always warred for consumer attention like bitter siblings. Naturally, Intel has had the upper hand, whereas AMD was considered the “poor man’s Intel.” That same dynamic can be found in the markets, with AMD stock gyrating from euphoria to despair and back again. Although it’s a commonly expressed sentiment with mixed results, this time could be different for Advanced Micro Devices. The Ryzen is armed with more features than the i7, including attributes that are vital to its core video-gamer base. Most importantly, it clocks in at half the price of its rival’s offering, which will inevitably draw much excitement. AMD has previously supplied chips to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) for their video game systems. On the technical front, Hargett notes that there’s significant shorting activity in AMD stock. All it would take are a few good reviews, and that will send shares moving higher. Those who are short Advanced Micro Devices will have to cover their position to stay in it. But the overwhelming upside pressure could be too much, forcing them to close their transaction. In order to do that, borrowed shares of AMD stock that initiated the short would have to be bought back. After those market gymnastics, demand for AMD shoots even higher.

See Offers J.P. Devine Posted March 3 Updated March 3 increase font size Wanna dance to these ‘what ifs’? From life choices to politics to the Oscars, everyone has their own 'what if' lists, J.P. Devine writes. Share Comment Read Article What if, in 1953 in Air Force intelligence school, I had been sent to headquarters in Paris with my friend Cpl. Freddie Blackman, or to Rome with Sgt. Nick Lorre and Lt. “Scoop” Larkin, instead of drawing the wrong red envelope and winding up in Korea and Japan? Asia affected my life deeply in so many ways, but Paris, a writer’s dreamscape? Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → What if? I would probably still be living in Paris now, writing my sixth best-selling novel and married to a beautiful French girl. What if I had gone to Rome? Instead of pushing my wheelchair down the Via Flaminia in my early 80s, what if I had come home to St. Louis, retired from running a corner pizza shop after being divorced from Rosemary DeBranco, she of the thousand-and-one pastel angora sweaters and simple strand of pearls, whose father did own a chain of pizza parlors? What if? In Hollywood, I had three clear shots at a major career advancement; I passed on each because they involved typical Hollywood moral choices — long story. What if I had said, “what the hell”? I would now be a fat, old, retired drunken Emmy/Oscar winner living in the Actor’s Home without She, who would have opted out. But I did what I did and feel good about it, and married a beautiful French girl, and here I am suffering from a bad knee and writing humor at bargain prices to make you laugh in this winter of discontent. We all succumb to the “what ifs” once in a while. What if the fickle finger of fate, that mythical card sharp in that deep forest of fantasies where we keep that “I won the lottery” glow, had grabbed the political red envelope and given it to Hillary and company? We would all be singing “Happy Days Are Here Again” and tap dancing on top of the cars at the car wash. Our LGBT brothers and sisters and children would be tasting freedom and shedding fear. Our Hispanic brothers and sisters would come out into the sunlight without looking over their shoulders. Hawkers on the streets of Manhattan would be selling rainbow hijabs you could wear if you wanted to, or not. Many of you are lining the bird cage with my column now. Guess what? I love you anyway and remember, this is my column, not yours. Go get one. Today, let’s look at a series of “what ifs” as exemplified by the 2016 movies: For example: What if God, the great celestial card dealer of all, had intervened and kept anyone from being wise to the envelope handed to poor Warren Beatty? “La La Land” would have emerged from that debacle as the Best Picture, and I, and millions of others, would be happier this morning. Even in the current Russian winter of Washington politics, we would at least have something to hum about, something to makes us want to break into a tap dance on the darkest of our days. Maybe not you, but certainly those of us who needed to sing and dance our way out of the Great Terror Tsunami of the last election. I know; you’re one of the winner’s circle and “giving Trump a chance” crowd. But again, this is my column; go get your own. “La La” was a happy dance in a happy place. It made us remember Fred and Ginger, Gene and Debbie. It was full of primary colors. You remember primary colors from kindergarten? Nobody wanted the dull colors; we wanted red, green and blue, and then yellow thrown in. Well, some of us are emotionally still in kindergarten. We want a carton of milk and an orange at recess, penny candy after school; we want a box of crayons to brighten our days with. “La La Land” was that box of crayons. Opinion alert: “Manchester By the Sea,” beautifully acted, was a gray day full of gray people. “Moonlight,” even with its touching last stage love, had no moonlight to give a romantic glow to its victims. Somber. Final, a what if to those of you, even my friends, who say, “I don’t get the paper anymore, it’s too full of bad news.” What if this newspaper, with its “bad news,” was not in your box or on your doorstep this morning or ever again? All of you, my neighbors and friends, from Augusta to Sidney, Hallowell to Skowhegan, my faithful and random readers, have your own “what if” lists. Come tell me about them; write them in. It’s OK.

Written by Guest author 4 days ago Telecoms.com periodically invites expert third parties to share their views on the industry’s most pressing issues. In this piece Professor William Webb, Director of Webb Search reviews the recent Mobile World Congress 2017 event and asks how much progress we have made towards the eventual 5G standard. MWC is the key calendar event for the mobile industry. With 5G deployment expected by some in the next 1-2 years, MWC 2017 was the moment for vendors to set out their stalls and operators to talk up their plans. Going into the show many expected wall-to-wall 5G wonderfulness, but things did not all go quite to plan. There was much of the “5G will connect everything perfectly” message, and most stands sported a car and a VR headset which either were, or could be “5G connected”. Intel, for example, demonstrated connected cars and cities, and announced testbeds or labs with Ericsson and Nokia. But Nokia was not quite on message, suggesting that they would not go along with an industry agreement to push for quick decisions on “new radio” to operate in non-standalone mode. Instead, they appeared to want to move straight to full 5G solutions. The CTO of Telefonica was also critical of the industry’s race to standardisation, suggesting it was closing down options too early and that the main focus in any case should be the network, not the radio. The reason for such haste appears to be impending fragmentation, with Verizon launching their own 5G standard and those keen on 2018 deployment looking for something they could claim to be 5G, while others were content to let the 3GPP standards process mature. An upbeat report from the GSMA warned about the dangers of fragmentation. But the solutions proposed to avoid it appear to be causing their own schisms within the community. The GSMA report represented one of the more rational outputs. While enthusing on how “5G will turbo-charge connectivity” it pointed out that new business models are needed, new network deployment approaches required and that the investment required is “huge”. It had some ideas on how new revenue might come from business services, but noted that initial 5G deployments would likely be enhanced broadband for consumers in dense urban areas. While there did appear to be a general view that 5G was mostly enhanced broadband, there was also fragmentation here. For example, Enrico Salvatore at Qualcomm said that the focus in Europe for 5G would be on the Internet of Things, leading globally on requirements and specifications, and that enhanced mobile broadband would be a North American and South Korean focus. As has long been the case with 5G, few are prepared to say anything negative in public, while many express scepticism in private (which is one of the problems with 5G, leading to a lack of healthy debate – so anyone out there who is prepared to be quoted please do step forwards). At Telecoms.com, Scott Bicheno penned an article on how the PR was disconnected from reality noting that “the word on the show floor at MWC 2017 is that the industry has completely got ahead of itself with all the highfalutin talk of remote surgery and sentient cars.” Rory Cellan-Jones at the BBC, while admiring Intel’s stand, noted: “a senior executive at one of the world’s biggest mobile operators, who took a very cynical view of his industry’s current state. ‘Who’s going to pay for it?’ he asked me, adding operators were already seeing their margins squeezed, as they battled with nimble newcomers such as WhatsApp, and had little appetite to pour money into 5G without seeing much of a return.” Rory then met with: “a chief technologist at a major networking equipment company – one that could stand to benefit from the 5G rollout. But he described the hype around the technology as ‘irrational exuberance’ – the same term used by an economist warning in the late 1990s about the dot-com bubble. He believed that current advances in 4G – what’s known as Gigabit LTE, which enables much faster data rates over existing networks – offered a more practical and affordable solution.” Amdocs, at least, were prepared to go public, with Telecoms.com reporting: “Gabriel Kerner – Amdocs head of product management – told us some use-case scenarios for 5G, such as gimmicky IoT toasters and fridges, are so ill-defined that the industry needs to take a step back and ask itself what it really wants to achieve. Being the first to deliver a technology that nobody really wants or needs is a pointless distraction and will end up being a wasted endeavour for everyone involved.” And Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global, Europe’s biggest broadband provider, was also not shy, saying: “You can wish all you want for 5G. You can have an overwhelmingly powerful vision for it. But without the capital it’s not going to happen.” Of course, I’m far from being an unbiased observer. My book “The 5G Myth”, published last November, suggests that the utopian vision is just not economically viable, and that consistent connectivity delivered using evolved 4G and Wi-Fi might better meet user requirements. Scott was on the same page, closing his piece with “Making sure everyone has a ubiquitous, safe, robust connection to the network may not be as sexy as 5G robot surgeons but it not only addresses a real, current issue, it is also an unavoidable prerequisite to all the other stuff everyone can’t stop banging on about here in Barcelona.” So we leave MWC 2017 none the wiser as to the business case, technology, deployment model or timescales for 5G. Instead, fragmentation and confusion appear even more likely than a year ago. There is little doubt that 5G will happen – too many players have staked too much to let it fade away. But there is much doubt as to whether it will just be an evolution of 4G or something revolutionary, and if the latter whether it will be a case of ‘irrational exuberance’ with all that entails. Illuminate or obfuscate? Perhaps MWC mainly served to cast more light on the cracks in the façade.   Professor William Webb is a Director of Webb Search and the author of “The 5G Myth: And why consistent connectivity is a better future”.

Initiative brings high-potential IT grads from West Bank, Jerusalem, to intern, soak up experience in multinational and Israeli companies By Dov Lieber March 3, 2017, 1:42 pm Tweet Email Print Share Writers Dov Lieber Dov Lieber is The Times of Israel's Arab affairs correspondent.

Taha did not manage to land a job in the Gulf. Instead, he worked for a short stint in a local construction company before landing a job for six months in Nigeria. Afterwards, he returned home, to work in the restaurant management business. Finally, he decided he was going to go back to school to study business at the Technion Institute in Haifa. Sari’s troubles are part of a much larger challenge for young Palestinians looking to break into the tech market. Palestinian universities produce around 2,000 IT graduates annually, according to a 2014 Paltrade report. But there are not enough jobs for them in the West Bank, nor according to the report, are these graduates “adequately skilled” to work in the local Palestinian IT market. The result is that most grads need look for jobs in the Gulf. And competition there is fierce. Fast-forward four years and Taha has sold his shares in a tech startup he cofounded and is now busy putting together the first-ever Palestinian tech park, which he hopes to transform into a Silicon Valley of the West Bank. The city of Rawabi — the first pre-planned Palestinian city touted as an example for what can be achieved in a future Palestinian state — has been earmarked to host the park. The fortunes of Taha, an East Jerusalemite, were changed by the Palestinian Internship Program (PIP), a three-year old USAID funded initiative that handpicks Palestinian IT graduates and sends them on internships in multinational companies and Israeli startups. The aim is for these Palestinian interns to soak up the knowledge of how to operate a successful and competitive tech startup and bring this knowledge back home to help build a Palestinian high-tech sector. Bereft of natural resources and without control over their own borders, Palestinians hope high-tech can play a major role in their flagging economy. According to the World Bank, the Palestinian gross domestic product (GDP) has been shrinking since 2013, mostly due to declining foreign aid. ‘Experience you can’t find in West Bank’ The PIP initiative was set up by Yadin Kauffman, an American immigrant to Israel who in 2011 co-founded Sadara (Arabic for “forefront”), the first venture capital firm to target Palestinian tech startups. PIP founder-chairman Yadin Kauffman, who is also a co-founding partner of Sadara Ventures/The Middle East Venture Capital Fund, the first fund targeting investments in Palestinian technology companies. (Courtesy) The $30 million investment fund gathered by Sadara, which is backed by first-rate investors including George Soros, AOL founder Steve Case, and former eBay president Jeff Skoll, as well as Google, Cisco and the European Investment Bank, has so far backed six Palestinian companies, three of which are start-ups. But Kauffman’s PIP initiative, which began holding its first internships in the summer of 2014, aims to provide the Palestinian tech sector with another kind of capital: experience. “I’ve seen through my work investing in Palestinian companies that there were lots of talented young graduates coming out of Palestinian universities who did not have any opportunity to work and gain experience in a sizable tech company,” Kauffman said in an interview with The Times of Israel. “That is something that is important for the professional development of these young graduates.” Kauffman, who took part in Israel’s tech-boom in the 1980s-90s as a venture capitalist, compared Palestinian internships in Israel to the valuable experience Israelis took home from working in Silicon Valley. PIP internships are paid three-month stints, supplemented by workshops, company tours, networking events and mentoring. Kauffman admits there is a limit to what one can learn in such a short period of time. “But,” he said, “at least it’s a taste of what a significant company looks like.” Nadine Handal, a female alumna of PIP from East Jerusalem who did software development while interning at Intel, said the program provided a “unique experience…not the kind you can find in the West Bank.” “PIP tries to put you in an environment with professional people who have deep experience in the industry and exposure to global markets. I wanted to gain that kind of experience,” she added. After she finished her internship, the East Jerusalemite was hired by Intel and worked there for a few years. After leaving her job in Israel, Handal, who studied computer engineering in the West Bank, is now studying data analytics in the United States. Her goal is to open up her own Palestinian data analytics company. “I hope to be one of the people who will bring this new knowledge to my community and to the Palestinian IT-sector,” she said. “It can provide job opportunities to a lot of talented Palestinian youth that are seeking opportunity. They will learn about a new and growing field and gain exposure to the advancements in technology in the world,” The unemployment rate in the Palestinian territories at the end of 2016 was at 27 percent (18% in the West Bank and 42% in Gaza) and job creation has not kept pace with the growth of the labor force, according to the World Bank. Handal said the PIP business seminars, in which top teachers, including from Harvard and Brown, train the interns in entrepreneurship, were the most useful to her. “I found these very helpful for me, especially because I come from a technical background with little knowledge of business and management,” she said. A win-win, strictly business relationship PIP, which incorporated in the US and receives funds from USAID, is intentionally kept apolitical. It’s strictly business. But PIP’s founder argues the result is one both Palestinians and Israelis—minus the political extremists on each—will welcome. “Pretty much everyone agrees it’s in Israel’s interest to have a Palestinian economy that is growing, able to employ people and succesful. Most people here [in Israel], on the right as well as on the left, understand it’s not in our interest to have unemployment or brain drain,” said Kauffman. Jesse Divon, 31, originally from England, is charged by Kauffman to run the PIP program. PIP program coordinator Jesse Divon speaks to prospective applicants in Jerusalem on November 14th, 2016. (Courtesy) “PIP does all the groundwork for its host companies – recruitment, selection, permits, accommodation near the company, signed agreements, and so on. Host companies are left only to interview PIP’s proposed candidates and – if there’s a fit – begin work.” Divon said that, while the logistics of bringing Palestinians from the West Bank into Israel are not straightforward, Israel’s Civil Administration, the military body responsible for Palestinian civil affairs, has been “cooperative” in the issuing of interns permits for the duration of their stay in Israel. The approval process for PIP interns is “very selective,” according to Divon. Only those who show true potential to fulfill the goal of PIP—to invigorate the Palestinian hi-tech sector— are taken on. So far there have been 30 PIP interns. In the latest round of internships, starting early 2017, Divon estimates that only around 10-15% of applicants will make it to intern at a host company. So far, more than one-third of the interns have stayed on working at their host company following the end of the internship, which, according to Divon, “is especially high given the logistical obstacles,” Divon said. “On the company side, there is often surprise at how much they benefit from participation in the program. Interns often greatly exceed expectations, while companies also appreciate the importance of increasing employee diversity and engaging in corporate responsibility,” Divon said. The Palestinian hi-tech sector is largely comprised out-sourcing companies, or copycats of existing businesses adapted to the Arabic language market. For example, the pre-eminent Palestinian start-up is Yamsafer, which is essentially the bookings.com of the Arab world. To date, no Palestinian tech company has been bought up by a larger firm or multinational. If just one Palestinian company would be acquired, Kauffman said, it would inspire other Palestinian entrepreneurs to try the start-up route and create some momentum. The ‘universal language’ of tech Taha, the mechanical engineer who could not find a decent job out of university, was hired by back in August by the developer of Rawabi, Palestinian businessman Bashar al-Masri, to join a team to create a tech-hub in the new Palestinian city. The hub, still in its early planning stages, could prove pivotal for the Palestinian high-tech sector, and if all goes to plan, according to Taha, it can be a boon to Israel’s high-tech sector as well. In this Friday, April 5, 2013 photo, Palestinians programmers attend a Ramallah Startup Weekend workshop in the West Bank city of Ramallah. .(AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed) “The high-tech/IT sector is one of the few options we have in order to create jobs and grow the economy to the size that the state won’t be as dependent on foreign aid as it is now,” said Taha. In 2005, the high-tech sector accounted for less than 1% of the Palestinian GDP. In 2008, after Cisco invested $15 million to create three big outsourcing companies in the West Bank, the sector has grown to almost 7% of GDP, employing some 5,000 people, a 2014 Paltrade report said. The Palestinian economy is largely dependent on foreign aid, and almost a quarter of the workforce is employed by the Palestinian Authority, according to a 2014 World Bank report. “What we hope to do in Rawabi tech-hub is to relocate the Palestinian high-tech companies, and try to bring in small multi-nationals to open operations in Palestine. This will increase the quality and competitiveness of the local talent,” said Taha. Taha’s capacity to shoulder the responsibility of creating Rawabi’s tech-hub is inextricably linked to his PIP experience, he said. He did his internship at Takwin labs, a Haifa-based venture capital that works specifically with high-tech Arab-Israeli companies. After his internship, he was hired to work at Takwin on a part-time basis. While at the Israeli VC firm, he conducted market research, performed due diligence, business development and financial budgeting, while also working on his own tech start-up: a manufacturer of renewable zinc-powered batteries that could help provide power to third-world countries. Taha sees Rawabi’s tech-hub as having a natural future partnership with Israeli R&D centers. “It will be better and less of a hassle if they could outsource to the Palestinian sector,” he said of Israeli hi-tech companies, some of which still outsource jobs to places like India and Ukraine. Israel is facing a shortage of skilled engineers and workers and is looking to tap into new sources of workers, including women, Arab and ultra-Orthodox populations that have been left at the fringes of the high-tech boom. “Palestine is closer in time-zone and in culture. You can arrange meetings between teams. In this generation, the technology crowd all speaks the same language. It’s universal,” he said. Large multi-nationals in Israel, including Cisco, Microsoft, HP and Intel already outsource to Palestinian companies in West Bank. The Israeli company Mellanox Technologies has been outsourcing programming jobs to Palestinians in the West Bank since 2010.

(Courtesy) The still untapped population of skilled workers bodes real potential for a Palestinian high tech market, said Dr. Paul Rivlin, a senior fellow and the Moshe Dayan Center and the editor of the Iqtisadi, a monthly publication on Middle East Economy. “Based on the fact that there is an educated and skilled population, one can be optimistic about the potential for the Palestinian high-tech sector,” he said, expecially in the Arab language based technologies. “The [Palestinian] market is very small, but size isn’t everything. The fact that they are small means less in hi-tech than anything. You don’t need a factory. You need a guy with a laptop,” he added. Israeli restrictions make it harder for Palestinian entrepreneurs to travel abroad or invite others to visit them, which hampers their ability to “build trust” with potential donors or colleagues. The business market in the Palestinian Authority is also often hobbled by the need to know “the right person”, he said, something which makes it harder to maneuver a business. But even considering all this, Rivlin said, the Palestinians can look to Israel as an example of a high-tech market overcoming the odds of being both small and bogged down by conflict. “Look at Israel. It’s not exactly how you would design a country to succeed,” he said. ” Yet with constant conflict, both internally and externally, the economy has grown enormously.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Interns from the Palestinian Internship Program (PIP) on a visit to Microsoft R&D center in Herzliya on July 20, 2016.

TurboStat Updated, More Power Management Code For Linux 4.11 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 3 March 2017 at 06:17 AM EST. Add A Comment One week after sending in the main power management and ACPI updates for the Linux 4.11 kernel, Rafael Wysocki has served up a second batch of feature updates for this next kernel version. This secondary PM update for Linux 4.11 includes fixes for a cpuidle menu governor problem, a fix for the Intel P-State operation mode, updates to the generic power domains, hibernation core cleanups, and other basic changes within the power management realm. Before anyone asks, no, there aren't any targeted Ryzen changes with this code. Perhaps more interesting are the turbostat updates for this Intel utility that lives within the kernel Git tree. TurboStat now has Geminilake support, better Bay Trail SoC support, several new options, more verbose output by default, and other changes.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 March 2017 by Military News AMD Ryzen™ 7 Desktop Processors Featuring Record-Breaking Overclocking Performance Available Worldwide Today Sydney, Australia, — March 3rd, 2017— After four years and thousands of hours of development, AMD today released the first three models of its highly anticipated, high-performance AMD Ryzen™desktop processor. Strong demand for these new desktop CPUs drove record pre-orders from more than 180 global etailers and boutique OEMs throughout the week prior to launch. Now offered for purchase around the globe, Ryzen is the first processor based on the entirely new AMD “Zen” core microarchitecture, bringing leadership multi-core performance for PC gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts around the world. “Today’s launch of Ryzen represents AMD at its best, delivering great products and innovation to the high-performance computing market,” said Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD. “With Ryzen 7desktop processors, AMD delivers to PC gamers, prosumers and enthusiastsboth the highest performance1 and the lowest power2 8-core desktop PC processors, bringing the absolute best PC experience to millions of people.”Availability Starting today there are three 8-core Ryzen 7 models available. Beginning in Q2 AMD expects to launch 6 and 4 core Ryzen 5 processors followed later this year by Ryzen 3, which is designed to bring more performance to mainstream applications. All Ryzen processors support the new AM4 infrastructure, with motherboard designs available from top ODMs. “Ryzen processors incorporate intelligent, performance-boosting technology that provides PC gamers, prosumers, and enthusiasts with incredible responsiveness, outstanding performance, and more immersive experiences, all in an extremely efficient package,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD. “In the near future we will bring to market additional lines of Ryzen processors, scaling from Ryzen 7 in the enthusiast segment, through high performance users with Ryzen 5, and then mainstream users with Ryzen 3. This CPU portfolio represents disruptive price-to-performance and compelling top-to-bottom features like unlocked CPU multipliers and AMD SenseMI Technology.” Alongside Ryzen 7 processors, AMD also announced the product specifications for two Ryzen 5 processors, and demonstrated the flagship Ryzen 5 1600X beating the flagship Intel Core i5 7600K by more than 60% in multi-threaded CPU testing3.     Product Line   Model   Cores   Threads   Base Clock (GHz)   Boost Clock (GHz)   Included Cooler   TDP4  (Watts)   On Sale Ryzen 7   1800X   8   16   3.6   4.0   N/A   95   Now   Ryzen 7   1700X   8   16   3.4   3.8   N/A   95   Now   Ryzen 7   1700   8   16   3.0   3.7   Wraith Spire   65   Now   Ryzen 5   1600X   6   12   3.6   4.0   Wraith Spire   95   Q2   Ryzen 5   1500X   4   8   3.5   3.7   Wraith Spire   65   Q2   In addition to being available to DIY builders and boutique PC vendors, in the coming months consumers will also be able to purchase Ryzen-based systems from top PC vendors. “As the eSports and virtual reality markets continue to grow, Dell is committed to offering cutting-edge technology to enable the best gaming and immersive experiences. We are excited to bring AMD’s new high-performance Ryzen processor to select desktop and All-in-One products in the coming months,” said Ray Wah, SVP, Consumer Product Group, Dell. “Experiences like gaming, eSports, and virtual reality push the performance limits of devices,” said Mike Nash, chief technologist, vice president of customer experience and portfolio strategy, HP Inc. “We believe there are a set of customers who will benefit from the new AMD technology and HP is excited to offer those customers devices powered by Ryzen.” "Lenovo is always exploring and creating new solutions to bring our customers innovative PCs that provide the most immersive computing experiences," said Johnson Jia, senior vice president, Lenovo’s PCs and Smart Device Business Group. "We’re excited to take our partnership to the next level with the revolutionary new Ryzen processor."Multiplier Unlocked During an event in front of global press, industry analysts, and partners last week, Ryzen CPUs were put through their paces and have already broken world records5. ASUS overclocking expert Jon “Elmor” Sandstrom, veteran overclocker Petri “SF3D” Korhonen and the AMD Ryzen OC team managed to push the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X CPU to over 5.35GHz with record breaking performance in the 8-core CPU category. The liquid nitrogen-cooled Ryzen CPU completed the industry standard Cinebench R15 and R11.5 tests with scores of 2454 and 27.40.

PC manufacturers may vary configurations yielding different results. Cinebench R15 nT is used to simulate multi-threaded CPU performance; the AMD Ryzen™ 7 1800X scored 1601.43, while the Intel Core i7-6900K Extreme scored 1473.79 for a benchmark score comparison of 1601.43/1473.79 = 1.09× or 9% more. RZN-92 Lowest power – Power efficiency of consumer client desktop 8-core processors based on Cinebench R15 nT score divided by wall power watts during testing. Scores: 1410 (AMD Ryzen 7 1700) vs. 1473 (Core i7-6900K). System config: AMD Reference Motherboard (1800X) and ASUS STRIX X99 Gaming (6900K), 16GB DDR4-2400, NVIDIA Titan X (Pascal), graphics driver 21.21.13.7633, Windows 10 x64 RS1. Measured system wall power during testing: 115W (1700) vs. 142W (6900K). Power efficiency: 1410/115=12.26 points per watt (1700) vs. 1473/142W=10.37 points per watt (6900K). Result: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 offers 18.22% more performance per watt. RZN-103 Testing by AMD Performance labs. PC manufacturers may vary configurations yielding different results. Cinebench R15 multi-threaded performance used to represent multi-threaded performance. The Ryzen 7 1600X (6c/12t) achieved a score of 1195 in the multi-thread test; The Core i5-7600K (4c/4t) achieved a score of 655 in the multi-thread test; resulting in a 69% multi-threaded performance advantage for the Ryzen 5 1600X. RZN-174 Though both are often measured in watts, it is important to distinguish between thermal and electrical watts. Thermal wattage for processors is conveyed via thermal design power (TDP). TDP is a calculated value that conveys an appropriate thermal solution to achieve the intended operation of a processor. Electrical watts are not a variable in the TDP calculation. By design, electrical watts can vary from workload to workload and may exceed thermal watts.

A new processor, an updated operating system, better battery life and that same sumptuous screen make this one hard to resist. For Modern OS Useful improvements across the board Probably the best Ultrabook (still) Against OS update still required for optimal performance QHD+ model is expensive Not really worth it if you already have the 9350 Last October Dell quietly updated its suave XPS 13 range of ultraportables. Pretty much since their inception, these beasts have been the undisputed champions of the premium laptop plains. Dell has hit on a winning recipe, and wisely chosen to only update and tweak it on this, its fourth generation. At the heart of the machine, there’s now a Core i5-7200U or i7-7500U processor. We tested the 2.7GHz i7 Developer Edition, which came with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and the same not-of-this-world 3200 x 1800-resolution glossy touchscreen as the previous model, the 9350. This notebook also ships with Ubuntu Linux, and since we already reviewed the Windows version, this write-up will be fairly Linux-centric. The main strong point in this outing is the migration to the Kaby Lake architecture. This promises around a 10% performance increase, improved battery life and, thanks to the new Intel HD 620 graphics, accelerated VP9 and 10-bit HEVC video playback. Beyond that we have a larger battery and a newer ‘Killer’ Wi-Fi chip from Qualcomm. Getting Linux to play nice with new and shiny hardware could potentially be a struggle, but Dell has worked hard to ensure that, while some benchmarks lag behind Windows, everything works exactly as it should.  While these things are just names, the Developer Edition moniker is something of a misnomer. Not all developers use Linux, and not all Linux users are developers. It’s heart-warming to see Dell supporting Linux, but maybe the firm should just call the proverbial spade a spade, and re-baptise this newest-born model as the Ubuntu/Linux/Penguin Edition (take your pick). Ubuntu 14.04, which shipped with the previous Developer Edition, is getting a little long in the tooth, so the update to 16.04 this time around is most welcome. That said, Kaby Lake did not receive mainline kernel support until the 4.5 series, and 16.04 ships with 4.4. However, installing a 4.8 kernel is easy using the recently pushed 16.04.2 Hardware Enablement Stack. Of course, one can always install a whole new flavour of Linux, and there are tales of success from users doing this with Ubuntu 16.10, Arch Linux, Fedora and many more. But it’s easier (and for many users preferable) to just install two packages (linux-image-generic-hwe-16.04 and xserver-xorg-hwe-16.04) and enjoy a modern kernel and video driver stack. This update will actually be pushed out automatically to desktop users in the coming weeks, but some people just can’t wait. Intel is a generous contributor to FOSS so its hardware is well-supported – the main issue is that it takes time for new hardware support to make it into fixed release distros. Spec Sheet Here is the Dell XPS 13 9360 DE configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz (3.5Ghz Turbo) Intel Core i7-7500U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 16GB LPDDR3 (1866MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch QHD+ (3200 x 1800) touch panel Storage: 512GB PCIe m.2 SSD Ports: 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 3.0 w/PowerShare, 1 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), SD card reader, headphone jack Connectivity: Qualcomm Killer 1535 802.11ac Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 720p widescreen webcam with dual mics Weight: 2.9lb (1.29kg) Size: 304 x 200 x 9-15mm (W x D x H) Software and Linux support After installing the HWE packages, we were met with very tiny text and icons in the Unity interface. It turns out that scaling is handled differently with the new drivers, but all it takes to remedy is adjusting the Scaling setting in the Displays applet. Setting it to 2 will make things comfortable again, but young ones who still have keen eyes may prefer something closer to 1.5. The main desktop environments in Linux all have good support for scaling on HiDPI screens, so installing Gnome or KDE (or a whole new distro that uses one of these) won’t cause any problems. However, certain proprietary applications have hard-coded font sizes, which means they don’t respect the desktop environment’s scaling settings. The main culprits here are Steam and Spotify. Steam can be fixed using the HiDPI skin available on Github, and Spotify can be fed the ‘--force-device-scale-factor’ option. In days of old, Linux users were at a disadvantage when it came to BIOS updates. Vendors used to supply DOS executables for updating the BIOS, which were meant to be run from the Windows ‘Boot to command prompt’ option. It is possible to use these with, for example, a bootable FreeDOS USB, if one wants an entirely libre solution, but these can be quite tricky to make. Now we live in a UEFI world and would much rather have a cleaner way to freely freshen our firmwares. That way, dear readers, is the fwupd tool, and Dell has made enormous contributions to its development. Dell has also provided handy recovery tools in case things go south. When Kaby Lake was introduced, there was some concern that laptops on Linux were not entering the deepest sleep C-states, C8-C10. However, our tests with powerstat showed that these states of near-hibernation were entered after a relatively short idle time, and that idle power consumption was a mere 6.5W. Battery and benchmarks During our Phoronix Test Suite (PTS) benchmarking, temperatures, as reported by lm_sensors anyway, did occasionally become worrying. In particular the FurMark benchmark (which scored a respectable 473 points at 1080p) saw core temps rise as high as 85 degrees. At this temperature you’d hope for some fan noise, and there is some, but even at full power the sound of the fan whirring doesn’t become obnoxious. While the left-hand side of the keyboard did get warm, it was never uncomfortably so, suggesting that ventilation and heat dissipation worked well here. The CPU is only dual-core, but still managed to build a 4.9 kernel in just under four minutes. PTS’ sparse matrix multiplication test reported an impressive 1029.63 Mflops. Given all the native caching it’s hard to get reliable numbers for the SSD (PTS’ IOZone test generated some impressive, though impossible readings), but using dd (with the conv=fdatasync,notrunc options) reported write speeds of 567MB/s and read speeds (after clearing the cache) of around 1.2GB/s. Using mpv with all radios disabled and at 50% brightness, we managed to get 8 hours of full-screen playback with the 720p version of Sintel, and 5 hours with the 4K version. The taxing Unigine Heaven benchmark at 1080p managed 17 frames per second windowed and 8 fps full-screen, which tells you that this machine will struggle with triple-A games.  Final verdict The XPS 13 retains its crown as the undisputed champion of the Ultrabook market, and one can only admire Dell for its unwavering Linux support on a flagship machine. Don’t be misled by the name – it’s not just for developers, and can happily play less-demanding modern games at reasonable settings. Of course, such treasure comes at a price and though the QHD+ screen is something to behold, some people will prefer to settle for the HD version. Those who do will get a consolation prize of improved battery life, but will never know the joy of the tiny pixels and vibrant colour reproduction which the fancier screen is capable of.

The Obama administration officials sought to ensure that something like Russia's meddling in the 2016 election never happens again and to set up a future investigation into the matter with a "a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators," the New York Times reported Wednesday, citing former American officials. American intelligence agencies and European allies had provided the Obama White House "damning" information that showed meetings taking place between Russian officials, and others close to President Vladimir Putin, and associates of Trump, according to the Times. A former intelligence official confirmed to Fox News that the Obama administration's goal was to "keep the Russian issue alive" and ensure evidence of Moscow's reported election interference was widely disseminated. Normally such circulation is kept private, but the former official said the Russia hacking issue was so serious that two versions of the intelligence were created–one for the public and the other classified. To make sure the intelligence could be seen widely by people with the necessary security clearances, officials would ask specific questions and then archive the answers to be easily discovered by future investigators. The "raw" intelligence was given a low classification level to enable more people to access the files. Reports on the Obama administration's efforts to preserve intelligence regarding contact between Trump associates and Moscow coincided with the revelation Wednesday night that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Senior congressional Democrats have called on Sessions to resign for not disclosing the meetings during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general. Sessions has maintained that he did not discuss any campaign-related issues with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Session's spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said Thursday that the former Alabama lawmaker met with Kislyak as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who "had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors" last year.

Sessions had said at his confirmation hearing he had no contact with Russians during the election. The Hill's Jordan Fabian has more on the recusal: "I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign," he said at a press conference. Sessions had come under mounting bipartisan pressure to recuse himself after it was revealed late Wednesday that he spoke twice with the Russian envoy last year and failed to tell senators during his confirmation hearing.

TRUMP VISITS AIRCRAFT CARRIER: As the controversy around Sessions swirled in D.C., President Trump headed to Newport News, Va., to tout his planned defense budget in a speech aboard the soon-to-be-commissioned U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. The speech was more notable for what wasn't said than what was -- Trump didn't mention the Sessions controversy. In terms of his defense budget, Trump repeated his promise for a "great rebuilding" of the military. "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world," Trump said. "We will give our military the tools you need to prevent war, and if required to fight war and only to do one thing. You know what that is? Win. Win. We're going to start winning again." Trump has proposed a $603 billion base defense budget for fiscal 2018. The Hill's Max Greenwood has more on the speech here. HOUSE TO TACKLE 2017 DEFENSE SPENDING: Before Congress can get to Trump's fiscal 2018 proposal, it needs to pass spending bills for fiscal 2017, and lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill for defense. House appropriators unveiled a $577.9 billion fiscal 2017 defense spending bill in hopes of passing it quickly so that lawmakers can tackle a pending supplemental funding request and the fiscal 2018 budget.

US FORCES STRIKE AL QAEDA IN YEMEN: The U.S. military battered al Qaeda's Yemeni branch with more than 20 airstrikes overnight Thursday in the first known military operation in the country since a controversial raid that left one Navy SEAL dead. "U.S. forces conducted a series of precision strikes in Yemen against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, in the early morning of March 2," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement Thursday. "More than 20 strikes targeted AQAP militants, equipment and infrastructure in the Yemeni governorates of Abyan, al Bayda and Shabwah." The strikes were done in partnership with the Yemeni government, Davis added. "The strikes will degrade the AQAP's ability to coordinate external terror attacks and limit their ability to use territory seized from the legitimate government of Yemen as a safe space for terror plotting," Davis said. "AQAP has taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Yemen to plot, direct and inspire terror attacks against the United States and our allies. U.S. forces will continue to work with the government of Yemen to defeat AQAP and deny it the ability to operate in Yemen."

But what you don't see often is a company showing the instances where their hardware doesn't win. After Dr Lisa Su gave her initial presentation at AMD's Ryzen launch event in San Francisco, other speakers began to take the stage. But it wasn't until a breakout session afterwards where AMD delved a little deeper into gaming benchmarks for their 1800X 8-core CPU - as well as some figures for their 6-core offerings, Ryzen 5. Ryzen is officially on sale now, and the benchmarks were under NDA so I couldn't share them with you earlier. But what you'll see is the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 pitched against Intel's i7-6900K, i7-6800K and the more common i7-7700K, respectively, with Intel's CPUs coming out ahead for the most part. Images: AMD The CPU that's stands out to me is the Ryzen 7 1700, since it's priced at $469 locally (the kind of CPU people building a gaming PC for $2000 or under would consider). It's also a fraction cheaper, by about $20, than the i7-7700K used in the last slide. (The gap between the 1700 and the 7700K in GTA 5 at 1440p is pretty stark, mind you, considering both machines are running a NVIDIA GTX 1070 GPU.) If you're interested, here was the settings AMD say they used for all six machines in their testing: Image: AMD It's a bit of an odd mix, but it's also missing a few titles that have favoured AMD over the last year. There's no Total War: WARHAMMER, which AMD was a big supporter of prior to release, and there's no Hitman or Rise of the Tomb Raider, two other games that have been staples in DirectX 12 testing. But those games have also been good to AMD graphics cards, not AMD CPUs in particular. And one point AMD frequently hammered home in San Francisco was that they were still in the process of optimising their compilers and reaching out to developers, which should result in performance gains down the road. (Those performance gains will probably be marginal, as you often see with driver updates, but every bit adds up.) Right now, AMD's pitch is all about the value play. As far as they're concerned, their CPUs are cheaper - significantly so, in the case of the 1800X - and the performance is comparable, if not marginally better in certain scenarios. And having more cores means they'll get more usage out of non-gaming applications, like streaming or video encoding, too. But gamers will want to keep an eye on what those scenarios are. Right now, the price difference between the Ryzen 7 1700 and the i7-7700K is pretty negligible. But if you happen to be a streamer? Or you're a game developer who does a lot of encoding/rendering and you want an 8-core or 10-core CPU? That's a different equation. Either way, it's always interesting to see a company come out with tests that don't always show their product winning. Gamers, and the tech world, is so often accustomed to the opposite, tests that are skewed just the right way so CEOs and PR can say "we have the fastest product EVER". AMD's pitch is a little different. Third party benchmarks might not be quite as flattering - and we'll have our own in the next week or so - but it's a refreshing change of message nonetheless. The author travelled to San Francisco as a guest of AMD. Comments justachap @justachap Mar 3, 2017, 11:43am Looked at the prices for these new CPU's and they don't seem that much cheaper compared to the Intel CPU's. Unless if they just had a price drop? Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 3, 2017, 11:48am They haven't yet; I've been checking in with retailers to check just in case. The 6900K is still priced at $1400+ however, while the Ryzen 1800X is about $700. The difference between the 7700K and the Ryzen 1700 is pretty minimal in Australia though, which weakens AMD's messaging a tad. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 3, 2017, 12:21pm I probably wouldn't expect the 6900K to come down by much until the KBL-X CPUs hit in a few months. There's an opportunity here for AMD to pick up some of the HEDT market if they can convince people that it's better to buy now for cheap than wait to see how KBL-X looks. Are these the benchmarks you mentioned in your reply to me last article, Alex? You mentioned benchmarks that you had (or had seen) but weren't allowed to talk about yet. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 3, 2017, 12:27pm Basically. There were a couple of other graphs with the Ryzen 5 - but those weren't supplied to me, so unfortunately I can't republish it here. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 3, 2017, 12:32pm Does it mention anywhere what GPU they were using for these tests? Just curious how CPU-bound the results are or if none of them were being properly taxed. With a good GPU the CPU load usually isn't that stressful. On the settings table, systems C/D and E/F have the same settings so I'm guessing they had different GPUs in them. Last edited March 3, 2017 12:34 pm Reply 0 B-ob @beeawwb Mar 3, 2017, 12:36pm Alex mentions a "NVIDIA GTX 1070" in passing about one of the comparisons, assume it's that one. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 4, 2017, 8:59am TITAN X for the first two comparisons, GTX 1080 for the second, GTX 1070 for the last lot. Reply 0 twisti @twisti Mar 3, 2017, 4:49pm So basically Intel is still king for gaming. Hopefully these AMD GPUs will drop in price enough to justify the performance and lack of overclockability. Reply 0 xpz24 Guest Mar 3, 2017, 6:27pm its because most dx11 games will perform better with higher clock speed than more cores. Which is why a $309.99 i7 6700K will perform better than a $1,109.00 i7-6900K. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 4, 2017, 9:01am Yeah. The bet here is that games will start to take advantage of more cores/multi-threading and that the balance will tip to users with 6/8/10/12 cores in the next year, two years. (but that relies an awful lot on work from the developers, single core threaded performance is still a priority for developers because most PCs are 2 or 4 core systems, and Vulkan/DX12 is still in the early stages, so a lot of the benefits it provides isn't being taken advantage of) Reply 0 coldbin @coldbin Mar 4, 2017, 9:57am I hope you're right but we've been waiting 10 years since PS3, Intel q6600 days for developers to get off their asses haha. Reply 0 riddick @riddick Mar 3, 2017, 7:30pm You can only truly stress thus test the CPU's at lower resolutions such as 1080p many of these benchmarks are completely invalid for comparing these CPU's unfortunately and people are easily fooled! Reply 0 MediaSearchProgram Guest Mar 4, 2017, 5:56pm Dear Alex, Thanks for the information regarding AMD Ryzen benchmarks and your thoughts, I am happy to see AMD has after many years come out with a product that can be competitive in workstation and multimedia environments. Unfortunately it seems that they have not been able to grasp Intel's leadership when it comes to gaming side as the performance is lesser. I plan on making a video on YouTube, hopefully you will be able to view it and provide feedback. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jFuvAklYvYYIMXUUsixwA Thank you, Maximilian Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The brief, organized by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), is in favor of a suit brought by transgender student Gavin Grimm. Grimm alleges that Gloucester County School Board violated his Title IX rights by not letting him use the boys' restroom at his school. A federal court in June ordered the school board to give Grimm access to the boys' restroom. The Supreme Court, however, halted the lower court's order, and will hear the case itself. In their brief, the tech companies argue that reversing the 4th Circuit federal court's decision could have a harmful and far-reaching impact. ADVERTISEMENT "A reversal could embolden other local and state governments to enact legislation that also contravenes federal law and restricts transgender people's access to restrooms that comport with their gender identity, both in the public sphere and in the workplace," the brief reads. "This piecemeal approach will result in a geographic patchwork, the borders of which will be defined by the treatment of the transgender community. Such a result will have very real, adverse effects on amici's businesses." "These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America's leading businesses have their backs," said HRC President Chad Griffin in a news release.

SNAP, the company's ticker, closed its first day on the New York Stock Exchange at $24.48 -- a 44 percent increase from its $17 initial share price this morning. Snap's CEO Evan Spiegal gave an exclusive interview to the Los Angeles Times today, in which he addressed concerns that Snap would have trouble with future growth. "We built our business on creativity," Spiegel said. "And we're going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value." The IPO was the largest since Alibaba's in 2014.   ROBOCALLS TOP FCC MEETING AGENDA: The Federal Communications Commission will take up a proposal to crack down on robocalls from fraudulent numbers at its March open meeting, according to a tentative agenda released Thursday by Chairman Ajit Pai. As part of a pilot project to improve the FCC's transparency, Pai released the text of all six items that will be considered at the March 23 meeting. Included in that agenda is a notice of proposed rulemaking that would allow phone service providers to block calls from "spoofed" numbers, which disguise the source of certain robocalls. "The American people have long made it clear -- and industry, consumer groups, and government are unified behind them -- that they want unwanted robocalls to stop," Pai wrote in a blog post on Medium. "This month, we'll hopefully take an important step toward combating this scourge."

The three bills being pushed by the minority members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee would require the FCC to adopt rules to protect communications networks, set up an interagency panel to handle cybersecurity investigations and require Internet of Things devices to have certified cybersecurity standards. "Our networks and devices are the hub of our digital lives," Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.

Amazon's S3 cloud hosting service -- and the large swath of websites and apps run off the S3 platform -- were hobbled Wednesday, leading to consternation across the internet. The site explained the outage in a Thursday statement as the result of an employee trying to fix a billing server that had slowed. "Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended," said Amazon.

Rosenworcel previously served on the Commission from 2012 to 2017. She stepped down in January after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on reconfirming her.

The FCC is led by a chair and four commissioners, two from each party. Some speculated that Rosenworcel could be paired with a Republican nominee. Democrats at the time accused Senate GOP leaders of reneging on a deal to fill the FCC's two current vacancies. The nomination was officially withdrawn on Feb 28th.

Freedman Mar 2, 2017, 9:58 AM We test our fair share of gaming desktops here at Tom’s Guide, and pretty much all of them feature one of  Intel’s Core i series of CPUs. That’s about to change. AMD has released its Ryzen processors, built on its “Zen” architecture, to take on Intel in the enthusiast, professional and gaming markets. While no pre-built systems with Ryzen have landed in our labs just yet, you can still get a taste of how a Ryzen CPU will affect your gaming when compared to a chip from Intel. Our friends at our sister site Tom’s Hardware built their own computers with the new Ryzen 7 1800X GPU to see how it handles gaming(to see even more granular benchmarks, including detailed settings changes and number of other variables in their review, here). Two other Ryzen series, Ryzen 3 and 5, are expected later on in the year. For these tests, a Ryzen 7 1800X CPU was paired with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU to avoid graphics bottlenecks and were compared to Intel’s Core i7-6900K and i7-7700K with the same GPU. Hitman On the Hitman benchmark, the desktop with a Ryzen 7 1800X reached 91.7 frames per second, while the i7-6900K config and i7-7700K build rendered at 105.3 fps and 106.3 fps, respectively. MORE: Gaming Desktop Buying Guide: 7 Things You Need to Know Metro: Last Light Redux AMD’s Zen architecture was more competitive when it came to the Metro: Last Light benchmark. The 1800X rendered at 91 fps, just a tad below the Core i7-6900K (93.7 fps) and the Core i7-7700K (93.8 fps). Ashes of the Singularity The Ryzen 7 1800X fell farthest in the benchmark for the real-time strategy game Ashes of the Singularity. It ran at 61 fps, falling behind the Core i7-7700K (84.7 fps) and Core i7-6900K (95.8 fps). Productivity Our sister site Anandtech ran some performance benchmarks on builds with the Ryzen 7 1800X and Intel Core i7-6900K. While Ryzen didn’t fare as well for gaming, it definitely holds up in productivity.

Why so different set of benchmarks for the 6900K series and Ryzen ? Did you guys 4k monitor has dissapeared somehow along with your faith ? 1 scirishman76 Mar 4, 2017, 10:39 AM Agreed Most of the benches I have seen has the Ryzen winning most in 4K and trading blows at 1440 while losing at 1080. Its Also true that I think some sites are intentionally not testing 4K. I read hardware reviews almost every day and almost every other cpu launched includes 4K gaming test...Why are so many reviewers leaving them out of Ryzen reviews. Especially since 1440p and 4k are not only where this cpu shines but also more realistic for people buying this kind of hardware. 0 Halonan Mar 4, 2017, 12:25 PM Anonymous said: I game in 4K. It takes alot more GPU/CPU power to keep the frame rates high. Ryzen consistently outgames Intel in 4K benchmarks. That is precisely why it isn't shown here. How can a first time poster have any evidence to support the accusation in your last sentence, halonan? You are correct. I was a first time poster. But I have been designing my own systems since the mids 80s. I don't think your number of posts makes you any more of an authority on any subject. I do, however, notice a large disparity in the 1080 benchmarks versus the 4k benchmarks. As far as evidence, it is everywhere. The demand on the CPU does not decrease when you raise the display resolution in a system. 4k uses more CPU (even moreso when in SLI or Crossfire). The workload of a CPU increases with increased resolution and framerates. Running on lower resolution does not magically cause more stress to the CPU. (A good demonstration of this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoQD9pDwXM ). My largest matter of contention here is this: If you game at 4k and get a tangible increase in performance at 4k when using the Ryzen in comparison to an Intel processor(using the same video card) then why only show the less demanding resolutions in the benchmarks? I am not a fanboy. In fact, in the last decade, the only thing AMD has accomplished in the desktop CPU market was to allow the stronger company to set prices even higher due to lack of legitimate competition. Now that we have competition, let's let it be a competition and test the system to today's industry standards on a level playing field. 0 AlienmanX Mar 4, 2017, 4:51 PM nvidia and intel are bum buddies, compare with an amd gpu. 0 Saga Lout Mar 4, 2017, 9:59 PM Anonymous said: You are correct.

Now, another poster has now pointed out that so have many other testers in not testing in 4K. 0 putergod Mar 6, 2017, 7:03 AM Toms has ALWAYS been Intel and nVidia biased! I've been an avid Toms reader since the Athlon days, and even when AMD was kicking Intel's behind, Toms was still highly Intel biased. 0 Halonan Mar 6, 2017, 8:30 AM My reference was to your masked accusation that Tom's was biased towards Intel in its tests. Now, another poster has now pointed out that so have many other testers in not testing in 4K. I have no masked accusations. I love hardware, not conspiracy theories or brand names. I did not insinuate that Tom's was on the take. I am merely pointing out that the author had a winner in mind when he drafted this persuasive review. Why present benchmarks that give one processor a clear advantage over others? Give a well rounded technical review with concise evidence and let the reader decide. To stack a deck, whether intentional or not, reduces the credibility of the author. Techspot put together a good review and had some pretty interesting findings about resolution effecting Ryzen benchmarks. "The key thing to note when comparing Ryzen against Intel CPUs is that the 1800X trails the 6900K by 12% at 1080p yet moving to 1440p shrunk that margin to a nearly insignificant 4%. You can likely guess what would happen at 4K." http://www.techspot.com/review/1348-amd-ryzen-gaming-performance/page5.html This thread is about benchmarks and performance, not Red vs. Blue. As a 4k gamer, I can attest that the CPU does play a role in higher resolution gaming. I don't need numbers for 1080p alone, that is inconclusive. Gamers buying new hardware aren't looking to support yesterday's tech. They are buying 1440p or 4k monitors. 0 Comment Firstname Submit Latest in Gaming PCs Reference AMD Ryzen: What Gamers Need to Know Reference Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti: Everything You Need to Know by Michael Andronico Feb 28, 2017, 8:03 PM Review Falcon Northwest FragBox Review: $5,000 Worth of Awesome by Michael Andronico Feb 25, 2017, 6:00 AM Face-Off Alienware Alpha vs. Aurora vs. Area 51: What Should You Buy? by Michael Andronico Feb 17, 2017, 3:58 PM Review Dell XPS 27 Review: A New Standard for All-in-One Audio by Michael Andronico Feb 13, 2017, 2:22 PM Best Picks Best Gaming Desktops 2017 by Michael Andronico Feb 9, 2017, 7:32 AM Review Lenovo IdeaCentre Y710 Cube Review: Road-Ready Warrior by Michael Andronico Feb 8, 2017, 10:22 AM The Latest On Tom’s Guide News 4 hr Sonos Expands Home Theater Speaker Lineup With Playbase How-To 8 hr How to Turn Off Location Services on iOS How-To 9 hr Samsung Galaxy S5 User Guide Round-Up 10 hr Best Mobile Strategy Games Deals 10 hr Score a Free $60 Gift Card with Your GoPro Hero5 Purcha...

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170302006194/en/ Kathy Winter is vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Division at Intel Corporation. (Credit: Intel Corporation) As the mom of four boys, I have spent countless hours hearing about "superheroes and their awe-inspiring "superpowers. Each son had his favorite over the years, and often dinner-table conversation turned into a debate about which superhero was the most powerful. My boys kept me busy, and I would often tell them I had a few superpowers of my own  like the ability to "run faster than a speeding bullet when I could see them getting into trouble, or a "spidey sense that would give me clues as to what they were up to even when I wasnt with them. When 5G arrives, we will all get the chance to experience something akin to the superpowers we chatted about when my boys were little. It will bring to our autonomous driving world superpower-like connectivity, giving cars a near-instant advantage of time and information  kind of like a "sixth sense. It will allow lightning-fast communication between cars and networks and the "things around them, which makes it possible to detect whats coming around that next corner, or miles up the road. It will have "pipes big enough to handle the massive amount of data that autonomous vehicles will use on a daily basis. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel As the leader of Intels Automated Driving Solutions Division, Im often asked two questions about 5G for autonomous driving: Why are you talking about 5G now when its so far off? And, more skeptically, whats wrong with the communication technologies were deploying today, such as DSRC and 4G LTE? Ill start with that second question because I think the answer is important to understanding how the autonomous experience is enabled. Plus the answer to that second question also helps answer the first. Autonomous cars will need two things to operate safely: ultra-fast communication between nearby cars, things and the cloud, and near real-time data about their surroundings. Both DSRC and 4G LTE are fast. Both provide the connections to other vehicles and nearby things. But neither technology was designed for transmitting big data files really quickly. And both technologies experience a modest amount of latency, which may seem "good enough but becomes a problem when your autonomous car is platooning with 100 other vehicles at 80 mph down the highway. But big data files are reason enough to align autonomous driving to 5G. Lets face it, self-driving cars will consume data voraciously  specifically high-definition 3D maps that will help them navigate safely. And no vehicle will have the storage capacity for all the worlds maps. Theyll need pieces of them relative to their immediate location  like the metropolitan area where they travel daily, or the freeway system and nearby roads connecting two cities. No communications technology can handle the transfer of these big files  were talking terabytes of data. Only 5G mmWave spectrum provides the speed and bandwidth to allow quick transfer of big data files during opportunistic moments, such as when stopped at a gas station. When 5G networks are deployed, we expect much of this data to be available through edge devices, such as cellular base stations. Intel and Ericsson demonstrated how this works at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week. Which brings me back to that first question: Why 5G now? For the simple reason that the work were doing today wont manifest itself for a few years. Carmakers are making design decisions today for the autonomous vehicles that theyll deliver in 2021. With 5G expected in that same timeframe, they need to include 5G in their design plans now in order for those cars to be ready when 5G is turned on. Theres a lot of work to do between now and then as far as standards, infrastructure and more. But the short of it is that 5G and autonomous vehicles must arrive together, which means planning for that arrival date today. And Intel is doing just that. We were first to deliver a 5G automotive platform to enable carmakers to start developing their autonomous driving systems. We were the first to demonstrate live 5G over-the-air communications between the car and nearby edge devices. And well lead the industry to an on-time arrival of 5G and self-driving cars in 2021.

Source: REUTERS/Pentagon/Handout/Files    Fatal Yemen Raid Yielded Intel On ‘Hundreds’ Of Al-Qaida Operatives Saagar Enjeti Reporter 3:13 PM 03/02/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5511436 U.S. intelligence officials are now trying to identify hundreds of al-Qaida operatives with contacts gleaned from a late night Jan 29 raid by Navy SEAL team 6 deep inside Yemen, CNN reports. The reports contradict previous claims from NBCNews Tuesday that no actionable intelligence was gained from the raid. President Donald Trump, the Pentagon, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer have consistently said the intelligence gained from the raid was valuable, and would save American lives. Officials told CNN that some of the operative contacts found in the raid were in the West, but not in the United States. U.S. officials also found information regarding training camps used by the groups, explosive-manufacturing techniques, and possible targets being considered by the terrorist group. The raid has become a hot-button political issue after Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Ryan Owens was killed in the midst of the operation. New details of the raid indicate that after the SEALs pushed the al-Qaida terrorists out of their primary residence, they retreated to a nearby building and began indiscriminately firing. The terrorists also lobbed grenades at the SEALs, despite the presence of numerous women and children. Innocent civilians were killed in the raid, the Pentagon indicated, emphasizing the women in the compound who took up arms against the SEALs. After the SEALs realized that they could not shoot their way out of the encounter they called for air support and extraction. A Marine Corps MV-22 lost power upon arrival and crashed, injuring three additional servicemembers. “Almost everything went wrong,” a U.S. defense official told NBC News after the operation. The father of Owens told the Miami Herald he spurned Trump when the coffin arrived at Dover Air Force base, and that he demanded “an investigation” into his son’s death. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to the request Monday, saying that the U.S. military would already be conducting three separate investigations into the incident, and defended the raid. “I can tell him that on the behalf of the president his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid as I said before was going to help save American lives,” Spicer said.

In Sessions’ Senate confirmation hearing, former Saturday Night Live comedy star Al FrankenAl FrankenSessions on Russia testimony: 'My answer was correct' Dem threatens to block deputy attorney general nominee over special prosecutor Franken: Sessions should come back before the Judiciary Committee MORE referred to scurrilous allegations being peddled around Washington by a former British intelligence operative, about Donald Trump’s alleged “ties” to Russia, including secret meetings between Trump campaign officials and Kremlin emissaries. ADVERTISEMENT Senator Franken mentioned alleged meetings and contacts where three Trump campaign staffers were supposed to have travelled to Europe for secret meetings with Putin emissaries. Then he asked Senator Sessions if he was aware of contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russians. That is when Sessions volunteered that he had appeared as a campaign surrogate, and hadn’t had meetings with the Russians.   It’s very clear that Sessions was referring to the allegations Franken and others had been making about Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and Michael Cohen. The former British intelligence operative, whose “investigation” was bought and paid for by the Democrat National Committee, claimed that Trump lawyer Cohen had met with Russian agents in Prague. Cohen subsequently presented his passport to his boss to show he had never left the country during that period. Democrats hate Jeff Sessions because he is tough, he is determined, and he is fair-minded. They know he will change the way the Department of Justice has done business over the past eight years. For example, he is likely to reinvigorate DoJ investigations into voter fraud, and to drop politically-motivated investigations launched by his predecessor. Example: just this week, the DoJ dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Texas over its voter ID law. Attorney General Sessions is also likely to cut off a political slush fund administered by the Department of Justice that funnelled an estimated $3 billion to left-wing activist organizations. Washington is nothing if it is not about the money, and whose ox gets gored. After taking out LTG Michael Flynn, they smell blood in the waters. Last week, Democrat activists at CNN made an attempt to smear White House advisor Dr. Sebastian Gorka, creating a story, made up of whole cloth, that somehow Gorka was a closet anti-Semite. What they really feared, of course, was Dr. Gorka’s outspoken support for defeating radical Islamic terrorism and winning the war of ideas against the ideology motivating the jihadis who want to kill us and destroy our way of life. When that failed, they looked for fresh meat. The attack on Attorney General Sessions is the continuation of a Democrat party effort to undermine the Trump administration with allegations of untoward Russian influence. In addition to the scurrilous dossier from the former MI6 operative, which has been dismissed as total fantasy by the FBI, former Obama administration and Clinton campaign operatives continue to make dark allegations that somehow the Russians “have something” on Donald TrumpDonald TrumpDHS head: US may seek better vetting from 13 or 14 more nations Student objects to Trump University settlement: report Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey, Trump at odds on wiretapping | Obama advisers press Trump to act on cyber MORE and could be subjecting him to blackmail. One player in these sordid efforts at disinformation is former Obama Pentagon official Evelyn Farkas. Ms. Farkas, who was a deputy assistant secretary of defense handling Russia and Ukrainian issues, resigned in September 2015 because she grew frustrated with President Obama’s handling of the Russian annexation of Crimea and its occupation of Eastern Ukraine. So she joined the Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonSamuel L. Jackson blasts Carson's slavery comment Grassley: 'Too soon' for decision on special prosecutor in Trump-Russia probe Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey, Trump at odds on wiretapping | Obama advisers press Trump to act on cyber MORE campaign as an advisor, noting that Mrs. Clinton “got it” on Russia. (Exactly why anyone thought Mrs. Clinton would get tough on Russia when she approved the sell-off of America’s uranium deposits to Kremlin interests while Secretary of State, then sat back as the beneficiaries of those deals funnelled over $100 million into the Clinton Foundation coffers, continues to baffle me). Ms. Farkas has appeared repeatedly in media outlets and op-ed pieces, peddling her bill of goods questioning whether Donald Trump has been “compromised” by Russia. Last month, she called for an independent investigation into Trump administration ties to Russia in mid-February 2017, saying the core question was, “Are you susceptible to blackmail from a foreign entity or individual?” On Wednesday night, she told MSNBC host Brian Williams that she was part of an effort, described by the New York Times, to “preserve” classified intelligence about the alleged Trump-Russia ties, by making sure it was sent to Democrats on Capitol Hill. Funny how MSNBC consistently introduces her as a Russia expert and former Pentagon official, but fails to mention that she was a Hillary Clinton campaign advisor. She launched her Russia smear of Donald Trump in an April 2016 column in Politico, titled: “Trump and Putin: Two Liars Separated at Birth?” Once again, a left-wing media outlet failed to disclose her relationship to the Clinton campaign. It should be obvious to any disinterested observer that we are witnessing a political witch-hunt, not an actual investigation., The Democrats are grasping at straws, and I believe they will soon regret their overreach.

The installations are part of a new “smart city” scheme that aims to monitor traffic and crime. With this news has also come many questioning whether this is an overreach into personal privacy, which is something that wasn’t properly investigated prior to approving this plan. Jen Lebron of the mayor’s office said, “it’s anonymous data with no personal identifiers,” since apparently the video quality will be low enough to individual identification.   However, this seems somewhat contradictory to what the new technology is meant for, which is, according to GE and the city, “to locate gunshots, estimate crowd sizes, check vehicle speeds and other tasks.” This begs the question, how can the technology properly monitor crime if it the cameras don’t record detailed video? While the new additions might not be infringing on personal privacy, it will certainly collect data that, as a whole, people may be opposed to being a part of. Especially because the city stated that it intends to make the data available to businesses. “San Diego is a very early adopter. While it’s a smallish deal in dollars it’s the biggest deal of this kind yet,” said Maryrose Sylvester, chief executive officer of GE Current. Everyone seems to be in agreement of the fact that this deal is revolutionary and that San Diego will be one of the first cities to test the “internet of things” technology that GE Current already provides for private buildings. One added benefit is that the information could be made available to developers who are interested in creating apps. Apps that show the safest way to walk home or locate available parking spaces could be a result of this new technology. Data from the new nodes will be available as early as this fall, and the technology was wrapped into a $30 million deal that San Diego struck with GE for a light upgrade that will save the city an estimated $2.4 million every year.

Image Credit: VentureBeat/Chris O'Brien Clearly just about every major company exhibiting at the mobile industry’s largest trade show got the memo about connected cars being the future. While a visitor had to go hunting to find displays of new smartphones, connected and autonomous vehicles were everywhere this year. Automotive manufacturers had previously participated at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. But many, such as Ford, significantly expanded their presence or, like the Renault-Nissan Alliance, made their first official appearance. By the same measure, chip makers and telecom carriers were eager to highlight their roles in enabling the connected and autonomous cars. “Automotive is a great opportunity for us,” said Laurence Bryant, vice president of the personal mobile compute business line at ARM Holdings. Indeed, ARM CEO Simon Segars had previously predicted that automotive demand for chips will increase by 50 percent over the next three years. Renault-Nissan announced a partnership with Transdev, a French public transportation develop, to begin developing mobility services with fleets of autonomous, electric driverless vehicles for both public and on-demand transportation services. “We have all the building blocks to produce the vehicles for this market of the future,” said Ogi Redzic, senior vice president of connected vehicles and mobility services for Renault-Nissan. Over at Intel’s booth, the company was showing off a BMW 740i that was equipped with Intel GO, an open platform the company wants OEMs and suppliers to use to develop their own autonomous and connected vehicle solutions. The system sits in the trunk and can plug into a vehicle’s computer system, providing both 5G connectivity and the ability to take all the data off the car and funnel it up to the cloud. http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Autonomous-Driving-Intel-at-2017-Mobile-World-Congress.mp4 BMW had its own announcements at the show. It staged a demonstration of a BMW i3 that could parking itself using gesture control. A driver standing outside the car could guide the vehicle into a parking spot by waving a hand. The company also showed off its BMW Connected platform for in-car features including trip planning and other personalization features. The system runs off Microsoft Azure.

The car can run autonomously, and the company that said during a recent test, it was able to establish a link to control it over a 20 Gbps network. Above: The SK Telecom T5 Image Credit: VentureBeat/Chris O'Brien Perhaps one of the biggest connected car announcements at the show came from Peugeot, which unveiled its Instinct concept car at MWC. The car’s system is the result of a partnership with Samsung that uses the latter’s Artik Cloud IoT connectivity platform. Samsung built Artik to pull together all your personal info from your gadgets and social network to build a profile for you that personalizes the car experience. Above: Peugeot Instinct Image Credit: VentureBeat/Chris O'Brien Mercedes-Benz’s exhibition space offered virtual reality demonstrations of its CASE strategy (Connected, Autonomous, Shared & Service, and Electric Drive). These include a new car-sharing service the company announced, as well as its COMAND Online, which offers data about traffic to help drivers choose the best route. Ford announced a partnership with Vodafone to put 4G modems in its European vehicles. Those modems will create a Wi-Fi hotspot in the car that can connect up to 10 gadgets. But Ford turned more heads with its new concept called Autolivery, which would be a system using self-driving, electric cars equipped with drones to deliver stuff around cities.

In the speech -- billed partially as a State of the Union address -- Trump talked about what he's done so far and what he hopes to accomplish going forward. Read his prepared remarks, as distributed by the White House press office, below: "Mister speaker, Mister vice president, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice -- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land. We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials -- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed -- but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm. As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight . Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the court of appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other presidents combined. We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it's good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't even asking for change.  But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade. The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the "abandonment of the protective policy by the American government [will] produce want and ruin among our people." Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others -- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the interstate highway system.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country -- twice.  And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles:  Buy American, and hire American. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care. Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state -- it is unsustainable and collapsing. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges -- leaving many Americans with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken. Obamacare is collapsing -- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  Action is not a choice -- it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts -- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government. Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance -- and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines -- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more -- so why not join forces to finally get it done?  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind -- and the souls -- of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone -- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. But to create this future, we must work with -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust -- not drive the wedge of disunity and division. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE –- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight , has become a good friend of mine. Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands -- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis -- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna:  I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica:  I want you to know -- we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Finally, to keep America safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and -- if they must -- to fight and to win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation -- and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero -- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, "Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies."  Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom -- we will never forget him. To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific -- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people -- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past -- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding. America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.  America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask. When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears -- inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past -- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and -- Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless these United States."

His comments came after revelations that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice with Russia’s ambassador to the US and failed to disclose those meetings when asked about the topic during his confirmation hearing. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, shook his head and said “no” when asked if he agreed with having a special prosecutor. Nunes also reiterated he hasn’t seen evidence yet of contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign. He would not say if Sessions should recuse himself. Schiff said Comey briefed members in the committee for upward of three hours Thursday and offered new information that had not been provided to other Congressional leaders yet. Schiff would not specify what they talked about, but did say he was disappointed that Comey dodged lawmakers questions and that he wants Comey’s “full cooperation” next time. Schiff said the information the FBI has provided the committee is a “small fraction” of what the FBI has uncovered. The House Intelligence Committee set the scope of its own investigation into Russia’s interference on Monday.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple, Intel, Twitter, others support transgender student’s Supreme Court case By Levi Sumagaysay / March 2, 2017 at 9:13 AM Dozens of companies including Apple, Amazon, eBay, Intel, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have signed on to an amicus brief in support of a Supreme Court case involving a transgender student’s fight over which bathroom to use at school. The case involves Gavin Grimm, a transgender student in Virginia who claims that the school board in his county violates his Title IX rights — rules that prohibit discrimination in education based on gender — by not letting him use the boys’ bathroom. “Many amici employ and/or serve transgender people, and all amici are concerned about the stigmatizing and degrading effects of the policy adopted by the Gloucester County School Board, which restricts access to public school restrooms for transgender youth,” the brief reads. Two big tech companies missing from the amici: Google and Facebook. Some of the 53 companies that signed the brief, such as Apple, Salesforce, Twitter and Microsoft, also recently spoke out for transgender rights after Donald Trump’s administration’s move to roll back federal protections for transgender students. Google parent Alphabet and Facebook did, too. When contacted by SiliconBeat, a Facebook spokesman would not comment about the company’s absence from the list of signatories, referring instead to the social network’s recent statement regarding the Trump administration’s move: “We stand for ensuring equal rights for everyone, including transgender students, and will continue to advocate for more rights instead of fewer.” Google has not yet returned SiliconBeat’s request for comment. Other tech companies that signed on to the brief include Airbnb, Box, LinkedIn, Lyft, Pandora, PayPal and Yelp. Some non-tech companies on the list of signatories are Gap, MAC Cosmetics and Williams-Sonoma. “A reversal could embolden other local and state governments to enact legislation that also contravenes federal law and restricts transgender people’s access to restrooms that comport with their gender identity, both in the public sphere and in the workplace,” the brief, put together by the Human Rights Campaign, says. “This piecemeal approach will result in a geographic patchwork, the borders of which will be defined by the treatment of the transgender community. Such a result will have very real, adverse effects on amici’s businesses.” A federal appeals court last year ordered the school board to let Grimm use the boys’ restroom, but the Supreme Court put a hold on that decision. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court are scheduled to start March 28, and a ruling is expected in June. But there is talk about possibly putting the case on hold because of the Trump administration’s action.   Photo: This file photo taken on May 4, 2016 shows a sign posted outside Santee High School’s gender-neutral restrooms in Los Angeles.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 02, 2017 11:22am   Comments Share: Related AMD Advanced Micro Devices Investors Flee From 45 Million Share Block Trade Advanced Micro Devices Stock Falls Following Poor Review Of Ryzen 7 Buy AMD At $12.25 - Cramer's Lightning Round (3/3/17) (Seeking Alpha) Loop Capital Markets' Betsy Van Hees argued in a research report in early February that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)'s stock is "being priced to perfection," and there is zero room for any missteps in 2017. Unfortunately for AMD's investors, the stock was trading lower by more than 2.50 percent on Thursday; there appears to be some early indications that its 2017 performance won't be as perfect as many had hoped. Negative News According to PC Gamer, AMD's much anticipated Ryzen 7 product isn't all it's cracked up to be. Specifically, the AMD's CPUs have been trailing Intel's performance over the past 10 years, and nothing has changed with the Ryzen 7. See Also: Intel Sets A Low Bar With Disappointing Guidance PC Gamer argued further argued that the Ryzen 7 offers plenty of power but also an "underwhelming" gaming performance. "With the huge strides in performance relative to the archaic (in CPU terms) FX-8370 Vishera chip, I expected Ryzen to achieve parity with Intel's X99 processors," PC Gamer wrote. "It gets there in the CPU-centric tests, but falls well short on gaming performance. And I don't really have a good explanation, other than the feeling I keep getting that Ryzen was pushed out the door before it was truly ready." At last check, shares of AMD were down 5.55 percent at $14.13. Image Credit: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Bottom Line Loaded with AMD's new flagship Ryzen 7 1800X CPU, the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra is a compelling fusion of gaming and processing performance at a delectable price. By Matthew Murray What Nvidia began with the release of its Pascal graphics architecture last fall AMD is now continuing with its new Ryzen CPUs: Both are changing how much performance you can expect for ever-decreasing amounts of money. The first computer we've seen that fuses both technologies is the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra, a $2,399 gaming desktop that, when it comes to processing chores, can also hold its own against some desktops costing thousands of dollars more. If you're willing to shell out more cash, you can find a better pure gaming system. But if you want something that's capable at work as it is at play, it won't be easy to find something better balanced than this. //Compare Similar Products Compare Acer Predator G1-710-70001   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen X   %displayPrice%%seller% Alienware Aurora (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Origin Chronos VR   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG GT51   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Talon (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Tiki (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Velocity Micro Raptor Z95   %displayPrice%%seller% MSI Trident   %displayPrice%%seller% Design and Features The relatively low price of the Gamer Master Ultra might work in its favor in terms of its aesthetics. Like most boutique manufacturers, CyberPower can sometimes go overboard on the bling, but here the design is restrained and even—dare I say it?—elegant. The case is an Enthoo Evolv ATX, all aluminum and all black along the front and top, except for the light-blue outlining the Power button (on the front of the top panel) and the activity light (on the bottom of the front panel). The center of the front panel is angled inward, bestowing a serious and mature look, and parallelogram-shaped vents along the left and right sides of the top panel add a bit of extra, low-key visual appeal. Tinted tempered glass doors cover not just the side of the Gamer Master Ultra that lets you view and access your components, but the other side as well, in case you want to show off the cable routing. (To open either side, just remove the four thumbscrews holding the door on, and then lift it straight off.) The biggest splash is made by the bright-white CyberPower logo applied to the primary door's glass panel. View All 6 Photos in Gallery There are a few shocks of white on the Gigabyte Aorus X370 Gaming 5 motherboard and the braided power cabling, an occasional flash of silver, and lighting accents (dull orange on the intake and exhaust fans, bright red on the motherboard itself), but otherwise the interior is awash in black. The top-mounted Corsair Hydro H110i GT liquid cooler, the two DIMMs of Corsair memory (totaling 16GB; the board can hold as much as 64GB), the EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 video card, the 850-watt Corsair power supply—all black. The 512GB Samsung SSD 960 Pro (for Windows and programs) and a 2TB 7,200rpm hard drive for storing files are tucked out of sight in the lower-right drive cage (which, of course, is black). There's no optical drive, which is fine given that these days you're more likely to download your PC games from a digital service like Steam or Origin, and having one on the front would only spoil the case's stylish austerity. (As it is, the easy-access ports—two USB 3.0, microphone, and headphone—and the Reset button are hidden by a flip-up door at the top of the front panel.) The back is necessarily a different story, as there you'll find the rear-panel ports: six USB 3.0, three USB 3.1 Type-A, one USB-C, two Ethernet, six audio (including S/PDIF), and PS/2 (for connecting an old-school keyboard or mouse). There's also an HDMI port, but you should defer instead to the ports on the graphics card, which comprise three DisplayPort, one HDMI, and one DVI. Power-Packed Processing Although you can't see it beneath the water block, the raison d'être for this system is the Ryzen 7 1800X processor. This is AMD's new top-end chip, which with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz and eight processing cores (which amounts to 16 threads), is a direct competitor to the Intel Core i7-6900K—but more impressive in some ways. That chip's base clock is 3.2GHz, and it has a higher TDP (140 watts versus 95 watts), but even more than that, it has a higher price. Whereas Intel recommends selling the Core i7-6900K for about $1,089, AMD has priced the Ryzen 7 1800X at only $499—a stunning difference for a processor this comparable. This becomes particularly important when looking at the Gamer Master Ultra's performance. Despite this configuration costing just $100 more than the Acer Predator G1-710-70001, our previous Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops, it soared past that computer on our multimedia tests. It finished our Photoshop filter application test in just 3 minutes, 1 second (the Acer needed 3:21), and our HandBrake video encoding task in 34 seconds (against the Acer's 56), and its CineBench rendering result was 1,621 (more than twice the Acer's 794). The only test on which it fell behind was the PCMark 8 overall system benchmark, with a result of 2,790 to the Acer's 3,623. See How We Test Desktops But the Gamer Master Ultra compares favorably even with more expensive systems, too. Our $2,599.99 review configuration of the HP Omen X scored higher on PCMark 8 (3,931) and was faster at Photoshop (2:38), but less adept at the more highly threaded CineBench (774) and HandBrake (57 seconds). Exactly the same was true of the 2016 Alienware Aurora and the Origin Chronos VR, each of which in our review configurations cost more than $3,600; the $4,182 Falcon Northwest Tiki; the $4,737 Kaby Lake–equipped Digital Storm Velox; and the $4,999 Asus ROG GT51. We've only seen appreciably better results from truly luxury gaming desktops, like the Falcon Northwest Talon and the Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock, both of which use the 10-core, 20-thread Intel Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition CPU. Still Good for Gaming When it comes to gaming, a PC's graphics card generally matters more than its processor, and because the Gamer Master Ultra at this price only has one GTX 1080, it can't really compete with the dual-GPU behemoths on the market. But the hardware that's here ensures the computer is still more than sufficient for full HD or VR gaming. Compared with the Acer Predator G1 and the HP Omen X, the Gamer Master Ultra smoked the 3DMark Cloud Gate and Fire Strike Extreme tests: It scored 45,751 on the former and 10,164 on the latter versus 30,584 and 9,263 for the Acer and 32,071 and 9,469 for the HP. Likewise, on our Heaven and Valley tests at 1,920-by-1,080 resolution with graphics quality set to Ultra, the CyberPower desktop sailed through with 133 frames per second (fps) and 109fps, respectively, versus the Acer's 121fps for both and the HP's respective 126fps and 124fps. It falls a little short, but at full HD, these differences are gravy anyway. Upping the resolution to 4K (3,480 by 2,160) caused frame rates to drop significantly, as you'd expect, but Heaven was still at 33fps and Valley at 42fps—above our 30fps threshold for smooth playability, and, in both cases, above the Acer (30fps and 38fps) and the Omen X (30fps and 40fps). Ryzen Shine The CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra is the first in what will undoubtedly be a long line of desktops challenging conventional notions of where the intersection of performance and budget should lie. For less than $2,500, you're getting a high-end gaming machine that's also adept at handling heavily multithreaded workloads. This has been Intel's exclusive province for years, and the composition (and pricing) of high-end and luxury gaming desktops has reflected that. And if you want to push the gaming envelope to the edge and beyond, with super-high 4K frame rates, you're best off going with a high-end gaming desktop, like our Editors' Choice, the Digital Storm Velox. The Ryzen 7 1800X provides an enormous performance benefit you'll see and feel in most other usage scenarios, particularly with software that can use its prodigious number of cores and threads. And because the chip is such a good deal, the same is true of a computer that uses it and uses it well. The Gaming Master Ultra falls squarely into that category, turning out not just luscious frame rates at 1080p, decent ones at 4K, and solid VR potential, but giving you additional processing capabilities you've never had before at this price. Factoring all this together with its forward-looking potential, the Gamer Master Ultra replaces the Acer Predator G1-710-70001 as our Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops.

The brief, organized by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), argues in favor of a suit brought by transgender student Gavin Grimm. Grimm alleges that Gloucester County School Board violated his Title IX rights by not letting him use the boys' restroom at his school. A federal court in June ordered the school board to give Grimm access to the boys' restroom. The Supreme Court, however, halted the lower court’s order, and will hear the case itself. ADVERTISEMENT In their brief, the tech companies argue that reversing the 4th Circuit federal court’s decision could have a harmful and far-reaching impact. “A reversal could embolden other local and state governments to enact legislation that also contravenes federal law and restricts transgender people’s access to restrooms that comport with their gender identity, both in the public sphere and in the workplace,” the brief reads. “This piecemeal approach will result in a geographic patchwork, the borders of which will be defined by the treatment of the transgender community. Such a result will have very real, adverse effects on amici’s businesses.” “These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America’s leading businesses have their backs,” said HRC President Chad Griffin in a news release. Fifty-three companies have signed the brief, including IBM, Lyft, Slack, Yahoo, Tumblr and Salesforce. Notably, Google, Facebook and Uber did not sign the brief. The companies, however, have voiced opposition to the Trump administration’s decision last month to rescind protections for transgender students. Google and Facebook also signed a letter last year calling on North Carolina to repeal its law restricting transgender individuals from using the bathroom corresponding with their gender identity. Uber said that it missed the deadline to sign the amicus brief but noted that it has voiced support for the LGBTQ community and legal protections for transgender individuals in the past. Google did not immediately return The Hill’s request for comment.   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 GOP releases bills to repeal and...

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 March 2017 by Military News AMD Ryzen(TM) 7 Desktop Processors Featuring Record-Breaking Overclocking Performance Available Worldwide Today New Ryzen 7 Processors Set to Reinvigorate the Desktop Computing Market; Unprecedented Pre-Order Sales Show Ryzen Leads Best Seller Lists SUNNYVALE, CA — (Marketwired) — 03/02/17 — After four years and thousands of hours of development, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today released the first three models of its highly anticipated, high-performance AMD Ryzen™ desktop processor. Strong demand for these new desktop CPUs drove record pre-orders from more than 180 global etailers and boutique OEMs throughout the week prior to launch. Now offered for purchase around the globe, Ryzen is the first processor based on the entirely new AMD „Zen” core microarchitecture, bringing leadership multi-core performance for PC gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts around the world. „Today’s launch of Ryzen represents AMD at its best, delivering great products and innovation to the high-performance computing market,” said Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD. „With Ryzen 7 desktop processors, AMD delivers to PC gamers, prosumers and enthusiasts both the highest performance(1) and the lowest power(2) 8-core desktop PC processors, bringing the absolute best PC experience to millions of people.” Availability Starting today there are three 8-core Ryzen 7 models available. Beginning in Q2 AMD expects to launch 6- and 4-core Ryzen 5 processors followed later this year by Ryzen 3, which is designed to bring more performance to mainstream applications. All Ryzen processors support the new AM4 infrastructure, with motherboard designs available from top ODMs. „Ryzen processors incorporate intelligent, performance-boosting technology that provides PC gamers, prosumers, and enthusiasts with incredible responsiveness, outstanding performance, and more immersive experiences, all in an extremely efficient package,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD. „In the near future we will bring to market additional lines of Ryzen processors, scaling from Ryzen 7 in the enthusiast segment, through high performance users with Ryzen 5, and then mainstream users with Ryzen 3. This CPU portfolio represents disruptive price-to-performance and compelling top-to-bottom features like unlocked CPU multipliers and AMD SenseMI Technology.” Alongside Ryzen 7 processors, AMD also announced the product specifications for two Ryzen 5 processors, and demonstrated the flagship Ryzen 5 1600X beating the flagship Intel Core i5 7600K by more than 60% in multi-threaded CPU testing(3). Product Line Model Cores Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) Included Cooler TDP4 (Watts) On Sale Ryzen 7 1800X 8 16 3.6 4.0 N/A 95 Now Ryzen 7 1700X 8 16 3.4 3.8 N/A 95 Now Ryzen 7 1700 8 16 3.0 3.7 Wraith Spire 65 Now Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 4.0 Wraith Spire 95 Q2 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 3.7 Wraith Spire 65 Q2 In addition to being available to DIY builders and boutique PC vendors, in the coming months consumers will also be able to purchase Ryzen-based systems from top PC vendors. „As the eSports and virtual reality markets continue to grow, Dell is committed to offering cutting-edge technology to enable the best gaming and immersive experiences. We are excited to bring AMD’s new high-performance Ryzen processor to select desktop and All-in-One products in the coming months,” said Ray Wah, SVP, Consumer Product Group, Dell. „Experiences like gaming, eSports, and virtual reality push the performance limits of devices,” said Mike Nash, chief technologist, vice president of customer experience and portfolio strategy, HP Inc. „We believe there are a set of customers who will benefit from the new AMD technology and HP is excited to offer those customers devices powered by Ryzen.” „Lenovo is always exploring and creating new solutions to bring our customers innovative PCs that provide the most immersive computing experiences,” said Johnson Jia, senior vice president, Lenovo’s PCs and Smart Device Business Group. „We’re excited to take our partnership to the next level with the revolutionary new Ryzen processor.” Multiplier Unlocked During an event in front of global press, industry analysts, and partners last week, Ryzen CPUs were put through their paces and have already broken world records(5). ASUS overclocking expert Jon „Elmor” Sandstrom, veteran overclocker Petri „SF3D” Korhonen and the AMD Ryzen OC team managed to push the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X CPU to over 5.35GHz with record breaking performance in the 8-core CPU category. The liquid nitrogen-cooled Ryzen CPU completed the industry standard Cinebench R15 and R11.5 tests with scores of 2454 and 27.40. The freely available Ryzen Master Software utility gives broad control of CPU settings allowing users to squeeze every drop of performance from their CPU(6). AMD Ryzen processors are available starting today at select etailers.

Home Newsletter Select Page Science fairs are out of date … or are they? by David Brooks | Mar 2, 2017 | Newsletter | 1 comment This is my Concord Monitor column this week: If you’re reading a column with “geek” in the title, you probably have fond and/or painful memories of being in a science fair. You know the routine: Find a project, run it for weeks or months, record data (maybe fudging it a bit), anguish over a write-up, then finally summarize everything on a trifold poster that you schlep into the school cafeteria on Science Fair Night, where you stammer through a prepared spiel for a procession of judges and friends’ parents. If you’ve forgotten what it’s like, you can check out NHTI next month when it hosts the annual New Hampshire Science and Engineering Expo, a science fair featuring teens from around the state. So it’s definitely part of the educational routine. But should it be? I ask because Intel, the computer chip giant, is dropping its longtime sponsorship of the International Science and Engineering Fair amid discussion about whether the whole approach is outdated in an era of hands-on Maker Faires, engineering contests like FIRST Robotics, and continuous online education. The resulting hand-wringing (a New York Times story was headlined “Intel drops its sponsorship of science fairs, prompting an identity crisis”) is particularly painful for the N.H. Science and Engineering Expo, a volunteer-run event that has spent years struggling to get recognition despite a lack of state support. “It’s kind of appalling when I compare New Hampshire to other states,” said Deb Shue, an engineer with MITRE Corp. in Massachusetts who is president of the NHSEE. She remembers a time when “only three states did not participate in the international competition, and New Hampshire was one of them.” “We are maybe similar to a regional fair in Massachusetts – it’s big bucks there. And Texas! Texas probably sends 30 to 40 students to international competition,” she said. In more than a decade of effort, the all-volunteer group slowly built up a cadre of judges – including me, an indication of how desperate they were at times – and developed the procedures and methods required by the International Science and Engineering Fair. That effort paid off. For the past two years it has been a real “state science fair,” able to send winning New Hampshire high school students to the national contest, where they’ve snagged several prizes. The prospect of having a rug pulled out from under the whole process is disheartening. Still, it never hurts to re-examine your premises. “I think that it’s time to adapt from that, definitely,” said David Benedetto, director of STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) at the New Hampshire Department of Education. “Science education is changing and the science fair needs to change with it – be more hands-on, constructivist, getting in and making things. . . . The three-panel fold-up is passive, not active.” “I don’t think we should drop the science fair, but adapt with the times, maybe have a traditional category and other categories,” he said. Careful what you wish for, Shue said. She argues that while those new approaches work for engineering and software, they are less effective for the life sciences, including medical and environmental projects, and they may not teach the communication skills necessary in the traditional approach. “We still need the outlet for the kids who are going to cure cancer, find ways to purify water,” she said. “There needs to be an outlet for basic research to be shown and shared, and the presentation part of it is an exceptional skill that these kids develop. They have to organize, present the material coherently, be able to tell people in 15 minutes what it’s all about; they are skills that allow to become a project manager going forward.” Indeed, there was a pretty good demonstration of that earlier this month, as the American Association for the Advancement of Science held its huge annual meeting in Boston. At least a half dozen lectures and discussion sessions anguished over how scientists can convey their work to the general public even as scientists were trying to convey their work to other scientists via science fairs. Except they’re not called science fairs when you’re a Ph.D. – they’re called poster sessions. But the idea is the same: Display your project on a single display board with illustrations/charts and stand in front of it to explain further, as necessary. So if you want your teen to become a real life scientist, maybe schlepping poster boards to school is more realistic training than you think. If you want to see a science fair done at a high level, check out the expo. It will be at NHTI on March 16, with projects available for viewing from 10 a.m. to noon, with a post-lunch award session and a speaker starting about 1 p.m. I won’t be a judge this year, so that’s one incentive to visit.

My experience as a parent and one-time volunteer is that many NH high schools aren’t even aware of it. That said, both of my children entered at various points and did well. At the time, they were the only kids from my school district to ever participate. Reply Submit a Comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Peter Bright - Mar 2, 2017 2:01 pm UTC reader comments 164 Share this story AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD Before the company's new Zen offerings, it's fair to say that AMD's last attempt at building a performance desktop processor was not tremendously successful. The Bulldozer core released in 2011 had a design that can, at best, be described as idiosyncratic. AMD made three bets with Bulldozer: that general purpose workloads would become increasingly multithreaded, that floating point intensive workloads would become increasingly GPU-driven, and that it would be able to aggressively scale clock speeds. Further ReadingCan AMD survive Bulldozer’s disappointing debut? Accordingly, AMD created processors with oodles of simultaneous threads, relatively long pipelines, relatively narrow pipelines, and relatively few floating point resources. The idea was that clock speed and the GPU would make up for the narrowness and lack of floating point capability. AMD hoped all those threads would be working hard. Each Bulldozer module could run two threads simultaneously, with two independent integer pipelines and one shared floating point pipeline within a module. Desktop processors shipped with two, three, or four modules for four, six, or eight threads in total. Compared to Bulldozer's predecessor, the K10, each integer pipeline was narrow: two arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and two address generating units (AGUs), instead of three of each in K10. So, too, was the floating point pipeline, with two 128-bit fused multiply-add (FMA) units that could be paired together to perform a single 256-bit AVX FMA instruction. AMD designed the processor with a base clock speed goal of 4.4GHz. Bulldozer? Bull💩, more like None of AMD's gambles paid off. The high-end desktop parts, with their four modules and eight threads, had an abundance of integer threads. But most consumer workloads still can't be distributed evenly across eight threads. Single-threaded performance continues to matter a great deal. On the other hand, the sharing of the floating point units means that applications stuffed with floating point arithmetic have too few resources to work with. While GPU-based computing is important in certain workloads—such as scientific supercomputing—mainstream applications still require the CPU for floating point number crunching. Bulldozer leaves them short. Even these issues might have been tolerable if the clock speed goals had been reached. A processor can get away with low instructions per cycle (IPC) if it runs at a high enough clock speed, but AMD came nowhere close to its 4.4GHz base goal. The top-end, four-module part had a base frequency of 3.6GHz. It could boost up to 4.2GHz under reduced workloads. This is a long way short of the design goal. Further ReadingAMD Ryzen 7 1800X still behind Intel, but it’s great for the price As a result, the first Bulldozer processors were in many workloads slower, yet more expensive, than their K10 predecessors. They were wholly uncompetitive with contemporaneous Intel parts. AMD did iterate the design. The top-end second generation Bulldozer, named Piledriver, boosted the base clock up to 4.7GHz and up to 5.0GHz boosted. Combined with some internal improvements, this made it about 40 percent faster than the top Bulldozer. This came at a power cost, however: to hit those clock speeds, the processor drew 220W, compared to 125W for the Bulldozer. The third-generation Steamroller made improvements to IPC and gained about nine percent over Piledriver. Fourth-generation Excavator added as much as 15-percent IPC over Steamroller. However, neither Steamroller nor Excavator were used in high-end desktop processors. The performance desktop space was ceded entirely to Intel. AMD did use Steamroller and Excavator in some of its APUs—"Accelerated Processing Units," which is to say, CPUs with integrated GPUs. But even in this space, the Bulldozer family has proved limiting. Mobile-oriented APUs in the 10-25W space only have one Excavator module (two threads). Their performance is substantially lower than that of Intel's chips in the same power envelope, and Intel manages to squeeze four threads (albeit only on two cores) onto its low-power processors. And to reach the ultra-low-power 3-7W space, AMD offers nothing at all with a Bulldozer-family core. The company has had chips operating in very low-power envelopes, but these have all used derivatives of the Bobcat core. This is a completely different processor design, developed for mobile and low-power operation. Bobcat derivatives are also used in the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One, and Xbox One S. By comparison, Intel's designs run the gamut (albeit with staggered release schedules); its Broadwell design ranges from two-core, four-thread mobile parts with a power draw of as little as 3.5W, up to 22-core, 44-thread server chips drawing 145W (or higher clocked 12-core, 24-thread parts drawing 160W). Time for something new Further ReadingBroadwell is coming: A look at Intel’s low-power Core M and its 14nm process By 2013, AMD had realized that Bulldozer was never going to be the processor that the company wanted it to be. A new architecture was necessary. AMD had a few particular goals for this: the new architecture had to be a viable challenger in the high-end desktop market, and it had to offer at least 40 percent better IPC than Excavator. Like Intel before it, AMD wanted its new design to span the full range from fanless mobile through server and high-end desktop. So this improved IPC needs to be wedded to improved power efficiency. But AMD isn't giving up on the Bulldozer ideas completely: the company still believes that high numbers of multiple simultaneous threads are the future, and some of the design decisions suggest that AMD still sees GPUs as being central to serious floating point number crunching. Four years in the making, the Zen core is the result of this new approach. And where Bulldozer failed to meet its objectives, AMD says that it has soundly beaten its 40-percent IPC improvement goal. In the single-threaded Cinebench R15 benchmark at a constant 3.4GHz, Zen achieves a score 58-percent higher than Excavator and 76-percent better than Piledriver. The typical IPC improvement, when compared to Excavator, is around 52 percent. It does this at significantly lower power draw, too: in multithreaded Cinebench R15, the performance per watt is more than double what it was for Piledriver. Compared to the Bulldozer family, Zen is so much better across the board that it makes for an interesting—if uneven—competitor to what Intel is offering. Years have passed since AMD could even hope to be considered a performance rival to its much larger competitor, but with Zen, AMD finally has an architecture that can compete.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology Innovation What is 5G? All the details of the new super-fast mobile internet technology explained 5G doesn't yet exist but specifications are on the way. Here's an explanation of the most technical terms. By Mary-Ann Russon Updated March 3, 2017 08:42 GMT After years of talking about it, 5G finally seems to be on its way. Here are some of the technologies that will be used to make super-fast mobile internet speeds possibleiStock There's a lot of buzz in the tech world about 5G, a next generation wireless networking technology that promises superfast mobile internet speeds capable of delivering high bandwidth content on the go. Envision streaming virtual reality experiences, video and music to hundreds of mobile users without the network breaking a sweat. However, it's important to note that 5G doesn't exist – yet. The specifications of the technology are being set out by global mobile standards body 3GPP. Meanwhile, mobile network operators are focused on trying to get as much as they can out of their existing 4G networks. To help you navigate this exciting, but rather complicated concept, here's an explanation of what exactly 5G is, and some of the technical terms you will hear mentioned frequently from now on, such as in this 5G news round-up from Mobile World Congress 2017, which contains announcements from the likes of Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia and BT. What is 5G? 5G will be the next generation of mobile network technology, enabling multi-gigabit per second (Gbps) internet speeds. In comparison, standard 4G LTE mobile networks provide average download speeds of up to 15Mbps in the UK, while the fastest 4G+ services offer an average download speed of 90Mbps (speeds provided by EE). For 5G signal transmission, the plan is to occupy part of the currently unused 28GHz and 39GHz bands, and refarm sub-6GHz frequency bands which are currently used for radio, TV and 4G transmission. What are millimetre waves? Millimetre waves fall in the extremely high frequency (EHF) class, also known as terahertz radiation, which ranges from 30GHz to 300GHz. These frequencies are found in the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared waves, and have wavelengths measured between 1-10mm. Millimetre wave offers more bandwidth than the sub-6GHz frequencies currently in use for 4G networks, but its use is hindered by a signal that only carries a few kilometres from the transmitter due to high free space loss and atmospheric absorption. With sub-6GHz frequencies being heavily crowded by existing communications technology, researchers are looking toward the vacant millimetre wave spectrum to expand their wireless networks. Research has shown that a network using millimetre wave will be possible, even though there are still many technical challenges that need to be solved. 5G will be needed to connect absolutely everything, from self-driving cars to virtual reality headsets to dronesReuters What is 5G NR? 5G New Radio (5G NR) is the new specification that is being devised by the 3GPP. The global mobile operator body GSMA is determined to see mobile operators deploy 5G wireless networks by 2020, but the industry is now aiming to make this possible by 2019. At MWC 2017 in Barcelona in February, a large number of key players in the global mobile industry, from smartphone manufacturers to telecommunications technology firms and mobile operators, agreed to collectively support and back the 5G NR specification, which is a huge step in the right direction. The firms that have agreed to support 5G NR include: AT&T, NTT DoCoMo, SK Telecom, Vodafone, Ericsson, Qualcomm, British Telecom, Telstra, Korea Telecom, Intel, LG Uplus, KDDI, LG Electronics, Telia Company, Swisscom, TIM, Etisalat Group, Huawei, Sprint, Vivo, ZTE and Deutsche Telekom. To deliver true 5G (known as 'Standalone 5G NR'), extensive infrastructure upgrades will have to be rolled out, such as new mobile base stations and transmitters. The consumer market will also be waiting for mobile phone manufacturers to produce 5G capable phones. It is unlikely that all this will be in place for a sudden switchover in 2019; instead the industry is going to gradually implement the new technology in stages. 'Non-Standalone 5G NR' will be the focus, making use of the existing 4G LTE radio and evolved packet core network and then adding a new 5G radio access carrier. What is MU-MIMO? Multi-user, Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is a Wi-Fi technology introduced in 2015 that enables routers to connect and transmit data from multiple devices simultaneously using beamforming. MU-MIMO works by transmitting radio signals in different directions at particular angles in order to better detect where the devices connecting to the internet are located in a room. The antenna makes small changes every now and then to strengthen radio signals going in some directions, while signals going in other directions are cancelled out. This Wi-Fi technology can also be applied to mobile networks. Current mobile base stations send singals out in a wide beam, but really the operator is only trying to connect to where a user and their device is located. All the rest of the signal waves being sent out that don't connect to a device are wasted. Mobile operators want to use MU-MIMO for millimetre wave transmissions because a direct line-of-sight connection (point A to point B) is needed to transmit data at high speed. Unfortunately people and their devices are unlikely to always be situated in an unobstructed path to the nearest mobile base station. Beamforming means that the user's device communicates with the mobile base station to let it know where its exact location is. Then, the mobile base station can immediately modify its phase and power to provide a better signal. Existing mobile networks connect with millions of users every second, but each connection is an individual conversation that the network is having with each user's smartphone. With MU-MIMO, the network can connect to multiple devices at the same time and use less bandwidth, instead of a blanket broadcast of signals over a specific geographic area, which means that there is more bandwidth available that isn't being wasted. Artwork of old mobile phones at MWC2017Reuters What is OFDM? OFDM stands for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing, which is a form of digital signal modulation in which a single data stream is split across multiple separate narrowband channels at different frequencies to avoid mixing up transmissions from multiple users. Imagine that the signal from the mobile network to the mobile base station and your smartphone is one big highway. Each text message you send to a contact is like a car on that highway, and the message your friend sends in return is another car. The mobile operator needs to make sure not to mix up all the messages being sent over the network, so it puts a guard between each message. It might take 2 seconds for each message to be sent and received by the network, including the time to put the guard down. With OFDM, instead of one car being sent down the highway, the message is split into four cars (four separate streams) that travel down the highway at the same speed. As there are four cars, not one, each car is lighter and travels faster, and there is narrower guard between each of the four parts, so the total time taken to send the message is shorter than sending it the old way. Also, splitting the message into four parts reduces interference and disturbance caused by electromagnetic fields from one signal affecting another signal in an adjacent circuit (known as crosstalk). What is adaptive self-contained TDD? TDD stands for Time Division Duplex, a single frequency band used to both transmit and receive data. The technology works by having the mobile network assign alternating time slots for transmitting and receiving data, whether it's voice, a text message or video. The data is transmitted in serial binary format. This technology works well to save spectrum space as it only needs one channel of frequency, but it requires precise timing and synchronisation to make sure that the timeslots don't overlap and corrupt the data flowing between the mobile network and the user's device. Imagine that each timeslot is like a single frame on the network, and each frame contains the message (being uploaded or downloaded to the internet), as well as details about the time it has been allocated. In the 5G future, the mobile industry wants to improve TDD so that each frame contains even more information, such as the upload or download scheduling information, the data being transmitted and the acknowledgement. This enables mobile operators to have intricate control over how and when each message is sent over the network. So for example, in the event of a natural disaster, if the police and first responders urgently need the network to communicate to save lives, the mobile operator will change the timeslots so that the police and firemen get the most bandwidth. In this case, the regular user who is streaming a YouTube video or FaceTime-ing their friend, will experience slower mobile internet as their timeslots for uploading and downloading data will be moved to the back of the queue. What is 5G TF? Verizon says that it has built a 5G network and that it is piloting 5G pre-commercial services in 11 cities (Washington DC, Miami, Seattle, Sacramento, Houston, Denver, Dallas, Brockton (MA), Bernardsville (NJ), Atlanta and Ann Arbor) starting from Spring 2017. Verizon is not supporting the 3GPP's proposed 5G NR specifications. Instead, it is working with a large number of partners including Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and Qualcomm in the Verizon 5G Technology Forum (5G TF) and using technical specifications developed from this to extend Verizon's 28/39 GHz frequency bands. Since 5G doesn't exist yet and there are still many challenges to be resolved for millimetre wave, and the fact that Nokia is working closely with Verizon, we wouldn't be surprised if the mobile operator is using Nokia's 4.5G and 4.9G technologies to expand the capabilities of its existing 4G LTE network to provide higher mobile internet speeds.

The data, which was collected from over 170,000 consumers, shows that Apple has slipped to the 20th spot on the list, while Samsung dropped to number 70. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Both of these rankings are significant changes compared to last year. Apple landed in the 10th slot last year, while Samsung had placed 17th. Though Samsung’s drop is obviously more dramatic, Apple’s is a continuation of the trend during the last few years. As for what Reputation Institute’s RepTrak study aims to show: “The annual Global RepTrak® 100 spotlights the companies that truly understand what they stand for and how to reinforce the emotional bond with their stakeholders across all the markets they serve,” Back in 2011, Apple was essentially tied as the number one most reputable brand, but since then the company has slowly been slipping. The fall from 10th to 20th marks its sharpest year-over-year drop yet. In the announcement, Reputation Institute’s chief marketing officer explained that it isn’t explicitly clear as to why Apple saw such a dramatic fall (via CNET): “Apple still has an excellent reputation for its products and corporate performance, but as the perceptions of its governance and citizenship fade, the company is starting to take a hit when it comes to its overall corporate reputation,” Allen Bonde explained. Samsung’s fall, however, shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise considering the company’s recent Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Coming in at the top of the list is Rolex, while LEGO Group holds the runner-up slot. Following those are The Walt Disney Company, Canon, and Google, who respectively round out the top 5. From there, Bosch, Sony, Intel, Rolls-Royce, and Adidas close out the top 10. Reputation Institute’s latest list comes following commentary from Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White last week, who explained that Apple has the upper hand on Samsung now more than ever. Samsung also recently dropped out of Fortune’s top 50 most admired companies, while Apple came in at number one. The full details concerning the RepTrak study can be read below: Rolex, Lego, and Disney Top Reputation Institute’s 2017 Global RepTrak® 100 – The World’s Largest Corporate Reputation Study Reputation Institute (RI), the world’s leading provider of stakeholder measurement, membership and management services, today announced the company’s annual Global RepTrak® 100 rankings. Based on over 170,000 ratings collected in the first quarter of 2017, the survey is the largest corporate reputation study of its kind, and includes comparative ratings, trends by demographic cuts, and unique insights into which companies are best regarded by stakeholders as well as what drives trust and supportive behaviors such as willingness to purchase a company’s products, recommend the brand, invest in or even work for the company. The top 10 companies in RI’s 2017 Global RepTrak® 100 are: 1.    Rolex 2.    LEGO Group 3.    The Walt Disney Company 4.    Canon 5.    Google 6.    Bosch 7.    Sony 8.    Intel 9.    Rolls-Royce 10.    Adidas “The annual Global RepTrak® 100 spotlights the companies that truly understand what they stand for and how to reinforce the emotional bond with their stakeholders across all the markets they serve,” said Michele Tesoro-Tess, RI executive partner. “This year’s Top 10 companies come from different sectors: reputation is a cross-industry asset and companies continuously invest on it because their leaderships finally recognized its impact on business performances.” RI’s RepTrak® System measures the general public’s perception of the world’s top companies on seven key rational dimensions of reputation: products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship, leadership and performance. An “Excellent” reputation is represented by an overall RepTrak® Pulse score of 80 or higher. For the first time, the company with the highest rating and the top spot (Rolex) falls into the “Excellent” range. A RepTrak® Pulse score of 70-79 is considered “Strong,” while 60-69 is “Average.” None of the companies in the 2017 RepTrak® Top 100 scored below 64. Regarding specific stakeholder expectations, respondents identified Rolex as the global leader in products and services, and LEGO Group as best in governance. While Google was perceived as leading in 5 dimensions: innovation, workplace, citizenship, leadership and performance. Key Trends by Industry: In terms of trends, 2017 saw the rise of heritage luxury brands like Rolex and Rolls-Royce, while consumer products took seven of the top ten spots in this year’s survey, with LEGO Group jumping 4 spots to 2nd, and Adidas moving into the top 10. In the tech sector, Intel returned to the top 10 (to 8th place) in 2017 after a one-year absence. Meanwhile Google (5th place) fell 2 spots, Microsoft fell out of the top 10 to 11th, and Apple slipped 10 spots to 20th place with a drop of 1.7 points. Samsung posted the most notable decline with its RepTrak® Pulse score dropping 4.0 points vs. 2016 and is now in 70th place overall. Among automakers, both BMW Group (12th place) and Daimler (27th place) both fell out the top 10, while Toyota, Honda, Ford and GM all showed modest gains vs. 2016. Meanwhile Volkswagen, who continues to deal with the aftermath of its emissions scandal nonetheless returned to the top 100 (in 100th place) and saw its RepTrak® Pulse score recover by 3.4 points to 64.73 – one of the largest increases in 2017. “For brands looking to benchmark how their reputation compares to industry peers, our Global RepTrak® 100 is the place to start,” said Allen Bonde, RI chief marketing officer. “Looking at top performers, it’s clear that offering high quality products, standing behind them, and meeting customer needs is foundational to delivering on the brand promise. But our data also shows that companies with a strong sense of purpose who are committed to improving on all dimensions of reputation – especially governance and citizenship – tend to be the most highly regarded.” Learn More and Get Your Company’s Pulse Score: On an annual basis, RI measures the reputation of thousands of companies using its RepTrak® framework, and for its Global RepTrak® 100 study measures the most highly regarded and familiar multinational companies in 15 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Think self-driving cars, telemedicine and VR reaching their true potential. Mobile by Roger Cheng March 2, 2017 5:00 AM PST @RogerWCheng I try my hand at remote surgery via a special glove, virtual reality and 5G. Celso Bulgatti/CNET You can't walk around Mobile World Congress without 5G slapping you in the face. If there's a phenomenon that's dominated this week's trade show besides the return of a 17-year-old phone, it's the reality that the next generation of cellular technology has arrived. Well, at least it's real in the confines of the Fira Gran Via convention center in Barcelona. Above the Qualcomm booth flashed the slogan: "5G: From the company that brought you 3G and 4G." If you took a few more steps, you could hear an Intel representative shout about the benefits of 5G. If you hopped over to Ericsson, you'd find a "5G avenue" with multiple exhibits demonstrating the benefits of the technology. Samsung kicked off its press conference not with its new tablets, but with a chat about 5G. More Mobile World Congress stories Nokia's nostalgia trap: The old-is-hot 3310 Moto Z, this is your mission: Make Motorola cool again LG G6 to Samsung Galaxy S8: Catch me if you can The hype around 5G has been brewing for more than a year, but we're finally starting to see the early research and development bear fruit. The technology promises to change our lives by connecting everything around us to a network that is 100 times faster than our cellular connection and 10 times faster than our speediest home broadband service. But it's not just about speed for speed's sake. While the move from 3G to 4G LTE was about faster connections, the evolution to 5G is so much more. The combination of speed, responsiveness and reach could unlock the full capabilities of other hot trends in technology, offering a boost to self-driving cars, drones, virtual reality and the internet of things. "If you just think of speed, you don't see the magic of all it can do," said Jefferson Wang, who follows the mobile industry for IBB Consulting. 5G is more than just speed, even if it'll be faster than your home broadband connection. Roger Cheng/CNET The bad news: 5G is still a while away for consumers, and the industry is still fighting over the nitty-gritty details of the technology itself. The good news: There's a chance it's coming sooner than we thought. It's clear why the wireless carriers are eager to move to 5G. With the core phone business slowing down, companies are eager for new tech to spark excitement and connect more devices. "We are absolutely convinced that 5G is the next revolution," Tim Baxter, president of Samsung's US unit, said during a press conference Sunday. Here's just a taste of what 5G will be able to unlock. Remote surgery Beyond speed, the biggest benefit of 5G is its low latency, or the short lag time between a device pinging the network and getting a response. While not necessarily noticeable, there is a lag with 4G LTE. A 5G network virtually eliminates it, meaning a surgeon may not need to be in the same room as a patient in the future. 5G lets you remotely perform surgery with a robot arm The demonstration set up by Ericsson illustrates the lag-free capabilities of a 5G network. by Roger Cheng 1:08 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Ericsson, working with startup NeuroDigital Technologies and doctors at King's College London, used a dummy patient to demonstrate how a surgeon could use a VR headset and special glove to control a robot arm that would perform an actual operation in another location. The glove was fitted with haptic feedback motors that buzzed when you touched the dummy's organ, giving you the sensation that you were actually touching it. Companies are calling this idea the "internet of skills" that would enable you to transfer your expertise over a great distance in real time using robotics and haptic feedback. Without the real-time 5G connection, the whole setup would be impossible. A touchy-feely internet The surgery feedback is just one example of how touch will play into the 5G network. With haptic feedback, you'll be able to transmit the tactile sensation of experience, enhancing the sights and sounds of a video experience. Another Ericsson setup put you in the driver's seat of a car 50 kilometers away from the Fira. Thanks to the feedback system built into the chair, you could feel yourself going over speed bumps and crashing into cones -- which I did at an alarming rate. "In order to touch and feel things miles away, you need low latency," Sprint Chief Technology Officer John Saw said in an interview Monday. That will have applications in the industrial area, including having humans overseeing robotic assembly. It's the first time the network will be faster than your mind, Ericsson Chief Technology Officer Ulf Ewaldson said in an interview Wednesday. Self-driving cars While companies like Google and Uber are investing in self-driving cars now, many in the industry don't believe a fully autonomous vehicle is possible without a 5G network. "We are absolutely convinced that 5G is the next revolution." Tim Baxter, president of Samsung's US unit. That instantly responsive network and ubiquitous coverage means the cars will be able to use 5G to talk to other cars and sensors built around the city, from street lamps to gas stations. "It not just about the cars," Adam Koeppe, vice president of network planning for Verizon, said in an interview Monday. "It's about urban design and technology." Drones Similarly, 5G will unlock the true capability of drones. Lynn Comp, director of market development at Intel, cited the example of a drone flying over an oil drill with a video camera. The network will allow for precise control of the drone, while sending back high-definition video. Virtual reality VR was a huge trend at last year's Mobile World Congress. But the technology took a back seat this year with little new hardware other than an update from Samsung. Meanwhile, virtual reality is in the hands of filmmakers, and it seems more happened at the recent Sundance Film Festival than at MWC. 9 Samsung's Gear VR gets a controller If there was any VR at Mobile World Congress, much of it was part of a demonstration of how 5G could enhance the experience, allowing you to chat in real time with live-streaming virtual worlds. Sprint Chief Operating Officer Gunther Ottendorfer said he expects to see a return of game arcades -- but focused on virtual reality. Guaranteed awesomeness Do you want to make sure you always have a dependable connection? 5G might be able to help with that. Phone companies already offer "service-level agreements" that guarantee a connection for mission-critical businesses and applications. With 5G, the networks will be smart enough to offer those guarantees to individuals. Of course, don't expect it to be cheap. Home broadband The most obvious application of 5G is as a replacement for traditional home internet service. And it's coming really soon, with Verizon and AT&T already investing in trials in the US. Of course, phones will eventually get the 5G treatment. Roger Gurnani, chief information and technology architect for Verizon, teased coming back to Barcelona next year with a 5G phone. That may prove overly ambitious, but Gurnani and the rest of the industry know there's a lot of work ahead and high customer expectations to fill. In the end, that's their priority. "It's not about the Gs," John Stankey, head of AT&T's entertainment business, said in a keynote Monday. "It's not about 5G or 5 gigs. It's going to be about more."

If you became a frequent computer user starting anytime between, say, 1990 and 2007, there’s a good chance that your idea of a PC is a desktop or laptop running a mouse-and-keyboard driven graphical user interface — most likely Microsoft Windows or, to a lesser extent, Apple’s (recently renamed) macOS. But if you got attached to computing in the last 10 years, you very likely find it more natural and comfortable to do your digital tasks on a multi-touch device lacking a keyboard or mouse and running a new, simpler and cleaner kind of operating system. This certainly includes an Android or Apple smartphone or, possibly, a tablet running Android or iOS. These devices have become by far the most commonly, frequently and extensively used personal computers. They are the new PCs. Even older people have taken to Android and iOS in a huge way, though they still rely on their traditional Windows and Mac laptops. Of course, personal technology never turns over entirely, especially in as short a period as a decade. So the redefinition of the PC is an ongoing thing. Even students who might otherwise be permanently attached to their phones are still likely to use a MacBook, Windows laptop or Chromebook some of the time. The redefinition of the PC is an ongoing thing. Also, there’s a difference between the two newer types of PCs. Despite maturing, smartphones are still wildly popular. But tablets — including the powerful, market-leading Apple iPad — are still too often viewed as unsuitable for productivity and creativity. Their sales have fallen sharply in recent years, partly because their replacement cycle is long. And there are all kinds of special factors that affect these changes. For instance, people who work in giant companies with rigid IT staffs may still be forced to use heavy laptops for tasks an iPad or even a smartphone could perform as well or better. Open-minded tech tinkerers may still prefer traditional PCs for work because they allow much more customization than, say, an iPad. And, even for those who recognize the speed and capability of tablets, the detachable keyboards available for them may be too inferior to the built-in keyboards on laptops to make it easy to rely on them as the principal device. But I believe this massive redefinition is real, and that there are signs of optimism for even the lagging tablet part of it. Signs of a tablet revival? The tablet — or perhaps more aptly, the large-screen mobile device — is showing new signs of interest. First, some clamshell devices — laptops — are getting ARM processors, the type that power most smartphones and tablets, and for which iOS and Android were built. That’s a big deal because the typical laptop has run on an Intel or Intel-compatible processor for eons. Google has even trademarked a name for the processor used in its newly released ARM-driven Chromebook Plus. Microsoft has announced that it’s making it possible to run classic Windows apps on ARM devices. There’s a good chance [Apple] will introduce ARM-based Macs. While Apple has been silent on this matter, I believe there’s a good chance it will introduce ARM-based Macs. This is partly because it has an entire silicon design arm that creates wicked fast, efficient, proprietary ARM chips that get produced in large quantities for iOS devices and run rings around the lowest, most battery-sipping Intel processor Apple uses in its smallest MacBook. In addition, Samsung just announced a new tablet, the Galaxy Tab S3, which is essentially an Android clone of Apple’s smaller iPad Pro. Both are squarely aimed at productivity. Both were built to use a detachable keyboard and a stylus. There's definitely something going on when the premium tablet designs from every major vendor are converging on the same idea. It’s the software, stupid But the signs of a shift to ARM only set the stage for a bigger development: The migration of the most important modern software platforms, Android and iOS, to laptops and other traditional hardware that once defined the old kind of PC. This is an exciting idea, for sure. But, I believe it won’t matter much until Apple builds an ARM-based laptop running iOS. Here’s why. Google and Samsung have just tried to do this with the Chromebook Plus. It’s the first Chromebook built from the ground up to run both the cloud-based Chrome OS and Android apps, so popular on smartphones. Sadly, the Android part of this device is currently a miserable failure, although it’s still in beta. This is mainly because there are few Android apps that have been optimized to run well on a large screen — even a typical tablet screen — and it will take a long time to change that. Microsoft, by contrast, does have a modern breed of multi-touch apps that work properly on a tablet or clamshell screen, and some are included on every Windows tablet and laptop. Unfortunately, partly because Microsoft has no smartphone business to speak of, it also lacks a critical mass of these new-style apps and, even on its tablets, relies instead on classic Windows apps. Apple, by contrast, boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen. This is more than a small advantage; it’s the reason people might buy this type of device instead of a traditional laptop. It’s up to Apple to save the iPad So … only Apple is well positioned to transform the laptop by creating one that runs just iOS. I am emphatically not talking about a traditional Mac, running macOS on ARM. Nor am I proposing a Mac that also runs iOS apps. I am talking about a laptop that only runs iPad apps, including the many productivity and creativity apps that have been built for that tablet. [Apple] could accelerate the redefinition of the PC. I believe this would accelerate the redefinition of the PC. It would also resuscitate the iPad, albeit in a different form factor, which would complement, not replace, the current slate and the macOS laptop. There would be many tradeoffs to be decided. For instance, should the screen detach to become a regular iPad? (I personally wouldn’t care.) Would you still need a trackpad? (Probably.) Would it be called a Mac, an iPad something-or-other, or an entirely new thing? (Probably not a Mac.) I asked Apple about this. I got a stock statement of allegiance to the current iPad and Mac, and a refusal to discuss future products. But Apple has just started a new ad campaign pitting the iPad Pro against PCs, and nothing in it mentions the clamshell or built-in keyboard. (Microsoft has run similar ads claiming its tablets are better than MacBook laptops.) Bottom Line The definition of a PC, a personal computer, is already undergoing a profound change. A great laptop running the new kinds of user interfaces and apps that people now love on phones and tablets would be a big, exciting event that would help seal the deal. But there hasn't yet been a product that emphatically suggests the era of the traditional PC is fading. And it feels like an opportunity only Apple can seize.

Apparently, the company’s current move to AMD GPUs on its products will help with the transition. However, a new report seems to suggest that the future of VR on the iMac 2017 is somewhat bleak. According to  Tech Crunch, Oculus is withholding support for the Mac for its Oculus Rift VR headset. This is mainly because the computers produced by Apple are not powerful enough to support VR gaming. Normally, a standard VR gaming rig like the Rift will require a PC with an Intel i5 processor and a graphics card that supports VR. While some of Apple’s devices even support an Intel i7 chip, some still lack the necessary graphics hardware. Although, to say the least, the Mac Pro is a very good candidate for a VR rig, there is still the question of cost. iMac 2015 (via apple.com) According to Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell, Oculus’ roadmap does not include the iMac 2017 support, at least for the time being. He also added that this does not mean that Oculus does not intend to support Apple in the future. The issue now is that Oculus does not have the resources to deal with it. Furthermore, dedicating an entire team for this will require a considerable amount of outlay. VR development for the Mac is not entirely new to Oculus. In fact, in the early days of the Rift, the company experimented with the Mac but deemed it unfit. This is because VR demands quite a lot in terms of hardware in order to work properly. Because the Mac is unfit for the Rift, the team immediately shelved the project. To date, there are no indications when Oculus intends to rehash the VR system for the Mac. At the moment, the details regarding the iMac 2017 are still shrouded in a cloud of mystery. So far, there are only a handful of leaks and reports about the all-in-one desktop. However, fans of the desktop may not have long to wait since it has been rumored that Apple might unveil the new iMac 2017 anytime soon. In fact, many speculations point to a possible March Apple event. Whether or not Apple makes it possible for VR to flourish on the iMac 2017, it is still too soon to tell. Consumers can only hope that they get the most from an overly priced machine that offers no means of upgradability. For more updates on the iMac 2017, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

Vulkan Descriptor Update Extensions Wired Up For Intel's ANV Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 2 March 2017 at 06:20 AM EST. 4 Comments Intel's ANV Vulkan driver in Mesa Git has picked up support for two more extensions of this week's big Vulkan update. Mesa Git now has support for VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template and VK_KHR_push_descriptor within the Intel ANV driver. These descriptor update extensions are a new way to update resource references between draw/compute dispatch calls. VK_KHR_push_descriptor allows descriptors to be written into the command buffer and VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template makes it easier to update a fixed set of descriptors. Supporting these descriptor update extensions in the Intel open-source Vulkan driver code-base just amounted to a few hundred new lines of code. More details via the commits. The Intel developers are rather prepared for Vulkan 1.0.42 and keeping their Linux driver implementation in-step with the latest Khronos API changes. One of the open matters though they are currently deciding is whether to land the "KHX" experimental extensions into mainline Mesa Git or keep them in a branch until they've been declared stable. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Here's how they fared. By Brian Nadel | Follow Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Mar 2, 2017 3:00 AM PT Email a friend To Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From 
		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Xplore More like this Break me if you can: 4 rugged tablets put to the test It's a hard-knock life: 3 rugged notebooks take a beating Review: 2 ultraportables from Acer and Dell add speed, efficiency Video Windows 10: Maps and Mail Table of Contents Getac F110 Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 Xplore Xslate R12 Conclusions Ruggedized tablets: Specs How we tested Ruggedized tablets: Test results Show More Anyone who depends on their tablet throughout the workday knows that disaster can strike at any moment -- it can get accidentally pushed off a desk or dropped while you're running for your airline connection, or caught in a sudden storm, or sat on by your three-year-old. If you want to avoid last-minute catastrophes, then you may want to consider buying a ruggedized tablet. There were about 530,000 rugged tablets sold in 2016, about 0.3% of the overall computer market, making it a niche within a niche, according to Chetan Mohan, lead hardware and semiconductor analyst at market-research firm Technavio. He forecasts sales to rise to 720,000 systems by 2021, an annual increase of over 6% -- a rare portion of the PC market that is prospering. But how do you measure how rugged a tablet is? Today, there are two prime ratings of a computer's ability to survive the worst that users and their environments can mete out: The Army's MIL-STD 810G series of tests is like basic training for computers to see how they can handle environmental stresses. It includes drops, shakes, dousing with water, chilling, heating and covering them with dust. The two-digit Ingress Protection (IP) ranking is equally important and rates how a device stands up to dust (the first digit) and liquids (the second digit). An IP54 rating means that dust can get into the system as long as it doesn't interfere with the system's operation and can withstand splashing of water. By contrast, the more stringent IP65 rating specifies a dust-tight system that can withstand a high-pressure spray. According to Mohan, the three top-selling vendors in this space are Getac, Panasonic and Xplore. In this roundup, we look at one ruggedized tablet from each vendor: the Getac F110, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 and the Xplore Xslate R12. These tablets all have a similar look, but the recipe for making each is very different.  [ Related: Fix Windows 10 problems with these free Microsoft tools ] For example, it once was standard to build a rugged system out of a thick, heavy, but super-strong magnesium-aluminum case. Of the three tablets I reviewed, only the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 follows this method. It can survive when lesser computers would fall apart or break, but is roughly three times the weight and thickness of a 9.7-in. iPad. The Getac F110 and Xslate R12 have metallic frames but plastic skins, so that they are lighter. All three are much more resilient than non-ruggedized tablets. Size and weight are only part of the rugged equation. I gave each tablet a tough workout that would break lesser systems. Each was dropped from heights of 29 in. and 60 in., shaken on a vibration table in a box filled with sand, and sprayed with water.  And that's the point behind rugged tablets. Rather than fragile devices that make you cringe when dropped or spilled on, these are tough hombres that can shake off abuse and come back for more. Getac F110 A mix of old and new, the Getac F110 -- which is has a slightly different case and completely updated technology as compared to its previous iteration -- bristles with power and includes a handy barcode scanner. However, it's got a low-resolution display and is the heaviest and biggest tablet of the three reviewed here. Getac Getac F110 The black and dark gray system has been built around a magnesium-aluminum frame with an acrylic butyl styrene plastic case, soft silicone rubber edging, reinforced rounded corners and protective port doors. It is MIL STD 810G certified and passed the IP65 tests. This is not a lightweight tablet. It measures 1.1 x 12.4 x 8.1 in. and weighs a hefty 3.3 lbs. If you include the AC adapter, it has a 4-lb. travel weight. At the same time, the Getac's 11.6-in. display is not only smaller than the Xplore's 12.5-in. screen, but tops out at a 1366 x 768 resolution, which can't compare to the full HD screens on the Xplore and Panasonic. Like the Xplore, the Getac uses Corning's reinforced Gorilla Glass, but it uses the second-generation version (as opposed to the Xplore, which contains fourth-generation Gorilla Glass). To the right of the display, the Getac has five buttons: A power button, volume up and down, one for the built-in barcode scanner, and a programmable function key. There's also a Windows key below the screen. Additionally, it comes with a tethered stylus that snaps into the tablet's right side. The display's brightness was on a par with the others, measuring 715 candelas per square meter. Getac's LumiBond technology uses silicone between the display pane and the touch overlay to make for brighter images and better readability in sunlight. The tablet has a full HD front-facing camera and an 8MP camera in the back. Standard ports include a single USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, a headphone jack and connection for an external antenna. There is also a space for one of several optional features. The review unit came with a barcode scanner that can work with 1D and 2D barcodes. Other options include an Ethernet port, an RS-232 serial port, a microSD card slot or a USB 2.0 port. All the connections are safely stowed behind a sealed door, which can obstruct inserting larger thumb drives; you might want to invest in a USB extension. The Getac is equipped with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2; you can get an optional card for using an LTE mobile data network. The system's single sealed speaker is on the right side of the system's back. As a result, the sound is not as rich as it could be, with flat audio that points away from the user. The system is equipped with an Intel Core i7 6600U processor (a generation behind the Xplore's Core i7 7500U), which runs from 2.6GHz to 3.4GHz. If that's not your speed, you can order the Getac with a slower 6500U Core i7 or your choice of the even slower 6200U or 6300U Core i5 chip. The system also comes with 256GB of SSD storage and 8GB of RAM (it can hold up to 16GB). The Getac is nicely security-minded; it includes Intel's vPro security extensions, a TPM 2.0 module and a fingerprint reader on the back (although it can be an awkward reach for the left index finger to reach the scanner). Behind a sealed cover is the Getac's pair of swappable batteries. Each has a capacity of 2,160mAh, for a total of 4,320mAh, the highest of the three systems reviewed here. Each battery has a five-LED charge indicator, but you need to remove the door to check the charge status. Like the Panasonic, the Getac's cooling fan was loud, annoying and ran often. The company offers a variety of accessories that range from optional desktop and vehicle docks to a snap on keyboard that can turn the tablet into a notebook. While it doesn't offer higher-capacity batteries, the company does have a device for charging eight batteries at once, a boon for those who use the tablets every day. Test results Despite all that capacity, the Getac had the shortest battery life of the three on the PCMark battery test, lasting 4 hours and 15 minutes. This increased to 5 hours and 17 minutes on our continuous video playback test. While on paper the Xplore's Core i7 7500U processor is more powerful, the Getac was the top dog in our performance testing, with a PCMark rating of 3,428.7. The system survived all our torture tests: The drops from 29 in. and 60 in., being drenched with water and shaken in sand. Unfortunately, during the last test, its exhaust vent quickly filled with sand, which if not cleaned could eventually cause the system to overheat. It comes with Windows 10 Pro and Getac's G-Manager utility, which summarizes the system's major settings (although I found it hard to read at times, because the software can run at only one-quarter the screen size). Bottom line The Getac F110 offers a well-protected exterior (except for its exhaust vent), good performance, and the choice of several options, including a barcode reader, an Ethernet jack or a microSD slot. However, the display, while nicely visible in sunlight, shows less detail than its peers, and although the batteries are replaceable, which is a plus, it did not do well on our battery tests. It is also heavier than the other two tablets reviewed here and, probably because of its options, more expensive. As a result, each business must judge whether the choice of options and additional protection is worth the extra expense. At a Glance Getac F110 Price: $4,194 (review unit); $2,099 (base price) Pros: Has a barcode scanner; includes TPM and vPro for enterprise security; performed well on our benchmarks; comes with dual swappable batteries; includes a fingerprint scanner Cons: Low-resolution display; rugged structure makes it heavy to carry; loud fan Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 Seeing the recently introduced fourth-generation of Panasonic's Toughpad FZ-G1 is, to me, like being reintroduced to an old friend -- this is an updated version of a tablet that I reviewed two years ago. It looks familiar, but the current system has been updated in every way. Panasonic Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 The Panasonic's silver-tone magnesium-aluminum case has heavily rounded corners and black silicone edging. Its sealed doors protect its ports from dust and water. Like the Getac, it comes with a MIL-STD 810G certification and an IP65 rating for liquids and dust intrusion. At 0.9 x 10.9 x 7.7 in., this Toughpad FZ-G1 is slightly smaller than the previous generation and is, in fact, the smallest of these three rugged tablets. Still, it's slightly thicker than the Xplore. It weights 2.4 lbs., making it the lightest of the three. With its power adapter, the FZ-G1 has a travel weight of 2.8 lbs. The Panasonic has a 10.1-in., 1920 x 1200 screen, compared to the Getac's 11.6-in. and Xplore's 12.5-in. displays. Unlike earlier models, the current system doesn't come with Corning's Gorilla Glass; instead, it uses a non-branded chemically strengthened glass. Compared to the Xplore's 12.5-in. display, the Panasonic's 10.1-in. screen felt small and constraining, particularly when trying to work through a complicated diagram or detailed map. Still, it delivered 713 candelas per square meter of light, which is on a par with the others, and did well in direct sunlight with a minimum of glare. There's a convenient place on the back of the unit to snap the included stylus into place and it comes with a coiled tether, making it harder to lose. Below the display are seven buttons for powering up the unit, adjusting the volume, an auto-rotate control, and a programmable pair for starting apps. Above the screen is a 1280 x 800 forward-facing webcam, which is augmented by a high-resolution 8-megapixel back-facing camera.  There is a single sealed speaker in the lower left corner of the system's back. It was on a par with the Getac's sound system but sounded tinny and hollow compared to the Xplore's richer audio. Inside, the review unit of the Panasonic had a Core i5 6300U processor that runs at between 2.4GHz and 3GHz, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. The Panasonic tops out at 8GB of RAM and there is no option for a high-performance Core i7. The CPU includes Intel's business-oriented vPro manageability extensions. The system also has a second-generation TPM module to make remote access more secure, but there is no option for a fingerprint scanner. Its assortment of connections includes 802.11ac Wi-Fi; there is an optional LTE mobile data network and you can also opt for an Ethernet port. The system comes with Bluetooth 4.1, not the faster 4.2 version that ships with the other two tablets. The system includes an HDMI port, a single USB 3.0 port, an audio jack and a connection for an external antenna. Like the Getac F110, the Panasonic can be augmented with a variety of equipment, depending on the task at hand. These include a magstripe or Smart Card reader, an RFID reader, a barcode reader, an RS-232 serial port, an Ethernet port, a micro SD slot or a second USB port. All of the ports are protected from the elements by a sealed door, which, as with the Getac, can get in the way if you're inserting a slightly oversized USB thumb drive. It comes with a fan that, to my ears, was loud and annoying. Performance tests Like the others, the Panasonic's 4,200mAh battery is swappable and behind a single sealed cover. The tablet led the three reviewed here with a 4-hour, 45-minute runtime on PCMark's battery life test, and earned second place with 6 hours, 15 minutes in our continuous video test. (The company offers an optional 9,300mAh battery that adds about 7.4-oz. to the tablet's weight, but could double the time spent away from an AC outlet.) Although it was up against a pair of Core i7 devices, the Core i5-equipped Panasonic acquitted itself well in performance testing, scoring a 2785.0 on the PCMark series of tasks. It survived the six drops, the sand-shake and the drenching with water without a scratch. Only one slight issue: In the last drop from five feet, the Panasonic ejected its stylus from its snap-in holder. Good thing it comes with a coiled tether. The system comes with Windows 10 Pro along with Panasonic's excellent PC Settings Utility that consolidates every major system adjustment -- from screen brightness to networking -- in one place. Bottom line The Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 doesn't offer a fingerprint scanner or a Core i7 processor, which in today's market makes it feel slightly behind the times. And its metal design means that even though it's the lightest of the three tablets reviewed here, it's still a lot to carry around for a 10.1-in. screen. But it combines a ruggedly-built frame with fine performance and good battery life. At a Glance Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 Price: $2,799 (review unit/base price) Pros: Compact system; includes TPM and vPro for enterprise security; good battery life Cons: No fingerprint scanner; lacks Intel Core i7 option Related: Tablets Windows 10 1 2 Page 1 Next 7 Wi-Fi vulnerabilities beyond weak passwords You Might Like Shop Tech Products at Amazon What Readers Like China reminds Trump that supercomputing is a race China said it plans to develop a prototype of an exascale supercomputer by the end of this year,...

Photo: Twitter.com/@siteintelgroup The SITE Intel Group, which monitors Jihadi intelligence in the region, reported that the ISIS arm in Aleppo province released a photo "that showed deceased fighter Abu Khattab al-Polandi.” Poland’s RMF FM broadcaster said that experts suggest that the man in the photo published by the Jihadi group bears a resemblance to Pole Jakub Jakus, a former resident of Sandomierz in southern Poland. The international police organisation Interpol has issued an arrest warrant for Jakus, who reportedly converted to Islam and moved to Syria, where he allegedly joined the so-called Islamic State. There has not been any official confirmation that the man who died was Polish. In April 2016, the International Centre for Counter Terrorism (ICCT) reported that the as many as 40 Polish nationals could be currently fighting within IS.

Korean threats The Korea Herald > Business > Technology [MWC] 5G will breathe new life into devices   Published : 2017-03-02 16:48 Updated : 2017-03-02 16:56 BARCELONA -- The four day journey of this year’s biggest tech event, the World Mobile Congress, wrapped up on Thursday, attracting 110,000 visitors from around the world to see the latest technologies and solutions presented by 2,200 companies. This year’s MWC in Barcelona, Spain, showed how companies have moved forward from a year ago, and gave a clearer shape to 5G-enabled devices. While the MWC in 2016 focused on the speed of 5G, this week’s event showcased how new services can be realized based on the 5G network. Mats Granryd, director general of the GSMA, which hosted MWC, said in describing the event, “We will move away from being vague on the prospects of 5G this year to concrete proposals.” At the event, the most prominent technology of 5G-enabled services applied to daily lives was connected automobiles. With 5G expected to be realized within two years, automakers, telecom companies and chipmakers have partnered to show off their connected car technologies -- communications among cars and infrastructure, real-time navigation, remote-controlled vehicles and autonomous driving. German automaker BMW and US chipmaker Intel partnered to present their future autonomous car driving technologies. BMW grabbed attention by demonstrating its autonomous car parking technology outside the main hall. Intel also envisioned its 5G-enabled connected car platform in partnership with BMW and Israeli tech firm Mobileye. French car manufacturer Peugeot unveiled the self-driving concept car Instinct that uses Samsung Electronics’ Internet of Things platform Arctic. Mercedes-Benz showcased its online connectivity and navigation tools in the Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe.  (Yonhap) Meanwhile, home appliance companies also showcased their 5G-enabled smart home appliance technologies. Dutch technology company Philips unveiled its smart lighting that figures out a user’s location to automatically turn on and off lighting. It can be controlled from outside the home through voice commands via the smart speaker Amazon Echo. German tech firm eQ-3 showcased a smart home technology that can control temperature, security, alarms and lighting in partnership with Amazon Alexa. Korean telecom operator SK Telecom also offered its AI-powered speaker NUGU that controls home appliances while KT showcased its voice command TV Giga Gini platform. In terms of realizing a 5G network, Korea’s two telecom operators KT and SKT vowed to commercialize 5G by 2019. KT CEO Hwang Chang-gyu said the company will “commercialize a 5G network by 2019” during the keynote speech on the first day of the tech congress, showcasing how 5G can change the world by citing the pilot services for the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics. SK Telecom’s CEO Park Jung-ho also said in its press conference Tuesday, “We will commercialize 5G as early as possible by closely cooperating with relevant companies.” Tech companies aiming to take leadership have partnered to advance the 5G standardization during the event. A total of 22 companies, including AT&T, NTT Docomo, Vodafone, Ericsson, Intel, SKT, KT, LG Uplus and LG Electronics, have partnered to hasten the standardization of 5G.

(Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) 30085 CONNECTTWEET 7 LINKEDIN 694 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Prior to his nomination as attorney general last year, then-Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions met with the Russian ambassador to the United States, but did not disclose the contacts during questioning during his contentious confirmation, Justice Department officials confirmed late Wednesday. Sessions, who took office last month as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year — in July and September — while the FBI investigated Russia's meddling in the U.S. election. Sessions' meetings with the ambassador were confirmed by his spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, and another Justice Department official, who is not authorized to comment publicly. In a released statement late Wednesday, Sessions denied discussing campaign-related matters with Russian officials. "I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign," Sessions said. "I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false." Yet when asked in January by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., whether he was aware if campaign associates had any contact with Russian government officials, Sessions said he did not have knowledge of such contacts nor did he communicate with Russian officials. He provided a similar response to written questions submitted by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. "There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,'' Flores said in a written statement, adding that Sessions took those meetings as a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee and not as a surrogate for President Trump's campaign. Sessions himself issued a terse statement last night, saying simply, "I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false." The disclosures about Sessions communications, first reported by the Washington Post, come as calls have mounted for Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the FBI's continuing investigation into suspected contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials. Late Wednesday, California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee,  said that it was now "essential'' that the attorney general remove himself from any involvement in the federal inquiry.

"This is not even a close call; it is a must." Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, went even further, calling for Sessions' resignation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., echoed Cummings' sentiment and requested Sessions' immediate resignation. "After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign," Pelosi said in a released statement. "There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal and financial connections to the Russians." AG Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign. https://t.co/5r8KpGQSRTpic.twitter.com/vKSVuvTIf3— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) March 2, 2017 Just last month, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign related to his contacts with Kislyak prior to Trump's inauguration. Flynn had repeatedly denied any communications coinciding with the Obama administration's announcement of sanctions against Russia for its attempts at disrupting the U.S. elections, until acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed Trump administration officials of intercepted communications involving Flynn and the ambassador that could make the national security adviser vulnerable to blackmail. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Here are the important dates detailing Michael Flynn's relationship with Russia that led to his resignation. USA TODAY NETWORK In Sessions case, Flores said the senator had "over 25 conversations (last year) with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign — not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.'' The meetings involved discussions between the two countries and any prominent issues they may have been facing. The September meeting with Kislyak was memorialized on the former senator's calendar. In July, Sessions encountered the Russian official during a Heritage Foundation event timed to the Republican National Convention. After speaking to a group of about 50 ambassadors, a Justice official said the Russian official was among a smaller group of ambassadors who approached the senator as he was leaving the stage. The official said Sessions spoke to the smaller group whose members invited the senator to attend events they were sponsoring. The official said Sessions made no commitments at that time. As recently as this week, Sessions gave no indication that he intended to recuse himself, telling reporters Monday that he would only step aside if a matter emerged requiring his recusal.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 1, 2017 at 7:30PM Analysts with BlueFin Research Partners (by way of Tech Trader Daily) claim that the pace at which Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is installing the equipment required to manufacture chips using its 10-nanometer technology at its Fab 28 in Israel "remain[s] on schedule" for mass production in the second half of 2017. Intel has publicly stated that its goal is to begin mass production of chips using this 10-nanometer technology in the second half of 2017 with shipments by the end of the year. Image source: Intel. However, BlueFin has some troubling news: Intel is "struggling with defect/yield issues with this process for High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) release and have not locked down the complete process of records (PORs) to date." The analysts say that "there are concerns that this ramp could be delayed by 2-3 months." Not a surprise Intel formally disclosed back at its Feb. 9 investor meeting that its next generation of personal computer processors -- which will be branded eighth-generation Core -- will be manufactured using the company's 14-nanometer technology, rather than its newer 10-nanometer technology. Now, the company is still apparently planning to ship chips based on its 10-nanometer technology to its personal computer customers by the end of 2017, but is likely that these chips will only target the "2-in-1" subset of the broader personal computer market. In other words, Intel will ship some 10-nanometer chips into some products just to be able to tell the public that it met its goal vis-a-vis 10-nanometer product timing, but it will keep the bulk of its volume on its current 14-nanometer technology during the eighth-generation Core product cycle. Intel needs to sort these issues out in about a year Fortunately, Intel appears to have readied an entire eighth-generation Core product stack built using its 14-nanometer technology. This means that between the second half of 2017 and the second half of 2018, Intel will have new products that it can sell to its customers (and around which its customers -- personal computer vendors -- can build new products). However, it is likely too late for Intel to start planning a ninth-generation Core processor family built using its 14-nanometer technology to serve customers between the second half of 2018 until the second half of 2019. The company needs to get its 10-nanometer technology into robust shape over the next year, otherwise it will be faced with two unappealing options: Intel starts manufacturing ninth-generation Core processors based on its 10-nanometer technology on schedule and simply suffer margin erosion as low yields translate into higher-than-anticipated cost structures and potential supply issues, or Intel delays releasing its ninth-generation Core processors until it can fix its manufacturing yield/cost structure issues. This would mean leaving system vendors high and dry without new processors. To placate said customers, Intel would likely need to resort to discounts on older chips, once again hurting margins. At this point, I don't think investors can be confident that Intel will work out the issues in time to avoid the above consequences; the company already bought itself extra time by delaying its 10-nanometer manufacturing ramp from the end of 2015/early 2016 into late 2017, and it bought itself even more time by restricting its initial 10-nanometer production to a subset of its product line (limiting the potential negative financial impact of poor 10-nanometer yields on the company's business).  That extra time simply wasn't enough; we'll see if another year will ultimately do the trick.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Earlier this week, technology writer Daniel Newman decried the proliferation of incompatible Internet of Things technologies(IoT). By way of simple definition, the "Internet of Things" is everything connected to the Internet that isn’t a computer, smartphone or tablet. It is "things" like your smart thermostat and motion detector, security cameras, engine monitors, railroad car trackers, etc. Writing in Forbes, Newman said " . . . all of these companies are building their strategies with a wide range of different platforms, creating a complex and messy web of tech that is already tripping over itself. That problem will only increase as we move toward greater IoT adoption." He then made a powerful, articulate, persuasive case for standardizing IoT worldwide. I disagree with all of it. The wrong question is, "How do we get all of these devices to talk to each other?” That's because there’s no particular reason why we need them to. I don’t care about 30 billion devices inter-operating; I care about my 30 devices inter-operating. How to do that is the right question. That gives us a problem we can manage, and manage well. It can best be described by analogy to a similar, more familiar situation, the advent of personal computing. It was invented by Apple, expanded by IBM and Microsoft into a ubiquitous but chaotically messy global juggernaut, and partially corralled by Apple again. The reason the Mac concept worked so well is twofold. First, Apple created and owned the closed Macintosh ecosystem and controlled everything, where the IBM/Microsoft/Intel model tried to play nicely with everyone. Controlling everything meant that Apple wasn’t plagued by the locusts attendant to thousands of independent bits of hardware and software trying to climb onto a single platform. The word "driver" appeared nowhere in Apple user documentation (and, not incidentally, Googling "Mac plus virus" got you zero results.) Second, Apple’s approach was to supply solutions, where IBM’s was to supply hardware and software. "The computer for the rest of us" and "It simply works" weren’t just marketing slogans; they were the genetic code of a carefully planned system. Apple had no interest in getting their ecosystem to work with everything on the planet. There was no need for it. (At least initially; as it happens, the two models starting to look a lot like each other, and now you can even run Windows on Mac computers.) So we ended up with two robust, completely incompatible systems that fought it out for world domination by constant innovation, to the benefit of all of us. That IBM/Microsoft/Intel initially succeeded where Apple struggled was, like the Betacam versus VHS, more about money and muscle than merit. A similar situation will prevail in the Internet of Things. Getting everything to talk to everything else is not only practically impossible, it’s not necessary, and attempting it will impede progress and leave us in technological gridlock. Instead, what we need is a small handful of "uberprotocols" or consortia competing fiercely with each other. At first they’ll be like IBM and Apple at the beginning, when they split their message between business/hobbyists on the one hand and education/ordinary mortals on the other but eventually were able to blur those distinctions. The geek versus ordinary mortal tension will be there in the IoT as well. Not to generalize too wildly, but right now, at least in the home automation domain, the IoT is a hobbyist’s adventure rather than a mainstream experience. Walk into a retail establishment and chat up the home automation salesperson and you’re going to hear all about protocols, configuration, pairing, hubs, and so forth. A certain segment of the population reading this article are probably thinking, "So what?" But, I’ll tell you so what. If we don’t change the pitch, home automation is going to remain the realm of hobbyists. The competing pitch is going to be to never mention any of those things, but instead to talk about things like scenes ("When I leave home, make sure the lights are off, the alarm system is set, the heat is down, and the garage door is closed, and don’t bother me with how you do it") a completely different approach comprising different technology. What we need is an uberprotocol focused on the experience, not the gadgets. We’re overloaded with useless junk that’s confusing the landscape and creating skeptics instead of adopters. We need to shift from what’s possible to what matters, and create systems built around that concept. The next big thing won’t be a device; it’ll be a brilliant way to get subsets of devices to talk to one another, and at the same time understand us, turning a stage full of independent dancers, all trying to one-up each other, into a tightly choreographed ballet. The only way to get this done is with ecosystems that start off closed, and only gradually expand following initial acceptance followed by wider adoption. It’s hard to imagine something as game-changing as an iPod, iPhone or Kindle coming onto the market (although nobody expected those, either). The Amazon Echo has already surpassed three million units in sales but it’s a better incarnation of existing concepts, not a breakthrough. Homekit, Weave, Smart Things and others are adding to the cacophony because they’re new and haven’t found their way yet, although they’re on the right track. And, as a matter of fact, they’re starting to talk to each other. The mix of  "allowable" conversations is chaotic and expands almost daily, but it’s happening. If they do find their way, however, it won’t be because they solved inter-operability. That’s a technical issue that should never even come to a consumer’s attention. What they have to solve is how to get all of these devices and systems to provide real value to the people who buy them, without bothering them with arcane technical issues along the way. Make it worth my while and I’ll buy all my stuff from within your ecosystem and let you have the data you need to make it all work. We’re not there yet. It’s going to take some major advances in artificial intelligence (i.e., more neural network than algorithmic) to get machines to deal with the kind of all-too-human inconsistency and ambiguity to which we’re all heir yet have little difficulty understanding in other humans. They have to deal with exceptions and incorporate them smoothly into the neural net, by guessing, trying again, and incorporating the experiences holistically. What we need is an Alfred the Butler, who understands, suggests, on occasion insists, but ultimately obeys and learns. That will be the "genius" home, not just smart. (Fair warning: If you’re the kind of person who can’t go to the bathroom if your dog is watching, or are prone to profusely thanking interactive voice response robots at the end of "conversations," you’re not going to like the truly smart, voice-driven home. The feeling of intrusion will be overwhelming). Closed ecosystems, in which members inside each system compete against one another and the system competes as a whole against other systems, is what’s going to make this all work and will answer the "right" question  — Can’t we all just get along without looking like each other?

Review: Lenovo ThinkPad E570 Posted on 4-Mar-2017 12:08 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles : Bill Bennett Lenovo serves up a mid-price, not-so-small business laptop. The ThinkPad E570 is so traditional it borders on retro. It will please laptop conservatives. If you need greater mobility, look elsewhere. Lenovo ThinkPad E570 at a glance: For: Configurable Latest processor Against: Heavy Large Build quality Maybe: No touch screen Removable battery Verdict: Mid-price large screen laptop. Will appeal to small business owners. Price: From NZ$1100. Review model NZ$1300. Website: Lenovo NZBy 2017 standards, the Lenovo ThinkPad E570 is bulky. The review model weighs 2.4Kg. It measures 376 by 262 by 34 mm at its widest, broadest and deepest. Part of the heft is because the case includes a large, bright 15.6-inch display and a DVD drive. There’s a lot of plastic around the edge of the screen. Indeed, there’s a lot of black plastic full stop. It’s chunky and robust which adds protection but you’ll need a backpack to move it. Another reason for the bulk is the battery and studs rise the base a few millimetres off a desktop. This gives breathing room so air can flow through vents. There’s also a heavy-duty fan vent on the left side of the case too. Rough in placesAn E at the start of a product number indicates the E570 is from the lower-price ThinkPad range. That means you get a lower quality finish than you’d find on more expensive models. It’s a little rough in places and the matt black plastic picks up smudges with a vengeance. The front of the lid doesn’t sit flush with the bottom part of the computer. This makes it easier to open. The hinge has a small amount of give, but nothing to trouble anyone. While the case is not pretty, it does look like Lenovo made the computer to do business. If you like the red and black ThinkPad look, you’ll be happy with the effect. Desktop replacementGiven size and weight, you won’t want to carry the E570 all the time. If portability is important get something else. It makes a fine desktop replacement that can travel at a pinch. A big case means there’s room for a full-size keyboard and numeric keys. The layout takes getting used to. A week or two of reviewing was not enough time to master the keyboard idiosyncrasies. Among other things, having two backspace and one delete key in the top right corner is strange. Also odd is the off centre touchpad and the small space bar. TouchPadBecause there’s no touchscreen, you’ll use the touchpad a lot. It’s small by 2017 standards. The little red signature ThinkPad cursor joystick is some compensation. In practice the touchpad is erratic, that could be a Windows 10 driver problem. If you owned this computer and used it often, trackpad aside, all these things, would be no trouble after a few weeks. The lack of a keyboard backlight is disappointing. As already mentioned, there is no touchscreen. The display is 1366 by 768 HD format. There is a FHD 1920 by 1080 model that, at the moment, costs $100 more than the review computer. It comes with a faster processor and a better video card, that’s a lot of extra value for $100. One minor worry about the display is that the default setting is 100 percent brilliance. While that’s fine, there’s nothing extra for when you need a boost. Video and everyday Windows apps work fine with the display. It’s not state-of-the-art, but its good considering the price tag. Kaby LakeThe review model has an Intel i5 7200U processor running at 2.5GHz. That’s a Kaby Lake chip or the seventh generation of Core processors. Intel says they are faster than last year’s processors, enough for users to notice. They are video optimised and should be more power efficient. Lenovo says you can get eight hours on a single charge. As always, the manufacturer’s claim is pushing it. In practice, it works for a little over six hours before power supply nagging starts. Battery life isn’t so vital in a computer that will sit on a desk most of the time. There’s a DVD drive, which feels anachronistic, but will please many users. There are three USB ports  again, that pleases some users not others. Lenovo also includes HDMI, Ethernet, a multi-format card reader and an audio jack. Old fashionedDespite a state-of-the-art processor, the ThinkPad E570 is, in many ways, old-fashioned. It’s been a long time since a review non-touch Windows PC with a hard drive instead of SSD has turned up here. The question is how the specification trade-offs work with value for money. The biggest downside is the quality of finish. You can find better-made computers at the same price, although they may not have the same mix of features. At first sight it looks as if Lenovo charges a premium for its 15.6 inch display. On a more positive note, you get a lot of processor performance for your money. It would be a good choice if you crunch numbers on a spreadsheet all day. It’s clear the $1400 top of the line model with a Core i7 processor, higher resolution screen and better graphics card is better value. This is a promotional price and may not be available for long. You might want to swap the 1TB hard drive for a 256GB SSD, that would add around $170 to the list price. Not everyone prizes slim and light over big screens, full keyboards and processor power. The Lenovo ThinkPad E570 isn’t for the kind of person who works from cafés or airport lounges. There are many who still want DVD drives. This will hit the spot for some demographics.

The software giant has been on a roll with great hardware lately, but Porsche Design's newly-anounced Book One takes a good idea one step further. If you think the Book One looks like a Surface Book, you're not alone. Like that machine, the Book One's screen can be detached from the keyboard for use as a tablet. On top of that, though, it also sports a cog-style hinge that brings the same 360° rotation offered by Lenovo's Yoga line and other convertible devices. The Book One sports more ports than its close cousin, too. You'll find two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, two USB 3.1 Type-C connectors, and one Thunderbolt port. For user input, there's a digital stylus that sticks magnetically to the side of the book, a backlit keyboard, and a Microsoft-certified Precision Touchpad. Inside, you'll find a Intel Core i7-7500U CPU with 3.5GHz turbo speed, alongside 16GB of RAM. The system's storage comes by way of an Intel 512GB SSD. While the Surface Book's screen has a non-standard 3:2 ratio with its 3000x2000 resolution, Porsche Design's system goes a bit more traditional, with a 13.3" screen sporting a 3200x1800 resolution in a 16:9 aspect ratio. There are no options for discrete graphics cards, though. The Book One will retail for $2,495 when it releases in April. That's not a bad number when compared to the closest Surface Book in price and specs. The Surface Book model that retails for $2,699 offers roughly the same specs, but with a Core i7-6600U CPU and a Nvidia 940M graphics card instead. The Book One may be the first offering from Porsche Design Computing, but it certainly looks enticing.     Tags: Mobile computing Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 3/3/2017 04:28 PM EST  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet At this year's Mobile World Congress, the industry's 5G conversation not only kept drifting back to 4G, but also quietly shifted from 5G's "Core Network" to "New Radio (NR)." Last year, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) was all about the promise of 5G networks. Vendors then talked about how 5G will be nothing like 4G — opening up a world of new possibilities for operators. As elements like software defined network and network function virtualization come to the core network, they promised operators should be able to provide many types of differentiated network service over the same infrastructure. The MWC last year painted a picture of 5G that was both exciting and a little frightening. A year later, at this week’s Mobile World Congress, the conversation on the show floor kept drifting back to 4G. Tech vendors discussed how the industry can still milk the LTE network for years to come. Simultaneously, in conversations about the 5G standard, the industry’s focus had quietly shifted from “core network” to “new radio.” I noticed this trend when I saw the announcement of “non-standalone 5G” — jointly issued by a group of carriers and tech companies — just a day before the MWC opened. Okay, I asked myself, “What just happened?” In the name of “5G acceleration,” companies including Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE, Qualcomm, Intel and a host of network operators including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, KDDI, KT Corp., NTT Docomo, SK Telecom, Sprint, Vodafone and many more, have announced their support for “non-standalone” 5G new radio (NR). This new proposal will be proposed at the 3GPP Radio Access Network Plenary meeting scheduled next week in Dubrovnik, Croatia. But really, what on earth is “non-standalone” 5G? How is it different from 5G? Is this something like 4G on steroids? More important, how does this detour affect all the market’s stampede toward 5G? As Qualcomm’s CTO Matt Grob explained in a one-on-one interview with us, “non-standalone 5G” is about a 4G-based “set-up” mode for 5G. By introducing the concept of an “intermediate” step, operators will be able to use the existing LTE radio and evolve packet core network under a configuration called “non-standalone 5G NR.” This would allow the carriers to begin trials and deployments of 5G NR in 2019, rather than 2020. Meanwhile, they can add a new 5G radio access carrier to support 5G use cases from 2019 onwards. Calling the tune before the band disassembled Perhaps, most significant about the notion of “non-standalone 5G NR” is that this “solidifies” the schedule for the complete standard, including standalone 5G NR in Release 15, at a time when some 5G versions, from carriers like Verizon and Korea Telecom, are outpacing the competition. In short, the companies who support the non-standalone 5G are calling the tune before the band is assembled. They want the 3GPP to completing the 5G NR specs in the biggest possible hurry, lest the divide among pre-5G specifications grows even wider. In their joint announcement, they stated: “Based on the current 3GPP Release 15 timeline the earliest 5G NR deployments based on standard-compliant 5G NR infrastructure and devices will likely not be possible until 2020.” While praising Verizon as a “catalyst” for 5G acceleration, Qualcomm’s Grob shared his concerns during the interview with EE Times: “There is an open question: Will Verizon come back to the [3GPP 5G] standard [after having pursued their own version of 5G specs]?” We don’t know that answer. It’s unclear whether the invention of non-standalone 5G can put the genie back in the bottle. Meanwhile, during the MWC, evidence piled up that the mobile industry is not unanimously gung-ho about non-standalone 5G. And why not? Nokia CEO announced a new comprehensive 5G solution at the Mobile World Congress. The company, however, didn't join the industry group supporting "Non-Standalone 5G." For example, Nokia was conspicuously absent from the list of companies joining the non-standalone 5G club. Nokia never gave a straight answer to the repeated question during the company’s press briefing. But the Finnish company seems worried that accelerating the NR standard might not synch with the development of a 5G packet core that will enable key features, such as network slicing. Similarly dubious voices on the show floor pointed out that the players rushing to close down the 5G NR spec today are focusing exclusively on 5G use cases, based on what they know about current 4G applications.  Every time the mobile industry start developing a new radio standard, vendors and carriers tend to get busy with political jockeying and the new-standard hype machine goes into overdrive. Predictably, the media goes along, handwringing along the way. We’ve seen this again and again as the cellular standard went from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G. Distinctly different from the past is that 5G isn’t just about developing a new radio spec in pursuit of faster speeds and bigger bandwidth. Obviously, the importance of stabilizing the 5G NR spec — sooner rather than later — is a big deal. But what about the rest of the stuff that goes along with the 5G core network? Where are we? Have we thought through all the new 5G use cases we haven’t been able to deliver on 4G networks? If the latest fuss isn’t just a matter of some companies trying to one-up some other companies, what’s the all-fired hurry? — Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

(AP) — The largest U.S. electric company says its annual shareholders meeting in May will be its first without a physical gathering, with all business conducted and questions answered only online. Duke Energy Corp. said Friday the live video webcast on May 4 will make the meeting accessible to 1 million shareholders worldwide. Dozens of companies including Hewlett-Packard and Intel have replaced in-person conclaves with virtual meetings. Advocates say they allow more shareholders to participate at lower cost. Critics say the format allows corporations to select the topics its executives want to address and scrub out tough questions. Duke Energy's shareholders meetings have long involved protests ranging from tea party groups to environmentalists. CEO Lynn Good faced tough questioning about a massive coal ash spill during the Charlotte utility's 2014 meeting. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, AP) 97 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 63 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump heaped new praise Friday on Canada's immigration system, which has served as a model for countries around the world because it focuses more on immigrants who can contribute to the economy than those with little more than family ties. Trump sent out a Tweet after apparently watching a segment on Fox & Friends that featured Nick Adams, a conservative author who the book Green Card Warrior: My Quest for Legal Immigration in an Illegals' System. During the segment, Adams spoke against "multi-culturalism" and immigrants who enter the country to "milk us," which drew a salute from Trump who described Adams' book as a "must read." "The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia!" he wrote. Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 That tweet followed Trump's comments during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, when he praised the system used by Canada, Australia and many other nations during a portion of his speech that called for reforming an "outdated" legal immigration system that hurts American workers. "Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits," Trump said. "It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class." Canada has long used immigration as a way to drive its economic engine, and limits the relatives Canadian citizens can bring in. About 63% of those granted legal permanent residence in Canada — the final step before becoming citizens — are admitted for their economic skills, with only 24% admitted based on having family members living in the country. The U.S. system is reversed: 63% of green cards are given to immigrants with family connections, and only 13% given based on economic reasons. Canada was also the first country to use a point system to grade economic immigrants — a 100-point scale introduced in the 1960s that rewards foreigners with PhDs and extensive work experience in specialized fields. It became increasingly popular in the 2000s, as countries that included Australia, Denmark, Japan and the United Kingdom adopted versions of it. "It was very trendy," said Meghan Benton, a senior policy analyst at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. Applicants are given a score on a 100-point scale, with points awarded in six categories: • 28 maximum points for language skills. The more fluent they are in English and French, Canada's two official languages, the more points they get. • 25 points for education — 5 for a high school diploma, 19 for a two-year college degree, 25 for a PhD. • 15 maximum points for work experience — the more skilled the job, and the more years spent doing it, the more points. • 12 maximum points for age — the younger the applicant, the more points awarded. • 10 points maximum if they have a current job offer from a Canadian employer. • 10 points maximum for "adaptability," which includes things like family ties to Canadians or past visits to the country. Those who score 67 points or higher are eligible to immigrate. Immediate relatives of Canadian citizens do not go through the grading process.

Canada and others countries, she said, realized that simply admitting people with PhDs wasn't an economic cure-all, since many couldn't find jobs in their fields and were forced to do work far below their education levels. "You had scientists working as taxi drivers," she said. "Classic brain waste." The country also made a major revision in 2015, when it allowed Canadian provinces to sponsor immigrants based on labor shortages. The goal was to tie the system more closely to local demands. The question in the U.S. now is how much Trump wants to emulate Canada's system. "We've been discussing here exactly what he means," Benton said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration, interpreted Trump's comments as a call to shift away from an immigration system that places such a high priority on family-linked migration — allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor not just spouses and children, but also extended family members.

That amounts to less than 5% of the 1.2 million immigrants admitted to the U.S. in 2015. "He's very clearly saying we should stop importing poverty," Beck said. "He didn't use that term. But he's saying that we're going to stop bringing in people who do not meet some criteria of merit." Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a group that advocates for immigrants in the U.S., said Trump was clearly embracing a proposal by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to cut all legal immigration in half. She said Cotton's proposal, and Trump's apparent embrace of that model, show what their true end goal is. "Many Republicans have been trying to hide behind this veneer of, 'We're not against all immigrants, we're just concerned with illegal immigration,'" Martínez-de-Castro said. "They're trying to eviscerate all of it." 97 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 63 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lmqjEg

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Courtesy Brawny Even though we totally have a crush on the Brawny Man who usually graces our paper-towel rolls, we have an even bigger crush on the badass women taking his place this month. The paper-towel company announced that in recognition of Women's History Month, Walmart stores will be selling Brawny towels with limited-edition commemorative packaging featuring a woman in place of the classic Brawny Man. Additionally, four different women who have made strides in a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) field are each appearing as the subject of her own individual minute-long film on Brawny's website. Brawny is calling the initiative #StrengthHasNoGender. The four women featured are: Vernice Armour—the first African-American female combat pilot in the U.S. and first African-American female pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps. Dr. Anna Kornbrot—the first woman to graduate from Columbia College. She is an oral surgeon and clinical assistant professor of OMFS at Penn Dental School. Patty Lopez, Ph.D.—a platform applications engineer at Intel who has released more than 50 products across five business lines. She holds seven imaging patents. Brittany Wenger—a first-place recipient at the 2012 Google Science Fair. She developed the app Cloud4Cancer, a breast-cancer-diagnosis test. There is also a fifth short film called Breaking Barriers, which honors the accomplishments of legendary women including Harriet Tubman, Amelia Earhart, and Serena Williams. Share via Pinterest "There are women and girls everywhere who exhibit strength and resilience in their lives, and that's the inspiration behind the Brawny #StrengthHasNoGender campaign," Frances Morgan, senior brand manager at Georgia-Pacific (the company that owns Brawny), said in a statement shared with SELF. "STEM is among many areas of society that are underrepresented by females, and we felt this would be a powerful platform to address this issue. Our partnership with Girls Inc. will help promote girls' interest in these fields and empower them to break gender stereotypes." In addition to honoring Armour, Kornbrot, Lopez, and Wenger with the short films, Brawny has partnered with Girls Inc., an organization that "inspires all girls to be strong, smart, and bold through direct service and advocacy." Brawny is donating $75,000 to the group, which will use it for developing "girls' enthusiasm for STEM as part of its Operation SMART programming. As a national sponsor of the program, the maker of Brawny is helping fund STEM education opportunities for more than 46,000 girls across 76 Girls Inc. affiliates," reads Brawny's press release.
