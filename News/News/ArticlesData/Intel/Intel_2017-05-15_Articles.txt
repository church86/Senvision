Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell.

I have an issue with this article, and its one I share with damn near every review out there – with the notable exception of Anandtech’s Ryzen 5 review. Which is unbelievably detailed in the permutations of CPUs/GPUs/resolutions it tests. The issue I have is that its too simple to say Ryzen is worse than Intel at gaming. Yes it is true if you match it with an Nvidia 1080 and a high refresh rate 1080 resolution monitor. But it’s less true with an Nvidia 1070 or 1440p monitor(GPU constraint kicking in). Go 4k monitor and its irrelevant entirely. Have a bog standard 1080p monitor and a Nvidia 1080? What the hell are doing matching that with an Nvidia 1080 GPU? The monitor is pretty much maxed out. Drop the graphics drop down to an Nvidia 1060/Radeon 480 and below – the GPU is pretty much your entire constraint. And so – is Ryzen “worse” at gaming? Sure – if you have one helluva graphics card, and monitor to match. But if you’re like me on something like a mid-range RX470 and budget 1080p monitor? (which I would say is a lot of people) Well, you just picked up a CPU that smashes the comparable Intel i5 chip in a lot of ways, for effectively identical gaming performance.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 23:56 sweenish says: There is a reason that CPU benches are run like that. While you’re correct that no one runs a setup like that, the point is to benchmark the CPU, not the GPU. They did what they said they would, and benchmarked the CPU. It’s up to you to determine how the CPU performance stacks up against what you want to do, and you can do that, because you have accurate CPU performance numbers. Log in to Reply 13/05/2017 at 20:42 Kasjer says: Yeah, this article completely misses the point that those budget Ryzen processors won’t be the ones that PC enthusiast will drop money for – taking in to consideration that new mobo and in most cases, DDR4 RAM (still on DDR3 like many of us? Tough luck) will be required. It’s not very realistic that Ryzen 5 (and even less likely with 3) CPU will be paired with GTX 1080 (or better) card. Considering the value, I think Ryzen 5 range will be very popular choice in pre-built PCs aimed at people who are looking for inexpensive PC or mid-tier one at best. This means land of 1080p/1440p 60hz monitors, anything from GTX 1050Ti, RX460 up to GTX1060 and RX480. And in such PCs, these CPUs will do quite well in terms of gaming. Plus, as it was said, Ryzen is based on new socket, which will be supported in years to come, this opens room for future upgrades of such PCs… can’t say that about buying older/second hand Intel i5/i7 CPUs. I’m currently on old i5 4460, 8GB DDR3 and 1050Ti (recent upgrade from 750Ti). In about two-three years (three is a stretch), as games will move more in to multi-threaded territory, I would have to buy new PC. Most likely I still will be stuck in 1080p 60hz land as I game on 1080p60 48 inch Samsung TV I’m not willing to retire any time soon (it’s not that old model and works great, so there is no point…). I suspect this PC will be based on second gen Ryzen processor unless Intel comes with something that can offer similar value. No going back to red team cards though, I’m too fond of low-powered silent ones from nVidia! Silent card can make huge difference when you are gaming in living room. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:20 Jeremy Laird says: The first problem you have is that I didn’t say Ryzen 5 was “worse” for gaming. I’m afraid you made that bit up. In fact, I said, “to be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good.” I also said that just occasionally it will frustrate. I said that based on the objective fact that it underperforms in some games. How many? Probably only a small number overall. So my broad take is that for a primarily gaming rig, I’d still lean Intel. It’s my view that you’re tangibly less likely to find a given game runs surprisingly poorly on the Intel chip. I think the Intel chip will give a good experience in pretty much every game. The AMD chip will be mostly just as good, occasionally sometimes better, but critically it will occasionally be poor. The occasionally better bit isn’t of significant value it’s better than something that’s already good – ie it’s better objectively in terms of the benchmarks, but you likely won’t be able to subjectively sense that advantage. When Ryzen occasionally runs poorly, you very much can sense it and as I said in the article, it’s not something that’s obvious from looking at the benchmark numbers. I don’t want to overstate the problem. But I tried to explain my viewpoint in the main piece. It’s not that Ryzen is a disaster. It’s that the knowledge that it occasionally underperforms in games can undermine your confidence and enjoyment. And that’s why I would be reluctant to build a gaming system around it today. You needn’t agree with that – it’s a viewpoint, not a statement of fact. But dismissing it as though I had simply said Ryzen is “worse” is to misrepresent what I wrote. And you’re wrong about the 4K thing. When Ryzen doesn’t get on nicely with a game, you can feel it at 4K as well. I’ve tried it! Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:52 Replikant says: I beg to disagree. The Ryzen processors are really good value for the money compared to Intels offerings and, in addition, they are probably a lot more future-proof, considering that newer games tend to have improved multi-core support and Intel is ramping up the core-count as well. Secondly, it’s a new platform, performance is bound to improve (wait for Zen+, maybe). Third, total cost of ownership of a Ryzen system should be lower than an Intel system, as far as I know, the AM4 socket is going to be around for a while. But, most importantly: We are just coming out of a ten year stretch when Intel ruled the (PC) world and followed the Way of the Dinosaurs: Become greedy, fat and lazy and hurt the (PC) environment as whole in consequence. AMD does not beat Intel in raw performance (that would be the i7 7700k) but has an advantage in terms of performance / price. So, having seen what a monopolized market looks like, we should all seriously consider buying AMD chips once in a while. Most of us probably won’t, though, because in Jeremy’s words: “The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment.” Funnily enough, gaming theory favors Intel.

Log in to Reply 16/05/2017 at 06:36 identiti_crisis says: It’s to do with the way that programming tasks are approached, in a schematic sense. We are effectively sequential beings, so we have historically more easily made things that run sequentially, with clear logical stops and checks. Intel’s CPUs do this really well, across multiple threads, in the classic “multi-tasking” approach. To exploit more of the parallel power in our computers, we’ve effectively needed new ways of programming, or of thinking about programming, and of constructing programming tasks in an algorithmic sense. The use of functional programming styles and moving away from traditional threading into more fragmented job-based approaches is a start. There is a risk in adapting any codebase in this way, so there will be a lot of inertia. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:34 Jeremy Laird says: The thing is, if Ryzen didn’t occasionally underperform, then we would all buy Ryzens. It’s not some irrational fear drummed up by Intel marketeers. The problem is that Ryzen is mostly fantastic, but where its performance is a little anomalous just so happens to take a form that slightly undermines it as a gaming CPU proposition. It’s by no means a terrible gaming CPU. It’s mostly a good gaming CPU. But if my life depended on a gaming CPU delivering a smooth subjective experience, I would choose Intel. In practice, if I was building a rig for myself today I would go Ryzen because I don’t have any PCs that are exclusively or really even primarily gaming PCs. They’re all multipurpose. I’d probably go with the 1700 and not need an upgrade for years. As an overall package, Ryzen is a really easy win. But for a system primarily for gaming, I still lean Intel for now. The margin isn’t huge. The trade offs are somewhat nuanced. But if I am providing advice about choosing a CPU for a primarily gaming rig, then that advice is that I think Intel remains the best choice today. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:15 Tyrmot says: I think as well while you *might* give intel the nod today, a very important consideration is that having 2 extra cores in your system right now is going to give a hell of a lot more future-proofing than going with 4. While it’s always wise to be a bit careful about future predictions, the scaling of software (including games) across more cores is, it’s reasonable to assume, pretty inevitable. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:39 Jeremy Laird says: I would agree with that except games having been supposedly going multi-threaded for years. And yet even today so few scale well to those extras cores. I thought when the consoles went to eight weedy AMD mobile cores, that would change. But here we are years later and it still hasn’t happened. It will probably, maybe even certainly, happen one day. But will it happen within the typical lifecycle of a CPU bought today? Hard to say. And thus I lean towards buying what works best right now. it’s also worth noting that’s its’ probably going to be an awfully long time before a major game dev puts out a game that runs poorly on a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake CPU. I really can’t see that happening for many years. So, I’m largely unconvinced by the future proofing argument. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:27 Addie says: At the moment, having to buy a new motherboard and RAM (and probably a new graphics card to make use of the CPU) makes this look a not-too-compelling upgrade over my FX9370. But probably by the time they’re a significant improvement the prices will have come down a bit and any bugs will be squashed. I’d certainly be looking to buy an Ryzen system if I was building from new, though. Looks like the main difference between the x370 chipsets and the b350 chipsets is that the former supports SLI / CFx? I thought that dual graphics cards were basically dead in the water now anyway, being supported by very few new games, and that one graphics card at twice the price was a much more sensible investment? In which case, you can cut the price of the motherboard in half and buy more RAM instead. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:30 Arathorn says: The B350 motherboards might not be great for overclocking, at least that is how I understood it when I was researching for my build. Apart from that, it seems to be a great platform. It kind of depends on what you intend to do with it. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 13:09 GurtTractor says: I think most B350 boards should be fine for overclocking actually, you are more likely to hit the wall in the silicon lottery on your specific CPU than exceed the potential of the board chipset. Always a good idea to check reviews and forums for people’s overclocking results though. The main benefits to X370 are the greater number of ports and things like fan headers, many of the board’s VRMs and other components are in theory a little better but the difference is not huge. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:28 Arathorn says: An extra thing to keep in mind is that the 1600 comes with a bundled cooler, and the 1600X does not, so the plain 1600 is an even better price proposition than the X. RAM support for Ryzen is still somewhat crappy, making it hard to get fast RAM to work at full speed at the moment. And Ryzen benefits from fast RAM because its clock speed is linked to the communication speed between Ryzen’s two core complexes. I finally bought and built a PC with the 1600 and an RX 580 video card last week, and so far I’m very happy with it. I haven’t been able to test it with something heavy yet for lack of games, but Doom 2016 is on offer on Steam this weekend, so that sounds like a fine opportunity.

You probably don’t know what the features are on an X370 and yet you’re assuming you need to spend the money for that. I personally got myself a cheap Gigabyte B350 Gaming (non-X even cheaper model) because I didn’t need crossfire or additional LED strip control. And this, for my Ryzen 7 1800X. And I am getting the most necessary feature, which is BIOS updates with new AGESA for memory compatibility updates. Disappointed in the article.

Days after reports of AMD releasing HEDT processors in June, a new report came out, this time for Intel. According to the rumors, Intel is planning on unveiling new Core i9 Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X HEDT processors sometime in June. In an article from Apple Insider, a leaker who goes by the handle “Sweepr” claims that Intel is preparing a presentation for the announcement of its new Core i9 platform. The new processors will feature a minimum of six cores and will go all the way up to 12 cores. The top-tier models will be the i9-7920X and the i9-7900X, each will have 12 and 10 cores, respectively. The second range of models will have six and eight cores in the i9-7800 product line. The i9-7820X will carry the eight core configuration while the i9-7800X will be the six core version. Alleged Core i9 lineup (via overclockers.ru) The 7900 series will offer as much as 16.5MB of L3 cache as well as 44 PCIe lanes. On the other hand, the 7800 series will only be able to support a maximum of 28 PCIe lanes and 11MB of L3 cache. The new HEDT platform will have a base clock of around 3.3GHz and a boost clock of 4.3GHz. Some models will be equipped with Intel’s Turbo Boost 3.0 that will bring the boost clock to as much as 4.5GHz. It is said that the processors, apart from the i9-7920X will be unveiled in June. Meanwhile, the i9-7920X will be unveiled sometime in August. For now, there are no indications about the pricing for the new Core i9 platform. However, consumers can expect that these processors will not come cheap. The current Broadwell-E i7-6950X ten-core processor costs around $1,800 on retail. Consumers should expect the new Core i9 processors to be price somewhere north of that. Another thing left to uncertainty is the idea of Apple using the said chip on the upcoming iMac and Mac Pro refreshes.

This chip was benchmarked against Intel's 10C/20T offering in the Core i9-7900X with its 3.3/4.0GHz base/boost clocks with 13.75MB of L3 cache, and the same PCIe lanes and TDP.     I put all of the scores into one of our benchmark templates, so you can see the scores in a much easier to understand way. As you can see the Core i9-7920X really is a monster, with the multi-core test score pushing 1760, leaving the Core i7-6950X in its rear view mirror, and the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X in its dust.   Even the 10C/20T chip in the Core i9-7900X doesn't do too well, with less performance than the current-gen Core i7-6950X @ 3.5GHz. The 7900X might be at its base 3.3GHz frequency, and the 7920X at 3.3GHz, which would explain these scores. The full 4.5GHz clocks on these Core i9 beasts might be scary good.   NEWS SOURCES:Eteknix.com >> NEXT STORY: RTG boss uses JFK quote for AMD Radeon RX Vega tease << PREVIOUS STORY: Hackers obtain upcoming 'Pirates of the Carribbean' film Related Tags Intel Intel Core i9 Core i9 benchmark Core i9-7920X AMD Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts HTC U11: Hands-on and first impressions It's official: HTC U11 doesn't have a headphone jack HTC launches HTC U11: Snapdragon 835, no headphone jack NVIDIA CEO: 'every human will be a gamer someday' Seth McFarlane launches live action sci-fi comedy showView More News Posts Forum Activity Computer suddenly Freezes MSI GS63VR STEALTH PRO 4K Gaming Laptop Review Gigabyte M8000X software bugged RAM for Gaming 7 Z270 MB ASRock Fatal1ty B250M Performance Motherboard ReviewView More Forum Posts Press Releases Micron accelerates all-flash storage speed, performance and value with new flexible petabyte-scale enterprise data center solution Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 and 630 mobile platforms drive advanced photography, enhanced gaming, integrated connectivity and machine learning Toshiba demonstrates latest 64-layer BiCS Flash on client NVM Express M.2 SSD at Dell EMC World ASUS announces two Cerberus gaming peripherals ASUS Republic of Gamers announces Strix Magnus microphoneView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

But it's not over yet: Intel has a new line of CPUs of their own, starting with Skylake-X in June this year. It all started with this image, which has flown around enthusiast forums and sites like wildfire over the last 24 hours: Image: Anandtech Forums It's taken from what appears to be a manufacturing presentation outlining Intel's Skylake-X series of CPUs. The most important element is that it takes away one of the main advantages AMD has with Ryzen right now: the i9 series starts with the hexacore/12 threaded i9-7800X, and goes all the way up to a 12 core/24 threaded i9-7920X, which will presumably settle into the same territory that the Broadwell-E/Haswell-E CPUs have done. For those focusing on more affordable gaming rigs, major changes include a bump in the available L2 cache to 1MB per core. The i7-7740K will become the new i7-7700K more or less, but from there every CPU will have 6 cores or more. Here's the rumoured specs from the deck above: Core i9-7920X 12C/24T 16.5MB L3 44 PCIe lanes Core i9-7900X 10C/20T 13.75MB L3 44 PCIe Lanes 3.3Ghz Base, 4.3Ghz Turbo 2.0, 4.5Ghz Turbo 3.0 Core i9-7820X 8C/16T 11MB L3 28 PCIe Lanes 3.6Ghz Base, 4.3Ghz Turbo 2.0, 4.5Ghz Turbo 3.0 Core i9-7800X 6C/12T 8.25MB L3 28 PCIe Lanes 3.5Ghz Base, 4.0Ghz Turbo 2.0 Core i7-7740K 4C/8T 8MB L3 16 PCIe Lanes 4.3Ghz Base, 4.5Ghz Turbo 2.0 Clock speeds for the i9-7920X haven't been leaked or revealed, and the chip supposedly won't be out until August anyway. As an added note, it's worth noting that all of this is rumoured at this point. That said, benchmarks have started to appear online. Earlier this morning, a listing surfaced on the SiSoftware benchmarking database featuring an Intel 6 core/12 threaded CPU running off the Basin Falls platform, which is expected to power Intel's Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs: Image: SiSoftware In short, you can expect Intel to pitch the i9-7820X against the Ryzen 7 1800X, the i9-7800X against the Ryzen 7 1700X, and the i7-7740K against the Ryzen 5 CPUs for the gaming enthusiast crowd. The rumoured leak adds that Skylake-X chips will also support DDR4-2666MHz memory, which isn't much of a surprise given that we're in 2017. It will be nice to see a 12 core CPU in 2017, but the reality is the 6 core or 8 core will be the most affordable and logical options for most gamers and consumers. We'll find out more about the CPUs in the coming months: Intel might have cancelled their annual developer forum for this year, but they've overtaken AMD as the sponsor of the PC Gaming Show at E3, and there's always Computex later this month. And as always, as soon as we know local pricing we'll pass the word along. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments nightcabbage @nightcabbage May 16, 2017, 11:59am All well and good to have more cores, however the clock speeds are slower, so single thread performance (including games) will actually be slower on these (than a 7700K, for example)... Same as the Ryzen CPUs... Great for video encoding and stuff though... Reply 1 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR May 16, 2017, 12:05pm Was the same case with Broadwell-E etc. versus the Skylake/Kaby Lake enthusiast CPUs as well. Reply 0 Camm @camm May 16, 2017, 12:42pm What will be interesting is more on AMD's side. Intel has the problem that as core counts increase, more silicon space (and thus also power) must be used in order to maintain cache coherency. AMD with its core complex design only maintains coherency between 4 cores, and copies out cache data cross fabric when needed. Whilst the fabric approach is slower from a cache access perspective, a tonne less silicon is used maintaining that coherency, so clockspeeds may be as high as any other current Ryzen part. Also, I can't see Intel pricing these aggressively enough again threadripper in the first place. Reply 0 sielinth @sielinth May 16, 2017, 12:46pm so I9, I7, I5 and I3? seems overly complicated, especially when you start throwing in mobile cpu (is that still a thing?) Reply 0 OzHuski Guest May 16, 2017, 3:22pm This isn't compatible with the current boards - people need to be aware they will have to upgrade to the new rumoured "X299" platform and intel won't cut costs - this thing will be expensive as hell as they won't canablise their pricing. And there is no "affordable" option even for the i7 compatible variant - you will still be paying for a brand new high end enthusiast board. The Ryzen 9's have also rumoured to leak with 16, 14, 12 and 10 core models and will much like the current lineup - probably be under half what intel is asking for, while adding in quad channel memory support and decent speeds. Its in everyone's best interest right now to wait - but there is a lot more interestin AMD camps CPUs right no due to cost alone. But let's face it, these are overpriced for gaming alone - if that's all your doing, get a R5 1600/R7 1700 or i7 7700 as that's still your best pics for pre gaming. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Research and Markets 15 May, 2017, 19:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "450Mm/Copper/Low-K Convergence: Timing, Trends, Issues, Market Analysis" report to their offering. A semiconductor foundry capable of processing 450mm wafers offers a tremendous economy of scale versus facilities working with smaller-diameter wafers, albeit with large startup costs required for the needed wafer-handling equipment. The larger wafers yield more semiconductor die, assuming that good material quality can be maintained across the surface of the larger wafers. As a rough approximation, only about one-half the wafer starts are required for a 450mm wafer facility compared to a 300mm wafer facility to produce the same number of die. ASML, one of the major equipment suppliers to chip factories, recently decided to stop trying to develop a new generation of machines that could handle 450mm wafers. No one is definitively ruling out 450mm, but even Intel agrees that it is on hold until the end of the decade. TSMC is not as vocal as Intel, but the Taiwan foundry giant is still interested in 450mm, as well. Still others believe 450mm fabs could get pushed out to the 2020 to 2025 timeframe. Now that work is on hold, along with the Intel investment in ASML's 450mm program. Equipment makers need a timely decision in order to move forward with their 450mm tool R&D efforts. This report addresses the timeline of 450mm acceptance based on the different requirements of logic versus memory chips. It also focused on the markets for copper interconnect and low-k dielectric deposition equipment and forecasts.

Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 00:00 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "450Mm/Copper/Low-K Convergence: Timing, Trends, Issues, Market Analysis" report to their offering. A semiconductor foundry capable of processing 450mm wafers offers a tremendous economy of scale versus facilities working with smaller-diameter wafers, albeit with large startup costs required for the needed wafer-handling equipment. The larger wafers yield more semiconductor die, assuming that good material quality can be maintained across the surface of the larger wafers. As a rough approximation, only about one-half the wafer starts are required for a 450mm wafer facility compared to a 300mm wafer facility to produce the same number of die. ASML, one of the major equipment suppliers to chip factories, recently decided to stop trying to develop a new generation of machines that could handle 450mm wafers. No one is definitively ruling out 450mm, but even Intel agrees that it is on hold until the end of the decade. TSMC is not as vocal as Intel, but the Taiwan foundry giant is still interested in 450mm, as well. Still others believe 450mm fabs could get pushed out to the 2020 to 2025 timeframe. Now that work is on hold, along with the Intel investment in ASML's 450mm program. Equipment makers need a timely decision in order to move forward with their 450mm tool R&D efforts. This report addresses the timeline of 450mm acceptance based on the different requirements of logic versus memory chips. It also focused on the markets for copper interconnect and low-k dielectric deposition equipment and forecasts.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links About PC Gamer Search Popular E3 2017 Intel vs AMD Battlegrounds PC Gaming Show Hardware Guides Best of 2017 Intel and AMD are about to clash with new high-end gaming CPUs By Jarred Walton It's looking like a new battleground for enthusiast PCs. Shares Intel has been the undisputed king of the PC world for the past decade, but AMD's Ryzen has started to shake things up. Offering more cores for less money, Ryzen is the first AMD CPU since Sledgehammer (K8) in 2004 to seriously challenge Intel's best. Following the successful launch of Ryzen 7 and 5 (competitors for Intel's Core i5 and i7) and the AM4 platform, AMD is prepping its X399 chipset and Ryzen 9 CPUs, potentially doubling the core count of Ryzen 7. Intel isn't about to go quietly into the night, pulling out its own heavy artillery in the form of Core i9 Skylake-X and Core i7 Kaby Lake-X processors for the upcoming LGA2066 / X299 platform. The high-end desktop market is set to become a new battleground for the PC enthusiast. Supposed leaks from both companies surfaced over the past week, and like all leaks we should approach the numbers with caution. I've seen plenty of fabricated numbers and model names in the past (eg, no one got the GTX 1080 Ti specs right before launch), but the specificity of the Core i9 and Ryzen 9 models implies we're not dealing with random guesses. And I've heard enough from motherboard manufacturers to say that the platforms definitely exist and are likely to show up at Computex in early June. With that in mind, here's the big picture of what's happening in the high-end desktop realm. Not an official image, at all. AMD's Ryzen 9 and X399 AMD isn't content to remain a 'budget' brand, a painful distinction the company has been dealing with since it launched the Bulldozer architecture in 2011. The Ryzen CPUs haven't necessarily beat Intel in every situation, but from a value perspective the Ryzen 5 1600 and Ryzen 7 1700 are awesome products. Those chips come very close to matching Intel's i7-6800K and i7-6900K performance, at one-half to one-third the price—though with lower maximum overclocks. Doubling down on the number of Ryzen die in the package will allow AMD to have up to 16-core/32-thread parts, in what will reportedly be a massive 4094-pin package (compared to AM4's relatively tame 1331 pin package). Just what the hell is AMD doing with all those pins? It's pretty simple, really: lots of memory channels and more PCIe lanes. The Ryzen 9 CPUs will use some derivative of AMD's Naples server product, only with half the cores (two Ryzen CPU die per package instead of four die). Naples can run up to 32-core/64-thread CPUs per socket, with eight memory channels and 128 PCIe lanes. Add all of that up and you get the 4094-pin requirement, and to avoid creating a third CPU socket, AMD will apparently leverage a modified SP3r2 for the high-end platform. Which means further down the road, we could conceivably get 32-core parts for the platform, but we're a long way off from needing such a configuration for even high-end desktops. What does all of this mean for performance? Single-threaded results are unlikely to change, but with the right workload Ryzen 9 should show excellent multi-core scaling. We've seen this with Ryzen 7 already, and the Infinity Fabric that connects the CPU die and packages on Ryzen 9 should allow 16-core parts to nearly double (at the same clockspeed) the multi-threaded performance of 8-core parts. For gaming, however, all those extra cores are likely going to waste. Very few games scale beyond 4-core/4-thread, and I'm not aware of any that really scale going from 6-core/12-thread to 8-core/16-thread—maybe Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation? If such a game exists, it's clearly in a very exclusive club, and I don't foresee most games pushing beyond 8-core/16-thread any time soon. Also a totally fake image. Intel's Core i9/i7 and X299 Intel, on the other hand, is continuing down the expected path, with a few minor tweaks. Core i9 (if that rumored name ends up being true) is a rebranding of existing 6-core and higher parts, but by moving the new chips into a separate brand Intel makes it easier to determine chip capabilities from the part number. Prior to Core i9, Core i7 ran the gamut of everything from ULV dual-core chips for laptops, to quad-core laptop and desktop parts, and on to 6/8/10-core enthusiast chips. Going forward, all the enthusiast chips could now sit in the first class Core i9 cabin. That's simple enough, but digging a little deeper into the leaked details on Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X, there are some noteworthy changes if everything bears out. By quadrupling the L2 cache size, Intel will keep the CPU pipelines running closer to capacity. First is the CPU architecture, which expands from a 4-wide superscalar pipeline to a 6-wide design. This potentially improves performance by up to 20 percent over the Haswell/Broadwell architecture, though in practice it's more like a 10-15 percent improvement. If you're interested in learning more about the Skylake/Kaby Lake architecture, check out our Kaby Lake need to know and Processors Architecture 101 articles. Intel isn't content to just port Skylake/Kaby Lake over to the high-end market without making a few tweaks, however, the biggest being that L2 cache size has been quadrupled from 256kB to 1024kB. Why does that matter? Cache is one of the main factors in keeping CPU cores fed with the data and instructions they need, when they need them. L1 cache provides information with effectively no pipeline stalls but is relatively small, while L2 cache has much more storage space but also higher latency (which means lost efficiency as the CPU cores wait for data to arrive from L2 cache). L3 cache repeats that pattern, with even more capacity and higher latency than L2, but it's still many times faster than waiting for DRAM to respond. By quadrupling the L2 cache size (assuming latency hasn't changed too much), Intel will keep the CPU pipelines running closer to capacity—possibly another 5-10 percent improvement in performance, depending on the workload. Combine all of this with reported stock clockspeeds that are substantially higher, at least for maximum turbo clocks, and the Core i9 parts should prove potent for nearly any workload. The 10-core i7-6950X as an example has a base clock of 3.0GHz with a turbo clock of 3.5GHz, with Turbo Max allowing up to 4.0GHz on a single core with the right motherboard and BIOS settings. The new 10-core i7-7900X, assuming the leaked specs are correct, has a 3.3GHz base and a 4.3GHz maximum turbo, with Turbo Max allowing up to 4.5GHz. AMD vs. Intel round 9: FIGHT! What can we expect from AMD's renewed aggression in the high-end market? Ultimately, it will come down to two things: actual pricing and intended use. For pure gaming use, the biggest factor will be per-core performance and clockspeed, at least for the near term. That means Intel will hold the advantage, as we'll likely see a clockspeed advantage of 300-500MHz (10 percent), along with an architectural advantage per core of around 10-15 percent. If you're putting together a gaming PC, even with multiple GPUs, don't expect Ryzen 9 to radically change the position of AMD's parts. For single-GPU users, you can see how GTX 1080 Ti performance differs between the Ryzen 7 (overclocked to 3.9GHz) and the Core i7-5930K (overclocked to 4.5GHz). With both Ryzen 9 and Core i9 targeting the enthusiast market, I expect GTX 1080 Ti or RX Vega to be the minimum GPU most enthusiasts will use, meaning even if it costs hundreds of dollars more, Skylake-X will be the winner for gaming. Of course, if you're running at 4K, regardless of your GPU, you're still likely limited by graphics rather than CPU in most cases. With more cores at every price point, Ryzen 9 should win a reasonable share of the multi-threaded benchmark metrics. Outside of gaming, the story will be different. Even if Intel holds a moderate clockspeed and architecture advantage, AMD is more than happy to throw additional CPU cores at the problem. 4-core/8-thread Ryzen 5 against 4-core/8-thread i7-7700K ends up with Intel winning every benchmark, but at a higher price. At the same $330 price, however, Ryzen 7-1700 against the i7-7700K lets AMD smoke Intel in multi-threaded workloads like video editing. And at $500, AMD has a higher clocked 8-core/16-thread part going up against Intel's 6-core/12-thread parts—you'll pay twice as much for the CPU to get eight threads from Intel. If the pricing pattern holds, I expect the 12-core Ryzen 9 chips to cost roughly the same as Intel's 8-core chips, and the 16-core Ryzen parts will probably cost half as much as the 12-core i9-7920X. And with more cores at every price point, Ryzen 9 should win a reasonable share of the multi-threaded benchmark metrics. AMD will still be offering the cheaper option—but in high-end parts instead of budget territory. Intel may drop prices on the 8-core/10-core offerings to be more competitive, if it feels enough pressure from AMD, but Intel is also worried about cannibalizing sales of its lucrative Xeon server line. High performance 12-core Broadwell Xeons cost over $2000 right now, so more performance at a substantially lower price with Skylake-X may not happen. But servers and high-end desktops don't overlap too much, so one likely scenario is that the i9-7920X takes over the $1700 price point of the 10-core i7-6950X, the 10-core i9-7900X goes for the $1000 price point, and 8-core i9-7820X will land closer to $600. Pricing advantage still goes to AMD, however. Assuming Ryzen 9 and Core i9 line up with what the rumor mill is saying (and the specs look pretty realistic), the new platforms and processors should continue with the current pattern. Intel will win its share of benchmarks, but often at a higher price, while AMD will perform well in scenarios where core counts are important. We should find out a lot more about official model numbers, prices, and launch dates at Computex, which kicks off at the end of May.

Image Credit: Wichy/Shutterstock I think it was The Pixies that said “If man is an i5, then God is an i7” — or something like that. I’m not great with lyrics. But, regardless, Intel is allegedly preparing to show us what i9 is and AMD will have a competitor of its own. Intel is preparing to reveal a new line of Core i9 processors for enthusiasts that will feature six-or-more cores, according to a leaked image on the AnandTech forums. AMD, meanwhile, is planning to launch its Threadripper CPUs that feature 10-or-more cores in June, according to a report on WCCFTech. These new chips should compete directly against one another as the new high-end chips for consumers looking to build extremely capable rigs. But since Intel nor AMD have made any official announcements, we still don’t pricing or exact release dates. When it comes to Intel, the company is planning to roll out the new Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X chips, and it is the latter that will get the Core i9 branding. Here’s the lineup starting with the most powerful: Core i9-7920X: 12 cores/24 threads, unknown clock, 16.5MB cache, 140W, 44 PCIe lanes Core i9-7900X: 10 cores/20 threads, 3.3-to-4.3GHz, 13.75MB cache, 140W, 44 PCIe lanes Core i9-7820X: 8 cores/16 threads, 3.6-to-4.3GHz, 11MB cache, 140W, 28 PCIe lanes Core i9-7800X: 6 cores/12 threads, 3.5-to-4GHz, 8.25MB cache, 140W, 28 PCIe lanes For AMD, this is part of its Ryzen 9 line. Here are the rumored details: Ryzen 9 1998X: 16 cores/32 threads, 3.5-to-3.9GHz, 155W Ryzen 9 1998: 16 cores/32 threads, 3.2-to-3.6GHz, 155W Ryzen 9 1977X: 14 cores/28 threads, 3.5-to-4.1GHz, 155W Ryzen 9 1977: 14 cores/28 threads, 3.2-to-3.7GHz, 140W Ryzen 9 1976X: 12 cores/24 threads, 3.6-to-4.1GHz, 140W Ryzen 9 1956X: 12 cores/24 threads, 3.2-to-3.8GHz, 125W Ryzen 9 1956: 12 cores/24 threads, 3.0-to-3.7GHz, 125W Ryzen 9 1955X: 10 cores, 3.6-to-4.0GHz, 125W Ryzen 9 1955: 10 cores, 3.1-to-3.7GHz, 125W Gamers will probably only need these CPUs in specific circumstances because an i7 Kaby Lake or a high-end Ryzen 7 are going to handle even 4K gaming without bottlenecking your performance. But, at the same time, it’s exciting to see how Intel and AMD want to take this space forward and what the high-end is going to look like. And if these rumors prove accurate, this PC gaming monkey has gone to heaven. VentureBeat's PC Gaming channel is presented by the Intel® Game Dev program. Get the news you can use.

Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich recently disclosed major advances in Microsoft’s hyperscale deployment of Intel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). According to the company’s press release, these advances have resulted in the industry’s fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that replicate “thinking” in a manner that’s conceptually similar to that of the human brain. “From our early work accelerating Bing search using FPGAs added to the Intel Xeon processor-based servers, to this new Hardware Microservices model that underlies the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) infrastructure that Mark discussed yesterday afternoon, Microsoft is continuing to invest in novel hardware acceleration infrastructure using Intel FPGAs,” said Doug Burger, one of Microsoft’s Distinguished Engineers. “Application and server acceleration requires more processing power today to handle large and diverse workloads, as well as a careful blending of low power and high performance—or performance per Watt, which FPGAs are known for,” said Dan McNamara, corporate vice president and general manager, Programmable Solutions Group, Intel. “Whether used to solve an important business problem, or decode a genomics sequence to help cure a disease, this kind of computing in the cloud, enabled by Microsoft with help from Intel FPGAs, provides a large benefit,” he added.

The previous generation included the Core-i7 6800K (six-core), 6900K (eight-core), and 6950X (ten-core), which were released six months after the 6700K (four-core). However, a few details have now allegedly surfaced regarding a new line of multi-core CPUs, which will fall under the Core-i9 moniker. According to a photo that originated on the AnandTech forums, the following specifications outline the upcoming Intel Core-i9 CPUs: CPU Name Cores/Threads Base Clock Boost Clock Core-i9 7920X 12 / 24 N/A N/A Core-i9 7900X 10 / 20 3.3GHz 4.3GHz Turbo 2.0 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 Core-i9 7820X 8 / 16 3.6GHz 4.3GHz Turbo 2.0 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 Core-i9 7800X 6 / 12 3.5GHz 4.0GHz The 7920X and 7900X models are said to feature 44 PCI-e lanes and a TDP of 160 watts, while the 7820X and 7800X will have 28 PCI-e lanes with a 140 watt TDP. All Core-i9 processors will be based on the Skylake-X architecture, an evolution of the previous Broadwell-E. Two additional Core-i7 CPUs based on the Kaby Lake architecture were also revealed. The 7740K is a beefier version of the 7700K that’ll still have four cores and eight threads, but a base clock of 4.3GHz and boost clock of 4.5GHz. The 7640K is essentially a souped-up Core-i5 7600K, which will have four cores and four threads with a 4.0GHz core clock and 4.3GHz boost clock. Intel’s new processors are anticipated to have a full reveal in June at or around the time of Computex, the largest annual computer hardware convention. There hasn’t been any hint of the price of each model yet. For performance metrics on Intel’s current 12-core CPU, check out our review of the Core-i7 6950X.

The two tech giants filed amicus briefs with the Northern California District Court on Friday supporting the American regulator in its crackdown on Qualy, and urged Judge Lucy Koh to reject Qualcomm's motion to dismiss the probe. The FTC has sued Qualcomm in January alleging it illegally demanded its customers pay licensing fees for patented technology they did not actually use. In their briefs, both Samsung [PDF] and Intel [PDF] say that they have seen first-hand how Qualcomm's alleged policies have harmed competition in the market by walling off competitors. Samsung and Intel are, by the way, fierce rivals with Qualcomm: the latter's Snapdragon line competes with Samsung's mobile and Intel's laptop chips, and its Centriq family is gunning for Intel's server sales. "The FTC's allegations of anticompetitive conduct reflect the reality that Intel has experienced in the marketplace," said Chipzilla, whose LTE business also competes directly with Qualcomm in the wireless broadband market. "Further proceedings in this case will shed much-needed light on Qualcomm's abusive practices and the harms those practices inflict on the competitive process and on consumers." Among the accusations leveled at Qualcomm is misuse of standard-essential patents (SEPs). Normally, when patents are vital to a technology standard, the owner will agree to offer licensing to all comers (including potential competitors) under a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) pricing policy. According to Samsung, Qualcomm has not been holding up its FRAND obligations, instead telling hardware vendors they must agree to exclusivity deals in order to get licensing rights. "Qualcomm has not upheld its end of the bargain: Despite declaring thousands of SEPs, Qualcomm altogether refuses to license SEPs to rival chipset manufacturers, instead licensing only handset manufacturers," Samsung writes. "Qualcomm then leverages and solidifies this market power by charging a 'tax' to handset manufacturers that further cements its monopoly power by imposing terms that significantly diminish demand for competing chipsets. And because Qualcomm does not license competitors, handset manufacturers have no choice but to accept Qualcomm's onerous terms. In short, Qualcomm directly excludes competitors and harms competition." Samsung and Intel join an increasingly impressive roster of companies who take issue with Qualcomm's patent dealings. Apple has charged that Qualcomm's unfair licensing terms led to it overpaying suppliers to the tune of $1bn. And the FTC legal challenge specifically accuses Qualcomm of screwing over Apple in chip tech licensing. ® Tips and corrections 1 Comment MORE Samsung Intel Patents Qualcomm Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Bullyboy Apple just blew a $500m hole in our wallet, cries Qualcomm Chip biz says Cook's crew has commanded tech world to withhold patent dosh 31 Comments Apple goes global in Qualcomm license war: Patent spat hits China One-billion Yuan lawsuit in Middle Kingdom alleges further royalty wrongdoings 11 Comments One BEEELLION dollars: Apple sues Qualcomm, one of its chip designers Snapdragon biz's bad week just got worse 57 Comments BlackBerry wins $814m Qualcomm patent-cap arbitration Besties still 4 Comments Qualcomm eyes NXP lunch 6 Comments US watchdog sues Qualcomm for 'bribing' Apple to swallow chips Snapdragon biz broke monopoly laws, FTC claims in bombshell lawsuit 23 Comments Whitepapers Secure Mobile Development Best Practices Covering the vulnerabilities hackers might use to launch an attack, and remediation tips that you can use to build security into your app. Blending Cloud-native and Conventional Applications This IDC InfoBrief, sponsored by Red Hat, reviews ten lessons from early adopters for successful integration of cloud native and traditional applications.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links About PC Gamer Search Popular E3 2017 Intel vs AMD Battlegrounds PC Gaming Show Hardware Guides Best of 2017 Intel Core i9 leak points to Intel's first new processor line in years By Paul Lilly Leaked slide shows Intel's enthusiasts CPUs getting their own branding. Shares (Image: © Intel) Let's be honest, Intel hasn't released anything particularly exciting in a long while now. It's the reason my primary desktop is still rocking an Intel Core i7-4790K Devil's Canyon processor released several years ago. Sure, I could scamper over to an X99 configuration, but at this point it makes more sense to see what Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X bring to the table. That remains to be seen, though if the latest rumor is to believed, at minimum we can expect new branding, at least for Skylake-X. A forum member at AnandTech posted what is purported to be an internal slide outlining a new crop of Core i9 processors. The photo is blurry and low quality, of course, because for whatever reason every leaker in the world seems to own a Fisher Price camera and has an aversion to screenshots. But criticisms over the quality of the leak aside, it looks like Intel is readying a potent lineup. If information is accurate, Intel's Kaby Lake-X processors will stick with Intel's Core i7 branding. There will be two chips in this tier, including: Core i7-7740K: 4C/8T, 4.3GHz to 4.5GHz, 8MB cache, 112W, 16 PCIe lanes Core i7-7640K: 4C/4T, 4GHz to 4.2GHz, 6MB cache, 112W, 16 PCIe lanes The other four processors shown in the slide are all Skylake-X chips with Intel's new Core i9 branding. It's a sensible change, with Intel moving all new 6-core and higher processors to the new brand. The i9 parts consist of the following: Core i9-7920X: 12C/24T, unknown clocks, 16.5MB cache, 140W, 44 PCIe lanes Core i9-7900X: 10C/20T, 3.3GHz to 4.3GHz, 13.75MB cache, 140W, 44 PCIe lanes Core i9-7820X: 8C/16T, 3.6GHz to 4.3GHz, 11MB cache, 140W, 28 PCIe lanes Core i9-7800X: 6C/12T, 3.5GHz to 4GHz, 8.25MB cache, 140W, 28 PCIe lanes The two middle SKUs will also feature Turbo Max support with both the Core i9-7920X and Core i9-7900X being able to hit 4.5GHz in some situations. None of the other processors leaked here list Turbo Max support, though it's possible the Core i9-7920X will, since no clockspeeds were provided. All the Core i9 Skylake-X and Core i7 Kaby Lake-X CPUs will run on Intel's upcoming X99/LGA2066 platform. That includes support for quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory, according to the slide. None of this is official, of course, but if the specs do end up being accurate, it is interesting that Intel will again slash the number of PCIe lanes on its lower end enthusiast processors. That could push power users to purchase a higher end part even if the additional physical cores and threads aren't needed. Meanwhile, it looks like AMD may take a different approach with its Ryzen 9 series for enthusiasts, all of which are rumored to offer 44 PCIe lanes. In related news, Guru3D dug up some supposed benchmarks of the Core i9-7900X and Core i9-7920X. In UserBenchmark, the former scored 107 points in single-core performance and 1,467 points in multi-core performance, whereas the latter scored 130 points and 1,760 points, respectively. As a point of reference, Intel's Core i7-6950X scored 117 points in single-core performance and 1,526 points in multi-core performance.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "These events add real value to me as an employee, and as a citizen of the net." --April 2017 "I now have a much better understanding of the controversy surrounding the Snowden leaks and have an idea of what I can do as a private citizen to combat the government's use of mass surveillance." --April 2017 "The topic was compelling and the level of expertise of the speaker made the information received very credible and thus easy to find relevant to my work." --April 2017 "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Thursday, July 20, 2017: Are you an introvert? Working Across Personality Types with Jennifer Selby-Long Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Engineers are introverted. Agile = meetings all the time. Works well for extroverts. Over the past year a few hundred staff at Mozilla have used the Insights Discovery tool to better learn about their individual personality temperaments, and to be more effective on their teams. But can these tests really help us? What’s the real science behind them? Can they be abused? Or are there ways they can help us work together better? On July 20, Jennifer Selby Long, an expert in the ethical use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), will lead us in a very interactive session on this material. She’ll help us explore these frameworks and the science behind them, with a focus specifically on their Introversion / Extraversion dimensions and workplace collaboration. Importantly, we’ll make it personal, rolling up our sleeves with some exercises to help us explore how our (and our team’s) MBTI preferences can help us work together better, regardless of job description, culture, or demographics. Hosts: Matt Frassica & Tyler Haugen Speaker: Jennifer Selby-Long Jennifer Selby Long is an executive coach, management consultant, and MBTI® expert who helps technology leaders navigate the challenges of seismic change to achieve their highest potential. She also advises on the impact of personality and gender on financial behavior. Jennifer is the past president of the Association for Psychological Type. She has been quoted by business and technology writers in the Fast Company, Information World, Dice.com, Univision, and the Bulletin of Psychological Type. She is an award-winning business writer and the author of Traveling Light, a blog helping leaders skyrocket their impact and lighten the load in their lives.

In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Adrian Hon is CEO and founder at Six to Start, co-creators of the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world, Zombies, Run!. The game has won awards for its stories and storylike games, and the team’s work has been displayed at the MOMA and Design Museum in London. He’s the author of A History of the Future in 100 Objects, and he used to write about technology for The Telegraph. Previously, Adrian was Executive Producer and Director of Play at Mind Candy from 2004 to 2007, where he designed and produced the Perplex City alternate reality game (ARG). Adrian’s interest in ARGs began with the genre itself in 2001, when as a moderator for the Cloudmakers community for ‘The Beast’ (an ARG for Steven Spielberg’s A.I.), he wrote a detailed walkthrough for the game, called ‘The Guide.' During that time, Adrian studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in experimental psychology and neuroscience. In 2003, he began a neuroscience DPhil at Oxford, but left after a year to join Mind Candy. Adrian has also spoken at the main TED conference in Monterey in 2001 (about the human colonisation of Mars), as well as various SXSW, GDC, Economist, and other such tech and gaming conferences.

Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015).

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Is Intel Corporation's Manufacturing Execution Improving? Chipzilla has done a good job of consistently executing on derivative technologies based on its original 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, but this Fool wants to see how Intel's 10-nanometer technology turns out. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 15, 2017 at 2:15PM For quite a while I have been critical of chip giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) execution vis-a-vis chip manufacturing technology. The company has long touted its leadership position relative to its major competitors, but over the last few years, Intel's execution here appears to have faltered as said competitors seem to have substantially improved their own. Intel's execution issues in chip manufacturing can essentially be boiled down to two things: Intel hasn't been able to launch fundamentally new manufacturing technologies at the rate that it had done previously, while competitors seem to be moving more quickly. When Intel does finally bring a technology into high volume, it seems to start production at lower manufacturing yields (aka higher costs) than it did in the past, indicating even further "delays" normalized for yields. Image source: Intel. After Intel hosted its Technology and Manufacturing Group (TMG) Day back in March, and after some new information leaked out about the company's upcoming product schedules, it's worth checking in to see if Intel has made progress in shoring up its execution in manufacturing technology. 14nm+ and 14nm++ seem to have gone well enough Intel has made it clear that it aims to deliver multiple "waves" on a given chip-manufacturing technology. The idea is that the company expects to take longer to deliver new manufacturing technologies with substantially reduced chip area compared to previous ones, but in the interim, Intel's product teams can still deliver better products through a combination of design enhancements and manufacturing technology performance boosts. In the second half of last year, Intel launched its first seventh-generation Core processors (often referred to by its codename, Kaby Lake) using its 14nm+ technology. The technology was quite good (Intel claims a 12% performance boost over its first-gen 14-nanometer technology), enabling sizable performance enhancements across many of Intel's product lines (particularly those that are power constrained). The company's first products based on its 14nm++ technology -- which Intel says will offer another double-digit jump in performance -- should begin to ship in the third quarter of this year. Indeed, both Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake refresh chips for notebooks, as well as its first Coffee Lake chips (aimed at the enthusiast gaming market), are expected to launch in the third quarter of this year. That's about a year after the first 14nm+ products made it to market. The jury's still out on 10nm, though Intel has done a good job of consistently executing on derivative technologies based on its original 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, but before I'm ready to confidently state that Intel's execution has improved, I want to see how it does with its 10-nanometer technology. The transition from any 14-nanometer derivative to 10 nanometer should be much more difficult (and much more indicative of management execution) than the transition from any one 14-nanometer derivative to another one. If Intel can smoothly deliver products based on its 10-nanometer technology and then follow them up relatively quickly with 10nm+ and 10nm++ based products, then that'd be solid evidence that things have really begun to turn around for the company's manufacturing division. However, if the 10-nanometer product rollout isn't smooth and is plagued with issues, then that'd be a clear sign that the company's manufacturing group is being poorly managed and ripe for a shakeup.

At one time, gaming machines meant hulking monstrosities of desktop computers. However as computers evolved, smaller devices boasted equal computing power. Thus laptops began competing with desktops in the gaming space. Among portables, there’s a subset of laptops called notebooks. A notebook is defined by its smaller firm factor, slimmer profile, and decreased weight. Contrary to size, notebooks may offer superb gaming capabilities. Discover the ultimate gaming notebook with a look at five of the best notebooks ever made. What Is an “Ultimate” Notebook? Chances are you’ve used the terms “laptop” and “notebook” interchangeably. A notebook is a lightweight, portable computer. Generally, notebooks clock in at six pounds or less. Yet despite their small size and weight, notebooks still pack in processing power equivalent to their laptop counterparts. A laptop is a portable computer as well. But these are usually a bit larger in both size and weight. Opting for a laptop or notebook over a desktop yields several advantages. There’s still loads of processing power, but where you go your machine goes. Desktops require a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and power outlet. Notebooks take up less space than traditional desktops as well. However laptops and notebooks lack the upgrade paths presented by desktops, and processing performance differs as well. Despite what you might think gaming laptops differ from desktops What's The Real Difference Between A Gaming Laptop And Desktop? What's The Real Difference Between A Gaming Laptop And Desktop? The fact that laptops are slower than desktops is common knowledge, but how much slower is hard to quantify, and gamers find themselves weighing the reduction in performance against the price tag and the portability.

So how do we define “ultimate?” We’ll focus on all gaming notebooks that are virtual-reality ready Best PCs for Virtual Reality Best PCs for Virtual Reality We've heard about the Oculus Rift for a long time now. HTC teamed up with Steam VR, creating the HTC Vive virtual reality headset. But what's the best PC to power them? Read More . Plus, we’ll balance performance, price, and portability. Hitting these three “P” areas will yield a notebook that’s the ultimate. 5 of the Best Notebooks Ever Made Dell Inspiron 15 7000 ($800) Image Credit: Dell The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is a superb gaming notebook. Not only is the Inspiron 15 7000 a top performer, but it sports a unique chassis. Laptop Mag praised its stunning form factor and comfortable keyboard. The 15 7000 balances power and portability. Weighing in at 5.8 pounds, it’s easy to tote around. Moreover, the battery lasts over 11 hours. Despite its excellent feature set, the Inspiron 15 7000 runs a bit hot on the bottom. Additionally, Laptop Mag comments that its display is pretty muted and inaccurate. Nevertheless, with a 7th generation Intel Core i5 processor and Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti GPU, the Dell Inspiron 7000 is a high performing, portable notebook. The baseline 256 GB SSD is speedy, but you’ll likely want the standard hard drive option. Especially if you’re installing games, you’ll relish the extra storage space. Still, for under $1,000, it’s tough to beat the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. This notebook is visually captivating, capable of gaming, and lightweight. Pros Intel Core i5 Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti GPU 5.8 pounds Innovative single-hinge design Cons Gets hot Lackluster display Alienware 13 R3 ($1,300) Image Credit: Dell While gamers value GPUs and CPUs, screens rank among the most important aspects of gaming machines. The Alienware 13 employs an OLED screen as its viewing device. The resulting images are gorgeous. As PC World notes in its review, the OLED display reproduces brilliant, rich colors. Expect rich darks, and deep blacks, with an enhanced sharpness. Additionally, OLED displays are more energy efficient than LCD screens. So you’ll benefit from better battery life. The OLED-outfitted Alienware 13 features a 2560 x 1440 screen. The 13-inch notebook is a mere 5.5 lbs. That’s a tad heavy for notebooks, but still under 6 lbs. PC World admired the small stature and compact size, as well as brilliant OLED display. It’s a solid overall performer with a GTX 1060 and 6 GB of VRAM. Scoring well in benchmarks, the Alienware 13 handles both 1080p and 4K gaming well. However, PC World admits that the Alienware 13 gets warm under its keyboard under stress. Plus, while the 5.5 lbs. is light for a gaming machine, it’s still on the heavy side. But Alienware’s 13 manages stellar performance and packs in one of the best screens available. Pros OLED screen available GTX 1060 with 6 GB VRAM 5.5 lbs. i7-6700HQ Small form factor Cons Keyboard gets warm during stress Heavy for its size Razer Blade ($1,900) Image Credit: Best Buy Razer is well-entrenched in the gaming space.

Everyone uses keyboards, but few people think about them when buying a new PC. Read More . Considering Razer’s dominance in the accessories department, it’s no surprise the Razer Blade laptop offers uncompromising size, portability, and performance. The Blade boasts a VR-ready GPU in a GTX 1060 with 6 GB of VRAM and 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake CPU. At 4.2 pounds, ports are slightly scarce. But you’ll find everything you need including USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, and a Thunderbolt 3 port. The Thunderbolt connector hooks up to a 4K display and is compatible with Razer’s external graphics amplifier. Laptop Mag appreciates the Razer Blade for its beefy specs and incredibly slim chassis. For under $2,000 you get a VR-capable machine that’s among the smallest, most portable, and lightest gaming rigs available. But the Blade does not come cheap. As you begin adding options such as a 4K touchscreen, you’ll jack the price to almost $3,000. Furthermore, heat management is really tough for the Blade. Trying to keep this rig cool calls to mind a certain quote from “Blade” about trying to ice skate uphill. Laptop Mag found that 15 minutes of The Witcher 3 got the Razer Blade hotter than that infamous scene of Geralt in a bathtub. Razer also manufacturers the Blade Pro which delivers a desktop replacement in a portable package. Ultimately, the Blade is a beautiful, ultra-portable gaming notebook that doesn’t sacrifice performance with its portability. Pros 7th generation Intel CPU GTX 1060 4.2 pounds Lots of ports Thunderbolt 3 for expansion 4K touchscreen available VR-ready Cons Gets hot quickly Adding options jacks up price MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro-230 ($1,800) Image Credit: Amazon MSI’s VR-ready GS63VR yields plenty of power in a slim design. For under $2,000, you can snag a well-endowed gaming laptop. The GS6VR comes with an i7-7700HQ CPU, GTX 1060 GPU, 16 GB RAM, and 256 GB NVMe SSD as well as a 2 TB hard drive. It’s VR-capable and (despite the plentiful storage, graphics, and processing options) weighs in at 4 pounds. You also get a 15.6-inch 1080p screen.  In their review, PC World dubbed the MSI GS63VR a game-changing notebook. Like the Blade, the GS63VR balances performance and portability brilliantly. It’s got the MSI aesthetic with three-zone backlight and full keyboard replete with 10-key number pad. In its benchmarks, PC World found the GTX 1060 about on par with the desktop GTX 980. Yet PC World found the 4K screen underwhelming. Additionally, the speakers sounded underpowered and tinny. While most laptop speakers are unimpressive, those on the GS63VR are particularly bland considering its premium looks. Asus ROG Strix GL502 ($1,700/£1,667) Image Credit: Amazon If the GS63VR don’t meet your needs, consider the Asus ROG Strix GL502. It’s available with a GTX 1060 or GTX 1070, core i7 Intel CPU, and full-HD 1080p screen. But the Pro-230 offers insane performance in a thin package that’s also competitively priced. Pros Reasonable price GTX 1060 VR-ready i7-7700HQ Plentiful storage options 1080p 15.6-inch screen 4 pounds Cons Optional 4K screen is lackluster Awful speakers What’s the Ultimate Gaming Notebook? Gaming laptops are increasingly available. Many laptops offer superb performance in small form factors. If you want one of the best screens available, the Asus NX500 features a Quantum Dot screen that’s lovely. However, it’s extremely expensive, at well over 2K. Plus, that’s as outfitted with a GTX 850M GPU which is pretty underpowered compared with the Nvidia 10-series GPUs. There’s also the Acer Predator 21x. But at $9,000, it’s really difficult to recommend, or even call “ultimate.” As PC Mag states, it’s a beast for 3D gaming and boasts a massive 21-inch screen and a mechanical keyboard. But it’s almost 20 pounds and requires two power bricks. Moreover, there’s no 4K screen which for the price of a decent used car, you would assume might be standard. So while the 21x rocks dual GTX 1080 GPUs and 64 GB of RAM as well as an overclocked i7, it’s touch to call it the best. Sure, it’s the most well-endowed, but you can buy a fantastic laptop and desktop for substantially less than the price of the 21 x. HP is probably better known among casual PC users, but its Omen line is fantastic. My main work rig is an HP Omen with a 17-inch screen, i7-6700HQ CPU, and GTX 965m. It’s a high performer with premium specs and only a few tradeoffs like a flimsy disk drive (hey, at least it has one), and lots of plastic.

The upcoming products, incorporating IBM Power Systems servers for business apps, will be Nutanix's first systems that will not rely on Intel (intc)-based servers. San Jose-based Nutanix (ntnx), which went public in September, helped pioneer a generation of data center hardware bundles that cram computing power, storage, and networking into one package—all managed by the company's own software. The theory is these hardware bundles–described as "hyperconverged" by techies—save space and energy while also speeding up operations. Bottom line: Corporate customers could now use a single, more efficient machine to do what many devices had done in the past. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. For non-techies, Nutanix CEO Dheeraj Pandey explains these new data center products are like smartphones in that they have integrated a raft of once-separate devices into one attractive package. Just as today's smartphones incorporate a phone, GPS, calendars, and a camera into one slick device, these new data center appliances put together server, networking, and storage hardware into one package all run by the same software. Related: Why Big Data Kills Businesses Nutanix already offers a choice of Intel-based servers from Dell, Supermicro, Lenovo (lnvgy), and Cisco (csco) as part of its overall package. IBM's Power Systems run a non-Intel Power chip that IBM says is well-suited for the advanced data crunching needs of artificial intelligence and data analytics tasks. Related: Nutanix Shows the Risk of Unicorn Valuations The upcoming IBM Power-based Nutanix appliances will suit a different set of jobs than their Intel-based cousins, Pandey tells Fortune. This version of the Nutanix appliance should appeal to customers requiring machine learning tasks, adds Stefanie Chiras, vice president of Power Systems for IBM. Some of the targeted customers include financial services firms needing to do fraud detection, big retailers that need ensure to their customers have the best shopping experience, and healthcare providers needing to scrutinize images such as those for MRIs for diagnostic purposes, Chiras cites. All of these jobs require computing fire power that can take in reams of data fast, and then search through it for patterns, and return results quickly. Related: Nutanix CEO Talks IPO While Intel chips dominate in PCs and general-purpose servers, IBM and its allies in the Power Open Foundation are pushing IBM's Power chips for the massive number crunching jobs mentioned above. Other members of the foundation include Google (googl), Mellanox (mlnx), Nvidia (nvda), Red Hat (rht), and Micron (mu).

By Tiernan Ray Updated May 15, 2017 11:30 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Maquarie Capital’s Srini Pajjuri today reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of Intel (INTC), and a $40 price target, writing that the firm has nothing to fear from the forthcoming server chip of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which offers “nothing groundbreaking." AMD is set to hold its annual analyst day meeting tomorrow, when it is expected the company may talk about its upcoming server chip, code-named “Naples,” which is expected to become available in the near future. “While Naples’s specs look good on paper, we do not see any groundbreaking features,” writes Pajjuri. “We expect Intel to remain well ahead in per-core performance is key for most mainstream workloads." Pajjuri compares Naples to Intel’s forthcoming “Purley” server-chip upgrade. In his view, Intel will maintain its lead in the performance of a single CPU “core,” which he thinks will keep Intel ahead in data centers versus the multi-core advantages that Naples may have. He details how the two stack up: Server CPU purchasing decisions are made based on overall system performance, platform stability, and total cost of ownership (TCO) metrics. Comparing CPU specs won’t give a complete picture but is a decent starting point. Naples’s specs appear impressive with 32 cores (versus up to 28 or 32 for Purley.) Memory channels versus six 128 PCIe lanes (versus 96), and integrated chipsets versus discrete. However Naples is not a single chip solution. Instead it is a multi-chip module with four discrete CPUs connected with a high-speed fabric (likely due to cost reasons.) We believe the fabric is fast, but Naples's per-core performance is likely well below that of Purley. Internet blogs have speculated the base clock speed to be 1.4 GHz versus 2.0 to 3.6 GHz for Purley. The modular approach also limit system performance in certain applications (when one CPU accesses the memory in a different CPU). And how this may hold back AMD in cloud computing and machine learning: Software compatibility is less of an issue for AMD, but it's long absence from the server market means that customers will need additional investments to optimize workloads. While cloud/hyper scale customers might use Naples as a bargaining chip against Intel, we aren't sure if many will find its performance/features compelling enough to actually adopt it. For example search applications at Google/Microsoft typically require high-performance cores. For public clouds such as Amazon EC2, using a CPU with lower per core performance limits the “Elasticity,” or “Burstablity." Amazon uses high-frequency Xeon's even in i3 (high I/O) and d2 (dense storage) instances. That said, Naples might be decent alternative for storage (AWS S3), scale-out Web servers, and Memcached applications. AMD shares today are up 24 cents, or 2%, at $11.50, while Intel stock is down 4 cents at $35.49.

Back in January, the FTC filed a complaint accusing Qualcomm of using its dominant position in the market to reduce the threat of competition. More specifically, Qualcomm is being accused of elevating fees for its licenses to rival baseband processor makers, thus putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Qualcomm has denied the charges, and filed its own brief to have the case dismissed, though Intel and Samsung’s meddling certainly won’t help matters for the chipmaker. “Because the FTC’s attempt to shed light on Qualcomm’s anticompetitive practices is of great importance to the industry as a whole, several other companies and trade associations also have filed briefs supporting the FTC,” Intel said on its blog. “Intel’s brief, in particular, illuminates the adverse impact that Qualcomm’s conduct is having on competition and innovation, and explains how that conduct violates the antitrust laws in several different ways.” For Intel, it the move might be an attempt to kick one of its biggest competitors while it is down. Intel may have had a tough time trying to capitalize on the mobile market (which Qualcomm dominates), however as the IoT battle warms up, anything which would prove a distraction for competitors certainly works in the favour of Intel. Samsung is different matter. Yes, it does have its own semiconductor business which competes with Qualcomm, but the mobile unit would be considered a major customer of the company. Considering Apple has already decided to sour the relationship between the two, the last thing Qualcomm needs is another customer kicking up a fuss. In its own filing, Samsung has said (courtesy of Bloomberg): “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets.” Essentially, Samsung is claiming its own in-house technology is being held back by Qualcomm because it refuses to license its technology. Samsung is unable to sell the chipsets to any non-Samsung customers currently due to the unwillingness of Qualcomm to co-operate. It would also be worth noting that Qualcomm has not defended its position yet, so take any Samsung claims with a pinch of salt until it has had a chance to voice its own views on the matter.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Sprint Launches C3PO – Open Source NFV/SDN–Based Mobile Core Reference Solution Streamlined, high-performance data plane significantly improves network core performance SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Sprint (NYSE: S) today announced the availability of C3PO (Clean CUPS Core for Packet Optimization – CUPS: Control & User Plane Separation), an open source NFV/SDN-based mobile core reference solution designed to significantly improve performance of the network core by providing a clean, streamlined, high-performance data plane for the packet core. “C3PO revolutionizes the network core and it’s part of our expanded toolbox of solutions to meet the coming wave of data in the years ahead,” said Günther Ottendorfer, Chief Operating Officer – Technology, Sprint. “C3PO is an important part of our NFV and SDN initiative, enabling Sprint to adapt more quickly to market demands and scale new services more efficiently and cost-effectively.” C3PO uses standard high-volume server hardware and streamlines mobile core architecture by collapsing multiple components into as few network nodes as possible. In lab tests conducted on Dell EMC DSS 9000 rack scale infrastructure with compute sleds running dual socket 14 core Intel® Xeon® processors E5-2680 v4, Sprint achieved 1.63 Mpps (million packets per second) throughput. This C3PO configuration demonstrated high efficiency by utilizing as few as seven processor cores – with one packet processing core and six processor cores supporting other tasks such as Control Plane, statistics, load balancer, operating system and other operations, for 500,000 subscribers using a typical Sprint traffic model. A similar C3PO configuration achieved 2.2 Mpps with a similar traffic model for 50,000 subscribers. Sprint and Intel Labs Collaboration The availability of the solution is the result of four years of collaboration between Intel Labs and Sprint on a joint research effort to develop optimal DPDK-based data plane nodes and disaggregated evolved packet core architectures, as well as a platform for further 5G core infrastructure research. “C3PO makes traditional mobility architectures and software designs more streamlined, efficient and scalable,” said Dr. Ron Marquardt, Vice President of Technology at Sprint. “By combining Sprint’s real-world operator knowledge with Intel’s research on optimizing software for standard high-volume servers, we’ve developed a single solution that provides seven functions previously located within separate physical elements.” C3PO addresses bottlenecks in mobile core packet performance by separating and independently scaling the data plane and control plane. The C3PO architecture collapses multiple evolved packet core and SGi LAN elements in a single data plane instance. A serving gateway, packet gateway, deep packet inspection, child protection, carrier grade NAT, static firewall, and service function chaining, or any combination of these functions, can be collapsed into one data plane instance. C3PO is designed to be used by global operators and other third-parties as a reference for commercial applications. Intel Labs technologists built the next generation core control plane and data plane virtualized EPC applications, and Sprint developed the SDN controller enhancements. The EPC application code from Intel is available via the CORD project in ON.Lab, and the SDN plug-ins from Sprint are available via OpenDaylight.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Wins Amazon Echo Show Design It's an Intel Atom inside the Amazon Echo Show. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 15, 2017 at 10:45AM Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced a new member of its Echo product line, known as the Echo Show. The device, unlike previous members of the Amazon Echo family, includes a touch screen and a built-in camera, dramatically boosting the device's capabilities. To support this increased functionality, the Echo Show includes an applications processor, like the ones typically found in smartphones and tablets. Image source: Amazon.com. As it turns out, the supplier of the applications processor of the Amazon Echo Show is a company that, ironically, couldn't succeed in becoming a major smartphone/tablet applications processor supplier: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel Inside the Echo Show The Echo Show includes an Atom x5-Z8350, a chip that's part of Intel's Cherry Trail line of Atom processors originally intended for tablets. According to Intel's product specification page, the x5-Z8350 includes four processor cores, running at a base frequency of 1.44GHz with burst frequency capability of 1.92GHz (likely on a single processor core). It also includes Intel's HD Graphics 400, which means that 12 of the 16 graphics cores built into the chip are enabled. In terms of performance, the Atom x5-Z8350 isn't anything to write home about; a typical mid-range smartphone almost certainly packs more computing and graphics power than this Atom processor. However, given the relatively modest computing demands of the current generation Echo Show, this Atom processor should enable an adequate user experience. Additionally, while the details of the supply agreement between Amazon and Intel are clearly not public, I would imagine that Intel is selling these chips to Amazon quite cheaply given how dated they are. Will Intel power the next Echo Show? If the Echo Show isn't a complete commercial flop, it's reasonable to expect that there will be a next-generation Echo Show. And, of course, that device is going to need an applications processor that's an upgrade from the one inside the current model. What's interesting is that the Atom x5-Z8350 that's inside the current Echo Show is a processor that the company designed specifically for the tablet market. Now, as you might be aware, Intel has substantially cut its investments in smartphone/tablet products and the company hasn't publicly communicated any specific smartphone/tablet chip plans. A device like the Echo Show is probably a good example of an Internet of Things device and Intel has made it quite plain that it intends to continue to invest heavily in its Internet of Things Group (IoTG). With that in mind, I think it's quite possible (even, I daresay, probable) that Intel's IoTG is cooking up chips designed specifically to meet the requirements of future Echo Show devices (as well as requirements for Echo Show-like devices that other companies might want to build). Indeed, if this product category proves successful and annual industrywide unit shipments of such products become substantial, then it could prove to be an interesting business opportunity for Intel (and other chipmakers) over the long term. For now, though, don't get too excited about the potential financial impact that this design win could mean for Intel -- it's not likely to move the needle for Intel.    Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Here's everything we know so far about Intel Core i9, including all the latest price, spec and release date rumours. Intel’s next-generation workstation CPUs will be called Intel Core i9, finally ending the confusion of there being far too many Core i7 chips on the market. There will be four new Intel Core i9 chips, all of which will feature six or more cores, with the top-end i9-7920X apparently getting a whopping 12 cores – the most ever for an Intel desktop part (though Intel’s server-grade Xeon chips go beyond 12 cores). In terms of where Core i9 will sit within Intel's consumer CPU family, it's positioned to take the place of the firm's existing ‘Extreme’ line, which are for high-end rigs used for content creation, including video production and game development. The information comes from a post in the Anandtech forums, where a rather unscrupulous member appears to have taken a photo of an Intel presentation. The cheaper chips, which will have six and eight cores, will rival AMD’s top-end Ryzen processors, featuring higher clock speeds and support for more PCIe lanes – both of which are important for high-end PCs that pack powerful components, like multiple graphics cards and high-speed storage arrays. The most expensive are (on paper, at least) in a class of their own, with the Core i9-7900X getting 10 hyper-threaded (each core can be used as two processing threads) cores, and the top-end i9-7920X gets 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. For context, the current most-expensive Intel Extreme chip is the Core i7-5960X, which costs nearly £1600. Expect the top-end models listed here to cost even more. That top-end chip also enjoy a massive 16.5MB of L3 cache, the ultra high-speed memory which CPU cores have most immediate access to. That's more than double Intel's most powerful current consumer chip, the i7-7700K, which gets 8MB of cache. All the chips will be built to a similar 14nm (nanometre) design similar to the sixth-generation Skylake processors. The key specs for the rumoured new chips are as follows.

It should support up to 44 PCIe lanes, which is a lot, along with 10 USB 3.0 ports and eight SATA connectors. Quad-channel memory will also be supported. We’re expecting Intel to unveil Core i9 at Computex 2017 in Taipei at the end of the month.

It's Come Back Up That Intel Is Reportedly Licensing Radeon Graphics IP Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 15 May 2017 at 11:52 AM EDT. 34 Comments A few months back were the reports that Intel was looking to license Radeon graphics intellectual property for their future processors. That deal is reportedly inked. Our Windows friends at Fudzilla are reporting from their sources that a deal between Intel and AMD has been reached for licensing Radeon graphics IP. AMD nor Intel has made any official announcement yet while Intel's licensing agreement with NVIDIA recently ended. This could be interesting to see if down the road this will lead to more competitive Intel integrated graphics, but it will likely be some time before seeing any Radeon graphics tech found within Intel hardware. This is good news as well for AMD's financial health. Feel free to discuss your thoughts and hopes in the forums. More details as they become available. 34 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Sprint Launches C3PO – Open Source NFV/SDN–Based Mobile Core Reference Solution Streamlined, high-performance data plane significantly improves network core performance SAN JOSE, Calif. (BUSINESS WIRE), May 15, 2017 – Sprint (NYSE: S) today announced the availability of C3PO (Clean CUPS Core for Packet Optimization – CUPS: Control & User Plane Separation), an open source NFV/SDN-based mobile core reference solution designed to significantly improve performance of the network core by providing a clean, streamlined, high-performance data plane for the packet core. “C3PO revolutionizes the network core and it’s part of our expanded toolbox of solutions to meet the coming wave of data in the years ahead,” said Günther Ottendorfer, Chief Operating Officer – Technology, Sprint. “C3PO is an important part of our NFV and SDN initiative, enabling Sprint to adapt more quickly to market demands and scale new services more efficiently and cost-effectively.” C3PO uses standard high-volume server hardware and streamlines mobile core architecture by collapsing multiple components into as few network nodes as possible. In lab tests conducted on Dell EMC DSS 9000 rack scale infrastructure with compute sleds running dual socket 14 core Intel® Xeon® processors E5-2680 v4, Sprint achieved 1.63 Mpps (million packets per second) throughput. This C3PO configuration demonstrated high efficiency by utilizing as few as seven processor cores – with one packet processing core and six processor cores supporting other tasks such as Control Plane, statistics, load balancer, operating system and other operations, for 500,000 subscribers using a typical Sprint traffic model. A similar C3PO configuration achieved 2.2 Mpps with a similar traffic model for 50,000 subscribers. Sprint and Intel Labs Collaboration The availability of the solution is the result of four years of collaboration between Intel Labs and Sprint on a joint research effort to develop optimal DPDK-based data plane nodes and disaggregated evolved packet core architectures, as well as a platform for further 5G core infrastructure research. “C3PO makes traditional mobility architectures and software designs more streamlined, efficient and scalable,” said Dr. Ron Marquardt, Vice President of Technology at Sprint. “By combining Sprint’s real-world operator knowledge with Intel’s research on optimizing software for standard high-volume servers, we’ve developed a single solution that provides seven functions previously located within separate physical elements.” C3PO addresses bottlenecks in mobile core packet performance by separating and independently scaling the data plane and control plane. The C3PO architecture collapses multiple evolved packet core and SGi LAN elements in a single data plane instance. A serving gateway, packet gateway, deep packet inspection, child protection, carrier grade NAT, static firewall, and service function chaining, or any combination of these functions, can be collapsed into one data plane instance. C3PO is designed to be used by global operators and other third-parties as a reference for commercial applications. Intel Labs technologists built the next generation core control plane and data plane virtualized EPC applications, and Sprint developed the SDN controller enhancements. The EPC application code from Intel is available via the CORD project in ON.Lab, and the SDN plug-ins from Sprint are available via OpenDaylight.

The FTC's complaint claims the mobile chip maker has a  'no license, no chips' policy that forces cell phone makers to pay increased royalties, has refused to license standard-essential patents to competitors and prevented Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm's competitors from 2011 to 2016.

Intel claimed it is ready and capable to compete with Qualcomm, but the vendor has "maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits". "These practices have illegally coerced mobile phone manufacturers into purchasing the chipsets they need from Qualcomm and Qualcomm alone," Intel said. "Intel's brief, in particular, illuminates the adverse impact that Qualcomm's conduct is having on competition and innovation and explains how that conduct violates the antitrust laws in several different ways." According to reports, Samsung also filed an amicus brief on Friday saying that "despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets".

Trying Out Intel Optane Memory On Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Storage on 15 May 2017. Page 1 of 2. 26 Comments Here are some of my initial tests of trying out an Intel Optane memory module under Ubuntu Linux with a Kabylake system. At the end of April is when Intel began shipping the long-awaited Optane Memory. Optane makes use of Intel's long talked about 3D XPoint technology. These initial modules come in 16GB and 32GB capacities with the intention of basically using them as a cache for frequently used files to complement a large-capacity hard drive. I wasn't seeded with any review sample of Intel Optane, but back on launch-day I had placed a pre-order for a 32GB Optane module from Amazon... I'm still waiting for them to go in-stock while NewEgg has also been out-of-stock all this time too. Last week I decided to order a 16GB Optane module, which can be found at both Internet retailers, while waiting for the 32GB module to finally arrive. This 16GB Intel Optane Memory is rated for sequential reads up to 900MB/s, sequential writes up to 145MB/s, 190k IOPS for random reads, 35k IOPS for random writes, and an active power use of 3.5 Watts. The read performance is much better than the write for serving as a cache. I hadn't seen any Linux tests of Intel Optane to date, so was very curious how this new class of Intel storage is performing. My initial tests were done with an Intel Core i7 7700K Kabylake box with MSI Z270-A PRO motherboard. First I upgraded the BIOS on this motherboard for adding the Optane memory compatibility and then installed it into the M.2 slot. Optane is only supported by Kabylake (7th Gen) Intel CPUs and newer. With the updated BIOS on this Kabylake motherboard, the Intel 16GB Optane memory worked just fine. When booting up a USB installation of Ubuntu 17.04 x86_64, the Intel Optane 16GB device was detected right away as an NVMe block device.

Zeman   @phonescooper Intel and Samsung support the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust investigation against Qualcomm and have filed amicus briefs to air their own complaints. The FTC hit Qualcomm with legal action in January and suggested that the company's patent licensing practices may violate monopoly regulations. Intel and Samsung, it would seem, agree. "Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years. But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits," said Intel in a blog on its web site. Intel has been unable to crack the smartphone market, which sees more than 1 billion devices ship annually. Samsung, for its part, suggests Qualcomm's unwillingness to play fairly has held back its in-house processor business. "Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets." Qualcomm argued that the FTC's case is weak and should be dismissed. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for June. Apple filed its own lawsuit against Qualcomm shortly after the FTC concerning the chip-maker's "onerous, unreasonable and costly" licensing terms. more info at Wall Street Journal » more info at Bloomberg » Related Comcast Details Mobile Phone Service as Xfinity Mobile Comcast today revealed details of its forthcoming Xfinity Mobile phone service.

Apple Sues Qualcomm Over Royalties, Qualcomm Bites Back Apple has filed a lawsuit against partner Qualcomm, alleging the mobile chipmaker used its monopoly power to push for "onerous, unreasonable and costly" licensing terms. Moreover, Apple says Qualcomm prevented it from seeking chips from other suppliers between 2011 and 2016. Apple Sues Qualcomm In China Apple has filed a fresh lawsuit against Qualcomm, this time in China where it alleges Qualcomm abused its market position to score higher patent-licensing fees.

This came as a bit of a surprise–while Qualcomm and Microsoft have worked together previously, as far back as Windows 8, but most of the devices that shipped with the ill-fated Windows RT used Nvidia hardware, not Qualcomm SoCs. Microsoft wants to put Windows 10 on ARM devices, but it can’t risk a repeat of the strategy that killed Windows RT. The central problem with that approach was that consumers bought a Windows tablet, brought it home, booted it up to a Windows desktop, and discovered they couldn’t actually run Windows applications. This wasn’t exactly a winning plan, and while Microsoft iterated on RT with the Surface 2, it eventually dropped the OS altogether. This time around, Redmond has a plan to avoid this issue, thanks to sophisticated emulation of x86 hardware. Here’s what’s different about things this time around. Instead of requiring developers to create ARM-specific versions of x86 applications from scratch, those applications will be emulated on the platform. When an application is first run, it will be translated from x86 into native ARM64 instructions, and cached both in-memory and on disk for future use. These Compiled Hybrid Portable Execution DLLs (CHPE, pronounced “chippie”) are where the magic happens. These files contain native ARM code and interface with the WOW (Windows on Windows) abstraction layer. The end result is that x86 applications should have native or near-native performance when run on ARM devices. And that’s a huge potential gain for Microsoft going forward. Additional details and demonstrations can be seen in the video above. Microsoft had no real option Of course, there’s another side to this equation. For decades, the so-called Wintel alliance between Microsoft and Intel ensured there was a Windows version available for basically every single x86 CPU Intel developed. That’s no longer the case today–Intel’s decision to leave the smartphone and tablet markets left Microsoft without an x86 partner it could work with to build these products. True, Intel still sells its Atom processors from previous generations, and it has Goldmont-derived hardware for thin-and-light budget systems. But there’s no work going into cutting-edge process nodes in the 3-5W TDPs Microsoft would like to hit. Enter Qualcomm and the Snapdragon 835. For now, that’s the only SoC supported on Windows 10, but that could change in the future, particularly if Samsung continues developing its own custom silicon. Lower-end devices from companies like MediaTek could also be supported. As for whether this poses a threat to Intel, for now, I think it doesn’t. Offering “near native” performance is a great buzzword, but we don’t yet know what the performance hit will be. Furthermore, tablets and smartphone-class processors aren’t really the chips you want to use for a desktop or high-end mobile workstation, no matter how much you like ARM. But we could be seeing the opening of a chink in Intel’s armor. The question is, how will Chipzilla–or potentially AMD, with its new Ryzen architecture–respond to the threat? Neither company has a great solution in-market right now for the tablet market, and bringing up new hardware designs always takes time. Gamers and enthusiasts, who prize every frame, will always buy native for higher-end applications. But the luxury business (and gaming is a luxury business at a certain price point) can’t sustain Intel’s business on its own. Either way, Microsoft is clearly envisioning a future where you buy a Windows device and don’t have to care about whether its ARM or x86. That’s a much smarter move than what we saw with Windows RT, and it could sever the x86 – Windows link for good in the long term.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation's Core X-Series Processors Revealed This chip giant's upcoming gaming-focused chips look like solid improvements over their predecessors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 15, 2017 at 7:45AM Later this month, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to launch a new family of processors that leaked materials referred to as its Core X lineup. "Core X" is surely a reference to the code names of these chips, which are Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X, respectively. These chips will plug into motherboards implementing the X299 platform controller hub -- that's a chip that enables key functionality of a computer, such as USB ports and storage connectivity. They'll make up the company's "high-end desktop" line of products aimed specifically at gamers and other performance-hungry consumers and prosumers. Image source: Intel. A good deal has been known about this product line in general terms, but thanks to a new leak that seems to be making the rounds, we now have information about the different product SKUs that Intel plans to launch, including frequency, cache sizes, and branding. Meet the Core X lineup According to the leak, there will be six members of the Core X family. The six-to-12-core variants will all be rated at a 140-watt thermal design power, while the quad-core chips will be rated at 112 watts. The highest-end chip will be the Core i9-7920X, a 12-core, 24-thread chip with 16.5MB of L3 cache memory and 44 PCI Express lanes. The leak indicates that the frequencies of the chip, base and turbo, are "to be determined." Below that will be a chip called the Core i9-7900X. This part will have 10 cores and 20 threads, run at a base frequency of 3.3GHz, and offer a maximum single-core turbo speed 4.3GHz in Turbo Boost 2.0 mode, with 4.5GHz for Turbo Boost Max 3.0. It will include 13.75MB of L3 cache memory and 44 PCI Express lanes. Taking it down another notch, we get the Core i9-7820K. This part will run at a base frequency of 3.6GHz and offer a maximum single-core turbo speed of 4.3GHz in Turbo Boost 2.0 mode, with 4.5GHz for Turbo Boost Max 3.0. It will have 11MB of L3 cache memory and sport just 28 PCI Express lanes. Moving another level down, we get to the Core i9-7800X, a six-core, 12-thread part running at a base speed of 3.5GHz, with a maximum single-core turbo speed of 4.0GHz in Turbo Boost 2.0 mode and no Turbo Boost Max 3.0 mode available for this product. It will have 8.25 megabytes of L3 cache memory and 28 PCI Express lanes. Then, finally, we have the Kaby Lake-X parts, which appear to be the same as the Kaby Lake-S parts that launched back in January of this year but are designed to work with the X299 platform. These both have four cores. The higher-end Core i7-7740K has two threads per core enabled, while the lower end i7-7640K has just one thread per core enabled. The 7740K runs at a base frequency of 4.3GHz and offers a maximum single-core turbo speed of 4.5GHz, while the 7640K runs at a base frequency of 4GHz and a maximum single-core turbo frequency of 4.2GHz. Both turbo figures are Turbo Boost 2.0, and neither of them has Turbo Boost Max 3.0 functionality. And, finally, these chips both have 16 PCI Express lanes. A much more compelling lineup than before Although the leak doesn't indicate the pricing of these chips, right off the bat it's clear that Intel has made substantial improvements over its prior-generation Broadwell-E parts. In addition to the goodness that a new processor architecture should bring to the table, Intel is apparently being much more aggressive on the out-of-the-box frequencies that it's rating these Skylake-X chips at. The 10-core chip in the Skylake-X lineup, for example, can achieve a maximum turbo boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz. Intel's Broadwell-E based 10-core chip offered a maximum turbo boost 2.0 speed of only 3.5GHZ, which meant the user had to push the chip to higher-than-rated speeds just to match Intel's $350 chips in tasks that couldn't use more than four cores. Intel is also being aggressive with the frequencies of the lower-end parts relative to their Broadwell-E counterparts. One other change that's visible, though, is that with the Broadwell-E lineup, the maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speeds decreased as core count increased. So, for example, the 10-core Broadwell-E offered a maximum single-core boost of 3.5GHz, while the eight-core Broadwell-E came with a maximum single-core boost of 3.7GHz. With the new lineup, the higher-end parts are unequivocally better than the lower-end ones, something that wasn't true before. All told, it looks as if Intel has done a much better job with its Skylake-X line of products than it did with the prior generation of Broadwell-E parts aimed at the same market. It'll be interesting to see if this product stack is compelling enough to drive upsell from Intel's mainstream desktop platform to the high-end desktop platform, and up the stack within the high-end desktop platform.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Previously, as you’re most likely aware, Intel has offered its Core family in increasingly powerful i3, i5 or i7 flavors. Core i9 would, of course, be the logical next step. According to the leak from an Anandtech forum member, the new offerings will comprise of four Skylake-X processors and a pair of Kaby Lake-X CPUs. If this information is correct, the top-of-the-range model will be the Core i9-7920X which will have 12-cores (24-threads) and a TDP of 140W (the spilled details – some of which come from a marketing slide, interestingly enough labelled as ‘high-end gaming’ Core-X processors – didn’t mention the clock speed for this chip). The next CPU down will be the i9-7900X which will sport 10-cores with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz and Turbo up to 4.3GHz (with Turbo 3.0 to 4.5GHz – meaning a single core can be boosted further to this speed, thermals willing). Some impressive clock speeds indeed for a chip with so many cores. Then the 7820X will be an 8-core model (3.6GHz with Turbo to 4.3GHz), and the 7800X is the 6-core variant (3.5GHz/4GHz). All have a TDP of 140W and support quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory. There will also be a pair of Kaby Lake-X models as mentioned, which will be quad-core: the i7-7740K (4.3GHz/4.5GHz) and the i7-7640K (4GHz/4.2GHz), both with a lower TDP of 112W. Cores and effect All these chips should be officially revealed at the end of the month at Computex, and they will be available in June – except for the top-end Core i9-7920X which reportedly won’t emerge until August. Pricing will of course be key here, especially coming after AMD’s launch of Ryzen processors earlier this year, but you’re obviously going to pay a premium for Core i9, particularly the beefier offerings. The latter are likely to be eye-wateringly expensive, as ever with Intel’s very fastest enthusiast-targeted chips. It’ll definitely be interesting to see how these CPUs actually perform, and whether the introduction of the Core i9 tier is truly indicative of a major performance boost. But assuming this leak is on the money with the specs, these could be very potent introductions indeed. Image credit: Sweepr Via: Hot Hardware Intel vs AMD: which chipmaker offers better processors?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Intel Corporation Investors haven’t bought into the chip giant’s transformation, which is great news for those in search of value. Tim Brugger (timbrugger) May 15, 2017 at 8:08AM Despite a second consecutive record-breaking quarter, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- even after increasing guidance for the current period by $500 million and its leading position in the data center market explosion -- hasn't done much for its shareholders. With its stock price down nearly 2% in 2017, Intel clearly hasn't won over industry pundits, which is one reason the best is yet come. Like many out-of-favor tech stocks in today's digitized world, Intel is undergoing an across-the-board transformation away from a reliance on PCs -- though the market remains surprisingly strong -- and become a data center first provider. Reaping the rewards of CEO Brian Krzanich's plans for Intel's future, however, requires patience, which is not something every investor possesses. But for those who do, Intel warrants a good look. Intel cloud data center. Image source: Intel. Change is good In some respects, Intel is a victim of its own success as it relates to the PC market. Long hailed as a "dying market" by pundits, Intel's record-breaking quarterly revenue is seen by some bearish investors as a short-term positive. To those that believe the PC's best days are behind it, Intel's fortunes are inexorably linked. Of Intel's $14.8 billion in revenue to kick off the year, $8 billion was from its client computing group, home of PC-related sales. Thing is, the 6% year-over-year increase in PC revenue was matched by a 6% jump in data center sales to $4.2 billion. Last quarter also included an 11% improvement for another key unit, the Internet of Things (IoT), to $721 million and an impressive 55% gain in its non-volatile memory division to $866 million. Combined, these critical aspects of Intel's transformation make up a larger piece of the revenue pie with each passing quarter. If there was anything bearish about Intel's first quarter, it was the 1% drop in data security revenue to $534 million. With the advent of IoT -- which seems much more than a passing fancy -- and the cloud, the sheer volume of data available today is almost unimaginable, and it still growing. One estimate suggests that data centers will generate over $32 billion in sales in three years. In addition to powering the world's cloud-based data centers, Intel's growing security segment represents a significant opportunity. Even though the security segment accounts for a relatively small part of total revenue, Intel's results there still disappointed and are worth monitoring in the quarters ahead. It's getting crowded Beyond data centers and IoT, Intel also has plans to make a splash in cutting-edge markets including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, drones, and virtual reality (VR). Of course, some of Intel's largest competitors including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also have plans to conquer these same markets. NVIDIA's latest graphic processing units (GPUs), the GeForce 1070 and 1080, are already VR industry standards and they're winning over customers including HP and its new OMEN gaming PC. Self-driving cars are also on NVIDIA's radar, just as they are for Intel. If there were any doubt about Intel's commitment to autonomous cars, its recent $15.3 billion deal for Mobileye should put them to rest. Intel's push into new opportunities are key components of why the best is yet to come, but there are also more immediate reasons. Value investors unite By virtually every valuation method, Intel stock is exceedingly inexpensive relative to its peers. One measurement often used for comparison's sake is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. On a trailing basis, Intel is valued at a touch over 15 times earnings, compared to the industry's 25 times. Looking ahead offers an even better view of Intel's relatively inexpensive stock price. On a forward P/E ratio basis, Intel is trading at a minuscule 12.6 times earnings. There's also the not-so-small matter of its 3% dividend yield to help ease investors' wait as its transformation continues. Record sales, cutting-edge new markets, and extreme value are why the best is yet to come for Intel.   Tim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The brand has been synonymous to superb performance albeit being on the pricier side of things, especially for the high-end desktop range. However, with the recent release of AMD Ryzen, all of this is about to change. More than ever with the upcoming AMD Ryzen 9 that boasts a maximum of 16 cores per die. According to a recent tweet from WikiChip, the upcoming AMD Ryzen 9 platform will have a minimum of 10 cores and goes up until 16-cores per package. The base frequency is set at 3.2GHz while the boost is at 4.0GHz. On top of this, the new line of high-end processors will also support quad channel, instead of dual channel, DDR4 memory with a maximum frequency of 3200MHz. In comparison to the latest Skylake-X HEDT processor from Intel, the i7-7920X only has a maximum of 12 cores per die. This allows for 24 threads executed simultaneously with the Hyper-threading enabled. [Rumor] The core race in the #x86 #HEDT market: #AMD vs #Intel: pic.twitter.com/pzIBizE18E — WikiChip (@WikiChip) May 14, 2017 As for the part numbers for the upcoming HEDT line of processors, the top-tier belongs to the AMD Ryzen 9 1998 and 1998X. The next tier in line with 14 cores include the 1976X, 1977, and 1977X. The 1956 and 1956X will have a maximum of 12 cores per package. And finally, the ten-core SKU will have the 1955 and the 1955X. On release, the AMD Ryzen 9 or otherwise known as Threadripper, will be the most powerful HEDT processor in the market. There are no definite release dates for the processors yet. However, rumour has it that the AMD Ryzen 9 platform may get an unveiling sometime in the second half of 2017. That said, many experts agree that AMD could use the upcoming Computex event in Taiwan to unveil the processor together with the new Naples server platform.

These advances have resulted in the industry’s fastest public cloud network, and new technology for acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that replicate “thinking” in a manner that’s conceptually similar to that of the human brain. The advances offer performance, flexibility and scale, using super low latency networking to leverage the world’s largest cloud investment in FPGAs. The increases in networking speed achieved by this low latency networking will help business, government, healthcare, and universities better process Big Data workloads. Azure’s FPGA-based Accelerated Networking reduces inter-virtual machine latency by up to 10x while freeing the Intel® Xeon® processors for other tasks. Russinovich also outlined a new cloud acceleration framework that Microsoft calls Hardware Microservices. The infrastructure used to deliver this acceleration is built on Intel® FPGAs. This new technology will enable accelerated computing services, such as Deep Neural Networks, to run in the cloud without any software required, resulting in large advances in speed and efficiency. “From our early work accelerating Bing search using FPGAs added to the Intel Xeon processor-based servers, to this new Hardware Microservices model that underlies the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) infrastructure that Mark discussed yesterday afternoon, Microsoft is continuing to invest in novel hardware acceleration infrastructure using Intel® FPGAs,” said Doug Burger, one of Microsoft’s Distinguished Engineers. “Application and server acceleration requires more processing power today to handle large and diverse workloads, as well as a careful blending of low power and high performance—or performance per Watt, which FPGAs are known for,” said Dan McNamara, corporate vice president and general manager, Programmable Solutions Group, Intel. “Whether used to solve an important business problem, or decode a genomics sequence to help cure a disease, this kind of computing in the cloud, enabled by Microsoft with help from Intel FPGAs, provides a large benefit.” See Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich’s presentation.

According to Gartner, total revenues for the segment increased to $343.5 billion over the course of 2016, with Intel taking a 15.7% slice of the market share, and Samsung accounting for 11.7%. The pair grew by 4.6% and 5.9% respectively, but the news was not as positive for Qualcomm, which saw its own revenues decline by 4.1%. This is a worrying sign, but the ongoing dispute with Apple has the potential to cause much more damage in the long-term. “The semiconductor industry rebounded in 2016, with a weak start to the year, characterized by inventory correction, giving way to strengthening demand and an improving pricing environment in the second half,” said James Hines Research Director at Gartner. “Worldwide semiconductor revenue growth was supported by increasing production in many electronic equipment segments, improving NAND flash memory pricing and relatively benign currency movements.” The largest mover in the market was Broadcom, which jumped up 12 places to fifth in the worldwide market share rankings, though this was primarily due to acquisitions. Avago Technologies acquired Broadcom Corp before rebranding to Broadcom Ltd. The new organization saw an increase of 191% year-on-year, now accounting for 3.8% of the global market share. “The combined revenue of the top 25 semiconductor vendors increased by 10.5% during 2016 and accounted for a 74.9% share, outperforming the rest of the market, which saw a 15.6% revenue decline,” said Hines. “However, these results are skewed by the large amount of M&A activity during 2015 and 2016. If we adjust for this M&A activity by adding the revenue of each acquired company to the revenue of the acquirer for both 2015 and 2016 where necessary, then the top 25 vendors would have experienced a 1.9% revenue increase, and the rest of the market would have increased by 4.6%.” While Intel has been facing a tough time in recent years in a search to reinvent itself, not many will complain about 4.6% growth across the year. Its traditional stomping ground will continue to be a cash generator, but a couple of big bets on the autonomous vehicles race could hold some fortunes for the team. It certainly is a sensible bet; the complexities of a self-driving and self-aware car, which is being tasked in making its own decisions in a fraction of a second, the requirements from companies like Intel and Samsung will be high. “Just as you need different clubs to get you through 18 holes of golf, you need different kinds of processors to ‘drive’ an autonomous car,” said Kathy Winter, GM of the Automated Driving Solutions Division at Intel. “Take sensors as an example. Each type of sensor generates a very different kind of data: cameras generate pixels, LIDAR generates point clouds and RADAR generates analogue waveforms. All of these data types need to be processed differently. And if you were developing an autonomous car brain, you would choose very specialized tools perfectly suited to each data type rather than a single gaming processor for all of it.” Tags: Intel, market share, processors, Qualcomm, Samsung, semiconductors Samsung Electronics Leave a comment Cancel reply Connect with: -or- Log in with your Telecoms.com account Alternatively, post a comment by completing the form below: Your email address will not be published.

Now, Intel and Samsung have filed amicus briefs with the court supporting the FTC’s lawsuit and opposing Qualcomm’s request to dismiss the case. Both the companies claim that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in the mobile processor industry to keep other players out. Intel said in a blog post, Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years. But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits. These practices have illegally coerced mobile phone manufacturers into purchasing the chipsets they need from Qualcomm and Qualcomm alone. Meanwhile, Samsung claims its in-house chip unit is artificially held back by Qualcomm’s unwillingness to license its technology, added the report. The FTC trial is scheduled to begin on June 15th.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel said to be launching new ‘Core i9’ Skylake-X and Core i7 Kaby Lake-X in June Intel said to be launching new ‘Core i9’ Skylake-X and Core i7 Kaby Lake-X in June Matthew Wilson 22 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News We have been hearing rumours surrounding Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs from Intel for months now. However, the picture remained unclear and somewhat confusing to follow. Fortunately, some new information has now come to light, indicating that Skylake-X will arrive as a batch of HEDT Core i9 processors later this year, while Kaby Lake-X will carry the Core i7 name. Up to this point, Intel’s Core i7 branding has carried across a broad range of CPUs, blurring the line between mainstream chips like the 6700K and HEDT parts like the 6900K. According to a leak over on the Anandtech forum, this will be changing this year, with the introduction of the Core i9 series. This new lineup will contain Intel’s upcoming Skylake-X CPUs, ranging from the 6C/12T Core i9 7800X up to the 12C/24T Core i9 7820X. For the mainstream, Intel will be launching two new Core i7 CPUs, the Core i7-7740K and the Core i7-7640K Here is a list of each of the rumoured CPUs and the details we have on them so far: Processor Cores/Threads L3 Cache PCIe Lanes Base Clock Turbo Clock 2.0 Turbo Clock 3.0 Launch  Core i9-7920X  12C/24T  16.5MB  44  TBD  TBD TBD August  Core i9-7900X  10C/20T  13.75MB  44  3.3GHz  4.3GHz 4.5GHz June  Core i9-7820X  8C/16T  11MB  28  3.6GHz  4.3GHz 4.5GHz June  Core i9-7800X  6C/12T  8.25MB  28  3.5GHz  4.0GHz N/A June  Core i7-7740K  4C/8T  8MB  16  4.3GHz  4.5GHz N/A June  Core i7-7640K  4C/4T  6MB  16  4.0GHz  4.2GHz N/A June This is a good start to clearing up the confusion surrounding Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X. Though I do think the Kaby Lake-X name is still a tad confusing, given that one of these CPUs is a cut down 7700K, while the other is a slightly improved one. With that in mind, now is as good a time as any to remind everyone that these are still rumours. While this particular leak seems promising, we have no way of verifying its legitimacy. KitGuru Says: This is certainly the most promising leak we have seen so far but so far, the claims are unverified. That said, we don’t have long to wait to get the full story, with Computex kicking off in two weeks time, coupled with Intel’s appearance at E3.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags core i7 Core i9 Intel leak news Skylake-X Previous Report claims Nintendo is bringing The Legend of Zelda to mobile Next Corsair Glaive RGB Mouse Review Check Also Samsung and Intel are backing the FTC’s lawsuit against Qualcomm Earlier this year, the US Federal Trade Commission and Apple both filed lawsuits against Qualcomm, … Rocky40 “Core i7-7640K 4C/4T 6MB 16 4.0GHz 4.2GHz N/A June” Now that’s some funny stuff right there branding a i5 a i7 like wow Intel now I have seen everything. Then again they do the same thing on the mobile make a i3 a i5 or worse a i7 with dual core 2/4 and people think oh look a i7 it’s the best I will buy it. This is really sad & this is what happens when there is very little competition in a market. I would have thought with AMD’s Ryzen being out there now that Intel would stop trying to pull the wool over peoples eye’s. But then again this rushed kaby-lake X stuff seems like a direct response to the Ryzen because Intel knows kaby-lake has enough core mhz speed to do great in games that are out now and is hedging their bets to make sure AMD does not over take them on the 2066 socket in the games. I am not a AMD fanboy I don’t own any AMD CPU’s at all just 4 Graphics cards from them. I do know my next CPU will be AMD once Ryzen 2 comes out as I am tired of these little Intel games they like to play.

A user there has published what is claimed to be a photo of an internal Intel PowerPoint document tabulating the specifications of a quartet of new Skylake-X processors, and a duo of Kaby Lake-X processors. Interestingly the Skylake-X CPUs are said to be the first ever 'Core i9 processors' and there are SKUs with six, eight, 10 and 12 cores - plus Hyperthreading of course. Without further ado, let's tabulate the 'leaked' specifications as provided by the forum user:   Architecture C/T Base Clock Boost Clock L3 Cache PCIe lanes TDP Core i9-7920X Skylake-X 12 / 24 Unknown Unknown 16.5MB 44 140W Core i9-7900X Skylake-X 10 / 20 3.3GHz 4.3GHz (Turbo 2.0) 4.5GHz (Turbo 3.0) 13.75MB 44 140W Core i9-7820X Skylake-X 8 / 16 3.6GHz 4.3GHz (Turbo 2.0) 4.5GHz (Turbo 3.0) 11MB 28 140W Core i9-7800X Skylake-X 6 / 12 3.5GHz 4.0GHz 8.25MB 28 140W Core i7-7740K Kaby Lake-X 4 / 8 4.3GHz 4.5GHz 8MB 16 112W Core i7-7640K Kaby Lake-X 4 / 4 4.0GHz 4.2GHz 6MB 16 112W   To the above unconfirmed info there are some things to add. The source says that all the Core i9 chips feature Hyperthreading, and 1MB of dedicated L2 cache, noted to be "4x as much as Core i7-7700K". L3 cache amounts are tabulated above. Interestingly the lowest end Kaby Lake-X processor doesn't seem to support Hyperthreading. Another difference between the processor ranges is that Kaby Lake-X supports Dual DDR4-2666 but Skylake-X supports Quad DDR4-2666. If the PowerPoint presentation is genuine we should expect some kind of launch event in June 2017, as you can read in the heading of the photo. The source indeed asserts that all the tabulated processors will be launched in June, except the top end 12c/24T Core i9-7920X which arrives in August. These "high end gaming" processors look just the ticket for Intel to square off against AMD's recently launched high core/thread count Ryzen 7 chips. Of course AMD isn't sitting still and will be outlining its own HEDT processors shortly. AMD has confirmed that it is holding a press conference at Computex on 31st May. Intel's close rival hinted heavily at HEDT Ryzen processor launches. Lastly please remember to add a hearty dose of salt to the above information from unconfirmed sources.

This is Intel's high end platform, I woldn't pay that premium for 16 PCIe lanes, and a CPU with 4 cores 4 threads and only dual channel RAM. It's only the top two CPUs that look interesting and going by intel's recent pricing strategies they'll weigh in around the £800-1k+ mark, nevermind the likely Mobo cost. Posted by silent - Mon 15 May 2017 10:18 its not april again is it? i dread to think of the price! Posted by GinoLatino - Mon 15 May 2017 10:49 TDP is too high… I will stick to Ryzen. Posted by LSG501 - Mon 15 May 2017 10:57 So intel are basically a rebranding the current 2011-3 i7's class cpus to i9 when they get refreshed with skylake. Not exactly a bad thing to stop the potential confusion. While I like the idea of the 12/24 thread chip I can't see that being cheap, I'd guess that's going to be £2000 or even more when it's released. While my personal direction would likely be multiple ryzen machines I now need to consider the software I use as it's currently going through changes to the way they charge users (extra licensing needed for network rendering etc) so one machine with more cores could potentially be cheaper overall for me….. now where's rizens desktop competitor to that 12/24 :) Posted by kompukare - Mon 15 May 2017 12:01 ik9000 It's only the top two CPUs that look interesting and going by intel's recent pricing strategies they'll weigh in around the £800-1k+ mark, nevermind the likely Mobo cost. LSG501 While I like the idea of the 12/24 thread chip I can't see that being cheap, I'd guess that's going to be £2000 or even more when it's released. Well, the current Broadwell-E 6950X is $1,700. That's the 10C/20T and the current top HEDT chip but the previous top HEDT chip was the Haswell-E i7-5960X which was only $999 like most previous Intel ‘Extreme’ processors. Now before Ryzen, Intel might have been tempted to add another price category above that for the 12C/24T but now I would expect a max of $1,700.

Go to Israel and chances are you'll install some new apps on your phone, just to keep up. A few years ago that might have been the navigation and transportation ones Waze and Moovit. More recently it may well have been photo editors Facetune and Enlight. All Israeli developed, all global successes and just a tip, albeit a visible one, of the country's high-tech iceberg. High-tech is usurping the place once held by Israel's founding myths, the ones about the kibbutz collectives and making the desert bloom. Nowadays it's all "Start-up Nation" and "Silicon Wadi". In fact, some say high-tech is even replacing the archetypal Jewish mothers' wish for their child to be a doctor or a lawyer; today's Israeli moms supposedly brag about the number of employees in their kids' start-up. Inevitably such success is shot through with hyperbole but it rests on very solid and tangible numbers. $15.3 billion is one of them, representing the biggest high-tech business deal in Israel's history and the sum that Intel paid in March for autonomous driving firm Mobileye. And instead of packing up the company and moving it to the U.S., Intel is establishing it as its global autonomous driving hub and R&D (research and development) center. There are over 300 international firms with a high-tech research center in the country, including giants such as Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Cisco, HP and older Intel centers, to name but a few. "Over the last couple of weeks, since the Intel-Mobileye transaction, all hell has broken loose," says Jon Medved, CEO of OurCrowd, an Israel-based crowdsourcing platform for accredited investors. show chapters Why Israel is a cybersecurity heavyweight    Thursday, 11 May 2017 | 10:44 PM ET | 03:08 "The country is being overrun in a positive way by investors, corporations, strategic partners, all sorts, who simply want to get a piece of this." The importance of the deal is also emphasized by Eugene Kandal, CEO of the NGO ( non-governmental organization) Start-up Nation Central, which seeks to connect start-ups to investors and supports the Israeli high-tech industry. He headed Israel's National Economic Council until 2015 and was as such a close advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "The message to investors not yet investing is: It's no longer unicorns, it's really big guys," he says. While those seeking investors in the high-tech industry can be expected to sound upbeat, the message is being repeated by others: The Mobileye deal is big and can be a game changer in terms of making more international companies and investors aware of the potential of Israeli businesses, not just start-ups, where much of the action had often been in the past. 'Israel on the big players' map' Koby Simana CEO of IVC Research Center, a Tel Aviv-based firm monitoring and analyzing Israel's high-tech industry, says the deal drew international attention. "I think those kind of deals from several hundreds of millions to billions of dollars being spent on one company, that's a big quantum leap for the industry. That puts Israel on the big players' map." Source: Mobileye He counts among these mega-deals the $4.4 billion sale of online gaming company Playtika in 2016 to China's Shanghai Giant Network Technology Co. Playtika is based in Herzliya, Israel, but was owned by U.S. casino and gaming giant Ceasars. This illustrates some of the difficulties in quantifying the number of deals and the amounts involved in Israel's high-tech field. PwC Israel, for example, in its 2016 report on Israeli high-tech industry exits, left out the Playtika deal, noting its ownership by Ceasars. That's how the accountancy firm concluded that in 2016 the value of deals in the industry dropped 51 percent compared to 2015, to $3.4 billion. PwC's estimate that this was just a temporary slowdown now seems vindicated by the Mobileye deal. Other big deals since the beginning of the decade include the 2012 acquisition of Waze by Google for over $1 billion, the 2013 sale of security software firm Trusteer to IBM, for $1 billion, and Cisco's 2013 takeover of cell phone software firm Intucell for $475 million. show chapters Israel's largest gas field    Thursday, 13 Apr 2017 | 1:20 AM ET | 01:38 The Mobileye deal is certainly big, for Israel. The company does account for some 60-70 percent of the world's autonomous driving and collision avoiding systems but Intel's acquisition is dwarfed by Qualcomm's announcement last year that it is buying Dutch automotive chipmaker NXP for $47 billion. Bumper year for venture capital In terms of venture capital flowing into the industry, Israel had a bumper year in 2016, raising $4.8 billion in funds, up 11 percent from 2015, according to an IVC-ZAG report. But the same firms note a slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 to $1.03 billion. That's 4 percent down, or what IVC's Simana calls, "a minor drop". What concerns the IVC CEO more is the change in the balance of investments, from early stage to late stage, a phenomenon that is also apparent elsewhere, notably in Silicon Valley. The difference is, says Simana, that in the U.S. the volume of investments is decreasing while in Israel it's still increasing. Even so, attracting early stage investment remains important to keep feeding the pipeline of start-ups. "We call for early stage investors and tell them right now there are opportunities. There's less competition. More risk but less competition," says Simana. "If they want to be in the competitive landscape going forward, they should be in the early stage." The type of investors interested in Israeli high-tech is shifting from North America to Asia, as the Playtika acquisition shows. Chinese investors have discovered the country and PwC in its report also notes that they, "are growing increasingly comfortable with doing deals in Israel." Medved and Simana too notice growing interest from Asia but Simana qualifies this: "Definitely at the moment U.S. and European investors are the dominant ones in the industry." U.S. interest in Israeli high-tech is long-established and Israeli companies have the third biggest presence on the NASDAQ, after the U.S. itself and China. In the past there has been a perception that many North Americans who invest in Israel do so to support the country. But, says Medved, that's only part of the story: "There's plenty of them but it's way beyond that now. It's just good business. I don't think people are investing emotionally or with their political or religious believes as the driver." When it comes to what particular high-tech field to invest in, there's a lot to choose from. According to Kandal of Start-up Nation Central, it's exactly the ability to work across different technologies that makes Israel so competitive. "There are a lot of different sectors. You can be in cybersecurity and digital health. You can be in cars and software. You have enough density for all of those to give you a buzz." show chapters Israel faces up to 2 million cyberattacks each day    Monday, 20 Feb 2017 | 7:06 PM ET | 01:59 That's a point that Simana also underwrites: "The big names out of Israel are multi-disciplinary. Take for instance Mobileye, Gett (an Uber rival) or other big names that came out of Israel in recent years. I think the way Israeli entrepreneurs are combining various technologies into one product, one offering is our competitive edge." Israel's security needs, its lack of water, arable land and its small population, just over 8 million, have all played a role in the development of its high-tech industry. It's long been renowned for its water and agriculture technology, its drone and aerospace industry and its use of solar power. More recent successes include cybersecurity, medical technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and of course transport fields such as navigation and autonomous driving. Medved, the OurCrowd CEO, says that Israel is especially appreciated for its "deep technology" knowhow. He says investors are attracted because of, "the change in the venture market into frontier technology where the deep tech is now back in fashion, whether it's machine learning, or cybersecurity or drones. Things that need deep technology, that's what makes Israel interesting. We are not leaders in the other stuff but we're leaders in deep technology." Many of these advances come out of the country's, U.S.-supported and part-financed, military and intelligence establishments and its defense industry. Some military intelligence units, such as Unit 8200, are veritable incubators for the country's high-tech industry, spewing out veterans that are bursting to begin start-ups. And the defense aerospace industry has made the country a leader in drones. But there are also world-class institutes and universities, such as Haifa's Technion and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. Israel's R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP (gross domestic product) regularly tussles with South Korea's for the global top spot. Risks to the industry Even the risks to the industry that Israel's high-tech observers mention, can be seen as humble brags. Chief among them is the danger of a shortage of skilled workers, coupled with a decline in the number of pupils choosing science trajectories in high school. It is a real concern and calls have been issued to ease visa requirements for high-tech workers from India and other Asian countries, always a concern in Israel, where demography is a sensitive subject. Yet, the shortage also sends the message that demand for high-tech workers in Israel is booming. Kandal says that in 2016 there were 1,100 new high-tech start-ups in Israel while 400 disappeared. "It's an indication that people are not afraid to begin new things. If they fail, they just start a new one or go to work at another company that's always looking for people." IVC's Simana says he has studied the failure rate of start-ups in Israel. "It's one-in-twenty that has a real success. I don't know the numbers but I suspect that's very similar to elsewhere in the world." It's a sobering reminder that any investment carries risk, particularly in start-ups, however dynamic and attractive the industry. "We're not prophets here," says Simana. Maybe the most obvious cautionary tale is the one of electric car battery venture Better Place. Its story and that of its founder Shai Agassi were used in the intro to the landmark 2009 book "Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle" by Dan Senor and Saul Singer. Even though it was pushed by Israel's late President Shimon Peres and supported by Nissan's Carlos Ghosn, Better Place went bankrupt in 2013, swallowing up some $850 million of private capital. It hardly slowed down Israel's high-tech industry, which the same year celebrated Google's $1 billion-plus acquisition of Waze, but it may have reminded companies and investors that a good idea and lots of "chutzpah" are not necessarily enough to make it in the marketplace.

Auckland Region, North Island, New Zealand (Photo: Stoneography / Getty Images) 18 CONNECTTWEET 8 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Santa Clara — Three major computer-chip manufacturers are moving into new territory by investing heavily to become the indispensable drivers of the driverless-car game. Intel is best known for cranking up the speed of laptop and desktop computers. Nvidia supercharged graphics for video games. Qualcomm helped make smartphones truly smart. Today, all are vying to become major players as the auto and tech industries work to bring autonomous vehicles to the masses. Santa Clara-based Nvidia took center stage last week in announcing a partnership with Toyota that puts its artificial intelligence hardware and software behind the automaker’s autonomous-car efforts. A week earlier, Intel unveiled its Innovation Center in San Jose and showcased its partnership with Delphi to create a turnkey driverless system that can be integrated into vehicle designs by any manufacturer. And later this year, San Diego-based Qualcomm could win approval of its $47 billion bid to acquire semiconductor maker NXP — one of the top suppliers to the auto industry. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm are no longer companies willing to simply see their chips used by others. They are neck-deep in the game and calling many of the shots. “Right now, there really is a rush among silicon manufacturers ... to try and have the chip set that is, in some way, the core of the future automated vehicle,” said Chris Gerdes, who runs Stanford University’s Dynamic Design Lab. The quest is all the more important in that many of the chipmakers face declines in their traditional revenue sources. At Qualcomm, which has been hurt by losses in cellphone sales, the hope is to be the chip provider to “cover all domains” of the driverless car. “Everybody in the chip business has an automotive strategy now,” said Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at tech-consulting firm Tirias Research. “They all see the increased amount of chips and silicon going into the automotive sector as one of the big growth-markets right now.” But Krewell said it’s unlikely any one chip can dominate, despite the massive investments companies are making. “The auto industry is just too big and too diverse,” he said. Nvidia Nvidia is best known in the videogaming community. After nearly a quarter-century in business, its graphics-processing units have evolved to crank out visuals that are more and more lifelike. The demands of the videogame market may have set the company on an advantageous path as it moves full-force into driverless vehicles. Nvidia specializes in graphics processors, not the central processing units backed by Intel and Qualcomm. Tim Wong, a member of the company’s technical marketing, said the fundamental difference that gives Nvidia its edge is that traditional central processors have only four to eight cores, or processing units. “Whereas, you have thousands of cores in an Nvidia GPU,” he said. Much of the excitement around driverless cars centers on artificial intelligence, or teaching machines to learn. For autonomous vehicles, that means coaching a system to recognize objects and situations, and then respond accordingly. Nvidia officials contend this is similar to what its graphic processors have been doing all along in the gaming industry. That work has already paid off in the form of high-visibility partnerships with Tesla Inc. and Volvo Cars Ltd., and last week, its announcement of the tie-up with Toyota. Nvidia officials said they see plenty more action on the horizon. “Artificial intelligence is keyed to be the next big thing in terms of the same kind of impact that the Industrial Revolution had,” said Nvidia’s Sean Wix, another member of Nvidia’s technical marketing team. “It will leave no market undisturbed, really.” Qualcomm When wireless communications exploded in the 1990s and early 2000s, Qualcomm mastered technology that allowed multiple signals to share band space. It put the company and its chip sets into all kinds of telecommunication technologies. That included the smartphone arena, where the company’s Snapdragon mobile processing chips boosted the company’s profile and portfolio. But waning demand for smartphones has Qualcomm looking for new areas of expansion. Qualcomm is not new to the auto industry, having worked with General Motors on OnStar applications as early as 2002. The company’s wireless technologies have led to partnerships with “pretty much every automaker on the planet,” says Nakal Duggal, Qualcomm’s vice president of product management. Snapdragon processors made their way into the automotive field in 2014. The company has made a series of acquisitions touching on wireless capabilities in the auto industry, including the $3 billion purchase of wireless networking company Atheros in 2011. Qualcomm’s ability to push even further into the driverless-vehicle race will be boosted exponentially if the company’s bid for NXP is finalized by the end of the year, as company officials expect. Roughly 40 percent of NXP’s semiconductor sales are linked to the auto industry, where they are used for everything from vehicle connectivity, to audio systems and regulating engine functions. Intel Like Qualcomm, Intel’s foray into driverless cars stems in part from the search to supplement its declining traditional markets — in this case, laptop and desktop computers. Intel may have the most clearly defined game plan — at least publicly — of the three U.S.-based chipmakers. Intel and partners like Delphi Automotive PLC, BMW AG and Ericsson AB are putting together what they describe as a turnkey driverless car system that can also help capitalize on Big Data — the information that connected vehicles can collect, sort, package and send to the “cloud.” That information can eventually be sold to a variety of customers in a business that could be worth $750 billion by 2030. Intel’s decades of experience and its comprehensive approach to driverless and connected cars are what separate it from competitors, say company officials. “Obviously, Qualcomm is focused on wireless connectivity — the wireless space — and they have other general computing (capabilities),” said Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Group. “Nvidia provides their GPU — a specialized computing element that can do things like sensor fusion and workload acceleration.” He says his company tries looking at solutions more broadly: “We engineer our technologies to make sure they deliver all of the capabilities that are necessary for the automotive industry today.” jlynch@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2034 18 CONNECTTWEET 8 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2rfZBvg TOP VIDEOS QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47 Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

Itanium co-creator HP and its enterprise arm HPE will be the last major customer of Itanium processors, with its Integrity i6 servers to receive the improved hardware, but other than that - Itanium is dead.   Itanium launched with a huge marketing campaign where Intel expected its exciting (at least at the time) 64-bit processor to take a huge chunk out of the massive wave of x86, aiming for high-end servers and workstations before cloud computing was even a thing. The first Itanium processors were power hungry, and then AMD decided it would launch consumer 64-bit processors in x86 form, disrupting Intel's plans.     Fast forward to 2017, and AMD is once again disrupting Intel's slowly moving and now tick-tock-less CPU plans with Ryzen, offering 8C/16T of processing power to consumers for under half of what Intel tries to shake you down for. This is why we're hearing so damn much about new processors with monstrous core counts, from both sides of the CPU business - AMD with their upcoming Naples platform, Starship rocking 48C/96T, and even a new 16C/32T consumer/prosumer Ryzen processor.   Intel isn't running away from the battle, with its own Core i9 processor rumored for launch in August led by the flagship Core i9-7920K with 12C/24T of power.

Longtime rival AMD is hard at work on a new line of CPUs that’ll bring its Zen architecture to the high-end desktop market and thanks to a new leak, we’ve got the skinny on the entire Ryzen 9 “Threadripper” lineup. Starting at the bottom and working our way up, we have the Ryzen 9 1955 and 1955X. These are 10-core (20-thread) chips with base / boost clocks of 3.1GHz / 3.7GHz and 3.6GHz / 4.0GHz, respectively, with TDPs of 125W. Climbing one step up the ladder, you’ll find the Ryzen 9 1956 and 1956X. These 12-core (24-thread) processors offer respective base / boost clocks of 3.0GHz / 3.7GHz and 3.2GHz / 3.8GHz with the same 125 watt power ratings. Name Cores/ Threads Base clock/ Boost (GHz) PCIe Lanes Memory TDP 1998X 16/32 3.5 / 3.9 44 Quad Channel DDR4 155W 1998 16/32 3.2 / 3.6 44 Quad Channel DDR4 155W 1977X 14/28 3.5 / 4.0 44 Quad Channel DDR4 140W 1977 14/28 3.2 / 3.7 44 Quad Channel DDR4 140W 1976X 14/28 3.6 / 4.1 44 Quad Channel DDR4 140W 1956X 12/24 3.2 / 3.8 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W 1956 12/24 3.0 / 3.7 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W 1955X 10/20 3.6 / 4.0 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W 1955 10/20 3.1 / 3.7 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W One step further forward is the 1976X, the 1977 and the 1977X. This tier offers 14 cores with 28 threads and base / boost clock speeds of 3.6GHz / 4.1GHz, 3.2GHz / 3.7GHz and 3.5GHz / 4.0GHz, respectively. The 1976X and 1977 carry TDPs of 140W while the 1977X is slightly higher at 155W. The crowning jewel of AMD’s upcoming enthusiast lineup is the Ryzen 9 1998 and 1998X, 16-core (32-thread) monsters with a base / boost clock of 3.2GHz / 3.6GHz and 3.5GHz / 3.9GHz, respectively. Both of these chips have 155W TDPs, as you might have guessed. All chips support quad-channel DDR4 and offer up 44 PCIe lanes. They’ll fit into a modified version of the SP3 socket (originally designed for AMD’s 32-core Naples server parts) called the SP3r2. The new platform is codenamed Whitehaven.

A typical data center setup. (Courtesy: Wikipedia) Nutanix plans to release a line of server appliances with IBM’s Power processor for artificial-intelligence applications, the first time it has shipped one of its data center bundles with anything but Intel inside. Nutanix sells a package of hardware and software to companies looking to manage their own data centers, and Fortune reports that it has decided for the first time to include appliances based on Power as part of those packages. IBM has been pushing Power as uniquely suited for AI or machine learning applications, given that it runs its Watson service on the chips. Nvidia is probably the first chipmaker AI researchers think of when building a new system. The graphics company has adapted nicely to the growing demand for powerful chips to train AI: GPUs (graphical processing units) excel at processing a relatively simple task over and over again, which is ideal for training AI systems, and IBM is actually using some of Nvidia’s chips inside its own public cloud service. Still, this is very new territory, and there’s lots of time for other companies to find a niche. Intel acquired Nervana last summer to address this area, and IBM is hoping its Watson experience will move a few Power chips. There could also be some more movement later this year on the idea of Power in cloud data centers, where Intel dominates. The Register noted Monday that Nutanix has invited Google Cloud Platform boss Diane Greene to speak at its yearly conference this summer. Google is the most prominent supporter of the OpenPower movement (which also includes Nvidia), and confirmed last year that it is running some of its public cloud infrastructure on IBM’s chips. This could mean (as The Register speculated) that Google is striking a hybrid cloud partnership with Nutanix, with Power processors playing some role in the package. You had to expect that the public cloud providers would do something to try and keep Intel on its toes in this market. It was long believed that Amazon Web Services and others would focus on designing their own chips around the ARM instruction set, which Microsoft has discussed in some detail, but Power processors are available now and backed by a rather large company.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement AMD Ryzen 9 chip details leaked 05/15/2017 at 12:04 PM by Brad Linder 11 Comments Intel may not be the only company preparing to launch a line of high-performance processors with the number 9 in the name (to indicate that they’re better than chips with the number 7 in the name). AMD is rumored to be working on high-power Ryzen 9 desktop chips with up to 16 CPU cores. The processors would join the company’s recently launched Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 chips for premium and mainstream desktops, and the upcoming Ryzen 3 processors for entry-level systems. If the latest leaks are accurate, AMD’s Ryzen 9 1998X will be the company’s new top-of-the-line desktop processor. It’s a 16-core CPU with support for hyperthreading for up to 32 simultaneous processor threads. Each CPU core has a base clock speed of 3.5 GHz and boost speeds of up to 3.9 GHz, and like other Ryzen processors, the new chip should be unlocked, which means enthusiasts can try to overclock the processor for higher performance. Don’t expect this chip to show up in notebooks anytime soon: it’s a 155 watt processor. Other members of the upcoming Ryzen 9 family are said to include 125 watt 10-core and 12-core chips, and 140 watt processors with 14 CPU cores. For more analysis on how AMD’s upcoming chips compare to Intel’s rumored Core i9 Skylake processors, at least on paper, check out wccftech. via TechPowerUp Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 11 Comments on "AMD Ryzen 9 chip details leaked" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member jakky567 Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I like the idea of increasing CPU cores as a path for the future, in theory. But until things change so that basically any program can properly take advantage of parallel processing, these kinds of chips will remain niche.

For example, many of us live in Notepad++ or a browser. I see I have 3 Firefox.exe processes running right now, and 120 tabs open. And I often run other processes, such as Windows Media Center, at the same time. So a multi-core processor might be a good choice for me and others, even if apps I don’t use, or use only occasionally, cannot take advantage of available cores.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. I would find it difficult to recommend anything less than a quad-core these days for general computing. I think you’ve hit the nail on the head, and any sort of future-proofing will require more cores. Programmers have been generally slow to adopt multithreaded approaches, but multitasking is growing as schedulers get better and better at balancing loads. Yeah, you probably won’t see 10+ cores in regular consumer devices too soon (my enthusiast-y, “prosumer” build only has 6 cores), but I would love to get my VMs on something like this.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Well, the Ryzen 9 is targeted at the HEDT segment, which has always been a niche market. AMD is definitely not trying to bring 16-core CPUs to the mainstream (at least not yet ;)). As for app support, Intel’s pricing strategy has so far limited 6, 8 and 10-core processors to deep-pocketed enthusiasts and prosumers, meaning there was little incentive for app and game developers to optimize for more cores. This will only change if more multi-core processors come to the mainstream, which is what AMD is doing with the Ryzen 5 and 7 series.

I’d like to see (and purchase) a 155+ watt APU with enough GPU performance to do VR and with a 4 core low power Ryzen architecture – all combined with HBM so as to save $$$ buying actual memory and also to get that sweet small form factor.

Good battery life. Faultless security and manageability. Cons Gets pricey with options. Slightly dim display. Thunderbolt 3 not standard. Bottom Line Dell's highly configurable Latitude 5480 is a strong rival to its 14-inch business laptop competition, though our near-$2,000 test unit was too much machine for mere spreadsheets and reports. By Eric Grevstad What do you call the middle model in a mainstream line? The sweet spot's sweet spot, perhaps. Dell's Latitude 3000, 5000, and 7000 series target modest, middling, and major budgets respectively. That makes the 14-inch Latitude 5000 (5480) (starts at $769; $1,947 as tested) as mainstream as it gets. We recommend it for fleet deployment in your enterprise, plus distribution to specialized workers who'll appreciate its available near-workstation levels of performance. On the minus side, our test unit was optioned so heavily it wound up priced above the 14-inch flagship Dell Latitude 7000 (7480), and its screen, keyboard, and weight keep it from unseating our current top pick for business laptops, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. //Compare Similar Products Compare Dell Precision 15 5000 Series (5510)   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Chromebook 13 G1   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad 13   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad X260   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Getac S410   %displayPrice%%seller% HP EliteBook Folio G1 (1080p HD)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14 for Work   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Latitude 13 3000 Series 2-in-1 (3379)   %displayPrice%%seller% Room for Customization The base model Core i3 configuration of the Latitude 5480 comes with 4GB of memory, a 500GB hard disk, and a 1,366-by-768 screen. Our test unit was closer to the top—and frankly overpowered for productivity work— with an Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB solid-state drive, and a 1,920-by-1,080 non-touch display. Options are plentiful, ranging from dedicated graphics and a touch screen to Thunderbolt 3 and WiGig support. Whichever configuration of the 5480 you end up with, your IT department will be delighted with Dell's manageability and security features, from TPM and vPro support to our system's three ID authentication choices (a SmartCard reader, fingerprint reader, and Windows Hello face-recognition webcam for securely logging into Windows 10). Basic Business Black At 0.88 by 13.1 by 9 inches (HWD), the Latitude is a bit thicker but has a slightly smaller footprint than the HP EliteBook 1040 G3 (0.65 by 13.3 by 9.2 inches) and a slightly larger one than the Lenovo ThinkPad T460s (0.74 by 13 by 8.9). At 3.6 pounds, it weighs about as much as the HP and a half-pound more than the T460s. (The Carbon weighs less than 2.5 pounds.) Nevertheless, it's no burden in a briefcase, nor to carry uncased—the lid and palm rest have a pleasant-feeling nonskid coating. The chassis is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. You may balk at a near-$2,000 laptop made of plastic instead of metal, but the Latitude feels solid, with virtually no flex in the display and only a little in the middle of the keyboard deck (we had to hammer the G and H keys to feel the bend). You'll be pleased with the unit's road-ready reliability (it's passed a slew of military standard tests for things like shock, vibration, and extreme temperatures). View All 7 Photos in Gallery The bezels surrounding the screen aren't fashionably thin, but they permit a proper placement of the webcam above rather than below the display. The chiclet-style keyboard features an embedded pointing stick (its blue ring is a nice accent in the sea of black) as well as a touchpad, with three and two buttons respectively. The power button and fingerprint reader are to the right of the keyboard, which features dedicated Page Up and Page Down keys (Home and End, alas, are function-key combinations with the left and right cursor arrows) and a bright backlight. The soft, silent keyboard encourages high-speed typing, but feels a bit mushy compared to its competitors. Both pointing devices work smoothly, though we prefer the touchpad and its big, crisp buttons to the slow stick. Ports are plentiful. On the left side, you'll find a USB 3.0 port, an SD card slot, a SmartCard reader, and a DisplayPort video output with USB-C connector. The last worked fine with our USB-C flash drive, but does not function as a Thunderbolt 3 port unless you spring for an option package including Nvidia GeForce 930MX discrete graphics replacing the Intel HD 630 integrated graphics. Considering the 5480's price, we would like Thunderbolt 3 to be standard. The right edge of the system holds another USB 3.0 port, an audio jack, a VGA port, and a Noble lock slot that will probably frustrate your IT department and its collection of Kensington lock cables. Finally, along the rear are a third USB 3.0 port, an Ethernet jack, an HDMI port, and a door covering the tray for the optional mobile broadband SIM card. There's also an NFC hotspot in the palm rest and 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 for wireless connections. The Full HD display offers good colors and contrast, as well as an anti-glare coating that reduces reflections. Details are crisp, with enough resolution to indulge in some photo editing and 1080p video viewing as well as fine-tuning presentations and spreadsheet charts, though we wish the screen (rated at 220 nits) had more brightness—it was perfectly legible at its top couple of backlight settings, but we longed for a couple more. PowerPoint presenters and Candy Crush Soda Saga players will find the Latitude's bottom-mounted speakers can easily fill a room, though sound lacks booming bass and grows distorted as you crank it past 75 percent volume. Our test unit carried an impressive warranty with three years of on-site service after remote diagnostics, compared to the one year of many rivals. The Thrill of Overkill If the Latitude's cooling fan frequently made itself heard during our everyday use and benchmark testing, that's because it has some heavy-duty hardware to cool: The processor is Intel's seventh-generation Core i7-7820HQ, a 2.9GHz (3.9GHz turbo) quad-core with Hyper-Threading that tops even the Core i7-7700HQ found in many gaming laptops. It's teamed with 16GB of DDR4 memory and a 512GB Micron SSD (with SATA interface; a PCI Express/NVMe solid-state drive is another option for performance zealots). Our test unit's PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity score of 3,586 topped those of comparable 14-inch notebooks, ranging from the Core i7 Latitude 7480 (3,369) to the Core i5 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (3,240). The new ThinkPad T470s (the "Kaby Lake" successor to the slimline T460s) scored 3,255. All these laptops, however, scored highly enough to indicate no trouble with the likes of Word and Excel. The quad-core Latitude 5480 predictably pulverized its dual-core competition in the CPU-intensive Cinebench scene rendering (score 737) and Handbrake video transcoding (time 1:01) tests. The system sprinted through our Adobe Photoshop image editing scenario in 2 minutes and 58 seconds, though all of its rivals except the HP EliteBook 1040 G3 were within a minute of that time. You likely won't use this or any business laptop for gaming, though it did reach the 30 frames per second threshold for smooth gameplay in our Valley test at medium resolution and image-quality settings—a performance near the top of the business-centric, integrated-graphics segment. We wouldn't bother ordering a Latitude with optional dedicated graphics in hopes of gonzo gaming, either; the GeForce 930MX is too far down Nvidia's parts list to challenge today's 1000-series GPUs. Lasting 10 hours in our battery-rundown test, the 5480 should easily get you through a full workday or transcontinental flight, though you can't replace the battery or swap in a spare. Other notebooks in our test group showed even more stamina, however, led by the Carbon's remarkable 16 hours. Racehorse or Workhorse, It's Up to You We may be overemphasizing the Latitude 5480's sticker shock: A nice dual-core model with, say, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD will satisfy most needs for under $1,500, and even companies that crave our unit's mighty power will amortize its cost over several years. The 14-inch competition is formidable, though, especially from Lenovo's T460s/T470s and our Editors' Choice X1 Carbon with their lighter weight and divine keyboards, but IT managers seeking top levels of both manageability and customizability will find the 5480 one of their best bets. We wouldn't wish a 1,366-by-768 screen on any business laptop user nowadays, but the freedom to choose anything from a Core i3 to our test unit's beefy Core i7-7820HQ? That counts for a lot with us.

News & Analysis Consolidation Continues to Rewrite Chip Vendor Rankings Dylan McGrath 5/15/2017 02:21 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO—The largest chip vendors buoyed the semiconductor industry's growth rate even more than usual in 2016 as an unprecedented wave of consolidation continued to roil the rankings of the top 25 firms, according to an analysis of sales data by market research firm Gartner Inc. Gartner (Stamford, Conn.) concluded that global semiconductor sales reached $343.5 billion last year, an increase of 2.6 percent compared to 2015. The growth rate is higher than that estimated by other market watchers previously, including the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, which said in February that industry sales grew by 1.1 percent. The top 25 vendors, however, grew sales by a combined 10.5 percent in 2016, according to Gartner, and accounted for nearly 75 percent of total market share. By contrast, the rest of the semiconductor vendors in the market saw their sales declined by 15.6 percent, Gartner said. According to James Hines, a research director at Gartner, the relative growth of the top 25 vendors compared to the rest of the market is skewed by the high degree of merger and acquisition activity that took place in 2015 and 2016. "If we adjust for this M&A activity by adding the revenue of each acquired company to the revenue of the acquirer for both 2015 and 2016 where necessary, then the top 25 vendors would have experienced a 1.9 percent revenue increase, and the rest of the market would have increased by 4.6 percent," Hines said, in a press statement. Major acquisitions that had a significant impact on the vendor rankings for 2016 included Avago Technologies' acquisition of Broadcom Corp. to become Broadcom Ltd., On Semiconductor's acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor, and Western Digital's acquisition of Sandisk, Gartner said. The largest mover in the top 25 was Broadcom, which moved up 12 places in the market share ranking, Gartner said. Intel remained the No. 1 semiconductor vendor for 2016, a position it has held since the 1990s. However, according to Gartner, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. cut into Intel's overall semiconductor industry market share in 2016. Intel held 15.7 percent of the market, while Samsung held 11.7 percent, according to Gartner. Some researchers, including IC Insights, have speculated that particularly strong memory pricing in the current market could enable Samsung to pass Intel in chip sales as early as this quarter. Top 10 semiconductor vendors by sales, 2016 (in millions of dollars). That the semiconductor industry achieved growth at all in 2016 came as a major surprise as sales really accelerated in the second half of the year. Early last year, in the midst of a widespread semiconductor inventory correction, market watchers-—including Gartner—were predicting that the industry would contract. But Hines said the weak sales environment in the first half of the year gave way to strengthening demand and improving pricing for chips. "Worldwide semiconductor revenue growth was supported by increasing production in many electronic equipment segments, improving NAND flash memory pricing and relatively benign currency movements," Hines said. —Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Race For AI: Google, Twitter, Intel, Apple In A Rush To Grab Artificial Intelligence Startups iCrowdNewswire – May 15, 2017 Corporate giants like Google, IBM, Yahoo, Intel, Apple and Salesforce are competing in the race to acquire private AI companies, with Ford, Samsung, GE, and Uber emerging as new entrants. Over 200 private companies using AI algorithms across different verticals have been acquired since 2012, with over 30 acquisitions taking place in Q1’17 alone (as of 3/24/17). This quarter also saw one of the largest M&A deals: Ford’s acquisition of Argo AI for $1B. In 2013, Google picked up deep learning and neural network  startup DNN research from the computer science department at the University of Toronto. This acquisition reportedly helped Google make major upgrades to its image search feature. In 2014 Google acquired British company DeepMind Technologies for some $600M (Google’s DeepMind program recently beat a human world champion in the board game “Go”). Last year, it acquired visual search startup Moodstock, and bot platform Api.ai. More recently, in Q1’17, Google acquired predictive analytics platform Kaggle. Apple has been ramping up its M&A activity, and ranked second with a total of 7 acquisitions. It recently acquired Tel Aviv-based RealFace, valued at $2M. Intel, Microsoft, and Facebook are tied for third place. Intel acquired 3 startups in 2016 alone: Itseez, Nervana Systems, and Movidius, while Facebook acquired Belarus-based Masquerade Technologies and Switzerland-based Zurich ye recently. Microsoft recently acquired Genee and conversational AI startup Maluuba.   Twitter is the next most-active acquirer, with 4 major acquisitions, the most recent being image-processing startup Magic Pony. Salesforce, which joined the race in 2015 with the acquisition of Tempo AI, made two major acquisitions last year: Khosla Ventures-backed MetaMind and open-source machine-learning server PredictionIO. GE made 2 acquisitions in November 2016: AI-IoT startup Bit Stew Systems, and CRM-focused Wise.io.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Samsung and Intel are backing the FTC’s lawsuit against Qualcomm Samsung and Intel are backing the FTC’s lawsuit against Qualcomm Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago Featured Tech News, General Tech Earlier this year, the US Federal Trade Commission and Apple both filed lawsuits against Qualcomm, citing anti-competitive business practises. Now, it seems that Samsung and Intel are also piling on, backing the FTC’s suit against the company, claiming that they too have been harmed by Qualcomm’s business practises. It might surprise you to hear that Samsung is backing the suit against Qualcomm, given that the two companies have worked closely. Most recently, Qualcomm tapped Samsung to produce the Snapdragon 835 processor, which went on to be featured in the Samsung Galaxy S8. However, there appears to be some bad blood brewing under the surface. According to Samsung, Qualcomm has been blocking the company from selling licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities.   Intel on the other hand had a lot more to say about Qualcomm, listing off three key business tactics the company uses to stifle competition: “An unprecedented “no-license-no-chips” policy, whereby Qualcomm refuses to sell OEMs any chipsets unless those manufacturers also purchase separate patent licenses that require them to pay exorbitant royalties for every handset they sell, regardless of whether the handset contains a Qualcomm chipset; A refusal to license SEPs to competitors, in violation of its FRAND commitments; A long-running exclusive supply arrangement with Apple that resulted in below-cost pricing for Qualcomm’s chipsets and substantial foreclosure of the premium baseband chipset market.” Intel branded this as Qualcomm’s way of coercing customers into exclusivity deals, which in turn, ‘fences’ competitors out of the market and creates a “lack of alternative supply options”. Since there are fewer alternative options, companies are increasingly reliant on Qualcomm’s supply chain. KitGuru Says: With more companies coming out to back the FTC’s case against Qualcomm, the situation is looking increasingly dire for the chip maker. After this, it seems doubtful that the FTC will drop its case like Qualcomm had previously hoped.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags FTC Intel news qualcomm samsung Previous Report claims IO Interactive will keep the rights to Hitman following split from Square Enix Next Google Android Auto gets much-needed standard interface, still lacks CAN Bus integration Check Also The 2017 Steam Summer Sale dates have leaked Over the last few years, it has grown increasingly easier to get your game published … Rocky40 HAHAHA….Seems rather weird Intel would complain about this when they themselves have been known to be very underhanded in the past.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 15, 2017 8:35 AM PT Credit: Microsoft More like this Qualcomm details plans for Windows 10 PCs with Snapdragon 835 chips Qualcomm: First Windows 10 ARM PC coming in the fourth quarter In PC comeback, ARM will battle Intel in Chromebooks and Windows 10 Video Surface Pro 4 vs. Surface Book: How to decide A Windows-on-ARM PC is getting closer to reality. Microsoft showed off a prototype mini-desktop with an ARM processor running Windows 10 at last week’s Build conference, with the PC running applications like Office. The PC was shown in a video posted on the Channel 9 website. The presenters reinforced Microsoft’s previous message saying that all x86 applications will work on Windows-on-ARM PCs. Microsoft has maintained that the experience on Windows 10-on-ARM PCs will be similar to x86 laptops, but many questions remain. One revolves around whether Windows 10-on-ARM PCs will support Windows Mixed Reality headsets. At an Acer event last month a Microsoft spokesman said that for now, Windows Mixed Reality headsets are configured to support only the x86 instruction set. Microsoft reinforced that position at the Build conference. Microsoft says PCs will require at a minimum Intel’s dual-core Core i5 and an integrated HD 620 GPU to run its Windows Mixed Reality headsets. PC makers like Acer, Asus, Dell, Lenovo, HP, and others will ship headsets. Last month, Acer said the price of its headset will start at $299. But from ARM chipmaker Qualcomm’s perspective, all x86 apps will run on Windows 10-on-ARM PCs, which are expected later this year. That could include Mixed Reality headsets from working with the PCs. “There’s nothing that would prohibit it from a hardware standpoint. I just think it’s a function of time,” Keith Kressin, senior vice president of product management at Qualcomm Technologies, said two months ago at MWC. The Windows 10-on-ARM PCs will run on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip, which has the ingredients to support Mixed Reality headsets. The chip has an integrated GPU that supports 4K video, the latest Bluetooth 5 wireless connectivity, and the latest display ports. Android mobile devices like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 handsets with the Snapdragon 835 already are capable of running mobile VR on headsets. But Windows 10-on-ARM PCs are designed more for mobility than virtual reality, Kressin said. The laptops and 2-in-1s are being designed, in the mold of smartphones, to be super thin and always connected to the internet. Microsoft has made some clever improvements to bring x86 app support to ARM chips. Windows-on-ARM PCs don’t have native support for x86 desktop applications. Instead, x86 apps are funneled through an abstraction layer and CPU emulator to run ARM chips. Windows PCs with x86 chips typically run code natively on hardware, but the Windows on ARM PCs won’t be able to do that. A “dynamic binary translator” will look at chunks of x86 code, which a run-time will then translate to ARM64 code. The ARM64 code will be cached for subsequent use. Emulation can be slow and take up system resources, but Microsoft has developed tools to reduce overhead. Then, it becomes a question of whether the Windows on ARM emulator can handle the massive graphics and CPU processing power required by Mixed Reality headsets and applications. Microsoft said x86 apps on ARM will be slightly slower than on Intel or AMD PCs. But there are some possible ways to run Mixed Reality on ARM. Headsets could be connected to Windows on ARM PCs to view VR content in a browser or an app supporting the WebVR specification. WebVR is an open standard and is supported by all major browsers and hardware including Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Rift, and the HTC Vive headsets. Making Mixed Reality work may come down to whether any supporting headset is released for Windows 10 on ARM PCs. PC makers are playing it safe with Windows-on-ARM PCs. Dell, Asus, and HP like the idea of a super-slim laptop with cellphone-like cellular connectivity to the internet. But they aren’t prematurely announcing hardware as a way to ensure these PCs aren’t the next coming of Windows RT, a 2012 OS for ARM-based tablets. Windows RT, based on Windows 8, failed because it didn’t run standard x86 applications. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

(Photo Credit: Army Research Laboratory screenshot) VIEW ORIGINAL ORLANDO, Fla. (March 29, 2013) -- The U.S. Army and Intel Corporation entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to collaborate and optimize research in virtual training environments. Intel researchers have been developing technologies to scale user interaction, and they intend to focus on technologies to scale realism and immersion. As platform technology providers, they partner with application developers to ensure technologies address the right problem. Collaboration with the Simulation and Training Technology Center, or STTC, offers an opportunity to work directly with users of the technology. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command's virtual reality experts are part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Human Research Engineering Directorate STTC, here. The unique partnership will provide both organizations a leap ahead in scalable simulation capabilities, officials said. Jointly developed technology will allow for at least five times the concurrent human participants supported in virtual-training environments. The expected increase of participants, areas of operation and complexity of agents will bring the military closer to achieving the goals outlined in the U.S. Army Learning Concept for 2015. The simulation center identified a need for scalability and flexibility for next-generation training applications. The majority of current simulation-based, virtual-environment training applications are only used at the small unit level, which is 40 Soldiers or fewer. "Properly representing the operational environment for Army training needs will require a massive increase in simulation scalability and flexibility," said Doug Maxwell, STTC science and technology manager. "It is our belief that virtual world technology may be used to achieve the goal of full-spectrum operations during mission rehearsal exercises. This partnership is the first step to show that more than 1,000 users can operate in the same space and at the same time to achieve a realistic mission." Human Research Engineering Directorate leads two ARL major laboratory programs: human sciences and simulation and training technology. The goal of the Army is to research, develop, mature and transition innovative training technologies that increase warfighter battlefield readiness and performance. The center's research focus is technology for the future -- what are the requirements in five to 10 years? The center is actively pursuing analysis and development in the areas of intelligent tutors, immersive learning environments, human agent teaming, dismounted Soldier training, virtual world technologies, mobile applications -- like apps -- and medical simulators and simulations.

The new Dell Alienware gaming laptops are heading to South Africa. The laptops, which will be distributed by Prima Interactive, gives gamers the opportunity to take their high-end PC gaming with them where ever they go. Alienware, a brand associated with the most elite echelons of gaming,will be brought to the market by Prima Interactive, which is one of country’s leading gaming and entertainment distributors and is the sole supplier of Microsoft Xbox hardware, including the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and peripherals. Prima Interactive is also the distributor of chart-topping triple-A gaming titles, such as Halo, Gears of War, Battlefield, FIFA, Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. “The Alienware brand has always set the standard for high-end gaming on laptops, rivalling desktop systems,” said Chris Buchanan, Director of Client Solutions at Dell EMC. “They play in a very competitive market, where second-best won’t do. This requires a specialist distributor that has the credentials and reputation the gaming market respects. Prima Interactive is a giant of that industry, having represented many of the top gaming titles and studios for years. It is without questions the partner to take the Alienware family of gaming laptops to new heights.” The new Alienware family of gaming laptops run on the latest 7th generation of Intel Core i chipsets, with the flagship model powered by the new i7 7700 Intel processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8GB graphics processor. Available with dynamic overclocking and in 13”, 15” and 17” screen sizes, every new Alienware machine runs on Windows 10, available in Single Language and Pro versions. The family of laptops supports DirectX 12 and also include additional features designed specifically for gamers. The chassis are designed with carbon fiber, inspired by aerospace technologies. This sturdy and reliable design reflects in the keyboard, which is reinforced with a steel plate and guaranteed for up to 10 million keystrokes. Customisable keys can be set to 15 unique commands, including in-game macros, programmed via the Alienware Command Center software. “Being appointed the Alienware distributor is a very exciting opportunity for Prima”, says Ian Hepplewhite CEO. “Alienware is the premier brand of gaming laptops, and it’s the device most PC gamers aspire to have. Apart from cutting edge specifications, the build quality is awesome, and Alienware laptops are finely tuned to deliver peak performance”. Owning a new Alienware also includes access to Microsoft Play Anywhere. This innovative cross-platform service lets players purchase just one digital copy of a game and play it on both their Xbox console and Windows 10 PC. The Play Anywhere family of games keep growing and already include Halo Wars 2, Forza Horizon 3 and Gears of War 4. Play on PC or Xbox, using the same save games and progress across all supported devices. Prima Interactive will also distribute Alienware accessories, such as the Alienware Graphics Amplifier. This expands the graphics power of your Alienware experience, including 4K graphics, support for multiple monitors and virtual reality. The new generation of Alienware gaming laptops, powered by Intel Core i7 SkyLake Dual Core technology, will retail from R23,999, below the traditional R 25,000 mark previously seen in the market, while the top of the range bring unparalleled gaming performance for only R49,999.

On Friday, Samsung and Intel both filed briefs backing the FTC in its case against Qualcomm, claiming they have been “harmed” by the misconduct. Although Samsung develops its own chips that compete with Qualcomm’s, it uses its competitor’s chips in its smartphones — such as the Snapdragon 835 processor in the Galaxy S8. “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets,” Samsung said in its brief, calling Qualcomm’s actions “exclusionary.” Intel, on the other hand, claims in its filing that Qualcomm’s practices have “inflicted and continues to inflict precisely the harms that the antitrust laws seek to protect against,” according to The Wall Street Journal. “Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits. These practices have illegally coerced mobile phone manufacturers into purchasing the chipsets they need from Qualcomm and Qualcomm alone,” Intel wrote on its website. While Qualcomm has not commented on Samsung and Intel’s briefings, it did warn investors in its most recent earnings report that growing legal challenges may affect its financial outlook. Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the FTC suit is slated for June, and will be heard in a federal court in the Northern District of California.

Microsoft Microsoft's 2-in-1 is due a refresh, but the Surface Laptop may have stolen its thunder Alan Martin @alan_p_martin 15 May 2017 whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email Hard to believe that the Microsoft Surface has only been a thing for just over four years, isn’t it? The Surface Pro – the version with specs more suited to the serious laptop user – is younger still, first emerging nearly exactly four years ago in February 2013.  That would have made us think that a Surface Pro 5 was imminent, but now we're not so sure. Why? Well, the Surface Laptop has gone and taken its thunder. On top of that, Panos Panay, corporate vice president for Surface computering at Microsoft, has told CNET that there won't be a Surface Pro 5 until there's a "meaningful change." "Meaningful change isn't necessarily a hardware change, which is what a lot of people look for. They're like, 'Where's the latest processor?' That's not what I mean. I'm looking for an experiential change that makes a huge difference in product line. You'll see that same meaningful impact when [Surface] Pro 5, or Pro Next hits the market. There's no such thing as a [Surface] Pro 5." That doesn't mean that the Pro won't be refreshed, of course, but perhaps not a Surface Pro 5? Or then again, maybe: Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic. — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 Here’s everything we know about the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, with a spot of educated guesswork thrown in. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 12.3 inch Tablet with Pen (Intel Core i5-6300U 2.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Integrated Graphics, Windows 10 Pro) - Silver £914.00 Buy now Microsoft Surface Pro 5 – Features See related  Apple MacBook (2016) vs Microsoft Surface Pro 4: The sub-1kg showdown HP Spectre x2 review: Like the Surface Pro 4, only cheaper Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review: Updated, and still the best of its kind First things first, you can be pretty sure that the Surface 5 will get a decent specs upgrade over its predecessor – when you’re waiting over a year for the next iteration, that should be an absolute minimum. The most obvious technological development in the intervening time has come in the processor department. The Surface 4 packed Intel’s Skylake range of processors, but with Intel hitting the seventh generation with Kaby Lake, we’re pretty confident the Surface 5 will get that upgrade – the power efficiency savings alone make it a good bet, given the Surface 4’s battery was a touch underwhelming and a frequent bone of contention for its owners. Said battery improvements could also make a 4K screen feasible, but this is one rumour we’re less inclined to take as gospel – purely because for most consumers, it’s just not essential on a tablet. If 4K screens do appear on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, we expect it’ll be optional, perhaps only included in the most expensive top-of-the-range model. So it’s faster and most likely more shiny. What about about actual new features? Well, the most likely addition is a rechargeable Surface Pen. The reasoning for this comes from a couple of patents – one filed back in November: a holder for the Surface pen which will also charge it, and another spotted by Patently Mobile which holds the pen magnetically while it charges. Ooooh. Finally there’s the Surface dial, which debuted with the Surface Studio. It’s a little round doohickey that allows you to interact with the computer via twists and taps. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of Surface Dial support Microsoft is planning for the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 – Release date We’re still hoping for a 2017 release date, thanks in part to this tweet from developer Shubhan Chemburkar who claims to have spotted this within Microsoft’s Redmond offices: Coming soon! In the #surface building @bdsams pic.twitter.com/R8zTDEJQ9M — Shubhan Chemburkar (@shubhan3009) July 3, 2016 ...of course, the zoomed out picture shows another similar picture with a 2016 sticker on it, which inspires less confidence: @bdsams see here pic.twitter.com/Tri8HDI1w5 — Shubhan Chemburkar (@shubhan3009) July 3, 2016 Sadly, we can’t really take any lessons from past Surface Pro release dates, because they’ve been inconsistent: The Surface Pro 1, 2 and 4 were all released in October, while the 3 was released in June. Given the Surface laptop is going to be this year's big release, it's possible we won't see a Surface Pro 5 before 2018. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 – Price This is all wildly dependent on how many and which of the rumours above end up materialising, of course, but as things stand, we’d be surprised if Microsoft adjusted the current pricing structure too much. With the Surface Pro starting at £749 and going well over £2,000 for the top-of-the-range model, it’s already an expensive device. It would therefore be a big surprise if Microsoft planned on raising things further with the Surface Pro 5. That said, Brexit currency fluctuations have made many consumer goods go up in price – and Microsoft itself has not been immune to this phenomenon, so never say never. As always, we’ll keep updating this page as we find out more information about the Surface Pro 5.

House and Senate GOP leaders have dismissed Democrats’ push to appoint a special prosecutor or create an independent bipartisan commission to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election since Comey’s ouster. They insist that the ongoing probes the FBI and House and Senate Intelligence panels will suffice. ADVERTISEMENT But the controversy isn’t going away, even nearly a full week after the White House made the bombshell announcement. The House will be back in session for the first time since the firing, after being out for a week and a half. Trump poured gasoline onto the fire days after the firing, tweeting that Comey "better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!" Meanwhile, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will meet with senators during a closed-door briefing this week over his role in Comey’s firing.  Rosenstein has been under the spotlight because of a memo used to justify Comey’s firing.  His role has confused and infuriated Democratic senators, most of whom voted to confirm him to the No. 2 Department of Justice spot less than a month ago.  Sen. Dick DurbinDick DurbinThis week: Congress grapples with Comey fallout Flynn subpoena sets up battle between White House, Congress The Memo: Dangers ahead for Trump on Comey MORE (D-Ill.), who supported Rosenstein’s nomination, said on Friday that he needed to resign if he wasn’t willing to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the FBI’s investigation, which includes potential ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow.  "To preserve his reputation as a credible prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must appoint an independent special prosecutor to pursue possible criminal charges, or he must resign," Durbin said in a statement.  The White House initially said Trump made his decision based off guidance from Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsPelosi: Trump actions on Comey dismissal ‘really weird’ Poll: Most want ‘independent’ probe of Trump, Russia Republican rep roils Alabama Senate race MORE. Trump, however, contradicted that when he told NBC News that he would have fired Comey regardless of the FBI’s recommendation.  In addition to briefing the entire Senate, the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked that either Rosenstein or Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, or both, give senators an update on the FBI’s investigation.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck SchumerCharles SchumerGOP senators lukewarm to lawmaker leading FBI Dems: Trump must explain allegations he discussed classified info White House defends Trump on classified intel report MORE (D-N.Y.) also wants Sessions to meet with his former colleagues.

MORE (D-Va.) — the top Democrat on the committee — told MSNBC.  Health care Despite the Comey cloud, Republicans will plow ahead with one of their top priorities: ObamaCare repeal. Speaker Paul RyanPaul Ryan'Daily Show' resurfaces GOP tweets on mishandling classified info. Overnight Defense: White House defends Trump on classified intel report | Trump's veterans hotline still not ready | Obama defends not bombing Syria Ryan tweet on classified info resurfaces after bombshell Trump report MORE (R-Wis.) downplayed the notion that the Comey scandal would distract from the GOP’s legislative agenda. “You know, it’s not hard that in Congress to get us to focus on our jobs,” Ryan told a Wisconsin radio host on Friday. House Republicans struggled to defend their votes for their healthcare plan while back in their districts over the last week. The few GOP lawmakers who did hold town halls were overrun by angry constituents fearful that they could lose access to health insurance. Even Freedom Caucus members in deep-red districts, like Reps. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) and Dave Brat (R-Va.), faced crowds full of people upset over their votes. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office on the legislation the House narrowly passed earlier this month isn’t expected until next Monday.  For now, the bill’s fate is in the Senate’s ballpark, where GOP senators are noncommittal on when they could pass it. Both Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price have endorsed the idea that the upper chamber could clear its legislation before lawmakers leave for the August recess.  "We will continue to work with the Leader [Mitch McConnellMitch McConnellPelosi: Trump actions on Comey dismissal ‘really weird’ GOP senators lukewarm to lawmaker leading FBI Trump faces tough choices in FBI pick MORE] and all the other senators who are interested, as I say, in working toward a positive, productive outcome. And I do, I believe the Senate will produce a bill this summer," Price told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday.  Asked if senators would be able to vote before they leave Washington, Price added, "I believe so." Ryan said Friday he hopes the Senate can move the legislation within the next month or so, but added, “I stopped trying to predict what the Senate is going to do a long time ago.” Lawmakers have roughly two and a half months before they are scheduled to leave on July 31. They will return to Washington in early September, where they will need to work out a deal funding the government and avoiding a shutdown.  But the timeline is a contrast to signals from Senate Republicans, who have been wary of being tied down to a specific deadline.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has yet to lay out when he thinks the Senate could pass legislation.  Sen. John CornynJohn CornynGOP senators lukewarm to lawmaker leading FBI Trump faces tough choices in FBI pick 'Daily Show' resurfaces GOP tweets on mishandling classified info. MORE (R-Texas) said the Senate will pass a bill this year, but pressed if they could pass legislation by Sept. 30 — the end of the fiscal year — he demurred.  “No, no, I’m not going to play that game," the No. 2 Senate Republican told reporters.  House and Senate lawmakers could also need to go to conference to work out their differences, which could drag the healthcare debate well into the fall.  For now, McConnell has convened a working group that is meeting two times a week. The group is tasked with coming up with a deal that could pass the Senate, but senators say the talks are still in the early stages and focused on broad policy ideas.  Senate Republicans have a narrow path for passing healthcare legislation through the upper chamber. With 52 seats, McConnell can only afford to lose two GOP senators and still pass a bill.  They're expected to make significant changes to the bill, with a group of moderate GOP senators concerned about what happens to ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion in their home states.  GOP Sens. Rob PortmanRob PortmanOvernight Finance: Chamber urges Treasury to withdraw rules on inversions, estate tax | Why Trump moved on tax reform | Trump takes aim at drug pricing | Budget chair wants Medicaid changes This week: Congress grapples with Comey fallout Week ahead: Senate plugs away on health bill MORE (Ohio) and Pat Toomey (Pa.) have been tasked with trying to find a way forward on Medicaid.  Senate GOP leaders are also preparing for a fight over using the bill to defund Planned Parenthood.

John Cornyn (R-Texas) said they are exploring whether they can get a repeal of essential health benefits through the Senate's rules. Though the move has been pushed by conservatives it could alienate more moderate senators.  In the meantime, House Republicans will try to pivot to tax reform.  The House Ways and Means Committee will hold its first hearing on tax reform — "How Tax Reform Will Grow Our Economy and Create Jobs Across America" — on Thursday morning.  “Our hearing is an important step forward as we work with President Trump and our Senate colleagues on delivering historic pro-growth tax reform for the first time in 30 years,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyChamber urges Treasury to withdraw rules on inversions, estate tax Overnight Finance: Chamber urges Treasury to withdraw rules on inversions, estate tax | Why Trump moved on tax reform | Trump takes aim at drug pricing | Budget chair wants Medicaid changes It's time to kill the death tax once and for all MORE (R-Texas) said in a statement announcing it.  With no major votes imminent, the House has a relatively light floor schedule this week. Lawmakers will consider two bills in commemoration of National Police Week. One would give probation officers the authority to arrest “hostile third parties” who interfere with their duties, while another would include the murder or attempted killing of a law enforcement officer as a factor for a jury to consider when deciding if a case merits the death penalty.  Nominations  The Senate will continue processing Trump's nominees with up to three votes this week.  Senators will start the week on Monday evening with a procedural vote on Jeffrey Rosen's nomination to be the deputy secretary of Transportation. Democrats could drag out a final vote on the nomination until Tuesday night.  Rosen was nominated by Trump in March and previously served as general counsel to the Transportation Department during the George W. Bush administration.  After wrapping up Rosen's nomination the Senate is expected to move to Rachel Brand's nomination to be assistant attorney general. The Judiciary Committee voted 11-9 to approve her nomination last month.  Sen. Chuck GrassleyChuck GrassleyTrump faces tough choices in FBI pick Comey’s gone, now how do we replace him at the FBI? Congress set to vote on cyber bills MORE (R-Iowa) also told Iowa reporters last week that the Senate could confirm Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) to be Trump's ambassador to China.  "By next week, he’ll be ambassador to China, as far as I can tell," he said according to the Des Moines Register.  But McConnell wrapped up the Senate's work for the week without setting up Branstand's nomination.  - Tags Richard Blumenthal Mitch McConnell Lisa Murkowski Chuck Grassley Chuck Schumer Jeff Sessions Susan Collins Rob Portman Dick Durbin John Cornyn Kevin Brady Mark Warner Paul Ryan   View the discussion thread.

The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Self-driving cars wouldn't dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quicklyadapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there's the 'California Stop,' where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. 'It's hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to gamethe technology,' says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota's autonomous car unit.

Re: Human Drivers, The Biggest Challenge Facing Self Driving Cars' Developers. by Explorers(m): 1:20pm On May 13 Intel expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That's equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle. That's because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. 'Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don't understand social graces,' says Missy Cummings, director of Duke University's Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing's giant traffic jams. In India's capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant.Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they're equipped with automatic emergency braking. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4495308/Whats-holding-self-driving-cars-Human-drivers.html 2 Likes 1 Share Re: Human Drivers, The Biggest Challenge Facing Self Driving Cars' Developers. by LeJeun3: 1:23pm On May 13 Laziness.... 3 Likes Re: Human Drivers, The Biggest Challenge Facing Self Driving Cars' Developers. by Explorers(m): 1:33pm On May 13 Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030.

We've all been blown away by the impressive performance and even more impressive pricing of AMD's new Ryzen chips, and it looks like Intel may have been paying attention, and been holding something in reserve to counter its resurgent competitor. Now, fair warning. This leak comes via the Anandtech forums, as picked up by Guru3D, and is based not only on a photo of a PowerPoint slide, but it's a work-in-progress slide to boot - and in German. So, this is far, far from final. But if we're to take it at face value, Intel's got two new Core i7 chips, and four Core i9 processors around the corner. The top-line SKU is the Core i9 7920x with 12 cores and 24 threads, and 16.5MB of L3 cache.  We don't have any clocks for that part yet, but the next down in the range is more fully fleshed out.

HTC flew about 150 journalists for this event 01:44AM EDT - It's just Ian today, taking care of pictures and text 01:44AM EDT - I've been in Taiwan a couple of days already - yesterday HTC gave us a factory and labs tour 01:44AM EDT - I've done factory and lab tours before - either building the devices or compliance/consistency testing 01:45AM EDT - most companies have similar processes for both 01:45AM EDT - However if you're ever invited to a lab tour, I highly suggested trying to get some time in the anechoic chamber/room. Always fun when I go in one :) 01:46AM EDT - So for this event, HTC is launching their new flagship smartphone 01:46AM EDT - It feels somewhat of an odd time to launch one, well after MWC, basically on top of Google IO (but not in the US), and only a couple of weeks away from Computex 01:47AM EDT - (yes, that means I'm flying back home to the UK and then flying back to Taiwan for Computex) 01:47AM EDT - Nonetheless, as Aicha Evans of Intel always says: Time to Market matters 01:47AM EDT - and today this launch is the extension of the HTC U smartphone line 01:48AM EDT - earlier in the year, HTC launched the U Play and U Ultra 01:48AM EDT - This device should be big pluses on both 01:48AM EDT - A little insight into our world for readers: 01:49AM EDT - we typically get prebriefings for these events, and this is no exception, but we're not allowed to talk about the device until the NDA lifts 01:49AM EDT - sometimes the NDA lifts at the beginning of the press event, making most of the press event somewhat redundant (hey, just read our news post) 01:49AM EDT - Or the embargo lifts part of the way through 01:49AM EDT - Or the embargo lifts at the end of the event 01:50AM EDT - This is that last one: I know what's coming, but I can't tell you 01:50AM EDT - So we're going to have to wait as HTC announces the new device, and the features 01:50AM EDT - Welcome to the internet, I'll be your guide 01:50AM EDT - (If the WiFi works properly) 01:50AM EDT - We just got a 10 minute warning, with the name of the new device flashed on the screen: HTC U11 01:51AM EDT - The main thing for this device is the Squeeze 01:52AM EDT - more info to come, but the video consists of squeezing sponges, honey, oranges, avocados, play-doh 01:54AM EDT - Squeezy 01:56AM EDT - Apparently the event WiFi is down already 01:56AM EDT - I'm running off of a WiFi hotspot. Taiwan is crazy cheap for data for visitors 01:56AM EDT - $20 gets you a SIM card with unlimited 4G for 10 or 14 days 01:56AM EDT - and coverage is everywhere 01:57AM EDT - Compared to US carriers, I end up paying $20/GB or something crazy when I visit SF with a visitor SIM 01:58AM EDT - This squeeze video is on repeat. Every. 30. Seconds. 01:58AM EDT - Well on the name, HTC U11 01:59AM EDT - It's designed to be the successor from the M7, M8, M9 and HTC 10 01:59AM EDT - one minute warning 02:00AM EDT - Here we go 02:00AM EDT - MC on stage 02:01AM EDT - 'Where HTC is from, what inspires us, and what has happened over the last 20 years' 02:01AM EDT - Chialin Chuang to the stage, president of smartphone and connected devices 02:02AM EDT - 'HTC celebrated 20 anniversary yesterday' 02:02AM EDT - 'Today marks the start of the next 20 years' 02:02AM EDT - Going through some innovations: Boomsound, dual Ultrapixel 02:03AM EDT - 'These have all been widely copied' 02:03AM EDT - 'In 1997, we started working on personal mobility devices' 02:03AM EDT - '2007: first HTC Touch phone' 02:04AM EDT - '2017: we see 5G coming in 2/3 years' 02:04AM EDT - 'The next generation of smartphone must have:' 02:04AM EDT - 'New ways to interact' 02:05AM EDT - 'Voice and PLatform based on natural language across multiple platforms' 02:05AM EDT - 'Next gen multimedia' 02:05AM EDT - Introducing HTC U11 02:06AM EDT - Apparently the leaked video was an internal 2015 video 02:06AM EDT - 'Thinking about something as intuitive as squeeze' 02:07AM EDT - 'A new baby will reach out and squeeze the mother's finger' 02:07AM EDT - 'Squeeze shows your feelings' 02:08AM EDT - 'Each media will get a U11 to test' 02:08AM EDT - 'The first thing you do is grip the side' 02:08AM EDT - 'Now imagine applying a little squeeze - and all sorts of interesting things will come out' 02:08AM EDT - Film time - it's that 30 second squeeze film again 02:08AM EDT - No it's a different one 02:09AM EDT - Squeeze for photo, squeeze for Google 02:09AM EDT - 'With a little squeeze you can turn on all sorts of applications' 02:09AM EDT - 'Simple squeeze to open camera' 02:09AM EDT - Squeeze to selfie 02:10AM EDT - Long squeeze to change camera from front to back 02:10AM EDT - 'As simple as squeeze' 02:10AM EDT - Action Squeeze: while skateboarding, hold phone and squeeze to selfie mid-air 02:11AM EDT - 'Squeeze becomes the only way to capture the moment' 02:11AM EDT - 'How do we combine squeeze with the next generation trend' 02:11AM EDT - 'We see the voice commands' 02:11AM EDT - 'A little squeeze for OK Google Assistant' 02:12AM EDT - Squeeze to enable OK Google, then say 'OK Google' to activate 02:12AM EDT - Or use a different wake word 02:12AM EDT - 'Alexa' 02:13AM EDT - The wifi in the room is bad, having some issues with the demo... but it is just about working 02:13AM EDT - 'You can set up a short or long squeeze then followed by a voice command' 02:14AM EDT - 'In China HTC is working with Baidu to power the voice commands 02:14AM EDT - 'Becase we have 4 microphone arrays detecting voice at distance, we can hear the signal very well and filter out the noise' 02:15AM EDT - 'Because of this, we can enable a 3D recording with AdioZoom' 02:15AM EDT - When recording music on a video, the microphones will 'zoom' to give the music better SNR 02:15AM EDT - HTC Camera has been ranked with DXOMark 90 02:16AM EDT - Highest rank ever in DXOMark 02:16AM EDT - 'Next generation of HDR+ give us really good contrast' 02:16AM EDT - 'Super fast on photo and video' 02:17AM EDT - 'Lot of reduced noise in low light' 02:17AM EDT - Now audio 02:17AM EDT - HTC USonic 02:17AM EDT - 'Why did you take out the 3.5mm audio jack' 02:18AM EDT - 'USonic with Type-C combined with two microphone, detects the ear canal reflection to beef up the frequencies were needed' 02:19AM EDT - Because the microphone will detect the noise inside your ear, we can send the counter noise to provide Active Noise Cancellation 02:19AM EDT - Next gen HTC Boomsound 02:19AM EDT - One speaker uses the internal of the device as a resonance chamber 02:20AM EDT - Now industrial design 02:20AM EDT - VIdeo time 02:20AM EDT - 'Squeeze to show the best you' 02:20AM EDT - 'Music adapted to each user' 02:20AM EDT - 'Squeeze for the adventurous you' 'Squeeze for Selfies' 02:21AM EDT - Squeeze works with gloves btw 02:21AM EDT - We sort of understand how it works according to a vague explantion, but that's under embargo for a bit 02:22AM EDT - 'We pioneered the metal unibody design for a couple of years' 02:22AM EDT - 'So what's right for the next couple of years?' 02:22AM EDT - 'Ergonomics, aesthetics, color' 02:22AM EDT - 'This is all needed in a flagship' 02:23AM EDT - 'Between the user and the display is the cover glass' 02:23AM EDT - 'Need to fit inside your hand, so we started bending the glass from the front' 02:23AM EDT - 'Not just bent 2 ways, but 4-ways 02:24AM EDT - 'How do we make sure the color is right?' 02:24AM EDT - 'Glass has been used for hundreds of years, but how to make it stunning?

Previously under the codename “Threadripper,” the Ryzen 9 line reportedly contains nine different models that will span four different core/thread configurations. Keep in mind that the rumors may not be 100 percent accurate, but according to Guru3D via WikiChip, the following will make the lineup of AMD Ryzen 9 processors: Ryzen 9 CPU Cores/Threads Core Clock Boost Clock TDP 1998X 16 / 32 3.5GHz 3.9GHz 155W 1998 16 / 32 3.2GHz 3.6GHz 155W 1977X 14 / 28 3.5GHz 4.0GHz 155W 1977 14 / 28 3.2GHz 3.7GHz 140W 1976X 14 / 28 3.6GHz 4.1GHz 140W 1956X 12 / 24 3.2GHz 3.8GHz 125W 1956 12 / 24 3.0GHz 3.7GHz 125W 1955X 10 / 20 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 125W 1955 10 / 20 3.1GHz 3.7GHz 125W Currently, the Ryzen 7 1800X is AMD’s top-of-the-line CPU and sports eight cores and 16 threads. It excels in video production and image rendering tasks, especially considering its relatively modest price tag. Ryzen 9 CPUs would not be intended for gaming applications alone; HEDT processors cater to users that multitask with several CPU intensive programs. Similarly, details on Intel’s upcoming high-end processors, the Core i9 line, have surfaced. The most robust model seen from the Intel rumors, the Core i9-7920X, is said to feature 12 cores and 24 threads, a successor to the i7-6950X. Additional SKUs with six, eight, and ten-core configurations would compete with AMD’s multi-core offerings. It seems that information is leaking as we approach Computex, which will take place from May 30 to June 1 this year. It’s the largest PC hardware convention, and AMD will be holding a press conference on May 31 to likely reveal Vega GPUs and additional Ryzen CPUs.

By Jonathan Chadwick | May 16, 2017 -- 03:39 GMT (20:39 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Global semiconductor revenue grew by 2.6 percent during 2016 to reach a total of $343.5 billion, according to Gartner's Market Share Analysis: Semiconductors Worldwide 2016 report. The figure was up from 2015's global revenue of $334.9 billion, due to strengthening demand and improved pricing in the second half of 2016. The figure was despite a weak start to the year, the research firm said. "Worldwide semiconductor revenue growth was supported by increasing production in many electronic equipment segments, improving NAND flash memory pricing and relatively benign currency movements," said James Hines, research director at Gartner. Intel kept the top semiconductor vendor spot from 2015, recording revenue of $54.09 billion for 2016, having year-on-year growth of 4.6 percent and equating to market share of 15.7 percent. Top 10 semiconductor vendors globally by revenue for 2016. Gartner Second-placed Samsung Electronics, which also remained in the same spot as last year, recording revenue of 40.1 billion, and year-on-year growth of 5.9 percent, Qualcomm landed in third place with revenue of $15.4 billion, a drop of 4.1 percent; while SK Hynix recorded an even bigger decline of 10.2 percent, from $16.3 billion in 2015 to $14.7 billion in 2016. The biggest growth in the top 25 was for California-based Broadcom, whose revenue jumped 191.1 percent year on year to reach $13.2 billion, up from $4.5 billion in 2015. The company moved 12 spots in the rankings over the year as a result, from 17th to fifth place. Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, NXP, and Media Tek rounded out the rest of the top 10. The top 25 semiconductor vendors' combined revenue increased by 10.5 percent over the year, although most of this was due to mergers and acquisitions, Gartner added, including Broadcom's acquisition by Avago in 2015. "Combined revenue of the top 25 semiconductor vendors increased by 10.5 percent during 2016 and accounted for a 74.9 percent share, outperforming the rest of the market, which saw a 15.6 percent revenue decline," Hines added. The firm predicts global semiconductor revenue to grow by 7.2 percent in 2017. "The turnaround that started at the end of the second quarter of 2016 will continue to gain momentum, and we expect the improved conditions to carry through 2017," said Gartner's research vice president Ganesh Ramamoorthy. The global semiconductor market totaled $340 billion for 2014, Gartner previously said.

Uber brawl sees 'suspicious' acts and 'pilfered files' The judge rules Uber's self-driving car program safe, for now, but also says its star engineer must step aside. All this and we haven't even gotten to trial. Tech Industry by Dara Kerr May 15, 2017 4:58 PM PDT @darakerr Uber's self-driving car program is safe ... for now. James Martin/CNET One thing is clear in the Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: It's complicated. Federal Judge William Alsup sort of, kind of sided with Uber when he ruled Monday not to shutter the company's self-driving car program. But in almost the same breath, Alsup sort of, kind of sided with Waymo by agreeing that something "highly suspicious" happened with Uber's star engineer Anthony Levandowski. But let's back up. How did we get here? In February, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company Alphabet, filed a lawsuit against Uber alleging trade secret theft. Levandowski is at the center of the suit, with Waymo accusing him of stealing 14,000 "highly confidential" files on self-driving car technology in December 2015. Levandowski used to work at Google but quit in January 2016 to form his own self-driving truck startup, called Otto. Uber bought Otto last August for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car program. Before Levandowski quit Google, he helped pioneer the company's autonomous vehicle program and develop its lidar technology, a key component in self-driving cars that lets vehicles "see" their surroundings and detect traffic, pedestrians, bicyclists and other obstacles. It's that lidar technology that's at the crux of the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit. Waymo claims Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal its lidar designs. Those designs, Waymo argues, have benefited Uber's driverless car tech. Uber argues that its lidar technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. Self-driving cars are a hot topic in the auto and tech industries. Automakers from Toyota to Ford to Volvo all have projects under way. Besides Google and Uber, other Silicon Valley giants, including Apple, Intel and Tesla Motors, are betting on the tech. These vehicles aren't making money yet, but that could soon change. Once thought of as far-off future tech, driverless vehicles could be cruising city streets within the next 10 years, transforming the multitrillion-dollar auto industry. Google started working on self-driving cars in 2009 and has now test-driven its vehicles nearly 3 million miles. Uber launched its self-driving project in 2015 and has since rolled out autonomous vehicles on city streets in Pennsylvania, California and Arizona. What does the judge say? Judge Alsup said Uber can keep its project alive in the three states where it's operating, but that it must formally remove Levandowski as the head of the program. Uber also has to create a timeline of events regarding Levandowski being hired and "do whatever it can to ensure that its employees return 14,000-plus pilfered files to their rightful owner." In anticipation of the judge's ruling, Levandowski said last month he'd step aside as head of Uber's driverless car program and recuse himself from all lidar-related work. He remains at the company, however. "We are pleased with the court's ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LiDAR," an Uber spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up." Waymo didn't respond to requests for comment. Waymo had asked for a preliminary injunction, basically requesting that the judge shut down Uber's self-driving project. But that's easier said than done. Waymo needed to prove two things: it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction wasn't granted and that Uber used the files Levandowski allegedly downloaded. While Waymo wasn't able to meet the bar on those two points, the evidence the company has brought forward so far convinced Alsup that something shady happened. Related stories Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Uber says it's not 'hiding anything' in Waymo case 11 juicy details revealed at the Waymo v. Uber hearing "Waymo has made a strong showing that Levandowski absconded with over 14,000 files from Waymo, evidently to have them available to consult on behalf of Otto and Uber," Judge Alsup wrote in his order on Monday. "Uber knew or at least should have known of the downloading but nevertheless proceeded to bring Levandowski and Otto on board." Alsup referred the case to federal prosecutors last week for a possible criminal investigation into the alleged theft of trade secrets. The Department of Justice has already opened an inquiry into Uber on its secretive "Greyball" software tool. If the DOJ decides to take the trade secrets case, prosecutors will likely look into Uber as a whole, said Phil Bezanson, attorney for the firm Bracewell. In its investigations, the DOJ tends to stress things like corporate culture, tone at the top and being a good corporate citizen, he said. "Do we just have two disconnected data points from Greyball to Levandowski's actions?" Bezanson said the government will be asking. "Or is this a larger corporate culture problem?"

With the White House still battling the political fallout from the firing of FBI Director James Comey last week, the president faced fresh controversy for allegedly revealing to Sergey Lavrov and Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, closely held intelligence from a US intelligence ally about an Islamic State plot during an Oval Office meeting last week. "The White House has got to do something soon to bring itself under control and in order," Republican Senator Bob Corker, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters at the Capitol. "Obviously they're in a downward spiral right now and they've got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that's happening." Lavrov on Comey: 'You're kidding!' 00:43 The intelligence involved information about an Islamic State plot to use laptop computers as possible weapons aboard commercial aircraft and had been provided by a US ally with access to the inner workings of the terrorist group, the Washington Post reported.  H.R. McMaster, White House National Security Adviser, described the story as "false",  adding that they reviewed a range of common threats including to civil aviation. "At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. ... I was in the room. It didn't happen," he said. Nevertheless, Mr Corker was among a raft of politicians on both sides of the political spectrum to express concern at the allegations.  Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services panel, said sharing information without the permission of a foreign intelligence partner violates a cardinal rule of dealing with friendly agencies. "If it's accurate, it's disturbing because it's divulging information about operations in Syria which could be exploited not only by the Russians to interrupt intelligence operations that they feel are threatening to them," Mr Reed said. Report that Trump shared highly classified intelligence with Russians is deeply disturbing. House Intel needs to be briefed immediately. pic.twitter.com/jHaMKy71am— Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) May 15, 2017 Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the report was "deeply disturbing." "This disclosure could jeopardise sources of very sensitive intelligence and relationships we have with key partners," he said in a statement. Mr Schiff said it is particularly "problematic" that Russian interests, in Syria and elsewhere, are "deeply antithetical to our own." If true, this is a slap in the face to the intel community. Risking sources & methods is inexcusable, particularly with the Russians. https://t.co/CRiSC024F7— Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) May 15, 2017 Senator Mark Warner, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted: "If true, this is a slap in the face to the intel community. Risking sources & methods is inexcusable, particularly with the Russians." Nancy Pelosi, House minority leader, says there is an expression "loose lips can sink ships".    "This accidental, messy approach to intelligence is very endangering," she told CNN. Pelosi: “Loose lips can sink ships … this messy approach to intelligence that is very endangering” #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/4UKzeOuMM6— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 16, 2017 A number of Republican senators also voiced concern at the report. "We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount," said Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan. "The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration." If the Washington Post report is true, it is very disturbing. Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous.— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 15, 2017 Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent critic of Mr Trump, called the reports “troubling” if true, while Senator John McCain called the allegations “disturbing”. He later added: “We certainly don't want any president to leak classified information but the president does have the right to do that." The latest claims come after security concerns were raised about the presence of a Russian state news photographer in the Oval, while US media were barred from the meeting. As administration official reportedly said the White House were told he was Mr Lavrov’s official photographer and they were not aware he also worked for Tass, a state-run news agency.  Share this article Follow Telegraph News Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph News Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Related Topics USA Republicans Russia Democrats Donald Trump Lt General HR McMaster White House Islamic State Show more Galleries Gallery 16 May 2017, 7:03am Gallery: Pictures of the Day: 16 May 2017 Gallery 15 May 2017, 5:35pm Gallery: Telegraph cartoons, May 2017 Gallery 15 May 2017, 4:58pm Gallery: Matt cartoons, May 2017  Premium News latest 16 May 2017, 7:41am Moors Murderer Ian Brady dies aged 79 and takes secret of final victim's burial with him Gallery 16 May 2017, 7:19am Gallery: Little Boy Blue: how much do the cast look like the real Rhys Jones and Sean Mercer? 16 May 2017, 7:18am Little Boy Blue episode 4 review: A powerful climax to Rhys Jones's tragic story 5 16 May 2017, 7:18am Little Boy Blue: What really happened during the trial of Rhys Jones's killer Sean Mercer?

USA TODAY President Trump and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on May 10, 2017. (Photo: Russian Foreign Ministry via AFP) 2045 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 219 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON – The nation's capital is engulfed in a debate about President Trump's reported decision to leak highly classified information to top Russian diplomats – but legal analysts and secrecy experts said Monday that American presidents have broad authority to disclose classified information, making them virtually immune from prosecution. Every other government employee with a clearance could face criminal charges for disclosing classified information without prior permission. But the commander in chief has the power to unilaterally disclose any material – even the most secret intelligence – without going through any kind of formal process. Still, Trump's decision to share such sensitive information last week in a White House meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak – first reported by the Washington Post – has potentially serious consequences. Perhaps most serious, said Mark Zaid, an attorney specializing in national security matters, is the prospect that allies would lose their trust in Washington's ability to keep secrets and no longer share valuable intelligence with their American counterparts. Read more: Lawmakers slam reports Trump revealed classified intel to Russians Trump's tweets on mishandled classified info come back to haunt him 'Post' scoop on Trump's Russia leak sets new reader record "If we get to the point where our closest allies refuse share this information, that would be the worst outcome imaginable,'' Zaid said. Trump, according to the the Post report, disclosed highly classified information about a plot involving the Islamic State during a White House discussion with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Making matters more complex, the ambassador's past contacts with with Trump campaign and administration officials are the subject of a separate ongoing FBI investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials. The information shared with the Russians had been provided by a U.S. partner under terms of an intelligence-sharing agreement, according to the report. The identity of the country that provided the information was not disclosed in the Post report. "The president has the power to declassify our intelligence,'' said Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. "He does not have the authority to declassify unilaterally intelligence provided to us by other countries.'' While violations of intelligence sharing agreements are not crimes, they are subject to sanctions from individual countries, including the complete nullification of the information sharing agreements, Zaid said. As a result, the U.S. could be blocked from a range of critical information, from intelligence about terrorists plots to the whereabouts of cyber criminals. And Trump himself could face some personal consequences. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn The Trump presidency: A new era in Washington  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Congress may have the authority to levy the ultimate personal sanction, Aftergood said. Lawmakers could pursue impeachment, should they determine the president's actions to be reckless. "His conduct is not a question for the Justice Department; it's a question for Congress," he said. The standards of how the government handles such matters has differed dramatically with changing administration, according to a 2013 analysis by the Congressional Research Service.

White House still won't say Analysis: Donald Trump has biggest credibility gap of any president since Nixon "The rules governing how best to protect the nation’s secrets, while still insuring that the American public has access to information on the operations of its government, past and present, have shifted along with the political changes in Washington,'' the CRS report stated. "Over the last fifty years, with the exception of the Kennedy Administration, a new executive order on classification was issued each time one of the political parties regained control of the Executive Branch. These have often been at variance with one another ... at times even reversing outright the policies of the previous order.'' Yet few actions by an administration have generated such a strong reaction than that following the disclosure about Trump's meeting this week with the Russians. "If true,'' tweeted Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, "this is a slap in the face to the intel community. Risking sources & methods is inexcusable, particularly with the Russians.'' 2045 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 219 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qlvhSY

Nutanix gets a chance to talk core apps 15 May 2017 at 23:31, Simon Sharwood Nutanix and IBM will announce on Tuesday a new relationship that will see Nutanix build hyperconverged systems out of IBM Power servers – its first non-Intel-powered boxes. Details of what will be delivered, and when, have not yet been revealed. But The Register understands Nutanix will bring its hyperconverged stack to Power systems complete with its software-defined storage play and ability to make private clouds out of Big-Blue-powered servers. IBM's Bluemix public cloud offers Power servers too, so there's potential for a hybrid cloud play too for Power people. Nutanix may also make it possible to consider x86 and Power as a single pool of resources. We understand that the alliance was struck for a few reasons. IBM knows that its Power systems don't have a stellar future. Commodity x86 and the operating systems it can run have mostly caught up to the resilience and scalability of the Power ecosystem. There's little reason to keep running it, other than the fact that many Power systems are tightly coupled to core applications. That tight coupling means Power systems and the apps they run can't easily access public-cloud-like elasticity, or let developers adopt cloud-native tools. Power users also see the elasticity and pay-as-you-go models falling from public clouds and want that in their own data centres. If Power users can't get that from IBM, it makes it more likely they'll consider migrating away from the platform – even if that means the pain of moving a tier-one app. Nutanix has problems of its own. The advent of Dell EMC, with its multiple own-brand hyperconverged products, plus HPE buying SimpliVity, means it now faces rivals with colossal resources, and in Dell's case little reason to continue nourishing a rival. Nutanix is also experiencing lumpy seasonal revenue that has spooked investors. Despite sounding like a breakfast cereal, Nutanix has done very well very fast, but it isn't yet entertained in discussions about core apps inside big enterprises. And those discussions are what every enterprise wants, because once you run a core application the incumbency is very hard to dislodge. An IBM/Nutanix alliance therefore makes sense. IBM gets a way to show Power users they can start to adopt cloudy models, and a way to show investors that the bound-for-legacy-status Power platform has a longer future than might previously have been imagined. Nutanix gets a way to talk to big companies about their core apps, which may cheer up its investors. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments MORE IBM Power Nutanix Hyperconvergence Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register IBM and Cisco have another crack at converged infrastructure UPDATED VersaStack's all about hybrid and/or cloud with software-defined storage now, even if that excludes StorWize IBM, Cisco hop into IoT bed Surprise!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global 450Mm/Copper/Low-K Convergence Timing, Trends, Issues, Market Analysis 2017 – Research and Markets A semiconductor foundry capable of processing 450mm wafers offers a tremendous economy of scale versus facilities working with smaller-diameter wafers, albeit with large startup costs required for the needed wafer-handling equipment. The larger wafers yield more semiconductor die, assuming that good material quality can be maintained across the surface of the larger wafers. As a rough approximation, only about one-half the wafer starts are required for a 450mm wafer facility compared to a 300mm wafer facility to produce the same number of die. ASML, one of the major equipment suppliers to chip factories, recently decided to stop trying to develop a new generation of machines that could handle 450mm wafers. No one is definitively ruling out 450mm, but even Intel agrees that it is on hold until the end of the decade. TSMC is not as vocal as Intel, but the Taiwan foundry giant is still interested in 450mm, as well. Still others believe 450mm fabs could get pushed out to the 2020 to 2025 timeframe. Now that work is on hold, along with the Intel investment in ASML’s 450mm program. Equipment makers need a timely decision in order to move forward with their 450mm tool R&D efforts. This report addresses the timeline of 450mm acceptance based on the different requirements of logic versus memory chips. It also focused on the markets for copper interconnect and low-k dielectric deposition equipment and forecasts.

Blog :  Research Shows Hallmarks of Great Leadership Unchanged over Three Decades Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch AMD’s Lisa Su and the Advantages of a Trained CEO Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 15 May, 2017          |         |     Share We seem to have a lot of problems with corporate governance at the moment, ranging from the lack of experience at the top of the country to revolving disasters at firms like Uber and Yahoo, all showcasing a fundamental lack of experience or maturity or both. It has fascinated me that even after we saw Steve Jobs take Apple off life support and turn it into the most successful company in the world, few boards seem to get the importance of selecting people who have been trained both as CEOs and in the industry in which the firm operates. Jobs is no longer with us but with AMD’s Financial Analyst Day coming up tomorrow, and having gone through at least some of IBM’s Executive Resources program myself, I figured it was a good time to point to AMD CEO Lisa Su’s success, as connected to her unique background and training. Let’s recap AMD’s progress and then talk a bit about the program that helped make Su one of the uniquely successful turnaround CEOs currently in the tech market. AMD’s 2015 FAD I went back to the presentations that I was given back in 2015, only seven months after Su took over as CEO of AMD. She made a number of what seemed like almost impossible promises at the time. Though, perhaps these were less so, once she tripled AMD’s stock price in five months. First, she said she would stabilize the AMD PC business. At the time, this seemed very unlikely. Back then, the market was falling like a rock, largely due to things outside of AMD’s control, but prior decisions in AMD hadn’t helped. Largely due to neglect, branding that removed demand based on obsolescence, and operating mistakes, the PC market in 2015 was in bad shape. On top of this, AMD had flipped like much of the market to the idea that everyone was going to mobile platforms and AMD had defunded its efforts with desktop systems even though Intel was vulnerable. Second, knowing you couldn’t cut out of problems like the ones hurting AMD’s performance, Su promised to focus AMD’s remaining limited resources on enterprise sales and expanding existing embedded and semi-custom business. This had a lot of greenfield opportunity in it, representing a lot of risk, given that ARM in particular was also targeting some of these areas, sales cycles are long, and margins are tight. Third, she promised to improve liquidity, which would require a set of financial skills often not seen in many CEOs with technical backgrounds. In fact, one of the big problems with technical CEOs is that they often fail because they run out of resources to carry out an aggressive agenda. Fourth, she aimed to build a foundation that supports the firm’s growth and assures profitability. If any of the foundational elements above failed, the chance of reaching this last goal would have been very difficult. If more than one failed, it would have been impossible. 2017 AMD Accomplishments With the last set of financial results, AMD has reported (by percentage) four quarters of double-digit growth and continued to report major sales wins in 2015 and 2016. It launched Ryzen, its first truly new processor in years. Coverage, so far, has suggested the market was unusually excited about what was a desktop PC processor initially. Revenue increased from $532M to $593M over the time period, and it is currently setting up for the release of Vega, a new PC GPU. As promised, AMD increased its investment in the enterprise and semi-custom business, though, because enterprise is a very long lead, that hasn’t paid financial dividends yet. Still, AMD’s “Naples” high-performance processor does have the OEMs excited, but we won’t know until later in the year whether that excitement leads to success. Refreshes on the Xbox and PlayStation around AMD’s technology and the coming Microsoft “Project Scorpio” showcase that the AMD Semi-Custom business has also become more successful. On liquidity, AMD’s cash position has improved and it has dropped its debt significantly from $2.27B to $1.4B. This improvement in income statement and balance sheet is unusual, as many CEOs tend to favor income statements and forget the balance sheet. With the exception of enterprise, which is still setting a foundation for recovery but not yet a financial benefit, Su has fully executed on all her promises. Her success largely helped her become one of the 50 most powerful women in technology this year.  We should have seen this coming, given that MIT recognized Su as one of the top innovators back in 2002 while she was at IBM. IBM Executive Resources One of the things that the Watsons put in place at IBM was a process to assure its survival. Part of that process is to identify potential early in a person’s career and then set them up with mentors so that there is a deep pool of experience underneath each of the eventual CEO candidates. With one exception, IBM has always promoted from inside, and the combination of this mentoring and training has allowed IBM to not only survive for over a century but often dominate the markets it is in. Now, not all IBM executives make it through all parts of the program, but when executed well, they receive training from the best in the business, serve as aides to the CEO (Su served as an aide to Louis Gerstner, the only outside hired CEO and also a turnaround expert), and gain the breadth that most CEO candidates lack when they first become CEO. It is interesting to note that many of the positions Su held were strategic positions. This is because one of the biggest problems with current CEOs is their tendency to focus excessively on tactical quarterly goals. Even Su’s CEO mentor Louis Gerstner, had issues with the idea of a “vision,” something that Su learned needed to be addressed, and did address early on (likely because she saw how that lack of “vision” hurt Gerstner’s execution). It isn’t either-or in terms of execution and vision; you need both. The vision tells you where you need to go, and the execution gets you there. It is like having a map; without it, driving faster can take you farther from your destination. Wrapping Up: The Value of Training and Experience One of the big problems with companies and turnaround CEOs is that the CEOs tend to lack depth and breadth of experience. This tends to force them down a tactical path where they mostly use executive decisions to artificially raise stock price as they kill the firm’s revenue stream and run up debt or equity, eventually screwing the stockholders. Su is one of the exceptions we should learn from to help build a better pool of CEOs. Her background, training and mentoring created the foundation for how she laid out her plan “vision” and how she executed against it. She was also able to maintain staff stability and loyalty because unlike many new CEOs, she knew it wasn’t all about her and gave her team the credit and support they needed as well. (It continues to surprise me how many CEOs think the job is mostly about self-aggrandizement and fail because they didn’t build staff loyalty and support.) In the end, in the face of a lot of bad examples, it is nice to have a good one stand out. Su is one of the good ones, but we should never forget that this wasn’t a lucky accident. She, as with most successful CEOs, is the result of a program that assured her own quality and taught her to assure the quality of her people and firm.

The Dell Inspiron 24 7000 is the company's attempt to challenge the likes of the Microsoft Surface Studio and Apple's premium iMacs in the growing all-in-one PC market, which combines everything you'd want in a computer into a single model. Design Make no mistake, the Inspiron 24 7000 is striking. The 23.8in FullHD display catches the eye from the minute you open the box, offering a true wide-screen experience - although there are some seriously large bezels present. The PC is also super thin, at just 1.06in across, and thanks to its movable hinge, the display can be tilted to a number of angles, right down to lying flat on its back. This flexibility means that the display isn't able to rise up too high, meaning you might need to invest in a separate screen stand unless you want to get a cricked neck. All the main components are contained within the base of the display, which packs in the device's hardware, as well as a surprisingly powerful speaker. With its metal and black plastic design, this is hardly the most attractive unit, but the angle of the screen means that you won't really notice it when in use. Specifications CPU: 3.20GHz 6th Generation Intel quad-core i5-6300HQ with 6M Cache Graphics: Intel HD Graphics RAM: 12GB 2133MHz DDR4 Screen: 23.8-in FullHD IPS 1920 x 1080 display Storage: 1TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive Optical Drive: Ports: 2x USB 2.0, 4x USB 3.0, RJ45 Ethernet Port, HDMI in, HDMI out Connectivity: Intel Single Band Wireless-AC 3165, Bluetooth 4.0 Camera: Intel RealSense 3D camera Weight: 9.46kg (20.86 pounds) Size: 22.95in x 1.06in x 14.21in (W x D x H) Overall, the Dell Inspiron 24 7000 offers a decent set of specifications, but nothing much more than that. There's also six USB ports, two USB 2.0 and four USB 3.0, along with ports for HDMI, ethernet and MCR, meaning the Inspiron 24 7000 is easy to hook up and connect to all your other devices. Inside, there's Windows 10 Home, meaning that all your favourite Microsoft Office programs are present and correct, making it ideal for home and office working. These specs put the Inspiron 24 7000 ahead of the lowest-priced iMac offerings, with an equivalent Apple device setting you back £1,749 - far more than £949 for Dell's device. As for Microsoft's Surface Studio, the equivalent model with hardware similiar to the Inspiron 24 7000 will cost $2,999 (around £2,326) meaning that if you are strapped for budget, Dell's device could be everything you're looking for. In use ATTO: 32MB Write 105544; Read 102066 Cinebench R15 Single Core: 416cb Cinebench R15 OpenGL: 59.63fps Geek bench 4 Single Core: 3,809; Multi Core: 10,649; Compute OpenCL: 16,588 NovaBench (Overall): 850; Graphics: 98 Passmark (Overall): 1892.2; CPU 6432.4; 3D Graphics 990.3 The Inspiron 24 7000 offers some fairly decent power, given its price range. The above tests show that the device was able to take on some of its more powerful competitors, outscoring the Microsoft Surface Studio on both GeekBench tests. It also out-performs the equivalent-sized Apple iMac, released back in early 2016, which scored lower on Novabench's tests, with Dell's device coming in 70 per cent faster thanks to its integrated IntelHD GPU. The version we used came with an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor, but the device is also available with a more powerful Intel Core i7. This boosted version also comes with embedded Nvidia graphics, instead of Intel hardware, as well as more RAM and storage - but you'll of course have to pay more for this privilege. Overall, though, the standard edition is more than enough to handle the vast majority of everyday work tasks, and also means that the device boots up quickly, with that huge 12GB of RAM doing wonders for speed and performance. Verdict Given its attractive design, it's a relief to also know that the Inspiron 24 7000 is easy to use and set up - just unpack the PC out of the box and plug it in to get started. Dell is obviously targeting creative industries, with the flexible display useful if you work in media or graphic design, however this is by no means a portable device, with the unit weighing in at just under 10kg.  The super-wide screen is also ideal for those who need multiple windows or programs open at the same time, allowing for a much less crowded display that lets you stay on top of everything. Overall, the Inspiron 24 7000 is a very attractive proposition if you need a Windows-powered all-in-one. We liked The Dell Inspiron 24 7000 is a striking-looking device, but it's not just a pretty face. Inside is a powerful set of components for a decent price. That wide screen should be a major plus point for anyone looking to get a new perspective on their work, with a useful amount of connectivity and compactness. We disliked The Inspiron 24 7000 lacks that last bit of polish - much like many of Dell's products, this is missing that extra bit of sparkle that its competitors could provide. The same goes for the hardware inside, which is good, but not great - and may be a deal-breaker if you are a heavy PC user. Final verdict With a screen like this, the Inspiron 24 7000 could be a valuable addition to your office - if you've got the room to squeeze it in. Although it lacks the high street appeal of Microsoft's Surface Studio, or the power of Apple's iMac, for the price on offer, the Dell Inspiron 24 7000 is a good all-round device for your home or office. Featuring a good blend of value, power and usability, Dell has made encouraging progress with its all-in-one PCs - now it's time for the company to take this forward.

Photo: Wee Teck Hian/TODAY mail print View all comments Tweet By Angela Teng - angelateng@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 4:00 AM, May 16, 2017 Updated: 10:57 AM, May 16, 2017 SINGAPORE — AEM Holdings’ chairman Loke Wai San is very positive about the growth prospects for the company, on the back of the adoption of new equipment and the tech sector rebound boosting demand for semiconductors. Mainboard-listed AEM designs and builds high-density semiconductor test handlers used by the world’s leading chip manufacturers. “We do believe that the semiconductor industry is in for a multi-year expansion,” said Mr Loke, in an exclusive interview with TODAY. “It’s not only the emerging markets that are adopting technology, it’s the first-world economies that are automating through robots and artificial intelligence, and big data analytics that are driving new ways of doing business,” he said. Semiconductor manufacturing output expanded by 50.3 per cent year-on-year for the first three months of this year, supporting total manufacturing output growth of 8 per cent in the first quarter, showed data from the Economic Development Board (EDB) last month. The semiconductor segment takes up 17 per cent stake in the overall manufacturing basket. The growth seen by AEM in recent months is partly attributable to the company’s next generation high density automated test handler, said Mr Loke. The new equipment is a research and development product created with its “key client”, which supports over 80 per cent of the group’s revenue. The surge in orders has been driving AEM’s financial performance over the last few months. While Mr Loke declined to reveal who AEM’s key customer is, research reports from banks have linked the company to semiconductor giant Intel. AEM’s order book has more than tripled over the last few months. The company which reported a revenue of S$42.1 million in the first quarter, expects to achieve at least S$142 million in revenue for the first nine months. The stellar report card has contributed to a spike in the company’s shares after its quarterly earnings result announcement last month. The stock had soared by about 80 per cent last month, achieving a high of S$2.65. The shares closed at S$2.48 on Monday, bringing the year-to-date return on the stock to 333 per cent, according to Bloomberg. CIMB is bullish on the stock, giving it a target price of S$3.39, saying that the company’s “journey is just beginning” and “on track for a multi-year ramp”. It seems the dark clouds that once loomed over the company have since passed. Founded in 1990 and listed 10 years later, the business has seen a reversal of fortunes in the past few years. It was once held under scrutiny by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, with leaders of the company charged with bribery and immigration offences. The management has since been overhauled, but the company lost key accounts and undertook staff retrenchments. Mr Loke joined the company in 2011. He is founder and managing director of private equity fund Novo Tellus Capital Partners and has steered the company around since taking charge. AEM went through major restructuring, such as the closing down of a non-profitable business. Even back then, Mr Loke had already saw the potential of the firm despite the odds against it. “Our view back then was this company was supplying handlers to the world’s top semiconductor company, which is a very difficult account to break into, and yet (this Singapore company) has been doing it for many, many years. That, to me, was an unrealised value,” he said. “To be able to dance with the best, you have to be a pretty good dancer. We have been able to ‘tango’ with them, to develop pretty much the world’s most sophisticated test handler to meet their needs, good enough for them to adopt globally,” said Mr Loke. The company is bullish about its future. It looks to expand its capacity in space and hiring. AEM has about 330 staff, and has plans to take on 50 to 70 engineering and production workers by the end of the year. The role of manufacturing in Singapore is key, as long as Singapore wants to be innovative, shared Mr Loke. “Manufacturing is important for any country that wants to be considered innovative. At the end of the day, if you are in the business of producing goods and services and you want to be innovative you do need manufacturing for a very quick feedback cycle,” he said. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “Tech with Heart” scheme to empower start-ups with social innovation focus “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble Workers say Wal-Mart discriminated against thousands of pregnant women With eye on millennials, Coach buys Kate Spade Whole Foods names new CFO, directors Whole Foods in board shake-up amid investor pressure: source Whole Foods board overhaul fails to satisfy activist Jana: source Western Digital takes legal action to block sale of Toshiba's chip unit Wells Fargo eyes return to mortgage deals shunned since crisis Wells Fargo doubles cost-cut goal but offers soft revenue outlook Wells Fargo bogus accounts balloon to 3.5 million: lawyers Wealth investments paying off for Singapore’s three big banks Inside Today World Duterte says Turkey, Mongolia could join Asean Asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea fear they will be put at risk by relocation Researchers say global cyber attack similar to North Korean hacks Ransomware attack again thrusts U.S. spy agency into unwanted spotlight Arab TV series dramatises life under IS Business Researchers say global cyber attack similar to North Korean hacks Ransomware attack again thrusts U.S. spy agency into unwanted spotlight Absent from America, French cars drive into Iran election U.S. home appliances shipments rise 13.7 percent year-on-year in April Asia stocks at two-year highs, look pricey; oil climbs Sports I’d have been sacked at ‘big club’, says Man City boss Guardiola Dream start for Andrew Tang in China GT C’ship Sorry, Home, but we’re going to the final, says Global Decimated Home counting on squad players to step up in AFC semis clash Malaysia hires Portuguese Nelo Vingada as new football head coach Entertainment Arab TV series dramatises life under IS Zac Efron to star as serial killer Ted Bundy in new movie﻿ Mandopop singer Show Luo to perform in S’pore on Aug 12 Foo Fighters to perform at National Stadium on Aug 26 Disney blackmailed over apparent movie hack: Reports About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 © Mediacorp Press Ltd.

MORE precipitously dismissed FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday because “it is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.” Regardless of whether the president appropriately fired Comey, Trump must expeditiously nominate and the Senate should promptly confirm an exceptional replacement. The institution and smooth execution of expert, open, fair and swift nomination and confirmation processes are essential to “public trust and confidence” in the FBI and the president. ADVERTISEMENT The statute which creates the office of FBI director and the term of service provides guidance on filling that office. Congress grants the director extraordinary powers to investigate potential federal law violations and a ten-year term, which accord the director insulation from political pressures and independence from the president and lawmakers, who nominate and confirm the director.   The president can most effectively discharge his solemn nomination responsibility by seeking broad input and assiduously consulting Congress, especially the Senate which must provide advice and consent.  The president should promptly seek recommendations on the nomination process and specific candidates from Congress’ members.

The attendees should comprehensively, candidly and confidentially ventilate all issues relevant to the nomination and discuss candidates qualified to direct the FBI. The president should quickly narrow the field of candidates and perhaps selectively broach these prospects with some attendees. The criteria for selection must be excellence, experience in law enforcement and independence.  Examples of the type of people Trump should nominate include former directors Louis Freeh and Robert Mueller. Once the president secures comprehensive input on candidates, he must carefully review those ideas and astutely nominate the best individual who satisfies the criteria.  When Trump announces the nominee, he should thoroughly explain the reasons for selection. Upon receipt of the nomination, the Senate must assertively fulfill its advice and consent role. Complete, swift and fair assessment is critical, particularly because President Trump may have conflicts of interest, especially regarding the FBI investigation of Russia’s interference in the U.S. elections and its possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Judiciary Chairman Grassley must rapidly, fully and equitably investigate the nominee by helping the FBI conduct a background check. The chairman then should expeditiously convene a hearing. Members must thoroughly, rigorously and fairly question the nominee.  Senators ought to guarantee that the nominee possesses superior qualifications, including complete independence, to discharge the Director’s critical responsibilities, especially leading the Russia probe, unless a special prosecutor or select committee is appointed. Soon after the hearing, Grassley must schedule a full, robust and fair discussion of the nominee and a vote. If the committee approves the nominee, Majority Leader McConnell must rapidly arrange a comprehensive and fair Senate debate, which rigorously ventilates all relevant issues. McConnell next should conduct a ballot. President Trump and the Senate must aggressively cooperate to ensure that the individual appointed FBI Director has the finest qualifications to discharge the office’s crucial responsibilities and the maximum independence.  The president and senators can best guarantee public confidence in the new director and the FBI by following efficacious selection procedures.  Carl Tobias is the Williams Chair in Law at the University of Richmond.

And it’s not just the president’s domestic economic policies that are generating optimism,” he said. Corning Glass, one of Apple’s US-based suppliers, was announced on Friday as the first recipient of funds from the program. It will be awarded $200 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the Advanced Manufacturing Fund in early May during an appearance on CNBC’s Mad Money; he made no mention of it being influenced by or created as a result of President Trump’s policies, however. Apple says the $1 billion program “is designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the US.” The company has recently been doing more to promote its record of job creation in the United States. Apple has never said the fund was shaped by Trump’s agenda When questioned on Apple’s relationship with Trump, Cook at one point mentioned his company’s strong disapproval of Trump’s immigration orders, which have been challenged by US courts. “With each administration, in every country in the world, there are things [where] you disagree and things [where] you agree. And you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don't. If you don't show up, I think that's the worst scenario. Because then you're quiet and this doesn't do your cause any good, or your point of view any good.” During the interview, Cook again expressed hope that the government will soon enact sweeping tax policy reforms. The $1 billion fund could be one way for Apple to win leverage in Washington as Trump works to advance his proposals. Spicer highlighted Apple’s announcement just moments after Tom Bossert, Trump’s Homeland Security advisor, began the press briefing with an update on the massive WannaCry ransomware attack that has sprung up around the world. That attack utilizes an exploit believed to have been developed by the NSA. Microsoft has since voiced its frustration with governments for “stockpiling” vulnerabilities for their own interests. Many have viewed the WannaCry catastrophe as evidence that Apple made the right decision when the company found itself at odds with the FBI and Obama administration over encryption last year. At the time, Tim Cook argued that helping law enforcement break the security protections of iOS “could expose people to incredible vulnerabilities.” The encryption debate could potentially be revived under President Trump’s administration. “This is not something that we would create. This would be bad for America,” Cook said. Donald Trump, then still a candidate, encouraged a boycott of Apple products until the company complied with assisting the FBI. The Verge has reached out to Apple for comment on whether the Advanced Manufacturing Fund is an outcome of Trump’s policies, as Spicer suggested. The president has been criticized for taking credit for economic deals first announced during Barack Obama’s presidency; companies like Intel have also been less than honest in their publicity and messaging.

(MU) Stock Will Gain 21% Recent Posts: Why Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Will Gain 21% 3 Under-the-Radar Tech Stocks to Buy Before Investors Wisen Up Turnaround in Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Anything but Certain View All Posts The downgrade of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) by Goldman Sachs is not looking very good now. It’s an unusual call, considering MU stock trades at a steeply discounted forward price-earnings ratio of 5.6. Not to mention Micron’s profit margins have surged due to a NAND shortage and the industry is showing no signs of the limited supplying moderating. Source: Shutterstock And as newer and faster computer parts from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) come to market, demand for DDR4 will go up with it. In the storage space, solid state drive demand will increase as consumers and businesses opt for its inclusion over mechanical hard disks. AI appliances also need fast storage and plenty of memory. The increased demand, I believe, is enough to push Micron to $35 per share, roughly a 21% increase from today’s perch. Micron’s Strong Quarterly Results In the second quarter, Micron reported revenue soaring 58.7% year-over-year to $4.65 billion. Gross margin stood at a healthy 38.5%, almost doubling last year’s level of 20.4%. For the current (third) quarter, the company forecast revenue of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion, easily surpassing the consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. The company’s cost-cutting measures are adding to results. MU’s transition in manufacturing at the 20nm DRAM capability is benefiting the company, as the market’s favorable conditions are helping selling prices for DRAM. Prices rose 21% from the last quarter and will likely continue. For what it’s worth, no memory supplier has plans to lift output high enough to put a lid on prices. Development of 3D XPoint Looking ahead, Micron’s developments in 3D XPoint will solidify the company’s moat in memory technology. Neither Hynix nor Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) have an answer to Xpoint. When it is released, expect profit margins getting a strong lift. Xpoint is not the only new market for the company. IoT markets are getting bigger and Micron’s components are at the center of it. Valuations Since Micron has clear profit growth ahead, assume annual revenue growth of between 10% to 15% for the next five years: Fiscal Years Ending 16-Aug 17-Aug 18-Aug 19-Aug 20-Aug 21-Aug Revenue 12,399 14,259 15,685 17,253 18,979 19,927 % Growth -23.40% 15.00% 10.00% 10.00% 10.00% 5.00% Ebitda 3,274 4,705 3,137 4,313 5,694 5,978 % of Revenue 26.40% 33.00% 20.00% 25.00% 30.00% 30.00% Source: finbox.io (click here to input your own assumptions) Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/05/why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-will-gain-21/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace The 10 Best Stocks for a “Set It and Forget It” Summer Portfolio 3 Retail Stocks to Buy Before Earnings Send Them to the Moon 7 Gold Stocks Under $7 Set to Shine in 2017 Amazon Stock Simply Cannot Be Stopped Can Sears Stock Even Stay Above $5? 5 Stock Picks That Buffett Has Blown ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks The 10 Best Stocks for a “Set It and Forget It” Summer Portfolio 3 Retail Stocks to Buy Before Earnings Send Them to the Moon 7 Gold Stocks Under $7 That Could Glitter This Year 7 Dogs of the Dow to Trade Now for Income 3 Solar Stocks That Are Sizzling Trades Right Now Most Popular 5 Top Dividend Stocks From Across the Globe 7 Stocks That Will Get Crushed in the Next Crash The 7 Best REITs You Must Buy Right Now! 10 Dividend Aristocrats That Are Ready to Rally 3 Cash-Rich Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever 7 Stocks to Buy Now for BIG Summer Outperformance Poll of the Day View and vote in our Will Snap beat expectations in its first quarterly report? poll Partners ADVERTISEMENT About Us   ·   Press Center   ·   Resources   ·   Advisory Services   ·   Free Newsletters   ·   Free Reports   ·   Contact Us   ·   Advertise With Us   ·   Employment   ·   Privacy   ·   Terms and Conditions   ·   Disclosures and Disclaimers   ·   Media Sites RSS   ·   Sitemap More On InvestorPlace: Choose A Page About Us Press Center Resources Advisory Services Free Newsletters Free Reports Contact Us Advertise With Us Employment Privacy Terms and Conditions Disclosures and Disclaimers Media Sites Sitemap Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Worldwide Semiconductor Revenue Grew 2.6 Percent in 2016, According to Final Results by Gartner Printer-friendly version Worldwide semiconductor revenue totaled $343.5 billion in 2016, a 2.6 percent increase from 2015 revenue of $334.9 billion, according to final results by Gartner, Inc. The top 25 semiconductor vendors’ combined revenue increased 10.5 percent, a significantly better performance than the overall industry’s growth; however, most of this growth resulted from merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. „The semiconductor industry rebounded in 2016, with a weak start to the year, characterized by inventory correction, giving way to strengthening demand and an improving pricing environment in the second half,” said James Hines research director at Gartner. „Worldwide semiconductor revenue growth was supported by increasing production in many electronic equipment segments, improving NAND flash memory pricing and relatively benign currency movements.” Intel retained its No. 1 position as the largest semiconductor manufacturer and grew its semiconductor revenue 4.6 percent in 2016 (see Table 1). Samsung Electronics continued to maintain the No. 2 spot with 11.7 percent market share. Table 1.

Merger and acquisition activity among the major vendors in 2016 included Avago Technologies’ acquisition of Broadcom Corp. to become Broadcom Ltd., On Semiconductor’s acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor, and Western Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk. The largest mover in the top 25 was Broadcom Ltd., which moved up 12 places in the market share ranking. „The combined revenue of the top 25 semiconductor vendors increased by 10.5 percent during 2016 and accounted for a 74.9 percent share, outperforming the rest of the market, which saw a 15.6 percent revenue decline,” said Mr. Hines. „However, these results are skewed by the large amount of M&A activity during 2015 and 2016. If we adjust for this M&A activity by adding the revenue of each acquired company to the revenue of the acquirer for both 2015 and 2016 where necessary, then the top 25 vendors would have experienced a 1.9 percent revenue increase, and the rest of the market would have increased by 4.6 percent.” Copy this html code to your website/blog to embed this press release. <br />

Comey, lawmakers of both political parties on May 14 said Trump ought to release any recordings that may exist. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) THE MORNING PLUM: A few Republican senators heroically ventured on to the Sunday shows to profess deep concern about President Trump’s abrupt firing of the man overseeing the investigation into the small matter of whether his campaign colluded with a foreign power to undermine our democracy. Meanwhile, the New York Times assures us that GOP senators are “increasingly unnerved” by Trump’s “volatility” and are “starting to show signs of breaking away from him.” That’s nice. But until GOP lawmakers support a full and independent probe into the Russia affair — not to mention real oversight of all the other ways in which Trump is shredding our democratic norms — they are essentially complicit in his ongoing abuses of power. Can this go on forever? Maybe not. Here’s why: ABC News is now reporting that associates of the fired former FBI director, James B. Comey, say he wants to testify publicly before Congress, and the Senate Intelligence Committee — which is probing the Russia story — seems like the right venue. Among other things, Comey will almost certainly address explosive but disputed reports over whether Trump demanded loyalty from him during a private dinner in January, as Comey’s associates have claimed. Ron Wyden, a hard-charging member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, intends to use this moment to press Comey to detail what exactly happened in this exchange, a spokesman for the Oregon Democrat says. “If and when Comey testifies, Senator Wyden will ask him if Donald Trump demanded a loyalty pledge,” Wyden spokesman Keith Chu told me this morning. If Comey asserts in public that Trump did demand loyalty from him — which is plausible — consider what could happen then. Trump responded to initial reports of that demand with a threatening tweet that implied Trump may have been taping private conversations. If Comey goes public, the pressure on the White House to release these tapes — or admit they don’t exist — should intensify. Republican lawmakers — who already expressed discomfort with the firing and with Trump’s threat — will now be expected to comment about Comey’s on-the-record assertion that the president demanded a loyalty pledge from him. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said President Trump has "nothing further to add" to his tweets suggesting "tapes" of his dinner conversation with former FBI director James Comey. "That's not a threat," he said at the press briefing on May 12. (Reuters) Some legal experts have suggested such a loyalty demand could constitute obstruction of justice. It isn’t just that FBI directors (who serve insulating 10-year terms) aren’t supposed to be political loyalists. It’s also that Trump would have demanded loyalty from the man overseeing the FBI probe into his own campaign, even as that man (Comey) knew full well that Trump has the power to fire him, which Trump has now exercised, explicitly because of Comey’s handling of the investigation. This undermines basic norms dictating a clear separation between the White House and law enforcement and raises doubts as to whether the FBI’s investigation can proceed free of political interference. A serious probe of this whole affair by an independent commission or similar would look not just at possible Russia-Trump campaign collusion. It would also seek to establish whether Trump demanded Comey’s loyalty. It would seek a full accounting of Trump’s decision to fire Comey, and what sort of role Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, played in carrying that out. That latter question matters, since Sessions was supposed to recuse himself from the investigation, and any role Rosenstein played in the political hatcheting of Comey could compromise his role in overseeing the continuing FBI probe. But some GOP leaders continue to resist this full accounting. The other day, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) responded to the Comey firing by claiming: “I’m focusing on what’s in my control, and that is what is Congress doing to solve people’s problems.” As Brian Beutler aptly points out, by saying the Comey firing is not in “his control,” Ryan is actually “denuding himself” of the congressional GOP’s oversight power and responsibilities: What Ryan has done is surrender his own fundamental powers to Trump, knowing that people he likes and respects are telling reporters that Trump’s presence in the White House terrifies them. Indeed, Trump may take this as a sign that Republicans will not exercise any meaningful oversight even if the revelations grow worse. The larger pattern here is crucial to appreciate. Trump is constantly trying to probe what abuses our institutions will let him get away with, whether it’s the in-your-face use of important diplomatic business to promote Mar-a-Lago and steer cash into his own pockets; the refusal to release his tax returns while advancing a tax plan that could deliver him and his family an enormous windfall; the constant lies about millions voting illegally in our election, which undermine public confidence in our democracy, and which he will now try to legitimize with a “voter fraud” commission; and, now, the firing of Comey. Republicans have tolerated (or even embraced) all of these things, and Trump would be reasonable in concluding that they have no intention of ever mounting a check on his power, no matter what he does. The question is whether a dramatic moment from Comey — in which he asserts that the president did, in fact, demand his loyalty — is enough to change this. * ANOTHER POLL FINDS TRUMP’S APPROVAL IN THE TOILET: A new NBC News-WSJ poll finds Trump’s approval at 39-54. Note these numbers on the firing of James Comey and the GOP health bill: Asked whether Mr. Trump fired the FBI director to slow down the agency’s investigation into Russian meddling in the election, 46% said that was the case, while 36% disagreed … Some 23% said the GOP health-care legislation was a good idea, while 48% said it was a bad idea. So pluralities think that Trump is interfering with the Russia probe and reject his repeal-and-replace push. * CLAPPER: OUR DEMOCRACY IS UNDER ASSAULT ‘INTERNALLY’: ON CNN’s “State of the Union,” former director of National Intelligence James Clapper flatly stated that our institutions are under attack from within: “In many ways, our institutions are under assault, both externally — and that’s the big news here, is the Russian interference in our election system — and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally … the founding fathers, in their genius, created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances. And I feel as though that’s under assault and is eroding.” Asked directly whether he meant “internally from the president,” Clapper responded: “Exactly.” * DEMOCRATIC RECRUITMENT LOOKS STRONG: National Journal reports that a number of strong candidates are gearing up to challenge House Republicans, and notes that GOP efforts to recruit candidates against vulnerable Democrats is faltering. As one GOP strategist put it: “The en­vir­on­ment is really bad for Re­pub­lic­ans right now, and that will weigh heav­ily for any­one con­sid­er­ing any race. The one thing that Re­pub­lic­ans can con­trol is the qual­ity of their can­did­ates and qual­ity of cam­paigns be­ing run. Right now, neither are ad­equate.” If Trump’s numbers keep sliding, and the revelations (and all around craziness) around the Russia probe continue, look for this trend to intensify. * TRUMP’S ‘MUSLIM BAN’ IS BACK IN COURT: Bloomberg reports that government lawyers today will try to persuade the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court’s decision to block the second version of Trump’s travel ban: At the heart of the legal arguments is the question of whether Trump’s comments as a candidate can be used as evidence that his travel order was founded on religious bias, in violation of the First Amendment … The Justice Department argues that his remarks as a candidate aren’t relevant to his actions as president. Until last week, the Trump campaign website included language promising a ban on Muslim immigrants. The crux is whether the ban is discriminatory in intent and effect, and whether Trump’s own words prove legally decisive, we all know perfectly well what its goal really is. * GOP PLANS HUGE CUTS TO PROGRAMS FOR POOR: Politico reports that House Republicans are quietly looking for ways to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from programs that help the poor, such as food stamps. Note this, on Medicare: Atop that, GOP budget writers will also likely include Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) proposal to essentially privatize Medicare in their fiscal 2018 budget, despite Trump’s unwavering rejection of the idea. While that proposal is more symbolic and won’t become law under this budget, it’s just another thorny issue that will have Democrats again accusing Republicans of “pushing Granny off the cliff.” If there’s anything that might get Trump voters to finally figure out how badly they’ve been scammed, it might be a broken promise not to cut Medicare. * TRUMP IS BOTH AUTHORITARIAN AND INCOMPETENT: E.J. Dionne Jr. points out that we have been debating whether the real threat from Trump is his authoritarianism or his incompetence, and notes that the Comey firing has reminded us of the seriousness of the former: Last week, the argument took a sharp, decisive and chilling turn. Trump proved that we can never be lulled into losing focus on the ways he could undermine the rules and principles of our democratic republic …  Of course, Trump can be fairly regarded as both incompetent and authoritarian. We may be saved by the fact that the feckless Trump is often the authoritarian Trump’s worst enemy. If we’re lucky, Trump’s astonishing indiscipline will be his undoing. Of course, even if Trump’s incompetence and indiscipline do prove to be his undoing, they could do incalculable damage to the country in the process. * AND THE TRUMPIAN ANECDOTE OF THE DAY, WE-ARE-ALL-DOOMED EDITION: Shane Goldmacher brings us this doozy: K.T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser, [gave] Trump a printout of two Time magazine covers. One, supposedly from the 1970s, warned of a coming ice age; the other, from 2008, about surviving global warming, according to four White House officials familiar with the matter. Trump quickly got lathered up about the media’s hypocrisy. But there was a problem. The 1970s cover was fake, part of an Internet hoax that’s circulated for years. Staff chased down the truth and intervened before Trump tweeted or talked publicly about it. Good to see those White House staffers are on the case! But it would be nice if they would also consider trying to persuade Trump that climate change is real. A lot is riding on that, you know.   opinions plum-line Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Probably not but, just a week after word went out on how the Chromebook Pro is long overdue, the Chromebook Pro finally goes on pre-order, with a shipping date set for the end of the month. But while that does indeed seem to be good news, the issues that supposedly caused the delay in the first place still casts a cloud of doubt over what is set to be the most premium Chromebook to date. Hardware-wise, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a dream come true for a Chromebook fan. Power-efficient Intel Core m3, high-resolution 2400×1600 12.3-inch screen, 360-degree foldable design, Wacom-powered “PEN”. In short, it’s the ultimate Chromebook productivity machine. If the Chromebook Pro were just that, we could stop there. But there has to be something more to this $550 device. Indeed, Samsung and Google bill this convertible as the fusion of Chrome OS and Android, the reference device, so to speak, of how Android apps are to run on Chrome OS. But that particular feature is the biggest question mark so far. Chrome Unboxed, for example, notes that Chrome OS 59 won’t be coming until mid-June, perhaps later. That version of Chrome OS is expected to update the Android support to Nougat, which is critical in improving the performance and behavior of Android apps on Chrome OS. With a May 28 shipping day, that means that pre-orders of the Chromebook Pro will be receiving a device that still has to be updated in a few weeks. More importantly, it means they will be receiving a device that might not be putting its best foot forward. At a time when Microsoft is making a huge grab for the education market with Windows 10 S, it’s not a misstep that Google and its Chromebook partners can afford.

More information about AMD's unreleased (and unannounced) enthusiast-grade Ryzen processors is coming to light. Hot on the heels of learning that AMD is prepping a monstrous Ryzen chip with 16 physical cores and 32 threads, the latest rumor is that the processor will be compatible with a modified version of AMD's SP3 server socket for its forthcoming Naples processor lineup. Naples is what AMD will use to infiltrate the data center market, which has been lucrative for Intel. Those processors will slip into a socket with 4,094 pins. Likewise, AMD's consumer-oriented enthusiasts processors based on Ryzen will also feature a socket with 4,094 pins dubbed SP3r2. But while it will have the same physical specifications and pin count as SP3, they will differ in maximum thermal design power. Here is a look at the two side-by-side...  In addition to thermal differences, SP3r2 will only be offered in single-socket form, whereas SP3 motherboards will have dual-sockets for running multiple server CPUs at the same time. The other thing we learned is that AMD's enthusiast Ryzen CPUs will be called ThreadRipper, an apt designation considering what we already know about Ryzen's multi-threaded performance. Whitehaven refers to the platform, which will support quad-channel DDR4 memory. It will also have more PCI-Express lanes to play with, which comes in handy when utilizing multiple graphics cards and/or those newfangled M.2 NVMe solid state drives that tap into the PCIe bus. It is shaping up to be an interesting summer. On top of an enthusiast offering from AMD, Intel is readying a new generation of high-end processors, Skylake-X and Kaby Lake X. These will be branded as "Core i9," a new tier that sits atop Core i7. And in addition to all that, new GPU architectures from AMD (Vega) and NVIDIA (Volta) are in the pipeline.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Intellinetics, Inc. Reports First Quarter Results COLUMBUS, Ohio–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Intellinetics, Inc. (OTCQB: INLX), a cloud-based document solutions provider, announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Q1 Key Metrics Software as a Service Revenue increased 20% Total Revenue increased 18% Slight Net Loss improvement and Adjusted EBITDA erosion – a result of sales and marketing investments to support and execute our channel expansion Summary – Q1 Results Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $710,394, as compared with $603,391 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $107,003, or 18%. Sales of Software as a Service (SaaS) growth was 20%, with new customers partially offset by a price reduction for a key channel partner. Overall, gross margins were 71% for each of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Net loss was $(448,709) and $(535,765) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, or $(0.03) and $(0.03) per share, respectively, representing a decrease of $87,056, or 16%. Total decrease in net loss was attributable to the increase in gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months was $(173,566), compared with a loss of $(112,875) for last year, a 54% increase. Matthew L. Chretien, President and CEO of Intellinetics, stated, “In Q1 we took another step forward in revenue growth while taking major steps to advance relationships with several strategic partners across multiple sales channels. We expect that these relationships will soon reflect the successful execution of our business plan as these new channels generate revenue beginning in Q2 and beyond.” First Quarter Highlights In January, our convertible debt financing round of $1.25M to support our expected rapid growth was fully subscribed. Continued to grow total revenues quarter-over-quarter sequentially from Q1 2016. Accelerated our relationship with technology-based partner Field2Base, announced earlier this month, and integrated our technology with their mobile solution.

We focused on growing new revenue streams through additional technology-based partners that have leading cloud-based platforms with large and growing installation bases. This new OEM / Embedded channel segment embeds the sale of IntelliCloud into an existing product vs. as a separate / standalone process.

Cautionary Statement Statements in this press release which are not purely historical, including statements regarding future business and new revenues associated with any channel partner, distribution partner, or other reseller; Intellinetics’ future revenues and growth in Q2 2017 and beyond; market penetration; execution of our business plan; and other intentions, beliefs, expectations, representations, projections, plans or strategies regarding future growth, financial results, and other future events are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the effect of changing economic conditions, trends in the products markets, variations in the company’s cash flow or adequacy of capital resources, market acceptance risks, the success of Intellinetics’ channel partners and distribution partners, technical development risks, and other risks and uncertainties discussed in Intellinetics’ most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks. Intellinetics cautions investors not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Intellinetics disclaims any obligation and does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements in this press release. Expanded and historical information is made available to the public by Intellinetics on its website or at www.intellinetics.com or at www.sec.gov. Non-GAAP Financial Measure Intellinetics uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. Intellinetics urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP Net Loss, which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Intellinetics’ financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, any income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation, note conversion warrant expense and other financing related transaction costs.   Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017   2016 Net Loss – GAAP ($448,709) ($535,765) Interest expense, net 132,803 138,668 Depreciation and Amortization 3,006 2,956 Share-based compensation 86,383 129,693 Note conversion/issuance warrant expense 52,951 137,970 Note conversion underwriting expense – 13,603 Adjusted EBITDA ($173,566) ($112,875)   INTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)     For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016   Revenues: Sale of software $162,984 $90,874 Software as a Service 132,308 110,156 Software maintenance services 249,922 246,596 Professional services 107,604 98,176 Third Party services 57,576 57,589 Total revenues 710,394 603,391   Cost of revenues: Sale of software 23,704 19,518 Software as a Service 94,357 48,884 Software maintenance services 26,078 46,558 Professional services 49,653 31,355 Third party services 13,088 27,442 Total cost of revenues 206,880 173,757   Gross profit 503,514 429,634   Operating expenses: General and administrative 579,837 636,267 Sales and marketing 236,577 187,508 Depreciation 3,006 2,956 Total operating expenses 819,420 826,731   Loss from operations (315,906) (397,097)   Other income (expense) Interest expense, net (132,803) (138,668) Total other income (expense) (132,803) (138,668)   Net loss $(448,709) $(535,765)   Basic and diluted net loss per share: $(0.03) $(0.03)   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – basic and diluted 17,354,619 16,262,800   INTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets     ASSETS (Unaudited) March 31, December 31, 2017 2016   Current assets: Cash $494,935 $689,946 Accounts receivable, net 366,530 259,497 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 211,954 150,620   Total current assets 1,073,419 1,100,063   Property and equipment, net 22,206 18,783 Other assets 10,284 10,285   Total assets $1,105,909 $1,129,131   LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT   Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $736,415 $767,197 Deferred revenues 538,985 665,460 Deferred compensation 215,012 215,012 Notes payable – current 366,316 360,496 Notes payable – related party – current 39,273 38,307 Total current liabilities 1,896,001 2,046,472   Long-term liabilities: Notes payable – net of current portion 759,166 585,782 Notes payable – related party – net of current portion 309,841 299,447 Deferred interest expense 156,901 158,062 Other long-term liabilities – related parties 6,609 1,125   Total long-term liabilities 1,232,517 1,044,416   Total liabilities 3,128,518 3,090,888     Stockholders’ deficit: Common stock, $0.001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized;

These were controllers that could enable 1G, 2.5G and 5G connections over standard RJ45 connectors and Cat5e cabling. At the time, the two launched controllers were offered to OEMs to add into their custom motherboard builds, such as enterprise focused machines with a 5G office network in place. We have also seen motherboard manufacturers pick up the mantle, with consumer motherboards such as the ASRock Z270 SuperCarrier and the ASRock X370 Gaming, using the 5G Aquantia AQtion AQC108 chip.  Today's announcement cements Aquantia's lead in the multi-gigabit Ethernet space, despite already having an apparent 2 year lead over other rivals in this space (it helps that Aquantia helped define a major part of the 2.5G/5G specifications in the NBASE-T Alliance). Aquantia is launching two PCIe-based single-port network cards using their AQC108 and AQC107 controllers.  Aquantia AQtion Multi-Gigabit NICs Card AQN-107 AQN-108 Controller AQC-107 AQC-108 100BASE-T Yes Yes 1000BASE-T Yes Yes 2.5GBASE-T Yes Yes 5GBASE-T Yes Yes 10GBASE-T Yes No Ports 1 1 Price (from Aquantia) $127 $99 Release Date Soon Soon Potential Resellers ASUS GIGABYTE ? Both of these cards equip a system with a single port, with the AQC108 based card supporting BASE-T standards from 100M to 1G, 2.5G and 5G and uses a PCIe 3.0 x1 interface. The beefier AQC107 based card supports the same standards as well as 10G, and uses a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface (both cards will work down to PCIe 2.0 x1, with reduced data rates). Drivers for both cards will be available for the Windows 7/8/8.1/10 (also as part of the Windows Update solution) as well as varieties of Linux (3.10, 3.12, 3.2, 4.2 and 4.4). The idea behind these cards is the same as other network cards - to be able to offer functionality without having to embed the controller on the motherboard or into a prebuilt/legacy system. In the consumer world, we have plenty of offerings of Intel and Realtek based gigabit Ethernet cards (even Killer NICs back in the day), and Intel commands the 10GBASE-T cards with its X540 and X550 series. Aquantia is hoping to shake up this market, particularly for businesses and end users willing to invest in 2.5G/5G infrastructure. One of the big questions surrounding the transition to 2.5G/5G for home and SMB is infrastructure - making sure the network backbone, switches and access points are all capable. The major enterprise network players are already deploying multi-gigabit Ethernet networks to their customers, however it will be a bit longer before commercially available switches for consumers are available. One of the major drawbacks investing in 10GBASE-T in the home right now, aside from the $100-200 per port PCIe cards, is the cost of the switches. This is something Aquantia isn't doing directly, but we have been told that they are working with partners (the typical enterprise players at least) to solve. The depth of those solutions remain to be seen (we've been told similar by 10G switch vendors who had a different interpretation of 'mass market'), but ultimately for this technology to become ubiquitous, we need to see cheaper switches ($25/port), followed by cheap implementations, as we have seen in the last 15-20 years with gigabit Ethernet.  Final pricing is set at $99 and $127, with the 5G card being cheaper over the 10G card. Aquantia stated in the briefing that they are planning to sell the cards direct to consumers, or OEMs can brand the cards in their own style (eg imagine gaming based cards, as we've seen from Gigabyte already, or ASUS and their recently announced ROG Areion 10G card using the AQC107 chip) for their customers. It would be interesting to see if a manufacturer will offer a multi-port card by placing 2-4 chips on the same PCB, even if it requires a basic PLX switch.  Four 1G/2.5G/5G/10G ports for $549, anyone? Gallery: Aquantia AQtion NICs Review samples are currently being circulated, and I'm discussing with Ganesh the best way to test them, especially as we don't have any 5G switch equipment. We're also looking at angles to test these ports as they appear on motherboards too. Aquantia expects the cards to be on shelves shortly, with branded cards to follow.  Gallery: Aquantia Press Slide Deck Related Reading GIGABYTE Exhibits an Aquantia AQC107 based 10G Ethernet PCIe Card Aquantia Launches New 2.5G/5G Multi-Gigabit Network Controllers for PCs Consumer 10GBASE-T Options: Motherboards with 10G Built-In Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

And please Ubiquiti, remake the 8/16 ports PoE switches with multi-gigabit support.. and not over priced like your current ones... Reply chechito - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link i agree, vendors are trying to sell 5g ethernet at almost the cost of 10g ethernet Reply BurntMyBacon - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link In theory, 2.5G and 5G are good for the market as they provide a lower cost competitor to 10G that should drive down prices of 10G equipment. However, my fear and what seems to be playing out in practice is that 2.5G and 5G are being used to prop up the price of current 10G equipment. Vendors are justifying their 10G pricing by pricing their half and quarter speed alternatives such that it is extremely short sighted not to spend the small additional premium to get all the way to 10G. On the other hand, the AQN107 is selling for a reasonable price premium over the AQN108. The ability to support 2.5G, 5G, and 10G gives options for when the infrastructure is less than ideal. Switches with these extra modes will be desirable for the same reason. The AQN108 makes sense as an upgrade for systems that can't support an extra PCIe x4 card. However, while support for 2.5G and 5G at the switch is desirable, I see no reason to get a switch that doesn't also support 10G. It would be extremely short sighted. Likely, vendors will try to play with pricing, but we can already see that there isn't a large price difference. If a larger price gap develops, it will most likely be because vendors want to create the disparity and not due to a significantly greater cost of manufacturing 10G components. Reply dtremit - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link The big advantage of 2.5G and 5G isn't port cost -- it's cable cost. 10Gbase-T won't run over the Cat5e/Cat6 cable that's installed pretty much everywhere -- it's even picky about Cat7. The cost of a $100 adapter is chump change relative to rewiring your building. Reply chechito - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link i think that is nic vendors charging you a plus for avoiding change your cable??? very sad!!! 5g nic costs 10 times 1g nic thats 100% overprice vs performance Reply Kvaern1 - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link Highend always comes at a premium. Always. Reply Xajel - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link I feel that from a consumer POV if they need 10G it will be for the backbone, like from the main switch to NAS to the main PC most these stuff in most homes are in the same room already. the rest can be wired using 5gbps with ease. For the way I see it, the 10G will be from NAS to main PC to main switch, all in same room. and 5G to the home theatre switch which will connect to several 1G devices like TV, Media Player, Game Console, ChromeCast, etc.. 2.5G/5G will also serve AP's either point to point or chained ( like Switch-5G>------>AP>---->AP ), 2.5G will enough for single AC AP, 5G will be good for chaining multiple AP's. Reply DanNeely - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link For the shorter runs that are common at home lesser cabling than the officially rated sort is often still good enough. Cat6 (not 6A) is rated for 55m at 10G; runs that long in a residential network are rare. The bigger issue, especially with DIY cabling is that the quality of crimping at the cable ends needs to meet higher tolerances than with 1G. Reply yuhong - Tuesday, May 16, 2017 - link The fun thing is that the 802.3bz standard don't refer to Cat5e or Cat6 but describe the requirements in the standard itself. I wonder if this is due to marketing. Reply Xajel - Tuesday, May 16, 2017 - link I might be speaking of what I see only, but it's a very rare case when a home owner will need to run a 10G for that long.. even fiber run will cost less considering there's a lot of used gadget out there. and those new multi gigabit are still costly considering the need for not just 10G but for 5 & 2.5 as well Reply 1 2 3 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News Welcome to the Smartphone Squeeze: HTC Launches the U11 AT20 Giveaway Day 14.5: Zalman Provides Power Supplies, Cases, and Peripherals AT20 Giveaway Day 14: PowerColor Unleashes the Red Devil RX 570 Video Card Aquantia Launch AQtion 5G/2.5G/1G Multi-Gigabit Ethernet Cards (NICs) for PCIe Western Digital: Sales of Helium-Filled HDDs Accelerating, 15M Sold So Far Lian Li Launches ASUS ROG-Inspired PC-O11WGX Case: Two Chambers, E-ATX, USB-C Fractal Design Launches New S24 and S36 Celsius AIO Liquid Coolers ASUS Announces ROG STRIX H270I & B250I Mini-ITX Motherboards AOC Releases the I1659FWUX: a 15.6-inch 1080P Portable USB Monitor AT20 Giveaway Day 13: Seasonic PRIMEs You for PC Power Supplies Cooler Master Debuts Affordable MasterBox Lite 5 Mid-Tower Case AT20 Giveaway Day 12.5: Antec Cubes and Powers Your Next Mini-ITX PC TWEETS RyanSmithAT: RT @anandtech: HTC Squeeze Live Blog (Starts 2am ET) https://t.co/WCS28yQYC7 IanCutress: @TMFChipFool @rjonesy I can only deal with rear fingerprint sensors.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print ROSENSTEIN BRIEFS THE SENATE THIS WEEK – Trump on the Hill today – DEMS PLAY HARDBALL AFTER FBI FALLOUT – Brooks to enter Alabama Senate race 05/15/17 07:56 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) ROSENSTEIN BRIEFING THIS WEEK — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, one of the key players at the center of the firestorm behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, has agreed to an all-senators briefing this week. Rosenstein met with Senate Intelligence Committee leaders last week. The date and time for Rosenstein’s next trip to the Hill haven’t been announced yet but don’t expect Democrats to go easy on the new deputy AG, who is just a few weeks into the job. Story Continued Below Rosenstein “must resign” if he won’t agree to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the federal probe into Russian campaign meddling, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, declared Friday. But Rosenstein doesn’t see the need for a special prosecutor to oversee the probe, at least not right now, CNN’s Evan Perez and Manu Raju report. Meanwhile, Comey declined a request to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting Tuesday. But he is willing to testify if it’s in public, according to an associate close to the former FBI chief, Peter Baker and Michael Shear report for the New York Times. TRUMP’S ‘TAPES’ COMMENT UNNERVES CONGRESS — Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said over the weekend that if President Donald Trump did in fact tape his conversations with Comey, as he suggested in a tweet Friday, those recordings should be turned over to Congress and federal investigators. “We have got to make sure that these tapes, if they exist, don’t mysteriously disappear,” Senate Intel ranking member Mark Warner (D-Va.) said. The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe and Jenna Johnson: http://wapo.st/2qmYCtX HOUSE OF CARDS — Democrats and some Republicans are expressing concern that their colleague Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) could be tapped by Trump as the next FBI director. “John Cornyn under normal circumstances would be a superb choice to be FBI director,” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham Graham said on Meet the Press Sunday. “But these are not normal circumstances.” Cornyn was one of four candidates who interviewed in person for the job over the weekend. But Graham and several Democrats have said the bureau’s next leader should be someone without a political background. If Cornyn were picked for the post, it would set off a domino effect both inside the Senate and back in Texas. In the short-term, the move would trigger a new round of GOP leadership elections to replace Cornyn in his No. 2 post. Sen. John Thune, who is right behind Cornyn in the leadership ranks, is an early favorite to succeed the Texas Republican, Burgess and Seung Min report. And, at least three Texas House members are eyeing Cornyn’s seat if it opens up, Abby Livingston reports for the Texas Tribune. GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, who has mulled the idea of challenging Sen. Ted Cruz next year, is looking at the seat. Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has already said he’ll take on Cruz next year, and Rep. Joaquin Castro are both also interested. More: http://bit.ly/2pBsCpa The FBI Agents Association has backed former lawmaker and FBI agent Mike Rogers to replace Comey, Rebecca Morin reports. DEMS PLAY HARDBALL AFTER FBI FALLOUT — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear Sunday he supports blocking confirmation of a new FBI director until an independent prosecutor is appointed to oversee the federal investigation into Russia. “We will have to discuss it as a caucus, but I would support that move, because who the FBI director is, is related to who the special prosecutor is,” Schumer told CNN’s Jake Tapper. So far, most Republicans have rejected the idea of an independent prosecutor. Side note: Since the next FBI director can be confirmed via a simple majority, Democrats would need at least a few Republicans to join them in opposition, a hurdle the New York Democrat acknowledged. “We're hoping. We're waiting. We understand it's difficult, but I think patriotism and the needs of this country demand it,” he said.

FRIDAY’S MOST CLICKED: The yarn from Seung Min and Burgess about GOP senators rebuffing calls for a special prosecutor with the winner. WORTH A CLICK: An investigation into lawmakers’ reckless stock trading — While Tom Price was in the hot seat earlier this year during his HHS confirmation over questionable biotech stock trades, several other lawmakers were quietly buying shares in the same firm. “On the very day that [Sen. Ron] Wyden was decrying Price’s bad judgment, Rep. Doug Lamborn, Republican of Colorado, bought shares of the same tiny Australian company ... Within two days three more members also bought in — Republicans Billy Long of Missouri, Mike Conaway of Texas and John Culberson of Texas,” Maggie Severns reports. They are not alone: “POLITICO found that 28 House members and six senators each traded more than 100 stocks in the past two years …And a handful of lawmakers, some of them frequent traders and some not, disproportionately trade in companies that also have an interest in their work on Capitol Hill.” Much more: http://politi.co/2pBDymH MO CANDIDATES, MO PROBLEMS — Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks is holding a string of press conferences across the Yellowhammer State today – including a 10 p.m. event in Mobile – where he’s expect to announce his candidacy for Senate. Republican leaders have made clear they’re treating Sen. Luther Strange, the temporary replacement for Jeff Sessions, as an incumbent and will back him with their full support. But that hasn’t stopped others like former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore and now Brooks from jumping in the race ahead of the filing deadline Wednesday. Daniel Strauss: http://politi.co/2pBkwgg BIPARTISAN BACK CHANNEL ALIVE AND WELL — As Senate Republicans work publicly on their proposal to repeal Obamacare, there’s also sporadic behind-the-scenes talks with Democrats on a “Plan B,” Burgess and Elana report. GOP Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Bill Cassidy (La.) have been reaching out to some Democrats about their Obamacare replacement plan. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also said he thinks the bill should be bipartisan. Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine (Va.), Tom Carper (Del.), Joe Manchin (W.V.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) have all been a part of informal talks with Republicans, they report. But there’s pressure from leadership on both sides not to cooperate: “Any cooperation on health care undercuts both parties’ political strategy. Republican leaders are wary of handing any bipartisan accomplishments to the dozen or so vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection next year. And Democratic leaders want the GOP to fully own the beleaguered health care system going into the midterms.” More: http://politi.co/2qnmLAU FOR YOUR RADAR: GOP EYES SLASHING SAFETY NET — “Under enormous internal pressure to quickly balance the budget, Republicans are considering slashing more than $400 billion in spending through a process to evade Democratic filibusters in the Senate, multiple sources told POLITICO,” Rachael and Sarah Ferris report. “Among the programs most likely on the chopping block, the sources say, are food stamps, welfare, income assistance for the disabled and perhaps even veterans benefits.” Key line: “If enacted, such a plan to curb safety-net programs — all while juicing the Pentagon’s budget and slicing corporate tax rates — would amount to the biggest shift in federal spending priorities in decades.” More: http://politi.co/2qn2hIl ABORTION POLITICS VEXES VULNERABLE SENATORS — Sens. Joe Manchin and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), vulnerable 2018 incumbents, have both been in the hot seat already this year over where they stand in the pro-life/pro-choice debate. Expect much more of that to come, Elana reports. “If the Senate calls up a bill to repeal Obamacare, controversy over Planned Parenthood funding will come to the fore — ensuring the 2018 campaign won’t lack for that perennial lightning rod.” More: http://politi.co/2qn29bR CORDRAY COMING TO CAPITOL HILL — CFPB Director Richard Cordray will huddle with House Democrats Wednesday, their first caucus meeting since FBI Director James Comey’s firing.

Every surgery has risks. During her presurgery consultation, teenager Hunter shared information that triggered concerns by her physician anesthesiologist. As a highly trained physician with extensive medical knowledge and expertise in anesthesia – and in the human body and its systems – the physician anesthesiologist suspected Hunter might have an undiagnosed condition that could result in profound surgical complications. The physician anesthesiologist canceled Hunter’s surgery and ordered additional tests – and that decision altered Hunter’s life. If the original surgery had been performed, Hunter’s life could have changed completely. Having a physician anesthesiologist leading Hunter’s care saved her from being paralyzed and resulted in a diagnosis and successful treatment of a brain tumor. Protect patients with safe, high-quality, physician-led care.

The top 25 semiconductor vendors' combined revenue increased 10.5 percent, a significantly better performance than the overall industry's growth; however, most of this growth resulted from merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. "The semiconductor industry rebounded in 2016, with a weak start to the year, characterized by inventory correction, giving way to strengthening demand and an improving pricing environment in the second half," said James Hines research director at Gartner. "Worldwide semiconductor revenue growth was supported by increasing production in many electronic equipment segments, improving NAND flash memory pricing and relatively benign currency movements." Intel retained its No. 1 position as the largest semiconductor manufacturer and grew its semiconductor revenue 4.6 percent in 2016 (see Table 1). Samsung Electronics continued to maintain the No. 2 spot with 11.7 percent market share. Table 1.

Merger and acquisition activity among the major vendors in 2016 included Avago Technologies' acquisition of Broadcom Corp. to become Broadcom Ltd., On Semiconductor's acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor, and Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk. The largest mover in the top 25 was Broadcom Ltd., which moved up 12 places in the market share ranking. "The combined revenue of the top 25 semiconductor vendors increased by 10.5 percent during 2016 and accounted for a 74.9 percent share, outperforming the rest of the market, which saw a 15.6 percent revenue decline," said Mr. Hines. "However, these results are skewed by the large amount of M&A activity during 2015 and 2016. If we adjust for this M&A activity by adding the revenue of each acquired company to the revenue of the acquirer for both 2015 and 2016 where necessary, then the top 25 vendors would have experienced a 1.9 percent revenue increase, and the rest of the market would have increased by 4.6 percent."

The malware, which has wreaked havoc at thousands of NHS trusts, threatens to delete your files unless you pay a ransom Liz Connor Monday 15 May 2017 17:13 BST Click to follow ES Lifestyle A global cyber-attack has hit 150 countries since Friday Shutterstock / Minerva Studio Last Friday, a global cyber attack caused disruption in 150 countries, with NHS hospitals, pharmacies and GP surgeries amongst some of the worst-affected in the UK. Hackers are thought to be using “ransomware” to carry out the attack, a type of malicious software that blocks access to data until a ransom is paid and displays a message requesting payment to unblock it.  The worm used in Friday’s attack, dubbed WannaCry and Wanna Decryptor, encrypted more than 200,000 computers for ransoms of $300 to $600 to restore access.  The software is one of a number of different hacking tools that the National Cyber Security Centre has to fight against in order to keep systems safe - and it's already managed to cause widespread chaos across hospitals in the UK. But what exactly is it, how does it work and - most importantly - how can you keep yourself safe from attack?  What is ransomware? Ransomware is a type of malware that blocks access to a computer or its data and demands money from the user to release it.  How does it work? Read more Cybersecurity expert warns of 'no kill switch' ransomware Security experts have warned that ransomware is the fastest growing form of computer virus.  Hackers can purchase malicious software kits the same way they would buy a video game program online.  For criminals to be able to lock a system, they need to download the software onto a device within the network - this is often done by sending a hoax email that prompts a victim to click on a download link.   A message appearing on a computer at an NHS trust (PA) When a computer becomes infected with the virus, the software contacts a central server, attacking and encrypting all of the files it can find on the network.  Once all of the files are encrypted, users recieve a ‘ransom’ message asking for a payment to unlock the files. This is normally in the form of bitcoin, the online cryptocurrency. The message threatens to delete the files if the ransom isn’t paid, with a timer alongside to force users to pay up fast.  The best laptops for home use- in pictures 6 show all The best laptops for home use- in pictures 1/6 Get the best home experience with our pick of easy-to-use laptops HP Spectre 2/6 Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Any laptop over £1,000 needs to offer a lot to make it worth the price tag.

The sound quality is clear and loud enough to cope with an epic film. £1249, Currys, Buy it now 3/6 ASUS Zenbook UX The aluminium frame on the Zenbook is thinner than that of a Macbook and comes at a third of the price, so if its transportability you’re after, this is a great choice.

It comes with three USB ports and an SD card reader, giving the user capacity to use it for working on the go.

It comes with the Windows 10 Home already installed, giving you the option to open multiple apps at once and supplying you with an Amazon Alexa type virtual assistant called Cortana, and weighs just under two kilos, making it manageable to carry around. £499.99, Argos,Buy it now What is Wanna Decryptor? Wanna Decryptor, WannaCry and wcry are the specific type of ransomware program that was used on Friday’s cyber attack on the NHS in Britain and Telefocina in Spain, amongst several other companies.  The software locks all the data on a network  and leaves users with just two files: a ransom note and the Wanna Decryptor program itself. Cyber attack hit 200,000 victims across 150 countries, says Europol chief How is it removed? On an individual level, basic ransomware is usually removed by putting Windows in Safe Mode and using an antivirus program to find and delete the software. However, larger industrial attacks involving networks of computers can be a lot more complicated to fix.  Should I pay the attackers? No - victims have been advised by cyber protection experts to never pay the ransom as it encourages the attackers, and there is no guarantee that your files will be returned to you. Instead, the best thing to do is restore all files from a back up.  Theresa May praises NHS staff in wake of cyber attack How can I protect myself from attack?  There are a few things you can do to keep your files safe. Outdated operating systems are easy targets, so make sure you are updating your system regularly. Separately, invest in software that can protect you against viruses and malware such as BitDefender, Kaspersky, Norton Antivirus and ESET.  The best way to make sure your personal files are never stolen from would-be attackers is to keep everything backed up on an external hard drive that’s not connected to the internet.  This way, if your computer does become infected, you can wipe the system, replace your data and start again.

The new portfolio delivers innovation in three key areas: • Scalable business architecture optimizes data centers for a wide variety of new and emerging workload requirements • Intelligent automation via expanded APIs and the all-new OpenManage™ Enterprise console enable IT to spend more time on higher priority work • Integrated security protects customers' businesses and data for the life of the server "In today's digital economy, technology must transform at the speed of business to develop and deploy new applications, optimize resources and deliver an ideal customer experience," said Ashley Gorakhpurwalla, president, Server Solutions Division at Dell EMC. "With our leadership in server technology innovations, the newest generation of PowerEdge servers are the bedrock of the modern data center." Legacy data center technologies are not agile, flexible or efficient enough to meet the needs of businesses undergoing a Digital Transformation. In fact, the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) 2017 IT Transformation Maturity Curve study, commissioned by Dell EMC, showed that only 5% of survey respondents are currently prepared to meet the IT requirements of digitally transformed businesses with modern platforms. PowerEdge 14th generation servers will be embedded in storage and data center appliances, hyper-converged appliances and racks, ready nodes, bundles and other industry-leading Dell EMC solutions. The new scalable business architecture of Dell EMC PowerEdge servers enable customers to meet dynamic business needs with performance optimized for traditional and cloud-native workloads.

Additional details and pricing information on the Dell EMC PowerEdge 14th Generation servers are expected to be available in mid-2017. Customer Quotes: Joe Wiese, systems design engineer, Rackspace Hosting "I totally love the new iDRAC 9. The new version is quite comprehensive and can be used to configure most everything for managing and maintaining the servers. The web front-end can view and edit the iDRAC, the PERC, the NICs and the BIOS all through a single web interface that is also Redfish compliant for scripting via API calls. It is hands-down the single greatest addition to PowerEdge that I have encountered." Vishvas Chitale, director, Chitale Dairy, India "With a massive growth in operations, we wanted to apply technology to automate the milk production process and monitor dairy cow habits and health via an Internet of Things (IoT) solution. As a long-time Dell EMC customer, we had confidence in scaling our mission-critical application on PowerEdge servers using VMware. As a result, we have automated a manual process with complete lifecycle management of cows via the cloud." Analyst Quotes: Matt Eastwood, SVP, Enterprise Infrastructure and Datacenter, IDC "Dell continues to grow its server business as a combined company with EMC. Its Dell EMC PowerEdge portfolio addresses a broad set of customer needs from traditional business use cases to cloud-native applications while offering a strong foundation to support future IT and business needs. Dell EMC has continued to invest in innovative technology combinations, which has resulted in a secure, scalable infrastructure and comprehensive solutions portfolio." Michelle Bailey, chief research officer, 451 Research "The next transition in enterprise architecture will increasingly be built on flexible hyper-converged infrastructures, those that simplify procurement and ongoing operations with a single supplier, lowering risks of implementation while helping speed time to delivery. Dell EMC's new generation servers is geared toward addressing many of these issues with intelligent management and automation capabilities." Channel Partner and Alliance Partner quotes: Lisa Spelman, vice president and general manager of Intel Xeon Products and Data Center Marketing Group, Intel Corporation "With breakthrough performance, security and agility, the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family represents the biggest set of data center platform advancements in a decade. A modern, multi-cloud-ready infrastructure built on industry-leading technologies from Intel and Dell EMC enables organizations to successfully transform into digital businesses." Yanbing Li, senior vice president and general manager, Storage and Availability Business Unit, VMware "Adopting modern data center technology, such as hyper-converged infrastructure, is key to enabling IT transformation that supports the new demands of today's digital business. The combination of the new Dell EMC PowerEdge servers and VMware solutions will accelerate this transition with reliable infrastructure that is less complex to deploy while reducing total cost of ownership." Bob Olwig, vice president of Business Development & Innovation, World Wide Technology "What sets Dell EMC apart is how they listen to their partners and customers.

Turns out, I was a bit early... but not by much. With the release of NVIDIA's GeForce 10 series, the company's mobile GPUs flaunt near-desktop levels of performance. Which makes buying a notebook in 2017 an exciting proposition. But how best to spend those valuable dollars while satisfying your gaming urges? Metabox's Alpha N850HK could be the answer. What Is It? Metabox's Alpha series represents the builder's more affordable range of notebooks. In terms of specifications however, they are in no way slouches. 15.6" and 17.3" units are available, all packing Intel's i7-7700HQ processor. The quad-core chip is close to the top-end of laptop CPUs. Where the main differentiation comes is the graphics. Depending on the model you go with, you'll get a GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti. The chips are comparable — 640MHz/1354MHz core and memory clocks versus 768MHz/1493MHz for the Ti. Both have a 128-bit bus. But the Ti has a little extra under the hood — 48 texture units and 32 render output units, up from the 1050's 40 and 16. For this review, we'll be looking at the N850HK, which comes with the 1050 Ti. Because Metabox allows you to customise almost everything about the build, here are the particulars of our configuration: 15.6" FHD 1920x1080 IPS WVA Matte 60Hz LED NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB Intel Core i7-7700HQ Processor (up to 3.8GHz) 16GB DDR4 2400MHZ SK Hynix SC308 512GB SATA3 SSD Intel 3168 AC Dual Band Wi-Fi 378 x 267 x 26.9mm (WDH) 2.3kg (with battery) This level of customisation means the price can vary a lot. At the time of writing, going with the minimal build (no OS or hard drive), you'll be out $1349. The cheapest drive, a 128GB Intel SSD, brings this to $1449, while tossing in Windows 10 raises the total to $1594. Keep in mind that Metabox (and resellers) tend to have deals going at various times, so you can save a hundred bucks or so by timing your purchase. In terms of the design, the chassis is solid plastic, sturdy and low-fuss. The lid is tightly sealed — you'll need to hold the base down before cracking it open, lest you flip the thing. It's totally black, except for self-lit keyboard, grey Metabox logos and the gleam of copper through the cooling vents. Speaking of vents, there's three — a bottom intake and two outtakes positioned in the back-left and right sides. If you enjoy having a warm mouse hand, this is the notebook for you. At 2.3kg it's no ultrabook and sits on the borderline of being too weighty as an all-day backpack carry. But, given the hardware inside, it's a reasonable compromise. Finally, it comes with plenty of ports: 1x USB 2.0 3x USB 3.0 (1x Type C, 2x Type A) 1x HDMI 2x Mini DisplayPort 1.2 1x headphone jack 1x microphone jack 1x RJ-45 1Gb/s LAN There's also a six-in-one card reader (MMC, RSMMC, SD, miniSD, SDHC, SDXC) for all your photo and tiny storage needs. What's It Good At? Image: Metabox As a budget gaming notebook, the N850HK excels. You'll be hard-pressed finding a cheaper notebook with the same specifications and build quality outside of ridiculous discounts and second-hand gear. The i7 chip slays every game you throw at it, leaving the 1050 Ti as the deciding factor. We tested with two benchmarks — The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and 3DMark's Fire Strike. Because the former doesn't come with a benchmark mode, the game was played for a fixed period at each quality setting, starting with the game's first fight and riding to the next cinematic. Post-processing quality was left at "High". All benchmarks were conducted at the display's native resolution of 1920 x 1080 (click the images for larger versions). Image: Supplied Image: Supplied As you can see, if you blindly go Ultra and cross your fingers, you're going to be disappointed. Still, I was impressed that the game wasn't a slideshow at those settings. I wouldn't call it smooth, but it was definitely playable, if you prefer eye-candy over frames. Once you get to medium details, thing are more acceptable. It's important to keep in mind that The Witcher 3 is at the top-end. If almost any other game is your bag, the 1050 Ti will be able to handle it at high settings. When it can't a few strategic tweaks will almost certainly make things buttery smooth. What's It Not Good At? If you just want to play games at ultra levels, then the N850HK won't satisfy. You'll want a notebook with the 1060 at a minimum. The screen isn't the best going around, if you go for the 1920 x 1080 option. At over 15 inches, the discerning eye can pick up the subtle grid pattern of the display (I've been spoiled for years by the glorious screen of ASUS' UX32VD). Once anything of substance is happening though, it's almost impossible to notice. A 4K panel is an option for ~$350. Battery life also wasn't flash. Idling with the screen always on, the unit lasted three hours and 27 minutes. Under heavy load (FurMark's stress test) it managed 40 minutes, so don't expect to play demanding games for long unplugged. In terms of temperatures, the unit happily idled at 42°C / 46°C for the CPU and GPU respectively at 20°C ambient. Under load running Prime95 and FurMark, these hit 97°C and 77°C respectively. Unsurprisingly, the CPU's throttling logic was triggered, which brought the core down to 90°C for the rest of the test. Consider these numbers the upper limits. Normal use, even playing a demanding game, would never make the hardware this hot and the N850HK's cooling system is more than adequate for the hardware. Should You Buy It? The 1050 Ti can't quite take the crown as a bang-for-your-buck miracle ... but it's close enough. If you're the sort of gamer that doesn't want to stuff around with optimal graphics settings, then you should turn your eyes to Metabox's 1060-equipped offerings, which start with its Prime range. The issue here is you're going to need to spend a couple of hundred extra dollars for the privilege. The 1060 Prime starts at $1799 — and that doesn't include an operating system. That said, if you have an extra $200-$300 to spend, it's worth paying for the 1060's grunt. All up, the Alpha N850HK is a fantastic balance of portability, power and price. Sure, a 1060 would be nice, but the 1050 Ti keeps the notebook in the ~$1500 bracket, which for a lot of people is the upper spending limit when it comes to notebooks. For the cost, the N850HK is about as good as it gets. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments Be the first to comment on this story! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Be the first to comment on this story!

This year, Microsoft chose to share all of its nitty gritty stuff on day one and reserved its more consumer-facing products for day two. There were a few underlying themes that stood out to me: artificial intelligence, cross-platform integration, an open source-feel and Microsoft urging developers to code on Windows for non-native apps. With Windows 10 now having 500 million monthly active users, the tech-giant wants to remind developers that it's worth investing time and effort into its products. From chatbots and apps for Microsoft Teams, to seeding AI through Azure stack, IoT Edge, and Microsoft Cognitive Services to provide a safer workplace for individuals on a construction site, this year's Build had a lot to offer. Here are some of the things that really caught my eye. Project Rome SDK for iOS developers This Microsoft project is a way for developers to connect their apps across devices. Previously aimed at Android developers, the functionality is now open to iOS developers, allowing a great way for those who want to test their apps in separate environments simultaneously to do so. This is achievable through the Xamarin Live Player, which will allow developers to debug and test iOS apps on a Windows machine. Cortana is now more useful than ever The somewhat unpopular AI assistant has been transformed into a cross-device, multi-purpose voice assistant. Used by 140 million users on a monthly basis, Microsoft encouraged developers to give more purpose to its AI software. Through a live demonstration, the company showcased how the voice assistant could work in companies collaborating through Microsoft Teams, or remind you that your connected car is out of petrol. An Amazon and Google speaker competitor was showcased too, the Harman Kardon's Invoke; a Cortana-based speaker. Microsoft also announced partnerships with both Intel and HP, which should also lead to more apps and products with Cortana integration. For developers, Microsoft announced its Cognitive Service and Bot Framework, which work together to allow an AI bot, like Cortana, to learn from user interactions. This makes conversational AI bots more life-like, a feature demonstrated by the Invoke speaker. Mixed reality developments On day two's keynote, Microsoft and the creative team from Cirque de Soleil showcased the benefits of using HoloLens by creating a virtual stage, live. This also demonstrated the ability to collaborate via HoloLens, no matter where you are in the world. However, that's not what got people excited – the Motion Controllers for Mixed Reality platforms did. Finally, just like the HTC Vive, you'll have controllers that will allow you to interact with the mixed reality headsets offered by Microsoft and its partners. The Acer $299 and the HP $329 dev kits were also announced at the event, which for a limited time will come bundled with the motion controllers. No UK pricing, availability or individual pricing for the controllers was announced, though. Azure now works on mobile A feature that exited a few developers at the keynote was Azure's new mobile app, which will be available on iOS and Android. A Windows 10 UMP app is also in the works, which will let you keep an eye out for activities through your Azure dashboard while on the go. Azure IoT Edge is scalable and powerful In a live demo, Microsoft showcased the power of Azure IoT Edge, its cross-platform runtime. In the demonstration Microsoft put us in a construction scenario, with dangerous equipment and products on a construction site. Using connected security cameras with image recognition and inputted data sets, a manager is able to monitor people and tools on site. The real-time tracking and AI-based recognition completely transforms the environment by individually tagging each item, whether it's an object or a human. With 12 million organisations using Azure Active Directory, Microsoft is pushing for developers and companies to better its recognition capabilities and with 90% of the Fortune 500 on the Microsoft Cloud, I see this becoming a key tool for businesses. Azure Cosmos DB is out The service, previously known as DocumentDB, has received a healthy update. You'll now be able to visually see inputted values in a database, allowing you to quickly see a full reproduction of your data. Visual Studio is now on Mac Developers who code on Mac rejoice! Visual Studio for Mac means you'll be able to access Microsoft's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on Apple's operating system. It will work on mobile, web, Unity and Azure. Of course, you'll need to be a developer to access this, but I presume most looking at getting Visual Studio will already have that certified badge. PowerPoint can now translate Following on from the unveiling of Skype Translator back in 2014, Microsoft has added a similar new feature to PowerPoint. With the help of AI, the presentation software can now translate your slides in real-time. Sure, it isn't flawless, but the room and myself were all impressed at how quickly and accurately it could translate spoken Spanish to written English. There are currently ten languages available, with more to come.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) DETROIT In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph – just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” says Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” says Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, says John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng says. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes.

I wish communities had a better way to subsidize the state than harrass drivers for rolling through stop signs and going 75 on the highway. . It will be great when you’re drunk and smashed and seat belted and your computerized car tells the computerized cop car that the computer is driving and it is pointless to stop them. When real human drivers stick out like a sore thumb and become the only source of revenue will be people who choose to drive. You will be stamped out like smokers. Probably driven to live in Tennesee or West Virginia. Your car will happily go 25. Stop on the white line. Come to a complete stop, etc. This is going to be great. I hope they have ride share where you borrow cars for trips you preplan with an app. If I want to go to work at 7 my car arrives at 630 then I don’t need parking because I will be dropped off and another car like it will arrive at 330 when my shift ends and will be prepared to make all those stops I planned and programed in.

May 16 2017 Fox Sports news.com.au Home 2017 National Elections National News World News Top Stories Sports Latest News Business Drum Editorial Yu Tok Bougainville World News Sources: Trump shared classified info with Russians President Donald Trump shared highly classified information with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador to the US in a White House meeting last week. May 16, 2017 President Donald Trump shared highly classified information with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador to the US in a White House meeting last week, The Washington Post first reported Monday. Two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to CNN that the main points of the Post story are accurate: The President shared classified information with the Russian foreign minister. The President did not directly reveal the source of the information, but intelligence officials told CNN that there is concern that Russia will be able to figure out the highly sensitive source. There is some disagreement, according to one of the sources, as to how far the President went. The intelligence relates to what is known as a special access program, or SAP, which covers some of the most classified information and is protected with unique access and security protocols. The White House scrambled to respond to the report Monday night, issuing several statements before sending H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser who participated in the meeting, out to speak with White House reporters. “At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the President did not disclose any military operations that weren’t already publicly known,” he said. “I was in the room. It didn’t happen.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement earlier Monday that Trump discussed a “broad range of subjects” with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. “During President Trump’s meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov a broad range of subjects were discussed among which were common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism. During that exchange the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations,” Tillerson, who was in the meeting, said in a statement provided by White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Dina Powell, White House deputy national security adviser for strategy, who also attended the meeting, said: “This story is false. The President only discussed the common threats that both countries faced,” in a statement provided by Spicer. According to the Post, Trump described details to Lavrov and Kislyak about how ISIS hopes to use laptop computers as bombs on planes. “I get great Intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” one official with knowledge told the Post described Trump as saying, before the President reportedly relayed specific intelligence. A former intelligence officer called the report — and White House response “infuriating.” “It sounds like White House is parsing words by saying ‘didn’t discuss sources or methods’ as a weak cover your a**,” the former officer said. “That’s a technicality. If the information itself was specific enough, it implicitly discloses sources and methods.” McMaster had previously told the Post that Trump and the Russian officials discussed “common threats.” “The President and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation,” McMaster told The Washington Post. “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.” – CNN Share this article: World News White House denies report Trump shared classified intelligence with Russian officials White House denies report Trump shared classified intelligence with Russian officials North Korea vows missile tests 'any time, any place', defying U.S. warnings North Korea vows missile tests 'any time, any place', defying U.S. warnings Mexican award winning journo shot dead Mexican award winning journo shot dead Journalist who covered Mexican drug trade gunned down in Sinaloa Journalist who covered Mexican drug trade gunned down in Sinaloa Related UN: Sexual violence increasingly used as ‘terrorism’ tactic A top U.N. official says sexual violence is increasingly being used as "a tactic of terrorism" from Iraq, Syria and Yemen to Somalia, Nigeria and Mali.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Waymo’s Relationship with Uber Has Reached Point of No Return Shutterstock photo On Sunday night, Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo and Lyft announced that they were in a partnership on self-driving technology that would give Waymo access to a network of travelers and Lyft access to leading self-driving technology. Lyft is a smaller Uber rival, having raised $600 million last month at a valuation of $7.5 billion. But it does have backing from General Motors, with which it has started testing its own self driving technology (still a fledgling effort unlike Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group). Google started out as more of a Uber partner, being the largest investor in the ride-hailing startup and powering its service with Google Maps. By virtue of its being the largest investor, Google also had an appointee on Uber’s board. Things started souring when Google developed its own self driving technology and showed signs of piggy-backing it to enter the ride hailing business rather than licensing it to its long-time partner. That’s when David Drummond, Google’s representative on Uber’s board, retired from the position. Since then, Google changed course, putting its automotive efforts under a company it calls Waymo and deciding to go with the licensing model after all. It’s currently testing its technology in Fiat Chrysler minivans. So the agreement with Lyft, the details of which remain undisclosed, potentially expands the list of testing partners and also applies the technology to the kind of use for which it might be consumed in high volume. This is particularly important because there is a big race between technology firms to get the technology out there first. So not just Google, but also Microsoft MSFT , Apple AAPL , Baidu, NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC are in the fray, developing the technology and partnering with traditional automakers to test it. Waymo also recently took Uber to court for using its former employee Anthony Levandowski to steal files related to its self-driving technology. Uber tried and failed to move the case to arbitration after Levandowski used the Fifth Amendment to refuse testimony. So the agreement with Lyft, which has reportedly been in the works for nearly a year, is also the final nail in the coffin as far as the Google-Uber relationship is concerned. 5 Trades Could Profit „Big-League” from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington’s changing course.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ernst & Young Announces Big Switch Networks’ Douglas Murray and Kyle Forster as EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2017 Northern California Finalists /EINPresswire.com/ — SANTA CLARA, CA–(Marketwired – May 15, 2017) – Big Switch Networks, The Next-Generation Data Center Networking Company, today announced Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks and Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks were named finalists for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2017 Northern California Region Award. After being named semifinalists in April 2017, alongside nearly 50 other nominees, Murray and Forster have been selected as finalists by a panel of independent judges for their respective contributions to and guidance of Big Switch. Prior winners for Northern California include Reid Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, Nick Woodman of GoPro, Andreas Bechtolsheim and Jayshree Ullal of Arista Networks and James Park of Fitbit. Northern California award winners will be announced at a black tie gala event on June 23rd. Under Murray’s guidance, Big Switch has experienced 40+% average QoQ growth for the last 12 quarters. Since he joined the company in late 2013, headcount has doubled and will have tripled by the end of 2017 to support growing market demand for Big Switch’s products. Prior to joining Big Switch, Murray ran Juniper Networks’ Asia Pacific, Japan and Greater China organization, where he was responsible for all aspects of Juniper’s business across the region. Previously he held executive positions at Extreme Networks, Sun Microsystems, as well as his first start-up, Sanrise. He started his career at AT&T as an Account Executive and was part of the AT&T Leadership Development Program. Murray has also been a guest lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on the topic of entrepreneurialism. „I am honored to be named an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California finalist, and thrilled to be nominated alongside Kyle. I am humbled by the recognition as we move from semi-finalist selection to finalist.” said Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks. „Kyle is the embodiment of entrepreneurialism and made a huge bet in starting Big Switch with Guido. I’ve never been more proud of the collective work of incredibly smart people, and it is my honor to lead this amazing organization.” Kyle Forster founded Big Switch in 2010, starting the company with longtime friend Guido Appenzeller, who at the time was the head of Stanford University’s Clean Slate Lab, a pioneer of the research that became known as SDN. Forster raised the initial financing, refined the initial ‚One Big Switch’ product vision, helped recruit the early engineering team and found the company’s first customers. Prior to Big Switch, he spent the formative years of his career at Cisco where he brought three products from concept to revenue and received six patents for cellular, wireless LAN and security inventions. Forster watched as hyperscale companies like Facebook and Google started developing their own networking technologies, out-innovating the legacy vendors’ expensive, proprietary solutions. In the early Stanford research, Forster saw an opportunity to bring hyperscale-inspired design to the broader enterprise community and disrupt what was becoming an increasingly stagnant $50B+ networking industry. „I am thrilled and humbled to have been selected as a finalist for EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California from the pool of truly remarkable semifinalists. To be nominated alongside Doug makes this recognition all the more meaningful,” said Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks. „Doug was born to lead, and there is no one who deserves this recognition more. His leadership of the company has been synonymous with Big Switch’s success.” Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by the the company’s 156% YoY growth in its most recent quarter. In 2016 it more than doubled its customer count and is on track to do the same for 2017. In 2016, Big Switch established a dedicated presence in China as well as EMEA and ANZ regions to support global demand for its products. Additionally, Big Switch has more than a dozen customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses.

All should be installed as soon as possible before they are exploited by miscreants. The updates, numbering seven in total, include fixes for security vulnerabilities in the Safari browser and WebKit engine. For iPhone and iPad, Apple has kicked out iOS 10.3.2. The update addresses a total of 41 CVE-listed vulnerabilities in the mobile OS, with 23 of those being flaws in WebKit, including 17 that allow for remote code execution through malicious webpages and five that enable cross-site scripting attacks. Other holes addressed in iOS 10.3.2 include CVE-2017-2498, which Apple termed "a certificate validation issue existed in the handling of untrusted certificates" and a pair of flaws in iBooks (CVE-2017-2497, CVE-2017-6981) that allow ebooks to open arbitrary websites and execute code with root privilege. Mac owners will want to install macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (or Security Update 2017-002 for El Capitan and Yosemite). The update addresses 37 vulnerabilities, including the two iBook flaws and a Wi-Fi networking hole (CVE-2017-6988) that allows the theft of network credentials. Also addressed were elevation of privilege flaws in both the Intel (CVE-2017-2503) and Nvidia (CVE-2017-6985) graphics drivers, as well as four different arbitrary code execution holes (CVE-2017-2513,CVE-2017-2518,CVE-2017-2520, CVE-2017-2519) in SQLite. A separate update for Safari looks to patch up three holes in the browser itself and 23 vulnerabilities in WebKit, many of which are also addressed in the iOS updates. Those using the Apple Watch should install watchOS 3.2.2, patching a total of 12 CVE-listed vulnerabilities, four of which could be targeted for remote code execution. Apple TV, meanwhile, has been sent tvOS 10.2.1 to patch 23 flaws, including 12 holes in the WebKit engine that allow cross-site scripting and remote code execution attacks. Finally, for Windows users there is iTunes 12.6.1, an update that patches a single (CVE-2017-6984) remote code execution flaw, and iCloud 6.2.1, which handles the CVE-2017-2530 remote code execution flaw in WebKit. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments MORE Apple iPhone Safari Patch Management Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Sophos waters down 'NHS is totally protected' by us boast Updated Watered down homeopathy for computers is more powerful, m'kay? 59 Comments Sophos update borks systems at London NHS trust Updated Rubber gloves on as techies probe root cause 13 Comments Sophos to assimilate Invincea's intelligent machine tech to fight malware Machine learning IP snapped up in $100m deal 3 Comments Apple blocks comms-snooping malware Leaked developer certificate revoked, protection updated 12 Comments Sophos buys Irish Barricade Security FUD and malware outbreaks boost Sophos' coffers Targeting the 'underserved mid-market' pays off nicely 2 Comments Whitepapers Secure Mobile Development Best Practices Covering the vulnerabilities hackers might use to launch an attack, and remediation tips that you can use to build security into your app. Blending Cloud-native and Conventional Applications This IDC InfoBrief, sponsored by Red Hat, reviews ten lessons from early adopters for successful integration of cloud native and traditional applications.

An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen," wrote Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft, on a company blog Sunday evening. Ransomware is a type of cyberattack that encrypts a target's files, with the attacker providing the decryption key only after a ransom is paid, usually in bitcoin. ADVERTISEMENT WanaDecrypt0r, alternately known by names like Wanna Cry, has struck hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 100 nations since the attack began Friday morning. Victims range from hospitals in the United Kingdom, a telecom company in Spain, U.S.-based FedEx, and the Russian Ministry of the Interior. WanaDecrypt0r was so virulent in part because it used a Windows hacking tool that appears to have been stolen from the NSA and leaked by a hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers. Though Microsoft had patched the security hole in Windows, businesses often lag in installing updates for reasons including industry-specific software being incompatible with the most current version of operating systems. "In February [we called] for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them," wrote Smith. By reporting bugs instead of using them to conduct cyber espionage, manufacturers would be able to increase cybersecurity for all of its users -- but that would come at the cost of intelligence and sabotage operations. Read more here, from our cybersecurity colleague Joe Uchill.   MORE ON WANNA CRY: Edward Snowden called the continuing "ransomware" scourge "a perfect storm of all the problems everyone has been warning about" at a privacy issues conference Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin used the ransomware attack to deliver a jab at the U.S. Monday was the most lucrative day yet for the Wanna Cry ransomware. President Trump reportedly ordered an emergency meeting over the weekend to address the threat.   Please send your tips, comments and constructive criticism to Ali Breland (abreland@thehill.com) and Harper Neidig (hneidig@thehill.com) and follow us on Twitter: @alibreland, @hneidig and @HilliconValley.

Waymo alleges that a former employee, Anthony Levandowski, stole about 14,000 documents -- including trade secrets -- before leaving to start a self-driving truck company called Otto. Uber later acquired Otto, gaining access to the files. Uber has until May 31 to return the files to Waymo, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered. The documents allegedly detail advancements Waymo had made with lidar -- a radar system that most self-driving car companies to employ help their cars pilot themselves.

Its Congressional Budget Office score came in on Friday, with the CBO estimating the plan to update government technology and IT systems would cost around $500 million over the next five years. The bill is set to hit the House floor on Wednesday. After President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpState Dept. surprised by Tillerson defending Trump: report GOP strategist: GOP would have 'rightly' tried to impeach Clinton for classified disclosure Pelosi: 'What do the Russians have on Donald Trump?' MORE's Cybersecurity executive order last week, technology and cyber interests praised the order, but said that a plan for updating the federal government's technology is necessary to protect the U.S. from cyber threats. Many see Hurd's bill as the answer. For more on the CBO score, click here.

He called the hiring push an example of "the president's domestic economic policies that are generating optimism." Unlike many other companies who have announced hiring pushes recently, Apple did not tie its announcement to Trump or his policies.   JOHN OLIVER ADDRESS FCC COMMENTERS: HBO comedian John Oliver on Sunday again rallied his viewers to submit pro-net neutrality comments to the Federal Communications Commission, but took a shot at those who had been using the site to launch personal attacks against the FCC's GOP chairman. Supporters of Ajit Pai, who has kicked off proceedings to roll back Obama-era net neutrality protections, have been quick to seize on inflammatory comments filed in the past week, after Oliver urged his audience to show support for the regulations. And on Sunday, Oliver acknowledged in a YouTube video that there were racist comments filed in support of net neutrality and had a simple message for any of his viewers who may have written them: "Stop it. Do not f---ing do that." "Writing racist things on the internet is not how you win the net neutrality debate," Oliver said. "It's how you win the presidency."

The agency has launched a new effort, dubbed Operation Tech Trap, to end online scams where customers are tricked into believing their computers are infected with a virus and that they must pay a third party to solve the issue. The fraud involves scammers running deceptive pop-up ads that look like security alerts from Apple or Microsoft.

Even though it's only been a short while, Asus is already making a variation of that mobo, the ROG Crosshair VI Hero Wi-Fi AC. Like the name implies, the major feature over the previous model is the presence of a 802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi adapter with MU-MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1 support. The Wi-Fi capabilities are nice on their own, but let's take a good look at everything that Asus crammed on a stylish black PCB. Let's start with the back side. The Crosshair VI Hero comes with a truckload of peripheral connectivity: eight USB 3.0 ports, four USB 2.0 connectors, and two USB 3.1 ports, in both Type-A and Type-C formats. If those aren't enough, there are additional USB headers mid-board, including pins for another two front-panel USB 3.1 ports. Maybe, just maybe you won't need a USB hub The board comes with no display outputs, though we figure that anyone buying a mobo of this caliber will have the dedicated graphics card to match. The fancy Wi-Fi connectivity isn't the only network accoutrement present, either—there's an Intel I211-AT Gigabit Ethernet controller to go with it. The five audio ports at the back are powered by a Realtek S1220 codec coupled with an ESS Sabre ES9023 DAC with an integrated 2V RMS op-amp. Liquid cooling enthusiasts will find a bevy of fan connectors, plus a set of headers specifically for pump control and monitoring. Since liquid cooling implies overclocking more often than not, Asus added onboard start, reset, and mode control buttons and switches to help in that endeavor. An M.2 PCIe x4 socket, eight SATA ports, and two Aura Sync RGB LED headers complement the package. The ROG Crosshair VI Hero Wi-Fi AC hasn't hit stateside stores just yet. Its antenna-devoid cousin is currently going for $255, so we'd expect the Wi-Fi version to cost a bit more than that.

News provided by Bsquare Corporation 15 May, 2017, 16:05 ET Share this article BELLEVUE, Wash., May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Bsquare Corporation (NASDAQ: BSQR) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Jerry Chase, Bsquare President and CEO, commented, "We continue to be pleased with the strong performance of DataV, our Internet of Things software offering, in deployments with large customers including a Fortune 500 company. This has led to timely payments, positive feedback, and additional opportunities with new and existing customers. "During the first quarter we recognized $3.0 million in DataV revenue at high gross margin levels. We believe being early adopters of new software revenue recognition standards puts us ahead of the curve and is beneficial for the company and our shareholders. Further, during the quarter we announced six new DataV product applications, which we expect to speed and simplify time-to-value for our customers. We continued to add to our R&D, sales, marketing and customer solutions groups based on our positive outlook." Q1 2017 Financial Highlights Total revenue for the quarter was $22.8 million, down 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and down 10% from the first quarter of 2016. Q1 revenue included $3.0 million in DataV software and services revenue. Net income for the quarter was $0.2 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.10 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016 and net income of $0.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDAS* was $0.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a decrease of $0.6 million from the first quarter of 2016. Our cash and investments at March 31, 2017 totaled $31.0 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from December 31, 2016. Three Months Ended 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 3/31/2016 Revenue: Third-party Software $ 16,797 $ 23,751 $ 19,917 Proprietary Software 2,654 301 250 Prof. Engineering Services 3,390 2,745 5,272 Total Revenue 22,841 26,797 25,439 Total Gross Profit 6,253 3,954 4,296 Gross Margins: Third-party Software 16 % 15 % 14 % Prof. Engineering Services 27 % 7 % 24 % Proprietary Software 99 % 82 % 56 % Total Gross Margin 27 % 15 % 17 % Total Operating Expenses 6,212 5,261 3,647 Net Income (Loss) $ 202 $ (1,261) $ 500 Per Share-Diluted $ 0.02 $ (0.10) $ 0.04 Adjusted EBITDAS* $ 593 $ (812) $ 1,213 Cash and Investments EoQ (includes $250,000 long-term at 3/31/2016) $ 30,984 $ 33,200 $ 27,876 Notes: *Adjusted EBITDAS = Income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDAS is a non-GAAP measurement (reconciliation provided after financial statement tables). Financial Commentary on First Quarter 2017 Results (Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016) DataV software and services revenues of $3.0 million were recognized in Q1 compared to $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016; we achieved project acceptance from PACCAR Inc. during the quarter, allowing for the recognition of $2.5 million in license fees and $0.5 million in customization fees under ASC 606; Revenue from third-party software was $16.8 million, a decrease of 29% from $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to a more competitive environment following the end of Microsoft's volume purchase programs on December 31, 2016 and strong sales of Microsoft software in the fourth quarter of 2016 ahead of related pricing changes; Professional engineering services revenue increased $0.6 million, or 23%, to $3.4 million, while engineering services margin increased by 20 percentage points to 27%. The margin increase resulted from higher engineering utilization rates and lower management overhead following the 2016 restructuring efforts; and Operating expenses increased approximately $1.0 million, or 18%, primarily due to increased DataV-related investments in R&D ($510,000) and sales and marketing expenses ($110,000), in addition to higher general and administrative spending ($330,000) associated with driving the DataV growth. Additional DataV Metrics (Including Non-GAAP Measures) We did not record any new DataV bookings during the quarter (bookings is a non-GAAP measure, defined as the contract value of new agreements signed with customers); cash receipts from DataV contracts totaled $1.3 million. DataV backlog (a non-GAAP measure defined as total DataV bookings less DataV revenue recognized to date) was $3.2 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $5.7 million at December 31, 2016. Total deferred revenue at March 31, 2017 was $2.0 million, compared to $3.9 million at December 31, 2016. The March 31, 2017 balance included DataV deferred revenue of $1.6 million, all classified as current. The deferred revenue balances relating to our DataV sales do not represent the total contract value of our DataV agreements. DataV unbilled deferred revenue (which is a non-GAAP measure) was an additional $0.1 million at March 31, 2017 and $2.5 million at December 31, 2016, representing future contract billings that have not been invoiced, and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Bookings, backlog and unbilled deferred revenue are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures have been included because management believes they provide meaningful information related to our new DataV product sales, since revenue may be recognized in different periods than those in which orders have been received or cash has been collected. Q2 2017 Outlook Management currently has the following expectations for Q2 2017: Revenue in the range of $18.5 to $20 million; DataV revenue recognized in the quarter will not be significant; Management has successfully closed a number of paid pilots with new and existing customers in the second quarter;  additional pilots are expected to close; Blended gross margin in the 16.5% to 18% range due to reduced third-party software margins reflecting lower levels of rebates from Microsoft's volume reseller programs and lower DataV revenue recognition; and A net loss in Q2 due to lower revenue and continued investments to grow DataV.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAS is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation expense on fixed assets and amortization expense (including impairment) on intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDAS should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (all as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position and cash flows, as Adjusted EBITDAS is not defined by GAAP. However, BSQUARE regards Adjusted EBITDAS as a complement to net income and other GAAP financial performance measures, including an indirect measure of operating cash flow.   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bsquare-reports-first-quarter-2017-financial-results-300457743.html SOURCE Bsquare Corporation Related Links http://www.bsquare.com 11 Feb, 2016, 16:10 ET Preview: Bsquare Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Results My News Release contains wide tables.

Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025 - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 15 May, 2017, 16:15 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Internet of Things (IoT) In Retail Market Analysis By Solution, By Hardware (Beacons, RFID Tags, Sensors, Wearables), By Service, By Technology (Bluetooth Low Energy, Near Field Communication, ZigBee), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025" report to their offering. The global IoT in retail market is expected to reach USD 94.44 billion by 2025 This growth can be attributed to the merging of digital and in-store operations in retail stores. Digital channels are becoming an important touchpoint for an Omni channel experience. Retailers are focusing on gaining a competitive advantage by installing smart shelves and RFID sensors, which detect low inventory and track products throughout the respective supply chain. The adoption of IoT also helps retailers to revolutionize the delivery operations and retail supply chain. The increasing Internet of Things spending in retail sectors for the purpose of premises monitoring, product monitoring, supply chain monitoring, and customer monitoring is driving the demand for IoT-based solutions. Cloud-based IoT solutions are enabling retailers to monitor and analyze the existing processes to improve them with incremental investments in capital equipment. However, with the rising degree of IoT penetration, retailers are still struggling on capitalizing IoT-enabled capabilities. The retail Internet of Things market is expected to witness promising growth as the industry is evolving from the passive approach of monitoring consumer behavior. Optimizing and automating supply chain is one of the key factors for the adoption of connected technology among retailers. However, fragmented technology standards and increasing security concerns are expected to hamper the industry growth. Further key findings from the report suggest: The retail IoT software is expected to be the fastest-growing segment owing to the increasing adoption of retail analytics solutions Beacons are expected to grow at a CAGR of over 24%. This growth can be attributed to its increasing adoption for enhancing customer in-store experience Professional services are expected to dominate the market over the forecast period Solution providers are focusing on providing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Payment-as-a-Service (PaaS) to retailers. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is expected to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period as this technology is gaining prominence in pre-tailing, payments, and post-payments operations. Latin America is expected to reach a revenue share of over 12% by 2025 due to the demand for innovation in infrastructure technology in retail outlets The key industry players include Intel Corporation, Impinj Inc., RetailNext Inc., Allerin Tech Pvt.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ernst & Young Announces Big Switch Networks’ Douglas Murray and Kyle Forster as EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2017 Northern California Finalists Murray and Forster Move From Semifinalists to Finalists, Selected for Extraordinary Success in Innovation, Financial Performance and Personal Commitment to Big Switch SANTA CLARA, CA–(Marketwired – May 15, 2017) – Big Switch Networks, The Next-Generation Data Center Networking Company, today announced Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks and Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks were named finalists for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2017 Northern California Region Award. After being named semifinalists in April 2017, alongside nearly 50 other nominees, Murray and Forster have been selected as finalists by a panel of independent judges for their respective contributions to and guidance of Big Switch. Prior winners for Northern California include Reid Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, Nick Woodman of GoPro, Andreas Bechtolsheim and Jayshree Ullal of Arista Networks and James Park of Fitbit. Northern California award winners will be announced at a black tie gala event on June 23rd. Under Murray’s guidance, Big Switch has experienced 40+% average QoQ growth for the last 12 quarters. Since he joined the company in late 2013, headcount has doubled and will have tripled by the end of 2017 to support growing market demand for Big Switch’s products. Prior to joining Big Switch, Murray ran Juniper Networks’ Asia Pacific, Japan and Greater China organization, where he was responsible for all aspects of Juniper’s business across the region. Previously he held executive positions at Extreme Networks, Sun Microsystems, as well as his first start-up, Sanrise. He started his career at AT&T as an Account Executive and was part of the AT&T Leadership Development Program. Murray has also been a guest lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on the topic of entrepreneurialism. „I am honored to be named an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California finalist, and thrilled to be nominated alongside Kyle. I am humbled by the recognition as we move from semi-finalist selection to finalist.” said Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks. „Kyle is the embodiment of entrepreneurialism and made a huge bet in starting Big Switch with Guido. I’ve never been more proud of the collective work of incredibly smart people, and it is my honor to lead this amazing organization.” Kyle Forster founded Big Switch in 2010, starting the company with longtime friend Guido Appenzeller, who at the time was the head of Stanford University’s Clean Slate Lab, a pioneer of the research that became known as SDN. Forster raised the initial financing, refined the initial ‚One Big Switch’ product vision, helped recruit the early engineering team and found the company’s first customers. Prior to Big Switch, he spent the formative years of his career at Cisco where he brought three products from concept to revenue and received six patents for cellular, wireless LAN and security inventions. Forster watched as hyperscale companies like Facebook and Google started developing their own networking technologies, out-innovating the legacy vendors’ expensive, proprietary solutions. In the early Stanford research, Forster saw an opportunity to bring hyperscale-inspired design to the broader enterprise community and disrupt what was becoming an increasingly stagnant $50B+ networking industry. „I am thrilled and humbled to have been selected as a finalist for EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California from the pool of truly remarkable semifinalists. To be nominated alongside Doug makes this recognition all the more meaningful,” said Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks. „Doug was born to lead, and there is no one who deserves this recognition more. His leadership of the company has been synonymous with Big Switch’s success.” Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by the the company’s 156% YoY growth in its most recent quarter. In 2016 it more than doubled its customer count and is on track to do the same for 2017. In 2016, Big Switch established a dedicated presence in China as well as EMEA and ANZ regions to support global demand for its products. Additionally, Big Switch has more than a dozen customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses. Customers are located in more than 25 countries, in verticals that include: technology, financial services, government, retail, automotive, media, telecom and higher education. Big Switch has raised $94M in funding from firms including: Index Ventures, Silver Lake Waterman, Khosla Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, Intel Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint, TriplePoint Ventures and more. In 2017 Big Switch was named for the third consecutive year to JMP Securities Super 60 List as well as to CRN’s 2017 SDDC 50 and Data Center 100 lists. Big Switch has also been certified a Great Place to Work from the GPTW Institute, with the company receiving a 93% overall employee satisfaction rating. Now celebrating its 31st year, the EY awards program recognizes entrepreneurs in over 145 cities and 60 countries who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in such areas as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities.

Kyle Forster founded Big Switch in 2010, starting the company with longtime friend Guido Appenzeller, who at the time was the head of Stanford University's Clean Slate Lab, a pioneer of the research that became known as SDN. Forster raised the initial financing, refined the initial 'One Big Switch' product vision, helped recruit the early engineering team and found the company's first customers. Prior to Big Switch, he spent the formative years of his career at Cisco where he brought three products from concept to revenue and received six patents for cellular, wireless LAN and security inventions. Forster watched as hyperscale companies like Facebook and Google started developing their own networking technologies, out-innovating the legacy vendors' expensive, proprietary solutions. In the early Stanford research, Forster saw an opportunity to bring hyperscale-inspired design to the broader enterprise community and disrupt what was becoming an increasingly stagnant $50B+ networking industry. "I am thrilled and humbled to have been selected as a finalist for EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California from the pool of truly remarkable semifinalists. To be nominated alongside Doug makes this recognition all the more meaningful," said Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks. "Doug was born to lead, and there is no one who deserves this recognition more. His leadership of the company has been synonymous with Big Switch's success." Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by the the company's 156% YoY growth in its most recent quarter. In 2016 it more than doubled its customer count and is on track to do the same for 2017. In 2016, Big Switch established a dedicated presence in China as well as EMEA and ANZ regions to support global demand for its products. Additionally, Big Switch has more than a dozen customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses. Customers are located in more than 25 countries, in verticals that include: technology, financial services, government, retail, automotive, media, telecom and higher education. Big Switch has raised $94M in funding from firms including: Index Ventures, Silver Lake Waterman, Khosla Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, Intel Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint, TriplePoint Ventures and more.

Does the search giant have enough firepower to overtake Amazon? We'll find out this week at Google I/O. Smart Home by Richard Nieva May 15, 2017 6:00 AM PDT @richardjnieva Enlarge Image This week, Google is expected to reveal what's next for its Google Home and Assistant. Taylor Martin/CNET A few days before Google CEO Sundar Pichai stepped on stage at the 2016 I/O developer conference, he told me about the Assistant, a digital helper that could do things for you like play a song, give you flight information or tell you what's on your calendar. Pichai also gave credit where credit was due. One of the devices the Assistant would inhabit is Google Home, a smart speaker that aims to capitalize on the success of the Amazon Echo. "There are areas where we will be ahead," Pichai said of following Amazon to the market. "And there will be areas where someone points a way and we do it." On Wednesday, Pichai returns to Shoreline Amphitheater -- basically Google's backyard in Mountain View, California -- almost a year after introducing the world to the Assistant and Google Home. He's expected to talk about a range of things including virtual reality and Android, Google's mobile operating system at Google I/O. And he's also due to give us an update on the Assistant, a rival to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. It might not make any difference to you whether you're barking orders at a device made by Google or Amazon, just as long as it gives you an accurate weather report or reads out the top headlines of the hour. But the stakes are high for tech companies looking to take over your living room. Home is where you binge on TV and movies, get ready for work, eat, cook, sleep and shop online. All of that activity is potentially data that tech giants including Google and Amazon want to get their hands on. The better they know you, the more they'll (eventually) be able to woo advertisers or get you to buy things. It's not like we don't have any options. Right now, Google is a distant second in the smart speaker market. So far, people overwhelmingly have picked the Amazon Echo, introduced in 2014, as the smart home hub of choice, according to research firm eMarketer. In the US, of the 35.6 million people who use a voice-enabled speaker once a month, more than 70 percent use a product from the Echo line, which has several variations, including the $150 original Echo and $50 Echo Dot. Google Home, which right now sells for $115, has almost 24 percent. Google declined to comment. An Amazon spokeswoman said it's "great to see people excited" about smart home hubs. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do 'Pressure on Google' Competition is only going to get more fierce. Last week, Amazon introduced its latest Echo product, the $230 Echo Show, which includes a screen for video calling. Microsoft is also bringing its Cortana digital assistant software to smart speakers, partnering with manufacturers including Samsung's Harman Kardon, Intel and HP. That means for Google, the clock is ticking. Once people bring a smart speaker like the Echo into their house, they're unlikely to switch to a competitor, according to a study by VoiceLabs. Only 11 percent would consider making that jump. "It does put a certain amount of pressure on Google," said Victoria Petrock, a principal analyst at eMarketer. "Amazon came out very early and aggressively." But she and other analysts think Google has a good shot at pulling ahead of Amazon. That's because while Alexa, the digital assistant that powers the Echo, is an unexpected hit, Google may have a formidable edge -- the trove of data that comes with 18 years of being a search company. Think about everything you confide to Google: your emails (Gmail), your whereabouts and favorite hangouts (Maps), your work schedule (Calendar), your love of Steph Curry highlights (YouTube), your favorite recipes (Search), your weird fascination with anglerfish (Search, again), or your obsession with World War I trivia (Search is really powerful). If Google leverages all that personal data the right way, Home could offer a better experience than the Echo. (CNET Reviews -- independent from its news department -- last month gave the nod to Home, after previously going with the Echo.) "Google has some natural advantages because of the information people are willing to share with them," said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research. And Google also has the software chops to pull it off. "It's a whole level of invisible engineering a lot of us don't appreciate," he said. Last month, Google announced multiaccount support for the assistant. That means Home can recognize more than one voice and surface personal information, preferences, calendar items and other stuff based on who's talking. On a conference call earlier this month, Pichai called the feature a "game-changer." We'll see if it is. eMarketer's Petrock calls it "a very important step." At this week's Google I/O (last year's event drew 7,000 developers), we'll hear what Pichai's next steps are -- and if they're strides, jumps or stumbles.

As part of the $1 trillion omnibus spending package, Congress approved almost $7 billion in assistance to address cascading disasters from the Middle East refugee crisis to food shortages in Africa. The single largest increase in the bill was the almost $1 billion of new money for famine relief. This new funding is important not only for the people it will help, but also for the bipartisan support marshalled to get it through Congress.  First and foremost, the deal is critical because of the lives it will save. The global humanitarian situation is on the cusp of what the medical profession refers to as an “acute on chronic” situation. This occurs when a patient with a chronic illness experiences the sudden onset of another medical crisis that together result in the rapid deterioration in the patient’s overall condition. In this particular case, the chronic condition is the global refugee and displacement crisis, which has seen some 65 million people forced from their homes. Most of displaced come from war torn countries and are in a situation of protracted displacement that is expected to last a decade or more on average. ADVERTISEMENT The acute condition is the most serious food security crisis in the modern era that could impact at least 20 million people.  Famine was declared in South Sudan this year, after emerging in parts of Nigeria at the end of 2016. Somalia and Yemen are set to be next. This is the first time in decades that so many large-scale hunger crises have occurred at once. Importantly, $990 million of the new money for humanitarian assistance in the omnibus will go to severe food shortages in these countries. This is critical, as the United Nations has only a fraction of $4.4 billion it needs to address the crisis. Second, the budget agreement will improve our national security. Refugees fleeing in historic numbers – particularly the Syrian caseload – are destabilizing neighboring countries, changing the domestic politics of U.S. allies and threatening the integrity of the European project. In three of the four countries beset by famine, transnational terrorist organizations are driving or thriving in the same conflict that threatens the food supply. Mass starvation will generate further state collapse, thereby opening more space for the terrorists to operate. Third, the agreement demonstrates that congressional Republicans and Democrats can come together to resist attempts by the Trump administration to unilaterally disarm the very civilian tools and agencies we need to address these crises. The Trump administration’s so-called skinny budget for 2018 calls for massive cuts in civilian assistance across the State Department and USAID. Ironically, it even zeros out the budget line for the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS) established in 1985 to detect the very type of mass starvation now breaking out across Africa.  The humanitarian portion of the omnibus constitutes a repudiation of the administration’s vision. In addition to the funding levels, the bill requires the administration to consult with Congress before closing down offices or programs in USAID and the State Department. Republicans on Capitol Hill are showing a new willingness to stand up for America’s role as a global humanitarian leader in the face of Trump’s assault on civilian power. Republican Sens. Bob CorkerBob CorkerGOP senators lukewarm to lawmaker leading FBI GOP strategist: GOP would have 'rightly' tried to impeach Clinton for classified disclosure GOP rep. promises to ‘raise issue surrounding disclosure’ in House Intel Committee MORE (Tenn.) and Todd YoungTodd YoungCongress must reenergize bipartisan consensus on humanitarian priorities GOP senators on Comey firing: Where they stand Senate nixes Obama-era retirement rule MORE (Ind.) reportedly played key roles in securing the new money for famine relief. That sort of leadership will be essential in the weeks and months to come.  However, much remains to be done. The first step will be to pressure the Trump administration to spend the funding. The almost $1 billion in famine assistance is currently being held up at the Office for Management and Budget. Some in the relief community are concerned that the administration is playing games with this money to set the stage for deeper cuts in the FY 2018 budget. But the food security of 20 million people cannot be held hostage to budgetary maneuvering. The next step will be to reenergize the bipartisan consensus on humanitarian priorities that made the omnibus possible. The Trump administration’s full budget proposal is slated for release on May 23 and congressional budget resolutions for FY2018 are expected as early as June. The White House has made clear that its priorities would be better reflected in the budget for 2018.  So support from both sides of the aisle will be essential to protecting even basic elements of America’s humanitarian response architecture, such as FEWS.   The omnibus was only the first skirmish in what promises to be a long fight over the future of American soft power. What’s important is that Democrats and Republicans work together to prioritize assistance for the over 85 million people fleeing conflict and facing potential starvation. In doing so, they set an example of cooperation required to push back against worst impulses of the Trump administration. These are the world’s most vulnerable. Caring for them is both the right thing to do by our values and the smart thing to do for our security.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Millennial fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff: 'Our consumer chose us' by Haley Draznin   @haleydraz May 15, 2017: 5:23 PM ET Millennial fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff: 'Our consumer chose us' She's a millennial, designing for a millennial. Rebecca Minkoff calls her eponymous company the largest global brand in fashion with a designer the same age and sex as her main consumers. "I'm going through the same life moments that my exact customer is going through," Minkoff told CNN's Poppy Harlow in a new Boss Files podcast. "If she's on the younger side of the millennial, then I know what she's about to go through. I'm so much closer to it than someone who might be older and kind of designed for a different generation." She's disrupting the fashion industry, merging tech with fashion, and building her company with her brother, Uri Minkoff. Minkoff, 36, leaned on her brother for support, after being turned down from her father, when she launched the company in 2001. "I was at that point where I was like, 'I can't fund this with my odd jobs anymore.' I was a stylist as well. And so that is when I called my father, and I said. 'I finally am on to something. I've got real orders, there's a heat behind this. Will you help me?' And he said, 'no, but try your brother,'" Minkoff said. Minkoff wasn't an overnight success. She said it was a major challenge to get recognized in the industry, which she has described as a "dictatorship." "I think that when we first started out, there were 10 key buyers, 10 key editors, and if they deemed you the right designer, the most talented, then you became part of the circle," Minkoff said. "I think that we're here because of our consumer, our consumer chose us. I began to talk to her online when no one else would." Listen: Download Boss Files on iTunes Early on, the designer connected with her customers in blog posts and later on social media -- building a following that was coined "The Minkettes." But Minkoff got some pushback from players in the industry who advised her to not engage with the people blogging and talking about her brand on social media. "We had sit downs with heads of department stores saying, 'Don't talk to these women. That's beneath you. You should be in your ivory tower.' When we first started working with bloggers, [we said] we actually think that there's something here, and we think that this is probably how fashion and storytelling and content will actually evolve," Minkoff said. Today, the brand has more than 800,000 followers on both Instagram and Twitter, and Minkoff said theirs was the first fashion brand on Snapchat. Minkoff became the first designer to live-stream her fashion show in virtual reality, and she incorporates drones to get aerial footage of the runway. And Minkoff designed wearable technology like device charging bracelets, and built in a self-checkout option in her retail stores. More recently, Minkoff installed interactive "smart" mirrors in stores' fitting rooms "to give customers an e-commerce experience in a brick-and-mortar environment." Users are able to adjust the lighting to match the time of day they plan to wear the item. Radio Frequency Identification tags on each item prompt the system to automatically pull up other items of interest on the mirror's screen with the hope consumers will click and try on additional items. "We as a retailer can look in and see what didn't she buy? What is pairing with what? Is there a fit issue? Is it a fabric issue? And you get enormous intel into what's going on in there without cameras," Minkoff said. She said the brand's sales have been up 30% year over since that implementation. More Boss Files: Spanx founder says it's fun to make money and to give it away Minkoff is committed to motivating girls and women in tech, partnering with Intel on STEM initiatives, joining boards of female-led companies and launching a venture capital firm to invest in more female entrepreneurs. She said she and her brother wanted to "put some money down and get our skin in the game and help these companies actually get started." Sixteen years in -- many in the fashion world are asking if going public is the next step for Minkoff's company. "We're not ready or even close to being ready to go public. I think that we're still on a great growth journey," Minkoff said. "There's still so much we haven't done."

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army Photo) VIEW ORIGINAL ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. (November 5, 2015) -- In serving as the one-stop-shop for the Army's tactical commercial commercial off-the-shelf information technology (COTS IT) hardware, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program is taking a holistic, innovative approach that is getting noticed. Recent undertakings resulted in increased efficiencies, significant cost avoidance and official designation as the primary organization to oversee tactical commercial off-the-shelf information technology (COTS IT) hardware procurement for the Army. CHS provides state-of-the-art computing and networking equipment that improves connectivity, interoperability, logistics and maintenance support to Soldiers, and is available for use by all DoD and Federal Agencies. "We've always got to be looking ahead to understand where technology is going, how we can benefit from that, and at the same time reduce capability gaps created through end-of-life hardware," said Breck Tarr, deputy product leader for CHS. "Other contract vehicles are not designed like CHS is, to be able to help [program offices] match their requirements to the COTS IT that they're going to buy." In April, Heidi Shyu, the assistant secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, signed a memorandum designating CHS as the primary organization to oversee tactical commercial hardware procurement. This designation enabled CHS to coordinate with 16 Army programs, an average of one per week since the memo was published. By working with these programs on their forecasted tactical requirements for COTS IT, CHS is able to identify and provide alternative hardware configurations that already exist on the CHS contract. CHS gains efficiencies by coordinating across programs and leveraging common configurations. They examine the schedule to determine when each program is planning to make hardware procurements, and by consolidating those requirements with other program offices that are making similar purchases during the same timeframe, they successfully save the Army time and money. "Our role is to enable supported Army and Department of Defense program offices to meet expedited fieldings and compressed schedules while mitigating costs," said Bill Gehrum, strategic initiatives lead for CHS. "We help programs to effectively meet their fielding requirements, to train Soldiers, to contribute toward the development of technical manuals, and to provide product support services in support of CHS hardware across a program's total lifecycle. We work with program offices to help them identify and subsequently procure those COTS IT hardware configurations and support services that will meet their needs." This consolidated acquisition approach can design, develop, modify, ruggedize, environmentally test, procure, support and provide configuration management for hardware systems, all while using a single contract action and a single part number. Take laptops for example. "The internal components may be different," Gehrum said. "But if you have the same look and feel of the laptop, then that potentially reduces the overall burden for the field and minimizes field support training and tracking of hardware component configurations because you have fewer variations in the field, which in turn reduces the amount of documentation you have to provide for these systems." While CHS works diligently alongside other Army programs, they also have unique partnerships with outside vendors. In FY15 alone, CHS hosted 19 vendor roadmap presentations. These roadmaps allow opportunity for CHS, as well as engineers from supported Army programs such as Project Manager Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) and Project Manager Mission Command (MC), to learn what each vendor is doing in terms of new technology. More importantly, the roadmaps are designed so that programs can plan how to leverage future technologies to meet their respective cost, schedule and performance requirements, and reduce hardware capability gaps. These roadmaps, in part, led to the selection of the various hardware configurations that comprise the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI). TSI will serve as a key enabling component of Operations and Intelligence (Op/Intel) convergence. By allowing Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System-Army (PM DCGS-A) and Project Manager Mission Command (PM MC) to cohost their capabilities as part of the Common Operating Environment TSI will reduce the burden on Soldiers who in the past had to train on separate systems, field separate systems and sustain them. As part of the TSI effort, the 26 stakeholders that comprise the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE), are leveraging the engineering expertise and contractual vehicle of CHS to support the TSI hardware configurations. Using feedback from Soldiers during the Army's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) exercises, for example, the CP CE utilizes CHS to make configuration changes based on new technologies before they are fielded. "Part of the goodness of CHS is that we can leverage multiple orders over a period of time for the same equipment," Gehrum said. "If you're ordering large quantities of a particular hardware configuration item, we can help to reduce the cost to programs tremendously, as opposed to every program buying individual server stacks." In addition to reducing costs, a common configuration for the server stacks enhances communication among programs, and eliminates the need for providing separate manuals and training to Soldiers. CHS also successfully executed a large buy for the U.S. Marines Corps (USMC) that included 1,100 Dell Rugged 14 laptops and 1,041 Dell 512Gb Solid State Drives in support of Mobile Tactical Shelter integration efforts scheduled to begin in spring 2016. By using CHS, the USMC is able to maintain interoperability with systems fielded by other program offices including Product Leader Fire Support Command and Control (PdL FSC2). As a result of the expedited contracting processes and demonstrated configuration control available through CHS, the Marines are planning to return for a future buy of additional hard drives and spare batteries at the beginning of the calendar year. Finally, Project Leader Network Enablers (PL Net E), which CHS is assigned to, has developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD). This establishes a program through which CHS and Tobyhanna collaborate to repair out-of-warranty CHS hardware. Tobyhanna has the capability to repair 78 of those part items, giving units and programs offices an alternative means to replace their hardware. "The CHS team will continue proactively collaborating with program offices to meet their COTS IT requirements while working to maximize efficiencies for the Army," said Tarr.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Connect Multiple External Monitors to Your Laptop By Michael Crider on May 15th, 2017 Multiple monitors are awesome. They really are—ask anyone who’s used a two- or three-screen setup for their desktop, and they’ll tell you that they have a hard time going back to just one. Laptops have a built-in advantage here, since they have one screen: to boost productivity, just add a monitor. RELATED ARTICLE How to Use Multiple Monitors to Be More Productive But what if you want more than one screen hooked up to your notebook at once? What if your laptop lacks a bunch of external video ports? What if you’re travelling, and you can’t lug around a full-sized monitor? Don’t worry, you still have more options than you might think. The Ideal Solution for Newer Laptops: Thunderbolt Thunderbolt 3, which uses the new USB Type-C connector standard, is the newest way for laptops and tablets to output video. The advantages are obvious: a single cable can handle video, audio, standard data transmission (for external hard drives or a wired Internet connection) and power, all at the same time. Not only does this reduce clutter on your desk—assuming you have the hardware to take advantage of it, of course—it means laptops can be made smaller and thinner by consolidating ports. So, if you have a laptop with Thunderbolt 3 and a Thunderbolt-capable monitor, this is by far the best solution. You can just hook up each monitor to one Thunderbolt/USB-C port. However, it’s rarely that simple. Unless you have a very new laptop and very new monitors, you’ll probably need a bit more to make this work: If you have a laptop with multiple Thunderbolt/USB-C ports but older monitors that don’t have Thunderbolt input, you’ll need some sort of adapter for each monitor, like this USB-C to HDMI or this USB-C to DVI adapter. Remember, you’ll need one adapter for each monitor you’re connecting. If your laptop only has one Thunderbolt/USB-C port, you’ll likely need some sort of docking station to connect two monitors to one port. We recommend checking out this Dell Thunderbolt Dock, though there are others out there as well. Note that some laptops, like the small one-port MacBook, do not support running multiple displays from one port using these docks, so check your laptop’s specifications, and if you’re going to try a dock, buy from a store with a good return policy in case it doesn’t work. Thunderbolt has a massive amount of video bandwidth, and it’s more that capable of supporting multiple standard monitors (the new Macbook Pros can output to two 5K displays at once, so long as you have the right adapters). Specialized adapters—basically mini-laptop docks—are designed for the purpose of regular docking to a multi-monitor setup with mice, keyboard, and other connections. Once USB-C and Thunderbolt become more common on laptops and monitors, it’ll be the best option around for connecting to just about any kind of video output. That may take a while, since some manufacturers (like Microsoft) seem oddly hesitant to adopt the standard. For Most Older Laptops: Get a Display Splitter Box If you have an even slightly older laptop, it probably doesn’t have Thunderbolt/USB-C, instead sporting a VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort port. This will let you easily add an external monitor, but if you want to connect two, things get more complicated. Most laptops only have a single video-out option, with a rare few (like some of Lenovo’s ThinkPad line or older Macbook Pros) offering multiple ports. It’s sometimes possible to use two ports at once for multiple external monitors, but this is rare, as manufacturers tend to expect you to use your laptop’s screen and a monitor together. So you’ll likely have to turn to a third-party solution, like the Matrox line of dual- and triple-head docks, which use a single video cable to output to multiple monitors. These are a bit expensive, but they’re probably the best solution for most people. Just keep in mind that they’ll be limited by your laptop’s graphics card, so if you have integrated graphics, don’t expect to run a bunch of 4K displays without problems. A Cheaper, but Less-Than-Ideal Option: USB Adapters If those multi-port docking stations are just too much money for you, there is a cheaper option. While older versions of the Universal Serial Bus standard weren’t designed to handle video-out, since version 2.0 companies have made handy adapters that can turn any USB port into a monitor-out port—like this USB-to-HDMI adapter from Cable Matters. The vast majority of these adapters are using Intel’s DisplayLink technology. This option has a lot of advantages. Not only is it an easy way to get video-out on almost any modern Windows or macOS machine, it’s inexpensive, portable, and expandable. It’s possible, at least technically, to add as many monitors as your laptop has USB ports in this fashion. However, USB video-out adapters basically function as their own low-power graphics cards, and they have a bigger hit on system resources like processor cycles and RAM than a standard external display. Most laptops will start to show serious performance issues if you try to add two or more monitors in this fashion. For quick and cheap multiple monitor setups, it’s best to combine your laptop’s own screen, one monitor attached with HDMI/DisplayPort/DVI, and one on a USB adapter. A Semi-Permanent Solution for Business and Gaming Laptops: Docking Stations We covered this briefly under Thunderbolt, but a docking station is a popular alternative to multiple adapters for power users. These gadgets usually aren’t made for specific laptop or tablet models unless they’re explicitly business-oriented; examples include Dell’s Latitude line, Lenovo ThinkPads, and Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets. USB-only alternatives are available, but generally less powerful—more expensive options offer more flexible video ports. A model-specific expansion dock with multiple video outputs might do if you want to keep your laptop mobile with the minimum amount of setup and teardown time at your desk. RELATED ARTICLE The Best Ways to Connect an External Graphics Card to Your Laptop A more specialized version of this idea is the external graphics card. These gadgets are really cool, because they let you hook up a full desktop-class GPU to a laptop and output to as many monitors as that card can support—usually three or four, for the mid-range options from NVIDIA and ATI. This external housing holds a graphics card and its own power supply, outputting to as many monitors as the desktop GPU can support. Unfortunately, these are both limited (typically restricted to only a few models of laptop from a single manufacturer like Razer) and expensive, with docks costing $300 or more without the card that goes into them. They also require a USB 3.0 or ThunderBolt port to operate. External GPUs should become a more viable option in the future, but for the time being most consumers can only use them if they’re prepared to buy a whole new laptop and a dock and a graphics card at the same time, a $2000 investment on the low end.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Concerns about ransomware attacks loom By Li Zhou 05/15/17 10:02 AM EDT With help from Brent Griffiths and Eric Geller CONCERNS ABOUT CYBERATTACKS CONTINUE — A global ransomware assault that began on Friday — affecting more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries — could continue to infect systems today as the work week gets started, The Wall Street Journal reports. “Cybersecurity experts are expecting another wave of computer-system attacks that encrypt files and demand ransom to unlock them [today] as companies and government agencies are seeking to restore normal operations and figure out the roots of the attack. ...The attacks affect only computers running Microsoft Corp.’s Windows that haven’t installed the security patch that the company released in March, or the emergency patch it released for older Windows systems over the weekend.” Story Continued Below — The Trump administration hastily held emergency meetings huddling about the cyberattacks on Friday and Saturday, Pro Cyber’s Eric Geller reports. “On Friday, when the attacks started spreading throughout Europe and Asia, White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert chaired a meeting of the federal government’s so-called Cyber Response Group, which helps agencies coordinate their reactions to digital assaults, a source familiar with the matter told POLITICO.” — Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith slammed governments’ “stockpiling of vulnerabilities,” noting that exploits used in this attack were “drawn from the exploits stolen from the National Security Agency” and that leaks of such information can be disastrous. “Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage,” he wrote in a post on the company’s blog. “An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.” ALL EYES (STILL) ON NET NEUTRALITY — After garnering more than a million comments since its debut, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to undo Title II — the regulatory underpinning of net neutrality — is scheduled to get a vote at the agency’s open meeting this Thursday. In addition to rolling back the classification of internet service providers as common carriers, the plan also seeks comment on the bright-line rules that prohibit ISPs from engaging in blocking, throttling or paid prioritization of online traffic and content. — The comment period for the proposal is open until mid-August, something that House Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats have urged Pai to extend, given the fact that many people may be on vacation at the time. Responses so far have been highly polarized, with Republicans broadly welcoming the repeal of Title II and Democrats arguing that the Obama-era reclassification offers a legal foundation that’s vital to maintaining the net neutrality rules as they are. We’re tracking. — Protests at Pai’s: Disgruntled at Pai's net neutrality moves, activists protested his proposal outside the chairman's house on Sunday. About 17 people lined the entrance to Pai's Arlington, Virginia driveway — holding a large "Save The Internet" banner and signs that included references to an old Eminem song, POLITICO Pro intern Brent Griffiths reports. If this sounds familiar, it's because the group Popular Resistance used similar tactics when then-chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, grappled with the issue in 2014. Unlike at Wheeler’s Georgetown home, there was no sign of Pai or anyone else coming or going while the protesters were there. Activists plan on showing up every day this week until the FCC’s Thursday meeting. They are also planning demonstrations outside the agency’s headquarters on Tuesday and again on the day of the vote.

TECHIE FOR CA GOVERNOR? — And no, this time the rumors aren’t about Mark Zuckerberg. In a column for the San Francisco Chronicle, former SF mayor Willie Brown highlighted Y-Combinator President Sam Altman as another techie who’s considering a potential political career. “He is a 32-year-old tech investor and app innovator who believes that if used right, technology can help bring an end to income inequality and a host of other social and economic problems. And he’s looking at running for governor in 2018, a race that [Gavin] Newsom is already in,” Brown writes. “Altman [said] that he isn’t planning on running a traditional campaign and that if he gets in, he’d reach voters through digital intelligence … He’d go after young folks and immigrants who will be voting for the first time.” ** A message from Qualcomm: The smartphone revolution didn’t happen by accident. Qualcomm invented the technology and business model to scale cutting edge performance throughout the industry for everyone, everywhere. Learn more. ** COMING UP IN CONGRESS — The House telecom subcommittee is due to look at the latest updates in emergency alerts at a hearing this Wednesday that will focus on how the tech for such updates has changed. This hearing follows an FCC vote last fall that changed the rules for emergency text alerts, increasing the number of characters that can be used in such messages and requiring wireless providers to support the embedding of URLs and phone numbers. In September, there was new spotlight cast on emergency text alerts after a New York City message about a terrorism suspect appeared to provide incomplete information about the person in question. “Our communications networks are becoming more advanced and providers are taking advantage of technological innovation and advancements with better targeted, more informative emergency alerts,” Chairman Marsha Blackburn said in a statement. — Meanwhile, international antitrust policy will be at the center of a hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee on Friday. — And the Modernizing Government Technology Act is slated to be up for a vote on the House floor on Wednesday. The bill, which is sponsored by Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), is aimed at overhauling the federal government’s aging computer systems and stalled in Congress last term. As Pro Cyber’s Tim Starks reported, Hurd worked with the Office of Management and Budget as well as the White House’s Office of American Innovation in order to secure support from the administration for the bill. President Donald Trump has also shown interest in dedicating resources to update federal IT. INTEL, SAMSUNG BACK FTC IN QUALCOMM CASE — Both tech companies filed amicus briefs on Friday supporting the FTC’s suit against Qualcomm, Bloomberg reports. Intel argued that Qualcomm’s approach to patents in the semiconductor market is anticompetitive, while Samsung said that Qualcomm’s refusal to license out specific tech was impeding its growth. SILICON VALLEY MUST-READS — Waymo and Lyft to partner on self-driving vehicles: The two will work together on “pilot projects and product development,” The New York Times reports. … And in an update on the Uber-Waymo case: It’s headed to a potential federal probe, based on the recommendation of a federal judge, The Wall Street Journal reports. If this probe were to take place, it would further compound the ride-sharing company’s regulatory woes, adding to those it’s already facing from a criminal investigation into its “greyballing” program. — Sheryl Sandberg calls out need for stronger safety net for women: The Facebook COO honored Mother’s Day with a Facebook post that highlighted the need for a higher federal minimum wage, paid leave and affordable childcare, Recode reports. “We all have a responsibility to help mothers as well as fathers balance their responsibilities at work and home,” she writes. “It's time for our public policies to catch up with what our families deserve and our values demand.” — Google’s education domination: “In the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms,” The New York Times reports. “It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google’s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products — effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.” MEANWHILE, IN EUROPE — — Vestager could arrive at a Facebook decision soon: The EU antitrust chief is expected to announce her verdict as soon as this week in a review regarding whether Facebook misled investors during its acquisition of WhatsApp, Pro Europe’s Nicholas Hirst reports. “Vestager in December formally charged Facebook with misleading her officials after the firm merged its user accounts with those of WhatsApp. Facebook said it would use the information to make better “friend” suggestions and show users ads that were more relevant.” TRANSITIONS — Chris Martin, Pandora’s chief technology officer, is leaving the company after working at the streaming service since 2004, per Bloomberg.

By Haley Draznin NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- She's a millennial, designing for a millennial. Rebecca Minkoff calls her eponymous company the largest global brand in fashion with a designer the same age and sex as her main consumers. "I'm going through the same life moments that my exact customer is going through," Minkoff told CNN's Poppy Harlow in a new Boss Files podcast. "If she's on the younger side of the millennial, then I know what she's about to go through. I'm so much closer to it than someone who might be older and kind of designed for a different generation." She's disrupting the fashion industry, merging tech with fashion, and building her company with her brother, Uri Minkoff. Minkoff, 36, leaned on her brother for support, after being turned down from her father, when she launched the company in 2001. "I was at that point where I was like, 'I can't fund this with my odd jobs anymore.' I was a stylist as well. And so that is when I called my father, and I said. 'I finally am on to something. I've got real orders, there's a heat behind this. Will you help me?' And he said, 'no, but try your brother,'" Minkoff said. Minkoff wasn't an overnight success. She said it was a major challenge to get recognized in the industry, which she has described as a "dictatorship." "I think that when we first started out, there were 10 key buyers, 10 key editors, and if they deemed you the right designer, the most talented, then you became part of the circle," Minkoff said. "I think that we're here because of our consumer, our consumer chose us. I began to talk to her online when no one else would." Early on, the designer connected with her customers in blog posts and later on social media -- building a following that was coined "The Minkettes." But Minkoff got some pushback from players in the industry who advised her to not engage with the people blogging and talking about her brand on social media. "We had sit downs with heads of department stores saying, 'Don't talk to these women. That's beneath you. You should be in your ivory tower.' When we first started working with bloggers, [we said] we actually think that there's something here, and we think that this is probably how fashion and storytelling and content will actually evolve," Minkoff said. Today, the brand has more than 800,000 followers on both Instagram and Twitter, and Minkoff said theirs was the first fashion brand on Snapchat. Minkoff became the first designer to live-stream her fashion show in virtual reality, and she incorporates drones to get aerial footage of the runway. And Minkoff designed wearable technology like device charging bracelets, and built in a self-checkout option in her retail stores. More recently, Minkoff installed interactive "smart" mirrors in stores' fitting rooms "to give customers an e-commerce experience in a brick-and-mortar environment." Users are able to adjust the lighting to match the time of day they plan to wear the item. Radio Frequency Identification tags on each item prompt the system to automatically pull up other items of interest on the mirror's screen with the hope consumers will click and try on additional items. "We as a retailer can look in and see what didn't she buy? What is pairing with what? Is there a fit issue? Is it a fabric issue? And you get enormous intel into what's going on in there without cameras," Minkoff said. She said the brand's sales have been up 30% year over since that implementation. Minkoff is committed to motivating girls and women in tech, partnering with Intel on STEM initiatives, joining boards of female-led companies and launching a venture capital firm to invest in more female entrepreneurs. She said she and her brother wanted to "put some money down and get our skin in the game and help these companies actually get started." Sixteen years in -- many in the fashion world are asking if going public is the next step for Minkoff's company. "We're not ready or even close to being ready to go public. I think that we're still on a great growth journey," Minkoff said. "There's still so much we haven't done." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Waymo and Lyft have agreed a new deal regarding the further testing of autonomous car technologies. Alphabet’s Waymo and ride hailing app Lyft are among some of the more prominent companies involved in the development of autonomous car technology and this deal will see them working more together. The new deal was initially reported by the New York Times but has since been confirmed by both Waymo and Lyft. A Lyft spokeswoman said in a statement: “Waymo holds today’s best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world’s best transportation.” A Waymo spokesman said: “Lyft’s vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo’s self-driving technology reach more people, in more places.” The fact that Waymo is working with a driving based service already has led to the belief that the company will be ready to debut its self driving cars much sooner than previously anticipated. The self driving car project began at Google in 2009 and last month the company announced that it was opening access to the public in Arizona. A recent survey also found that out of the leading self driving car developers, Waymo had accrued the most miles driven and the least disengagements of the self driving system. So far the companies have not announced any details of the deal but these sorts of alliances have become commonplace in the autonomous vehicle market. Recently Intel, BMW, and Mobileye announced that they would be working together to create 40 highly automated vehicles. This partnership could also have competition implications for Uber, the world’s leading ridehailing service, who is also developing self driving cars. Currently Lyft is much smaller than it’s competitor Uber but working with an established Alphabet brand like Waymo could help change that. Waymo is also currently embroiled in a battle with Uber, alleging that the ride hailing service stole self driving technology.

Does the search giant have enough firepower to overtake Amazon? We'll find out this week at Google I/O. Smart Home by Richard Nieva May 15, 2017 6:00 AM PDT @richardjnieva Enlarge Image This week, Google is expected to reveal what's next for its Google Home and Assistant. Taylor Martin/CNET A few days before Google CEO Sundar Pichai stepped on stage at the 2016 I/O developer conference, he told me about the Assistant, a digital helper that could do things for you like play a song, give you flight information or tell you what's on your calendar. Pichai also gave credit where credit was due. One of the devices the Assistant would inhabit is Google Home, a smart speaker that aims to capitalize on the success of the Amazon Echo. "There are areas where we will be ahead," Pichai said of following Amazon to the market. "And there will be areas where someone points a way and we do it." On Wednesday, Pichai returns to Shoreline Amphitheater -- basically Google's backyard in Mountain View, California -- almost a year after introducing the world to the Assistant and Google Home. He's expected to talk about a range of things including virtual reality and Android, Google's mobile operating system at Google I/O. And he's also due to give us an update on the Assistant, a rival to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. It might not make any difference to you whether you're barking orders at a device made by Google or Amazon, just as long as it gives you an accurate weather report or reads out the top headlines of the hour. But the stakes are high for tech companies looking to take over your living room. Home is where you binge on TV and movies, get ready for work, eat, cook, sleep and shop online. All of that activity is potentially data that tech giants including Google and Amazon want to get their hands on. The better they know you, the more they'll (eventually) be able to woo advertisers or get you to buy things. It's not like we don't have any options. Right now, Google is a distant second in the smart speaker market. So far, people overwhelmingly have picked the Amazon Echo, introduced in 2014, as the smart home hub of choice, according to research firm eMarketer. In the US, of the 35.6 million people who use a voice-enabled speaker once a month, more than 70 percent use a product from the Echo line, which has several variations, including the $150 original Echo and $50 Echo Dot. Google Home, which right now sells for $115, has almost 24 percent. Google declined to comment. An Amazon spokeswoman said it's "great to see people excited" about smart home hubs. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do 'Pressure on Google' Competition is only going to get more fierce. Last week, Amazon introduced its latest Echo product, the $230 Echo Show, which includes a screen for video calling. Microsoft is also bringing its Cortana digital assistant software to smart speakers, partnering with manufacturers including Samsung's Harman Kardon, Intel and HP. That means for Google, the clock is ticking. Once people bring a smart speaker like the Echo into their house, they're unlikely to switch to a competitor, according to a study by VoiceLabs. Only 11 percent would consider making that jump. "It does put a certain amount of pressure on Google," said Victoria Petrock, a principal analyst at eMarketer. "Amazon came out very early and aggressively." But she and other analysts think Google has a good shot at pulling ahead of Amazon. That's because while Alexa, the digital assistant that powers the Echo, is an unexpected hit, Google may have a formidable edge -- the trove of data that comes with 18 years of being a search company. Think about everything you confide to Google: your emails (Gmail), your whereabouts and favorite hangouts (Maps), your work schedule (Calendar), your love of Steph Curry highlights (YouTube), your favorite recipes (Search), your weird fascination with anglerfish (Search, again), or your obsession with World War I trivia (Search is really powerful). If Google leverages all that personal data the right way, Home could offer a better experience than the Echo. (CNET Reviews -- independent from its news department -- last month gave the nod to Home, after previously going with the Echo.) "Google has some natural advantages because of the information people are willing to share with them," said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research. And Google also has the software chops to pull it off. "It's a whole level of invisible engineering a lot of us don't appreciate," he said. Last month, Google announced multiaccount support for the assistant. That means Home can recognize more than one voice and surface personal information, preferences, calendar items and other stuff based on who's talking. On a conference call earlier this month, Pichai called the feature a "game-changer." We'll see if it is. eMarketer's Petrock calls it "a very important step." At this week's Google I/O (last year's event drew 7,000 developers), we'll hear what Pichai's next steps are -- and if they're strides, jumps or stumbles.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Samsung Chromebook Pro now listed for pre-order on Amazon By Rei Padla - May 15, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Samsung Chromebook Pro which was launched at the CES 2017 together with the Chromebook Plus has been delayed a bit. We’re not sure why but we’re guessing it must be related to Android apps being not yet ready for Chrome OS. We know it’s getting the Nougat update soon as its sibling the Chromebook Plus already received the said update on the Canary channel. Google has been busy with updating the list of Chrome OS systems receiving Android apps and it’s safe to assume the Chromebook Pro is included because it is new. And more good news, the device is now listed on Amazon. It is up for pre-order with shipping to begin on May 28. The Samsung Chromebook Pro is lightweight and slim with a QHD touch screen display, 3:2 aspect ratio, Intel processor, multi-tasking and multi-window features, plus the new Google Play store support so you can run different Android apps. Just like the Chromebook Plus, this one offers “flexibility and versatility of a tablet” and the “power and productivity of a laptop”. Price tag reads $549.99 with free shipping. It’s already worth the price because the Chromebook works as a tablet and notebook computer in one. It also comes with a built-in pen (stylus) so you can draw and write with more efficiency. To review, the Samsung Chromebook Pro comes with the following: 12.3-inch screen, Gorilla Glass 3, Quad HD 2400 x 1600 pixel resolution, full-size keyboard and trackpad, 2.2GHz Intel processor, and a 32GB flash memory. SOURCE: Amazon Story Timeline Samsung Chromebook Pro aka 'Kevin' sighted for pre-order, might have a stylus Samsung Chromebook 3, HP 13 G1 receive Google Play Store support Samsung Chromebook Plus may have 8GB, 16GB RAM Samsung Chromebook Plus receives Nougat update on the Canary channel Samsung Chromebook Pro, Android apps for Chrome OS not yet ready TAGS Android Chrome OS Chromebook Samsung Samsung Chromebook 2 Rei Padla Must Read HTC U11 Hands-on: squeezing every last measure available BlackBerry KEYone Review Samsung Galaxy S8 Review Community 922.5klikes 476.4kfollowers 85.8kcomments / Free WordPress Plugins and WordPress Themes by Silicon Themes.

Now we're hearing that AMD will have 10/12/14/16 core versions, meaning we'll have CPUs with 10C/20T, 12C/24T, 14C/28T, and 16C/32T.     ThreadRipper will be compatible with a modified version of AMD's current SP3 socket, something that's codenamed SP3r2, and was designed for AMD's upcoming Naples server platform. AMD's new Whitehaven platform will provide quad-channel DDR4 with 44 PCIe lanes for multi-GPU users, enthusiasts and workstation users.   Better yet, we know the names of AMD's new ThreadRipper processors with a rather large purported list of Ryzen 9 processors.     ThreadRipper 16C/32T: Ryzen 9 1998X/1998   The new HEDT chips will be led by the flagship Ryzen 9 1998X and Ryzen 9 1998, offering 16C/32T at 3.5GHz base and 3.9GHz boost CPU clocks, while coming in with a 155W TDP - 5W less than Intel's next-gen Core i7-7920X which is a 12C/24T part. The Ryzen 9 1998 on the other hand will retain the 16C/32T power, but at 3.2/3.6GHz for base/boost clocks, respectively - on the same 155W TDP.     ThreadRipper 14C/28T: Ryzen 9 1977X/1977   AMD's purported 14C/28T processors will arrive as the Ryzen 9 1977X with a base 3.5GHz clock and boost of 4.1GHz on a 155W TDP. The smaller Ryzen 9 1977 will hit 3.2GHz base and 3.7GHz boost, on a lower 140W TDP.     ThreadRipper 12C/24T: Ryzen 9 1976X/1956X/1956   The mid-range ThreadRipper will still have 12C/24T and will include 3 SKUs in total, starting with the Ryzen 9 1976X with base and boost clocks of 3.6GHz and 4.1GHz, respectively, on a 140W TDP. The Ryyzen 9 1956X will have the same 12C/24T, but at 3.2GHz and 3.8GHz for base/boost, at 125W. The smaller Ryzen 9 1956 is a 125W part at 3GHz and 3.7GHz on base/boost.     ThreadRipper 10C/20T: Ryzen 9 1955X/1955   AMD will have its lowest ThreadRipper SKUs as 10C/20T parts with the Ryzen 9 1955X offering 3.6GHz and 4.0GHs base/boost CPU clocks, while the Ryzen 9 1955 will rock 3.1/3.7GHz CPU clocks.

As investing trends go, passivity is in. Advisers increasingly rely on index funds or robo platforms to manage their clients’ investments, rather than sift through individual stocks to buy and sell them. Study after study seems to reinforce the belief that active portfolio managers do not outperform big, prepackaged baskets of stocks. Just don’t tell Scott Snider. Snider, a certified financial planner in Jacksonville, Fla., has no beef with low-cost index funds. But he’s an avid stock picker at heart. “I’m always looking for new companies to add,” Snider said. “I see stocks as a way to buy something that’s mispriced, and it’s good to buy at a discount. With some mutual funds, you own stocks that aren’t mispriced. They may even be overpriced.” Snider, 33, started his firm Mellen Money Management in 2016. During a 6 ½-year stint as an adviser working for a bank, he came to realize the advantages of selecting stocks and embracing a buy-and-hold strategy. Reviewing client accounts in that job, he was struck by the wealth generated by patient investors with a fondness for dividend-paying stocks. A bank customer who had accumulated $1 million in General Mills GIS, +0.20%   stock told Snider, “People won’t stop eating cereal.” “He held a much larger concentration in a position than I was taught,” Snider recalled. “But it got me thinking.” He began dabbling in stocks on his own. Soon, he was hooked. Today, Snider explains to clients that he views stocks as a key piece of a well-rounded portfolio. Depending on each person’s age, risk tolerance and other factors, he might invest 10% to 20% of assets in individual equities. He parks the rest mostly in index funds and other passive investments. Many of Snider’s peers — advisers in their late 20s and 30s—flock to passive instruments such as index funds and ETFs to allocate their clients’ assets. As online portfolio management tools go mainstream (even Fidelity offers its Fidelity Go “digital first” service), advisers are using automated robo platforms more than ever. Thanks to the algorithms that drive robos’ performance, advisers can help clients invest in groupings of stocks (by sector, risk level, etc.) — and automatically rebalance their portfolio — at low cost and with minimal time expended. The upshot is many advisers no longer pick stocks at all. Snider opts for what he describes as “good, boring, dividend payers” such as utilities and consumer staples such as Procter & Gamble PG, +0.16%  . For those willing to take more risk, he might throw in a few high-beta selections such as Mobileye MBLY, +0.23%   — a winner after Intel’s recent announcement to buy it — and Under Armour UAA, -1.41%   — a former highflier that hit the skids. Setting realistic expectations is a vital part of his job. If clients assume he will trounce the market averages year after year, he disabuses them of that notion. “Trying to beat the benchmarks is a crazy game,” he said. “I tell clients they have to think long-term, not get caught up in day-to-day or month-to-month or year-to-year.” Nevertheless, many clients initially question Snider’s intent to pick stocks and express what he describes as “a common surprised reaction.” Perhaps that’s because the tide is heading the other way: Investors have pulled $330 billion from active U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the past 15 months as passive products like index funds gained $765.5 billion, according to Morningstar. In time, however, clients often share Snider’s affinity for stocks. Better yet, they become more engaged in the investment process. “There’s a value in clients knowing exactly what they own,” he said. “When they see a company’s name, it’s a much easier conversation when the market goes down. They tend to understand a stock better than they understand a mutual fund or ETF.” Snider acknowledges that his commitment to stocks can hamper his ability to grow his practice. He’s a diligent researcher of potential buys, and analyzing a company’s fundamentals takes time away from prospecting and other business tasks. “Some advisers think that buying individual stocks isn’t scalable, that it takes away from revenue-generating activities,” he said. “But I’m buying stocks for multiple accounts.” To manage his time, Snider allots chunks of Monday and Friday to conduct intensive research. This frees him to focus on client service and other aspects of his practice the rest of the week. He also adopts a flexible attitude. A few clients reject the idea of owning handpicked stocks, so Snider accommodates them. “You have to be open-minded to what they want to accomplish and fit it into your philosophy and approach,” he said. “You want to make them comfortable.” For others, the allure of owning certain stocks brings them to Snider in the first place. He recalls meeting an investor in his 60s who told his former adviser to buy rail company CSX CSX, -1.53%  . The adviser replied, “I’m sorry, but buying individual stock just isn’t something that we do.” Suffice it to say, he’s now Scott Snider’s satisfied client.

Poll: Most want ‘independent’ probe of Trump, Russia MORE? “If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,” Clinton declared at a forum in New York City earlier this month. Those words led Republicans to mock Clinton for refusing to accept responsibility for running a bad campaign that ended in defeat. ADVERTISEMENT But Clinton then got backing — of a kind — from the man who beat her, President Trump.   The president fired FBI director James Comey last week, ostensibly for violating policy when, despite clearing Clinton of any crime, he still went on national television last summer to condemn her as a “careless” public official. At that July 2016 press conference, Comey defamed Clinton to the point that Republicans criticized him for not recommending that she be charged with a crime. Comey’s impact on the campaign grew larger when, just 11 days before the November election, he sent a letter to Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email address and server. Nothing came of the last-minute investigation, just as no charges resulted from the first investigation. But with Trump campaign surrogates, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, shouting “lock her up,” Republicans and a supplicant press made a big issue out of the controversy. How times change. Last week Trump agreed with a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein which flatly stated that it is not possible to “defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s e-mails.” That memo was released a week after Comey gave testimony to Congress in which he wrongly claimed “hundreds and thousands of emails,” had been forwarded by Clinton aide Huma Abedin to her husband’s non-secure computer. In fact, most of the Clinton emails found on the non-government computer “occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices,” according to the FBI. And only two “email chains” of classified information had been mistakenly sent to the private computer. Trump found it convenient to use Comey’s errors to get rid of the leader of the agency investigating charges that his campaign had treasonous ties to Russia. But whatever the reason, Trump stood with Clinton — at least for a while. In an interview broadcast Saturday with my Fox News Channel colleague Jeanine Pirro, Trump reverted to his earlier insistence that Comey gave Clinton "a free pass like nobody's ever, ever gotten a free pass." Clinton, meanwhile, is refuting Republican claims that Russian interference did not swing votes to Trump. “I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey’s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off — and the evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling and persuasive,” Clinton explained at the New York forum. She specifically pointed to data coming from pollster Nate Silver. On his website FiveThirtyEight.com, Silver later noted that Comey’s letter “does not excuse” every bad decision made by the Clinton campaign. But Silver concluded: “Hillary Clinton would probably be president if FBI Director James Comey had not sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28.” Silver’s breakdown shows that Comey’s letter hurt Clinton’s chances of victory in swing states key to winning the Electoral College — such as Wisconsin and Michigan. Clinton lost in each of those states by less than one percentage point. And keep in mind while Comey was maligning Clinton, he never mentioned the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign. But Republicans still refuse to accept the reality that Russia, a hostile foreign power, played a major role in electing Trump. Comey’s sudden dismissal is now part of a fire that threatens to burn down the GOP’s House majority next year. The firing came one day after Sally Yates, the former acting Attorney General, told the Senate she warned the White House Counsel about former National Security Adviser Flynn’s ties to Russia weeks before he was fired. Yates, too, was fired by Trump. How quickly will Capitol Hill Republicans abandon their Republican president in order to save themselves before they are fired by voters? The flight is beginning. "I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination," said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard BurrRichard BurrJuan Williams: Comey firing burns GOP Warner: I will 'absolutely' subpoena tapes between Comey and Trump if they exist GOP chairman: Trump’s Comey tweet ‘inappropriate’ MORE (R-N.C.).

All this comes at a time when a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. But it makes no sense to run slowly from an inferno. This conflagration is threatening to burn every Republican on the ballot in 2018. “The President's firing of Director Comey is a smoke signal. And where there's smoke, there's fire. And this is a bonfire,” tweeted Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.). How far will the fire have to spread before Republicans decide it is every GOP candidate for himself or herself — whatever the consequences for Trump?

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search New Samsung division wants to put its chip in all your devices JC Torres - May 15, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit To the surprise of no one, Samsung has just created a new division within it silicon business that will focus on contract chip manufacturers for companies outside of Samsung. While it was probably a long time coming, the move couldn’t have come at a worse time for Qualcomm, who is now beset by lawsuits from all sides. With Qualcomm begins to show cracks in its armor, Samsung seems to be getting ready to snatch up whatever piece of the pie Qualcomm might drop. It’s actually not that hard to think of conspiracy theories in Samsung’s foray into the semiconductor market. If one remembers, it was rumored that Samsung was partly responsible for actually starting the flames of criticism against the overheating Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 back in 2015. Whether or not that’s true, it didn’t help that the Galaxy S6, for the first time, didn’t use the ill-fated processor. When the “fixed” Snapdragon 820 came out, it was revealed to have been made by Samsung for Qualcomm, hinting at its prowess in the semiconductor business. Its role in the Snapdragon 835 cemented its position even more. It was almost a sure thing that Samsung would want to start making chips for other companies as well. It is, however, apparently roadblocked by Qualcomm. According to Samsung, the chip maker has artificially prevented it from selling its chips by refusing to grant it the license to make and sell chipsets. So despite having what initially seemed to be a harmonious relationship, Samsung has sided with Intel to back up the US Federal Trade Commission’s monopoly lawsuit against Qualcomm. For now, the new contract chip manufacturing division still operates inside Samsung’s larger semiconductor business. Spinning it off to its own subsidiary will most likely depend on the outcome of the Qualcomm monopoly lawsuit. Whether it will be a profitable business, however, depends on how fast Samsung can scale production for a larger number of customers. Without causing “manufacturing anomalies” of course.

Valve has made it easier for users to watch immersive videos on their VR headsets by releasing a beta version of Steam 360 Video Player.The video player allows for instant playback of VR movies and other linear VR shorts and shows including The Hunger Games 360, Lego Batman and (for the braver players) Alien Covenant in Utero. The player uses Pixvana SPIN Studio technology to stream in virtual reality and this means there is no need to launch a separate application which is what users had to do before. As it is in beta, Steam have launched a community hub for questions and discussions of the player.Valve says that in the minimum specifications for 360 video playback are basically the same for the Virtual Reality HMD. The general specifics are Windows 10, an Intel i5-4590, AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better processor and 50 MB available space. Head to the FAQ page to see the full specification. READ NEXT: Hands-on Preview: OSVR There are four different types of 360 videos on Steam. There is Mono, where the video was captured from a single position in space meaning there is no sense of depth during video playback. Stereo is where the video was captured from two positions and each eye in the VR will see a slightly different image, providing depth and distance in the video. The third type is Equirectangular which captures and playbacks a 360 view in a rectangular photo frame. Lastly, there is FOVAS (Field of View Adaptive Streaming) which is where only the content needed is presented in front of the user's eyes in order to make the most of a reduced network bandwidth. The rest of the 360 view is lower quality and as the user moves their head, different areas are loaded.
