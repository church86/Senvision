By Hyacinth Mascarenhas September 24, 2016 09:18 BST Lenovo, Intel, Synaptics and PayPal have announced a partnership to bring established FIDO biometric authentic capabilities to PCs.iStock Lenovo, Intel, Synaptics and PayPal have announced a collaboration to bring FIDO-enabled fingerprint authentication to Lenovo computers. The new technology would allow people to use their fingerprints instead of a password to verify their identities while using online payment services such as PayPal. The new biometric authentication system will combine Lenovo's laptops with Intel's hardware security and Synaptic's biometric fingerprint technology, including encryption technologies and anti-spoofing algorithms. It will also be based on FIDO Alliance's – an industry association that has developed identity authentication standards and assesses the security of password alternatives – security standards. Founded in 2012 by Lenovoand PayPal among others, FIDO Alliance has been backed by numerous other major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Bank of America, American Express, Samsung and Qualcomm. "The average user has to remember passwords for many different accounts, from PC log-in, email to online shopping," Lenovo senior vice president of its PC and smart device business group Johnson Jia said in a statement. "We wanted to help change that by freeing users from the burden of remembering complex passwords by providing a simple authentication solution." The companies did not specify when laptops with the new fingerprinting technology for online payments would be released. However, they did mention that they would bring the new technology to its laptops beginning with the Yoga 910 convertible PC. Biometric technology has been growing rapidly as a promising new, reliable authentication solution to strengthen digital security and has been adopted by multiple institutions across the globe, particularly in the financial and banking sectors. Innovative biometric security solutions, such as fingerprint sensors, voice recognition, facial recognition and retinal scanning are viewed as a more reliable security options since they do not require a person to remember any information such as a password, PIN or token. Besides being easy to use, they also rely on data that make each person unique, making it much more difficult for hackers and digital thieves to fake. The companies' announcement also comes just a day after internet giant Yahoo disclosed that a massive data breach in 2014 compromised over 500 million user accounts. The company said the sensitive user information - including names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and encrypted passwords - of about half a billion people was compromised by what it believed was a "state-sponsored actor."

(EMAILWIRE.COM, September 24, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) SSD Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market: Intel, Micron, Samsung, Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: ADATA, Apacer, IBM, Kingston Technology, Memblaze, Nimbus Data Systems, OCZ, SK Hynix, and Violin Memory. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/388335/global-pcle-ssd-market-2016-2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: One of the key trends for market growth will be rise in investments in emerging memory technology. The 3D NAND flash memory market is a new market where manufacturers are investing a lot of capital. Some companies such as Samsung, Micron, and Intel have already invested to extend their product portfolios. Toshiba, in collaboration with SanDisk, is investing huge funds to develop 3D NAND. Samsung, SanDisk, and Toshiba, and Intel and Micron are likely to invest more than $18 billion in the manufacturing of 3D NAND during the forecast period. Intel has plans to invest up to $5.5 billion to manufacture flash memory in its China-based memory chip plant during the forecast period. Hence, increasing investments in 3D NAND technology will boost the global PCIe SSD market during the forecast period. According to the report, need for managed service data centers will be a key driver for market growth. It is advantageous for an enterprise to operate a colocation facility rather than to build a data center. Data center colocation allows enterprises to rent computing storage, servers, and network. It enables minimal utilization of power and bandwidth and enhances the security of enterprise IT equipment. Further, the report states that the lack of availability of constant low latency is a major challenge. Write latency can be masked with write-back caching. However, read latency cannot be hidden. SSD latencies are usually for a couple of hundred microseconds. In certain cases, when access is interrupted by the device's internal tasks, SSD's latency can exceed tens of milliseconds or even to a few seconds. The situation is further complicated by the lack of coordination across an array of devices. This results in unpredictable performance of I/Os due to uncoordinated internal tasks. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors. Request A Sample copy of This Report @ https://marketreportscenter.com/request-sample/388335 About Solid-State Drive A solid-state drive (SSD) is a kind of an electronic disk that is built out of silicon microchips and is used for data storage. It uses the same I/O interface design as hard disk drives and stores data in solid-state memory in the form of electric charge. It is made out of silicon microchips. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and negated AND (NAND) are most commonly used storage components used in many devices. Semiconductor-based devices such as NAND have no mechanical or moving parts. This reduces the risk of failure and allows higher read and write speeds in SSDs. The number of applications of SSDs has also increased as they can withstand extreme shocks, consume less power, deliver high consistency, and can be integrated into devices that are used in harsh environments. Technavios analysts forecast the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 33.24% during the period 2016-2020. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market for 2016-2020.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Lenovo, PayPal, Intel and Synaptics team up for fingerprint tech for online payments Lenovo has teamed up with Intel, PayPal, and Synaptics to bring FIDO authentication to laptops. The collaboration will enable Lenovo customers to be able to authenticate to online FIDO ((Fast Identity Online) )-enabled services like PayPal by using a fingerprint instead of a password. This innovative biometric authentication system for PCs will implement current FIDO standards, bringing established FIDO biometric authentication capabilities to the PC. The main aim of the new technology is to reduce fraud and increase security, while making online authentication nearly frictionless with biometrics secured by built-in, hardware-level protection. The companies’ collaboration will leverage Intel’s Software Guard Extensions via its 7th Gen Intel Core processors, and Synaptics’ Natural ID fingerprint sensors featuring TLS 1.2 encryption. Johnson Jia, senior vice president, PC & Smart Device Business Group, Lenovo said, The average user has to remember passwords for many different accounts, from PC log-in, email to online shopping. We wanted to help change that by freeing users from the burden of remembering complex passwords by providing a simple authentication solution. We’re excited to be the first PC company to partner with Intel, PayPal and Synaptics to bring users simpler and safer online authentication based on the released FIDO standards, through fingerprint readers designed for improved security on our laptops starting with the Yoga 910 convertible. Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance said, Passwords are a universal problem that is not limited to mobile devices.  Every internet connected device needs the ability to upgrade to simpler, stronger FIDO authentication and thanks to this partnership, the desktop ecosystem is on an accelerated path to get the same FIDO capabilities already well established across the mobile ecosystem. Lenovo did not mention when systems with the new fingerprint authentication technology will hit the market.

Everykey Tech & Science John McAfee Intel Cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee is fighting Intel to prove he still owns his own name, after the computing giant accused him of infringing on the “McAfee” trademark it owns. McAfee created the eponymous antivirus computer software, which Intel acquired in 2010, almost 20 years after selling his assets to the company. He has since become CEO of MGT Capital Investments and plans to rename the firm “John McAfee Global Technologies.” McAfee antivirus has since been renamed Intel Security, but Intel still warned McAfee earlier this year that any use of his name would infringe on the company’s trademark. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week “When MGT was renamed John McAfee Global Technologies, Intel sent a cease and desist order claiming they owned my name,” McAfee tells Newsweek. “In truth, when I formed McAfee Inc I signed over only the name ‘McAfee Antivirus.’ “Intel has been illegally using my name for every product that they sell,” McAfee says. “It never bothered me but now that they are trying to prevent me from using my name I’m pissed off.” McAfee and his new company MGT Capital filed a lawsuit against Intel on September 2, arguing that the Asset Acquisition Agreement from 1991 did not assign the rights to his personal name or agree to restrict his right to do business using his own name. Related Stories I May Be a Political Hot Shot but I’m No Charlie Sheen Mr. McAfee Goes to Washington How Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Japanese Farmers According to the lawsuit, MGT’s proposed name change is “a clear reference to McAfee as an individual and as a famed international figure in his own right.” Since selling his antivirus company, McAfee has had several business ventures and has remained consistently in the public eye. Earlier this year, McAfee sought the Libertarian Party nomination for the U.S. presidential election. The nomination was eventually won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson. Intel was not immediately available for comment.

The model I tested, the 13-V005TU, is powered by a powerful Intel Core i7-6500U running at 2.5 GHz and equipped with plenty of working memory – 8 gigabytes of RAM. It has a 512 GB fast PCIe SSD drive and it runs on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit edition. The chassis is crafted with durable aluminium and carbon fibre in a two-tone design – the dark grey body in nice contrast with the high-gloss gold back edge that houses two hinges and three USB Type-C ports, one of which is used for recharging the notebook, and a headphone jack. The notebook uses a hidden piston hinge to create the illusion of a hinge-less design for a premium look and feel. Its backlit keyboard and glass trackpad add an even sexier twist.  Billed as the thinnest notebook ever to be released, the display and keyboard are just 10.4mm thick, which has been achieved by removing all the ports. The HDMI output, full-size USB and LAN ports are instead provided in USB-C adapters. The adapters must be connected to the USB Type-C ports at the back. The Spectre 13 comes with a sharp and bright Full HD IPS edge-to-edge display that is protected by Corning Gorilla glass. The display is very good for editing photos, showing presentations and watching Full HD movies. Its graphics horsepower comes from Intel HD Graphics 520. Although the Spectre 13 is powered by a fast processor and despite its thin design, the cooling system is good. It uses a breakthrough hyperbaric cooling technology from Intel that actively draws cool air in and directs it over the processor to keep it running at peak performance. The Spectre 13 showed off its impressive performance during the test, starting up and shutting down instantly and running business applications like Microsoft Word and Excel fast and smoothly. Full HD video clips also played smoothly. The notebook has good sound too as it uses HP Audio Boost and Bang & Olufsen Audio technologies. HP Audio Boost raises the volume and makes its crystal clear. The Bang & Olufsen four-speaker set-up and its Smart Amp function and software reproduces good quality sound so that you enjoy both movies and music.  The Spectre 13 has fast wireless connection, using Intel dual band AC8260 Wi-Fi 802.11 ac adapter. I connected it to my Linksys WRT1200AC wireless router and was pleased at the speed of the Internet connection, which allowed me to easily stream music and video files from other computers on my home network fast and smoothly. The adapter supports Intel WiDi and is compatible with Miracast-certified devices, such as new smart TVs. The Spectre 13 has up to nine hours of battery life. It uses a hybrid battery that is split into thinner pieces but delivers the same wattage as a single battery.  The package also comes with 13.3-inch leather sleeve. HP Spectre 13-V005TU has a suggested retail price of Bt69,990.   Key Specs - OS: Windows 10 Pro 64 - CPU: Intel Core i7-6500U 2.5GHz - Memory: 8 GB LPDD3-1866 |on-board RAM - Hard drive: 512 GB PCIe SSD - Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 520 - Display: 13.3-inch FHD BrightView (1920x1080) 2.0mm panel - Wireless connectivity: Intel Dual band wireless-AC 8260 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi + BT 4.2 Combo Adaptor - Audio: BANG & OLUFSEN, Quad Speakers, Support Smart Amp functionality - Webcam: HP TrueVision HD: |HD camera - indicator LED, USB2.0, BSI sensor, f2.4, 720p - Ports: 3.5 Headphone / Microphone Combo Jack; 1 USB Type-C; 2x USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Thunderbolt Gen 3 technology - Battery: 4 cell Polymer |battery - 38Whr (4.95AH) - Dimensions: 325 x 229.4 x10.4 mm - Weight: 1.163 kg   Tags Gadgets Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Jinyang Palace of Sui Dynasty found in Shanxi...

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 23, 2016 at 11:07AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is currently in mass production on a chip manufacturing technology that it refers to as 14-nanometer+, an improved version of the 14-nanometer technology that it debuted in the second half of 2014. The company's next generation technology, known as 10-nanometer, is expected to go into production during the second half of 2017. Over the next couple of years following the introduction of the first 10-nanometer technology, the company says it will introduce both 10-nanometer+ and 10-nanometer++ technologies to improve upon the performance of the initial 10-nanometer technology. Beyond the various 10-nanometer flavors, though, Intel is working to develop a 7-nanometer technology. Unlike 10-nanometer+ and 10-nanometer++, which are both expected to deliver performance enhancements but not reductions in chip area (known as a "shrink"), the company's 7-nanometer technology is expected to bring performance and power improvements as well as a shrink. Although much about this upcoming technology remains a mystery, I have a key detail about the technology to share. Refining a familiar technology In late 2011, Intel went into production on its 22-nanometer technology. This technology was unique because it was the first implementation of a transistor structure, known as a FinFET, to go into high volume manufacturing. In a nutshell, FinFETs (which Intel marketed as "Tri-Gate") enable substantially better power/performance than prior generation "planar" transistors. A FinFET. Image source: Intel. With Intel's 14-nanometer technology, the company refined the same FinFET transistor structure used in its 22-nanometer technology to deliver better performance and power characteristics. With 14-nanometer+ the company further continued to refine the technology. At 10-nanometer, Intel has already publicly said that it will continue to refine the FinFET transistor structure, and since Intel is planning three iterations of 10-nanometer, the FinFET is likely to be Intel's transistor of choice for several years to come. There had been some speculation that Intel could move away from the FinFET technology when it transitions to its 7-nanometer technology (after all, the FinFET will be nearly a decade old by the time this technology ramps into production), but it would appear that this won't be the case. According to a LinkedIn profile of an Intel engineer, Intel's 7-nanometer technology will, indeed, be a further refinement of the FinFET structure, as you can see below: Image source: LinkedIn. If we assume that Intel spends three generations on 7-nanometer before transitioning to 5-nanometer (as the company is on track to do with 14-nanometer and plans to do with 10-nanometer), then it might not be until 2023/2024 before Intel transitions to a post-FinFET transistor structure. What else do we know about 7-nanometers? At a recent presentation, Intel also provided some insight into the transistor density/cost metrics that it aims to deliver with its 7-nanometer technology. Image source: Intel. Indeed, based on the above image, it looks like Intel is promising both area and cost-per-transistor reductions, although it seems as though the company hasn't quite nailed its targets down yet. The upshot, though, of lower area and ultimately cost per transistor is that chips with more transistors can be made more cheaply on a newer, denser technology than on an older, sparcer technology. The one caveat, though, is that these cost-per-transistor calculations assume equivalent manufacturing yields, something that -- at least with Intel's 14-nanometer technology -- isn't the case when a new technology goes into production.

The collaboration will enable Lenovo customers to be able to authenticate to online FIDO-enabled services like PayPal by using a fingerprint instead of a password. It makes use of the built-in security features of 7th Gen Intel Core processors; hardware and design expertise of Lenovo; the encryption and biometric features of Synaptics’ fingerprint sensor; and the payment processing and unique authentication ecosystem of PayPal. The 7th Gen Intel Core processors with built Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) lay the groundwork for robust, hardware-protected biometric authentication securing users’ FIDO credentials and biometric information. The Synaptics Natural ID fingerprint sensor features enterprise-level security with TLS 1.2 encryption. Synaptics’ Natural ID Fingerprint Solution is secured by SentryPoint features, including TLS 1.2 encryption and anti-spoofing algorithms. PayPal leverages its unique authentication ecosystem to continue making payments more secure and convenient. Lenovo PCs using Natural ID and Intel Core processors achieve this by quickly and securely capturing user credentials, which are encrypted and stored in the hardware, making them less susceptible to malware attacks. “The average user has to remember passwords for many different accounts, from PC log-in, email to online shopping. We wanted to help change that by freeing users from the burden of remembering complex passwords by providing a simple authentication solution,” said Johnson Jia, senior vice president, PC & Smart Device Business Group, Lenovo.  “We’re excited to be the first PC company to partner with Intel, PayPal and Synaptics to bring users simpler and safer online authentication based on the released FIDO standards, through fingerprint readers designed for improved security on our laptops starting with the Yoga 910 convertible.” I hope more PC manufactures will follow Lenovo in bringing fingerprint based secure payments solutions to Windows PCs.

Andrew Gallant's Blog About Projects GitHub ripgrep is faster than {grep, ag, git grep, ucg, pt, sift} Sep 23, 2016 In this article I will introduce a new command line search tool, ripgrep, that combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack clone) with the raw performance of GNU grep. ripgrep is fast, cross platform (with binaries available for Linux, Mac and Windows) and written in Rust. ripgrep is available on Github. We will attempt to do the impossible: a fair benchmark comparison between several popular code search tools. Specifically, we will dive into a series of 25 benchmarks that substantiate the following claims: For both searching single files and huge directories of files, no other tool obviously stands above ripgrep in either performance or correctness. ripgrep is the only tool with proper Unicode support that doesn’t make you pay dearly for it. Tools that search many files at once are generally slower if they use memory maps, not faster. As someone who has worked on text search in Rust in their free time for the last 2.5 years, and as the author of both ripgrep and the underlying regular expression engine, I will use this opportunity to provide detailed insights into the performance of each code search tool. No benchmark will go unscrutinized! Target audience: Some familiarity with Unicode, programming and some experience with working on the command line. NOTE: I’m hearing reports from some people that rg isn’t as fast as I’ve claimed on their data. I’d love to help explain what’s going on, but to do that, I’ll need to be able to reproduce your results. If you file an issue with something I can reproduce, I’d be happy to try and explain it. Screenshot of search results Table of Contents Introducing ripgrep Pitch Anti-pitch Installation Whirlwind tour Regex syntax Anatomy of a grep Background Gathering files to search Searching Regex engine Literal optimizations Mechanics Printing Methodology Overview Benchmark runner Environment Code search benchmarks linux_literal_default linux_literal linux_literal_casei linux_word linux_unicode_word linux_re_literal_suffix linux_alternates linux_alternates_casei linux_unicode_greek linux_unicode_greek_casei linux_no_literal Single file benchmarks subtitles_literal subtitles_literal_casei subtitles_literal_word subtitles_alternate subtitles_alternate_casei subtitles_surrounding_words subtitles_no_literal Bonus benchmarks everything nothing context huge Conclusions Introducing ripgrep Pitch Why should you use ripgrep over any other search tool? Well… It can replace both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep because it is faster than both. (N.B. It is not, strictly speaking, an interface compatible “drop-in” replacement for both, but the feature sets are far more similar than different.) Like The Silver Searcher, ripgrep defaults to recursive directory search and won’t search files ignored by your .gitignore files. It also ignores hidden and binary files by default. ripgrep also implements full support for .gitignore, where as there are many bugs related to that functionality in The Silver Searcher. Of the things that don’t work in The Silver Searcher, ripgrep supports .gitignore priority (including in parent directories and sub-directories), whitelisting and recursive globs. ripgrep can search specific types of files. For example, rg -tpy foo limits your search to Python files and rg -Tjs foo excludes Javascript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about new file types with custom matching rules. ripgrep supports many features found in grep, such as showing the context of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while supporting Unicode (which is always on). In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, saner defaults, fewer bugs and Unicode. Anti-pitch I’d like to try to convince you why you shouldn’t use ripgrep. Often, this is far more revealing than reasons why I think you should use ripgrep. ripgrep uses a regex engine based on finite automata, so if you want fancy regex features such as backreferences or look around, ripgrep won’t give them to you. ripgrep does support lots of things though, including, but not limited to: lazy quantification (e.g., a+?), repetitions (e.g., a{2,5}), begin/end assertions (e.g., ^\w+$), word boundaries (e.g., \bfoo\b), and support for Unicode categories (e.g., \p{Sc} to match currency symbols or \p{Lu} to match any uppercase letter). If you need to search files with text encodings other than UTF-8 (like UTF-16), then ripgrep won’t work. ripgrep will still work on ASCII compatible encodings like latin1 or otherwise partially valid UTF-8. ripgrep may grow support for additional text encodings over time. ripgrep doesn’t yet support searching for patterns/literals from a file, but this is easy to add and should change soon. If you need to search compressed files. ripgrep doesn’t try to do any decompression before searching. In other words, if you like fancy regexes, non-UTF-8 character encodings or decompressing and searching on-the-fly, then ripgrep may not quite meet your needs (yet). Installation The binary name for ripgrep is rg. Binaries for ripgrep are available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Linux binaries are static executables. Windows binaries are available either as built with MinGW (GNU) or with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). When possible, prefer MSVC over GNU, but you’ll need to have the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools installed. If you’re a Homebrew user, then you can install it with a custom formula (N.B. ripgrep isn’t actually in Homebrew yet. This just installs the binary directly): $ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/master/pkg/brew/ripgrep.rb
 If you’re an Archlinux user, then you can install ripgrep from the official repos: $ pacman -Syu ripgrep
 If you’re a Rust programmer, ripgrep can be installed with cargo: $ cargo install ripgrep
 If you’d like to build ripgrep from source, that is also easy to do. ripgrep is written in Rust, so you’ll need to grab a Rust installation in order to compile it. ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.9 (stable) or newer. To build: $ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.2
 If you have a Rust nightly compiler, then you can enable optional SIMD acceleration like so, which is used in all benchmarks reported in this article. RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release --features simd-accel
 Whirlwind tour The command line usage of ripgrep doesn’t differ much from other tools that perform a similar function, so you probably already know how to use ripgrep. The full details can be found in rg --help, but let’s go on a whirlwind tour. ripgrep detects when its printing to a terminal, and will automatically colorize your output and show line numbers, just like The Silver Searcher. Coloring works on Windows too! Colors can be controlled more granularly with the --color flag. One last thing before we get started: ripgrep assumes UTF-8 everywhere. It can still search files that are invalid UTF-8 (like, say, latin-1), but it will simply not work on UTF-16 encoded files or other more exotic encodings. Support for other encodings may happen.. To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all .gitignore files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files: $ rg foobar
 The above command also respects all .rgignore files, including in parent directories. .rgignore files can be used when .gitignore files are insufficient. In all cases, .rgignore patterns take precedence over .gitignore. To ignore all ignore files, use -u. To additionally search hidden files and directories, use -uu. To additionally search binary files, use -uuu. (In other words, “search everything, dammit!”) In particular, rg -uuu is similar to grep -a -r. $ rg -uu foobar  # similar to `grep -r`
$ rg -uuu foobar  # similar to `grep -a -r`
 (Tip: If your ignore files aren’t being adhered to like you expect, run your search with the --debug flag.) Make the search case insensitive with -i, invert the search with -v or show the 2 lines before and after every search result with -C2. Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with -w. Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them): $ rg '([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$2, $1'
 Named groups are supported: $ rg '(?P<first>[A-Z][a-z]+)\s+(?P<last>[A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$last, $first'
 Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this with other search tools!): $ rg '(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)\s+(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)' --replace '$2, $1'
 Search only files matching a particular glob: $ rg foo -g 'README.*'
 Or exclude files matching a particular glob: $ rg foo -g '!*.min.js'
 Search only HTML and CSS files: $ rg -thtml -tcss foobar
 Search everything except for Javascript files: $ rg -Tjs foobar
 To see a list of types supported, run rg --type-list. To add a new type, use --type-add, which must be accompanied by a pattern for searching (rg won’t persist your type settings): $ rg --type-add 'foo:*.{foo,foobar}' -tfoo bar
 The type foo will now match any file ending with the .foo or .foobar extensions. Regex syntax The syntax supported is documented as part of Rust’s regex library. Anatomy of a grep Before we dive into benchmarks, I thought it might be useful to provide a high level overview of how a grep-like search tool works, with a special focus on ripgrep in particular. The goal of this section is to provide you with a bit of context that will help make understanding the analysis for each benchmark easier. Background Modulo parsing command line arguments, the first “real” step in any search tool is figuring out what to search. Tools like grep don’t try to do anything smart: they simply search the files given to it on the command line. An exception to this is the -r flag, which will cause grep to recursively search all files in the current directory. Various command line flags can be passed to control which files are or aren’t searched. ack came along and turned this type of default behavior on its head. Instead of trying to search everything by default, ack tries to be smarter about what to search. For example, it will recursively search your current directory by default, and it will automatically skip over any source control specific files and directories (like .git). This method of searching undoubtedly has its own pros and cons, because it tends to make the tool “smarter,” which is another way of saying “opaque.” That is, when you really do need the tool to search everything, it can sometimes be tricky to know how to speak the right incantation for it to do so. With that said, being smart by default is incredibly convenient, especially when “smart” means “figure out what to search based on your source control configuration.” There’s no shell alias that can do that with grep. All of the other search tools in this benchmark share a common ancestor with either grep or ack. sift is descended from grep, while ag, ucg, and pt are descended from ack. ripgrep is a bit of a hybrid because it was specifically built to be good at searching huge files just like grep, but at the same time, provide the “smart” kind of default searching like ack. Finally, git grep deserves a bit of a special mention. git grep is very similar to plain grep in the kinds of options it supports, but its default mode of searching is clearly descended from ack: it will only search files checked into source control. Of course, both types of search tools have a lot in common, but there are a few broad distinctions worth making if you allow yourself to squint your eyes a bit: grep-like tools need to be really good at searching large files, so the performance of the underlying regex library is paramount. ack-like tools need to be really good at recursive directory traversal while also applying ignore rules from files like .gitignore quickly. ack-like tools are built to run many searches in parallel, so the raw performance of the underlying regex library can be papered over somewhat while still being faster than single-threaded “search everything” tools like grep. If the “smarts” of ack also mean skipping over that 2GB artifact in your directory tree, then the performance difference becomes even bigger. ripgrep tries hard to combine the best of both worlds. Not only is its underlying regex engine very fast, but it parallelizes searches and tries to be smart about what it searches too. Gathering files to search For an ack-like tool, it is important to figure out which files to search in the current directory. This means using a very fast recursive directory iterator, filtering file paths quickly and distributing those file paths to a pool of workers that actually execute the search. Directory traversal can be tricky because some recursive directory iterators make more stat calls than are strictly necessary, which can have a large impact on performance. It can be terribly difficult to track down these types of performance problems because they tend to be buried in a standard library somewhere. Python only recently fixed this, for example. Rest assured that ripgrep uses a recursive directory iterator that makes the minimum number of system calls possible. Filtering file paths requires not only respecting rules given at the command line (e.g., grep’s --include or --exclude) flags, but also requires reading files like .gitignore and applying their rules correctly to all file paths. Even the mere act of looking for a .gitignore file in every directory can have measurable overhead! Otherwise, the key performance challenge with this functionality is making sure you don’t try to match every ignore rule individually against every file path. Large repositories like the Linux kernel source tree have over a hundred .gitignore files with thousands of rules combined. Finally, distributing work to other threads for searching requires some kind of synchronization. One solution is a mutex protected ring buffer that acts as a sort of queue, but there are lock-free solutions that might be faster. Rust’s ecosystem is so great that I was able to reuse a lock-free Chase-Lev work-stealing queue for distributing work to a pool of searchers. Every other tool that parallelizes work in this benchmark uses a variant of a mutex protected queue. (sift and pt might not fit this criteria, since they use Go channels, and I haven’t followed any implementation improvements to that code for a few years.) Searching Searching is the heart of any of these tools, and we could dig ourselves into a hole on just this section alone and not come out alive for at least 2.5 years. (Welcome to “How Long I’ve Been Working On Text Search In Rust.”) Instead, we will lightly touch on the big points. Regex engine First up is the regex engine. Every search tool supports some kind of syntax for regular expressions. Some examples: foo|bar matches any literal string foo or bar [a-z]{2}_[a-z]+ matches two lowercase latin letters, followed by an underscore, followed by one or more lowercase latin letters. \bfoo\b matches the literal foo only when it is surrounded by word boundaries. For example, the foo in foobar won’t match but it will in I love foo.. (\w+) \1 matches any sequence of word characters followed by a space and followed by exactly the word characters that were matched previously. The \1 in this example is called a “back-reference.” For example, this pattern will match foo foo but not foo bar. Regular expression engines themselves tend to be divided into two categories predominantly based on the features they expose. Regex engines that provide support for all of the above tend to use an approach called backtracking, which is typically quite fast, but can be very slow on some inputs. “Very slow” in this case means that it might take exponential time to complete a search. For example, try running this Python code: >>> import re
>>> re.search('(a*)*c', 'a' * 30)
 Even though both the regex and the search string are tiny, it will take a very long time to terminate, and this is because the underlying regex engine uses backtracking, and can therefore take exponential time to answer some queries. The other type of regex engine generally supports fewer features and is based on finite automata. For example, these kinds of regex engines typically don’t support back-references. Instead, these regex engines will often provide a guarantee that all searches, regardless of the regex or the input, will complete in linear time with respect to the search text. It’s worth pointing out that neither type of engine has a monopoly on average case performance. There are examples of regex engines of both types that are blazing fast. With that said, here’s a breakdown of some search tools and the type of regex engine they use: GNU grep and git grep each use their own hand-rolled finite automata based engine. ripgrep uses Rust’s regex library, which uses finite automata. The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep use PCRE, which uses backtracking. Both The Platinum Searcher and sift use Go’s regex library, which uses finite automata. Both Rust’s regex library and Go’s regex library share Google’s RE2 as a common ancestor. Finally, both tools that use PCRE (The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep) are susceptible to worst case backtracking behavior. For example: $ cat wat
c
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
c
$ ucg '(a*)*c' wat
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'FileScannerException'
  what():  PCRE2 match error: match limit exceeded
Aborted (core dumped)
 The Silver Searcher fails similarly. It reports the first line as a match and neglects the match in the third line. The rest of the search tools benchmarked in this article handle this case without a problem. Literal optimizations Picking a fast regex engine is important, because every search tool will need to rely on it sooner or later. Nevertheless, even the performance of the fastest regex engine can be dwarfed by the time it takes to search for a simple literal string. Boyer-Moore is the classical algorithm that is used to find a substring, and even today, it is hard to beat for general purpose searching. One of its defining qualities is its ability to skip some characters in the search text by pre-computing a small skip table at the beginning of the search. On modern CPUs, the key to making a Boyer-Moore implementation fast is not necessarily the number of characters it can skip, but how fast it can identify a candidate for a match. For example, most Boyer-Moore implementations look for the last byte in a literal. Each occurrence of that byte is considered a candidate for a match by Boyer-Moore. It is only at this point that Boyer-Moore can use its precomputed table to skip characters, which means you still need a fast way of identifying the candidate in the first place. Thankfully, specialized routines found in the C standard library, like memchr, exist for precisely this purpose. Often, memchr implementations are compiled down to SIMD instructions that examine sixteen bytes in a single loop iteration. This makes it very fast. On my system, memchr often gets throughputs at around several gigabytes a second. (In my own experiments, Boyer-Moore with memchr can be just as fast as an explicit SIMD implementation using the PCMPESTRI instruction, but this is something I’d like to revisit.) For a search tool to compete in most benchmarks, either it or its regex engine needs to use some kind of literal optimizations. For example, Rust’s regex library goes to great lengths to extract both prefix and suffix literals from every pattern. The following patterns all have literals extracted from them: foo|bar detects foo and bar (a|b)c detects ac and bc [ab]foo[yz] detects afooy, afooz, bfooy and bfooz (foo)?bar detects foobar and bar (foo)*bar detects foo and bar (foo){3,6} detects foofoofoo If any of these patterns appear at the beginning of a regex, Rust’s regex library will notice them and use them to find candidate matches very quickly (even when there is more than one literal detected). While Rust’s core regex engine is fast, it is still faster to look for literals first, and only drop down into the core regex engine when it’s time to verify a match. The best case happens when an entire regex can be broken down into a single literal or an alternation of literals. In that case, the core regex engine won’t be used at all! A search tool in particular has an additional trick up its sleeve. Namely, since most search tools do line-by-line searching (The Silver Searcher is a notable exception, which does multiline searching by default), they can extract non-prefix or “inner” literals from a regex pattern, and search for those to identify candidate lines that match. For example, the regex \w+foo\d+ could have foo extracted. Namely, when a candidate line is found, ripgrep will find the beginning and end of only that line, and then run the full regex engine on the entire line. This lets ripgrep very quickly skip through files by staying out of the regex engine. Most of the search tools we benchmark here don’t perform this optimization, which can leave a lot of performance on the table, especially if your core regex engine isn’t that fast. Handling the case of multiple literals (e.g., foo|bar) is just as important. GNU grep uses a little known algorithm similar to Commentz-Walter for searching multiple patterns. In short, Commentz-Walter is what you get when you merge Aho-Corasick with Boyer-Moore: a skip table with a reverse automaton. Rust’s regex library, on the other hand, will either use plain Aho-Corasick, or, when enabled, a special SIMD algorithm called Teddy, which was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of the Hyperscan regex library developed by Intel. This SIMD algorithm will prove to be at least one of the key optimizations that propels ripgrep past GNU grep. The great thing about this is that ripgrep doesn’t have to do much of this literal optimization work itself. Most of it is done inside Rust’s regex library, so every consumer of that library gets all these performance optimizations automatically! Mechanics Repeat after me: Thou Shalt Not Search Line By Line. The naive approach to implementing a search tool is to read a file line by line and apply the search pattern to each line individually. This approach is problematic primarily because, in the common case, finding a match is rare. Therefore, you wind up doing a ton of work parsing out each line all for naught, because most files simply aren’t going to match at all in a large repository of code. Not only is finding every line extra work that you don’t need to do, but you’re also paying a huge price in overhead. Whether you’re searching for a literal or a regex, you’ll need to start and stop that search for every single line in a file. The overhead of each search will be your undoing. Instead, all search tools find a way to search a big buffer of bytes all at once. Whether that’s memory mapping a file, reading an entire file into memory at once or incrementally searching a file using a constant sized intermediate buffer, they all find a way to do it to some extent. There are some exceptions though. For example, tools that use memory maps or read entire files into memory either can’t support stdin (like Universal Code Grep), or revert to line-by-line searching (like The Silver Searcher). Tools that support incremental searching (ripgrep, GNU grep and git grep) can use its incremental approach on any file or stream with no problems. There’s a reason why not every tool implements incremental search: it’s hard. For example, you need to consider all of the following in a fully featured search tool: Line counting, when requested. If a read from a file ends in the middle of a line, you need to do the bookkeeping required to make sure the incomplete line isn’t searched until more data is read from the file. If a line is too long to fit into your buffer, you need to decide to either give up or grow your buffer to fit it. Your searcher needs to know how to invert the match. Worst of all: your searcher needs to be able to show the context of a match, e.g., the lines before and after a matching line. For example, consider the case of a match that appears at the beginning of your buffer. How do you show the previous lines if they aren’t in your buffer? You guessed it: you need to carry over at least as many lines that are required to satisfy a context request from buffer to buffer. It’s a steep price to pay in terms of code complexity, but by golly, is it worth it. You’ll need to read on to the benchmarks to discover when it is faster than memory maps! Printing It might seem like printing is such a trivial step, but it must be done with at least some care. For example, you can’t just print matches from each search thread as you find them, because you really don’t want to interleave the search results of one file with the search results of another file. A naive approach to this is to serialize the printer so that only one thread can print to it at a time. This is problematic though, because if a search thread acquires a lock to the printer before starting the search (and not releasing it until it has finished searching one file), you’ll end up also serializing every search as well, effectively defeating your entire approach to parallelism. All code search tools in this benchmark that parallelize search therefore write results to some kind of intermediate buffer in memory. This enables all of the search threads to actually perform a search in parallel. The printing still needs to be serialized, but we’ve reduced that down to simply dumping the contents of the intermediate buffer to stdout. Using an in memory buffer might set off alarm bells: what if you search a 2GB file and every line matches? Doesn’t that lead to excessive memory usage? The answer is: “Why, yes, indeed it does!” The key insight is that the common case is returning far fewer matches than there are total lines searched. Nevertheless, there are ways to mitigate excessive memory usage. For example, if ripgrep is used to search stdin or a single file, then it will write search results directly to stdout and forgo the intermediate buffer because it just doesn’t need it. (ripgrep should also do this when asked to not do any parallelism, but I haven’t gotten to it yet.) In other words, pick two: space, time or correctness. Note that the details aren’t quite the same in every tool. Namely, while The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep write matches as structured data to memory (i.e., an array of match structs or something similar), both git grep and ripgrep write the actual output to a dynamically growable string buffer in memory. While either approach does seem to be fast enough, git grep and ripgrep have to do things this way because they support incremental search where as The Silver Searcher always memory maps the entire file and Universal Code Grep always reads the entire contents of the file into memory. The latter approach can refer back to the file’s contents in memory when doing the actual printing, where as neither git grep nor ripgrep can do that. Methodology Overview Coming up with a good and fair benchmark is hard, and I have assuredly made some mistakes in doing so. In particular, there are so many variables to control for that testing every possible permutation isn’t feasible. This means that the benchmarks I’m presenting here are curated, and, given that I am the author of one of the tools in the benchmark, they are therefore also biased. Nevertheless, even if I fail in my effort to provide a fair benchmark suite, I do hope that some of you may find my analysis interesting, which will try to explain the results in each benchmark. The analysis is in turn heavily biased toward explaining my own work, since that is the implementation I’m most familiar with. I have, however, read at least part of the source code of every tool I benchmark, including their underlying regex engines. In other words, I’m pretty confident that I’ve gotten the details correct, but I could have missed something in the bigger picture. Because of that, let’s go over some important insights that guided construction of this benchmark. Focus on the problem that an end user is trying to solve. For example, we split the entire benchmark in two: one for searching a large directory of files and one for searching a single large file. The former might correspond to an end user searching their code while the latter might correspond to an end user searching logs. As we will see, these two use cases have markedly different performance characteristics. A tool that is good at one isn’t necessarily good at the other. (The premise of ripgrep is that it is possible to be good at both!) Apply end user problems more granularly as well. For example, most searches result in few hits relative to the corpus searched, so prefer benchmarks that report few matches. Another example: I hypothesize, based on my own experience, that most searches use patterns that are simple literals, alternations or very light regexes, so bias the benchmarks towards those types of patterns. Almost every search tool has slightly different default behavior, and these behavioral changes can have an impact on performance. There is some value in looking at “out-of-the-box” performance, and we therefore do look at a benchmark for that, but stopping there is a bit unsatisfying. If our goal is to do a fair comparison, then we need to at least try to convince each tool to do roughly the same work, from the perspective of an end user. A good example of this is reporting line numbers. Some tools don’t provide a way of disabling line counting, so when doing comparisons between tools that do, we need to explicitly enable line numbers. This is important, because counting lines can be quite costly! A good non-example of this is if one tool uses memory maps and another uses an intermediate buffer. This is an implementation choice, and not one that alters what the user actually sees, therefore comparing those two implementation choices in a benchmark is completely fair (assuming an analysis that points it out). With that out of the way, let’s get into the nitty gritty. First and foremost, what tools are we benchmarking? ripgrep (rg) (v0.1.2) - You’ve heard enough about this one already. GNU grep (v2.25) - Ol’ reliable. git grep (v2.7.4) - Like grep, but built into git. Only works well in git repositories. The Silver Searcher (ag) (commit cda635, using PCRE 8.38) - Like ack, but written in C and much faster. Reads your .gitignore files just like ripgrep. Universal Code Grep (ucg) (commit 487bfb, using PCRE 10.21 with the JIT enabled) - Also like ack but written in C++, and only searches files from a whitelist, and doesn’t support reading .gitignore. The Platinum Searcher (pt) (commit 509368) - Written in Go and does support .gitignore files. sift (commit 2d175c) - Written in Go and supports .gitignore files with an optional flag, but generally prefers searching everything (unlike every other tool in this list except for grep). Notably absent from this list is ack. We don’t benchmark it here because it is outrageously slow. Even on the simplest benchmark (a literal in the Linux kernel repository), ack is around two orders of magnitude slower than ripgrep. It’s just not worth it. Benchmark runner The benchmark runner is a Python program (requires at least Python 3.5) that you can use to not only run the benchmarks themselves, but download the corpora used in the benchmarks as well. The script is called benchsuite and is in the ripgrep repository. You can use it like so: $ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep/benchsuite
# WARNING! This downloads several GB of data, and builds the Linux kernel.
# This took about 15 minutes on a high speed connection.
# Tip: try `--download subtitles-ru` to grab the smallest corpus, but you'll
# be limited to running benchmarks for only that corpus.
$ ./benchsuite --dir /path/to/data/dir --download all
# List benchmarks available.
$ ./benchsuite --dir /path/to/data/dir --list
# Run a benchmark.
# Omit the benchmark name to run all benchmarks. The full suite can take around
# 30 minutes to complete on default settings and 120 minutes to complete with
# --warmup-iter 3 --bench-iter 10.
$ ./benchsuite --dir /path/to/data/dir '^subtitles_ru_literal$'
 If you don’t have all of the code search tools used in the benchmarks, then pass --allow-missing to give benchsuite permission to skip running them. To save the raw data (the timing for every command run), pass --raw /path/to/raw.csv. The benchmark runner tries to do a few basic things for us to help reduce the chance that we get misleading data: Every benchmarked command is run three times before being measured as a “warm up.” Specifically, this is to ensure that the corpora being searched is already in the operating system’s page cache. If we didn’t do this, we might end up benchmarking disk I/O, which is not only uninteresting for our purposes, but is probably not a common end user scenario. It’s more likely that you’ll be executing lots of searches against the same corpus (at least, I know I do). Every benchmarked command is run ten times, with a timing recorded for each run. The final “result” of that command is its distribution (mean +/- standard deviation). If I were a statistician, I could probably prove that ten samples is insufficient. Nevertheless, getting more samples takes more time, and for the most part, the variance is very low. Each individual benchmark definition is responsible for making sure each command is trying to do similar work as other commands we’re comparing it to. For example, we need to be careful to enable and disable Unicode support in GNU grep where appropriate, because full Unicode handling can make GNU grep run very slowly. Within each benchmark, there are often multiple variables of interest. To account for this, I’ve added labels like (ASCII) or (whitelist) where appropriate. We’ll dig into those labels in more detail later. Please also feel encouraged to add your own benchmarks if you’d like to play around. The benchmarks are in the top-half of the file, and it should be fairly straight-forward to copy & paste another benchmark and modify it. Simply defining a new benchmark will make it available. The second half of the script is the runner itself and probably shouldn’t need to be modified. Environment The actual environment used to run the benchmarks presented in this article was a c3.2xlarge instance on Amazon EC2. It ran Ubuntu 16.04, had a Xeon E5-2680 2.8 GHz CPU, 16 GB of memory and an 80 GB SSD (on which the corpora was stored). This was enough memory to fit all of the corpora in memory. The box was specifically provisioned for the purpose of running benchmarks, so it was not doing anything else. The full log of system setup and commands I used to install each of the search tools and run benchmarks can be found here. I also captured the output of the bench runner (SPOILER ALERT) and the raw output, which includes the timings, full set of command line arguments and any environment variables set for every command run in every benchmark. Code search benchmarks This is the first half of our benchmarks, and corresponds to an end user trying to search a large repository of code for a particular pattern. The corpus used for this benchmark is a built checkout of the Linux kernel, specifically commit d0acc7. We actually build the Linux kernel because the process of building the kernel leaves a lot of garbage in the repository that you probably don’t want to search. This can influence not only the relevance of the results returned by a search tool, but the performance as well. All benchmarks run in this section were run in the root of the repository. Remember, you can see the full raw results of each command if you like. The benchmark names correspond to the headings below. Note that since these benchmarks were run on an EC2 instance, which uses a VM, which in turn can penalize search tools that use memory maps, I’ve also recorded benchmarks on my local machine. My local machine is an Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 16 CPUs, 64 GB memory and an SSD. You’ll notice that ag does a lot better (but still worse than rg) on my machine. Lest you think I’ve chosen results from the EC2 machine because they paint rg more favorably, rest assured that I haven’t. Namely, rg wins every single benchmark on my local machine except for one, where as rg is beat out just slightly by a few tools on some benchmarks on the EC2 machine. Without further ado, let’s start looking at benchmarks. linux_literal_default Description: This benchmark compares the time it takes to execute a simple literal search using each tool’s default settings. This is an intentionally unfair benchmark meant to highlight the differences between tools and their “out-of-the-box” settings. Pattern: PM_RESUME rg         0.349 +/- 0.104 (lines: 16)
ag         1.589 +/- 0.009 (lines: 16)
ucg        0.218 +/- 0.007 (lines: 16)*+
pt         0.462 +/- 0.012 (lines: 16)
sift       0.352 +/- 0.018 (lines: 16)
git grep   0.342 +/- 0.005 (lines: 16)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. rg == ripgrep, ag == The Silver Searcher, ucg == Universal Code Grep, pt == The Platinum Searcher Analysis: We’ll first start by actually describing what each tool is doing: rg respects the Linux repo’s .gitignore files (of which there are 178(!) of them), and skips hidden and binary files. rg does not count lines. ag has the same default behavior as rg, except it counts lines. ucg also counts lines, but does not attempt to read .gitignore files. Instead, it only searches files from an (extensible) whitelist according to a set of glob rules. For example, both rg and ag will search fs/jffs2/README.Locking while ucg won’t, because it doesn’t recognize the Locking extension. (A search tool probably should search that file, although it does not impact the results of this specific benchmark.) pt has the same default behavior as ag. sift searches everything, including binary files and hidden files. It should be equivalent to grep -r, for example. It also does not count lines. git grep should have the same behavior at rg, and similarly does not count lines. Note though that git grep has a special advantage: it does not need to traverse the directory hierarchy. It can discover the set of files to search straight from its git index. The high-order bit to extract from this benchmark is that a naive comparison between search tools is completely unfair from the perspective of performance, but is really important if you care about the relevance of results returned to you. sift, like grep -r, will throw everything it can back at you, which is totally at odds with the philosophy behind every other tool in this benchmark: only return results that are probably relevant. Things inside your .git probably aren’t, for example. (This isn’t to say that sift’s philosophy is wrong. The tool is clearly intended to be configured by an end user to their own tastes, which has its own pros and cons.) With respect to performance, there are two key variables to pay attention to. They will appear again and again throughout our benchmark: Counting lines can be quite expensive. A naive solution—a loop over every byte and comparing it to a \n—will be quite slow for example. Universal Code Grep counts lines using SIMD and ripgrep counts lines using packed comparisons (16 bytes at a time). However, in the Linux code search benchmarks, because the size of each individual file is very small and the number of matches is tiny compared to the corpus size, the time spent counting lines tends to not be so significant. Especially since every tool in this benchmark parallelizes search to some degree. When we get to the single-file benchmarks, this variable will become much more pertinent. Respecting .gitignore files incurs some amount of overhead. Even though respecting .gitignore reduces the number of files searched, it can be slower overall to actually read the patterns, compile them and match them against every path than to just search every file. This is precisely how ucg soundly beats ripgrep in this benchmark. (We will control for this variable in future benchmarks.) In other words, respecting .gitignore is a feature that improves relevance first and foremost. It is strictly a bonus if it also happens to improve performance. The specific reasons why supporting .gitignore leads to a slower overall search are: Every directory descended requires looking for a corresponding .gitignore. Multiply the number of calls if you support additional ignore files, like both The Silver Searcher and ripgrep do. The Linux kernel repository has 4,640 directories. 178 of them have .gitignore files. Each .gitignore file needs to be compiled into something that can match file paths. Both The Silver Searcher and ripgrep use tricks to make this faster. For example, simple patterns like /vmlinux or *.o can be matched using simple literal comparisons or by looking at the file extension of a candidate path and comparing it directly. For more complex patterns like *.c.[012]*.*, a full glob matcher needs to be used. The Silver Searcher uses fnmatch while ripgrep translates all such globs into a single regular expression which can be matched against a single path all at once. Doing all this work takes time. Unlike ag, rg will try to support the full semantics of a .gitignore file. This means finding every ignore pattern that matches a file path and giving precedent to the most recently defined pattern. ag will bail on the first match it sees. Actually matching a path has non-trivial overhead that must be paid for every path searched. The compilation phase described above is complex precisely for making this part faster. We try to stay out of the regex machinery as best we can, but we can’t avoid it completely. In contrast, a whitelist like the one used by ucg is comparatively easy to make fast. The set of globs is known upfront, so no additional checks need to be made while traversing the file tree. Moreover, the globs tend to be of the *.ext variety, which fall into the bucket of globs that can be matched efficiently just by looking at the extension of a file path. The downside of a whitelist is obvious: you might end up missing search results simply because ucg didn’t know about a particular file extension. You could always teach ucg about the file extension, but you’re still blind to “unknown unknowns” (i.e., files that you probably want to search but didn’t know upfront that you needed to). linux_literal Description: This benchmark runs the same query as in the linux_literal_default benchmark, but we try to do a fair comparison. In particular, we run ripgrep in two modes: one where it respects .gitignore files (corresponding to the (ignore) label) and one where it uses a whitelist and doesn’t respect .gitignore (corresponding to the (whitelist) label). The former mode is comparable to ag, pt, sift and git grep, while the latter mode is comparable to ucg. We also run rg a third time by explicitly telling it to use memory maps for search, which matches the implementation strategy used by ag. sift is run such that it respects .gitignore files and excludes binary, hidden and PDF files. All commands executed here count lines, because some commands (ag and ucg) don’t support disabling line counting. Pattern: PM_RESUME rg (ignore)          0.334 +/- 0.053 (lines: 16)

 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: We have a ton of ground to cover on this one. First and foremost, the (ignore) vs. (whitelist) variables have a clear impact on the performance of rg. We won’t rehash all the details from the analysis in linux_literal_default, but switching rg into its whitelist mode brings it into a dead heat with ucg. Secondly, ucg is just as fast as ripgrep and git grep (ignore) is just as fast as rg (ignore), even though I’ve said that ripgrep is the fastest. It turns out that ucg, git grep and rg are pretty evenly matched when searching for plain literals in large repositories. We will see a stronger separation in later benchmarks. Still, what makes ucg fast? ucg reads the entire file into memory before searching it, which means it avoids the memory map problem described below. On a code repository, this approach works well, but it comes with a steep price in the single-file benchmarks. It has a fast explicitly SIMD based line counting algorithm. ripgrep has something similar, but relies on the compiler for autovectorization. ucg uses PCRE2’s JIT, which is insanely fast. In my own very rough benchmarks, PCRE2’s JIT is one of the few general purpose regex engines that is competitive with Rust’s regex engine (on regexes that don’t expose PCRE’s exponential behavior due to backtracking, since Rust’s regex engine doesn’t suffer from that weakness). ucg parallelizes directory traversal, which is something that ripgrep doesn’t do. ucg has it a bit easier here because it doesn’t support .gitignore files. Parallelizing directory traversal while maintaining state for .gitignore files in a way that scales isn’t a problem I’ve figured out how to cleanly solve yet. What about git grep? A key performance advantage of git grep is that it doesn’t need to walk the directory tree, which can save it quite a bit of time. Its regex engine is also quite fast, and works similarly to GNU grep’s, RE2 and Rust’s regex engine (i.e., it uses a DFA). Both sift and pt perform almost as well as ripgrep. In fact, both sift and pt do implement a parallel recursive directory traversal while still respecting .gitignore files, which is likely one reason for their speed. As we will see in future benchmarks, their speed here is misleading. Namely, they are fast because they stay outside of Go’s regexp engine since the pattern is a literal. (There will be more discussion on this point later.) Finally, what’s going on with The Silver Searcher? Is it really that much slower than everything else? The key here is that its use of memory maps is making it slower, not faster (in direct contradiction to the claims in its README). OK, let’s pause and pop up a level to talk about what this actually means. First, we need to consider how these search tools fundamentally work. Generally speaking, a search tool like this has two ways of actually searching files on disk: It can memory map the file and search the entire file all at once as if it were a single contiguous region of bytes in memory. The operating system does the work behind the scenes to make a file look like a contiguous region of memory. This particular approach is really convenient when comparing it to the alternative described next. … or it can allocate an intermediate buffer, read a fixed size block of bytes from the file into it, search the buffer and then repeat the process. This particular approach is absolutely ghoulish to implement, because you need to account for the fact that a buffer may end in the middle of the line. You also need to account for the fact that a single line may exceed the size of your buffer. Finally, if you’re going to support showing the lines around a match (its “context”) as both grep and ripgrep do, then you need to do additional bookkeeping to make sure any lines from a previous buffer are printed even if a match occurs at the beginning of the next block read from the file. Naively, it seems like (1) would be obviously faster. Surely, all of the bookkeeping and copying in (2) would make it much slower! In fact, this is not at all true. (1) may not require much bookkeeping from the perspective of the programmer, but there is a lot of bookkeeping going on inside the Linux kernel to maintain the memory map. (That link goes to a mailing list post that is quite old, but it still appears relevant today.) When I first started writing ripgrep, I used the memory map approach. It took me a long time to be convinced enough to start down the second path with an intermediate buffer (because neither a CPU profile nor the output of strace ever showed any convincing evidence that memory maps were to blame), but as soon as I had a prototype of (2) working, it was clear that it was much faster than the memory map approach. With all that said, memory maps aren’t all bad. They just happen to be bad for the particular use case of “rapidly open, scan and close memory maps for thousands of small files.” For a different use case, like, say, “open this large file and search it once,” memory maps turn out to be a boon. We’ll see that in action in our single-file benchmarks later. The key datapoint that supports this conclusion is the comparison between rg (ignore) and rg (ignore) (mmap). In particular, this controls for everything except for the search strategy and fairly conclusively points right at memory maps as the problem. With all that said, the performance of memory maps is very dependent on your environment, and the absolute difference between rg (ignore) and ag (ignore) (mmap) can be misleading. In particular, since these benchmarks were run on an EC2 c3.2xlarge, we were probably inside a virtual machine, which could feasibly impact memory map performance. To test this, I ran the same benchmark on my machine under my desk (Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 16 CPUs, 64 GB memory, SSD) and got these results: rg (ignore)          0.156 +/- 0.006 (lines: 16)
rg (ignore) (mmap)   0.397 +/- 0.013 (lines: 16)
ag (ignore) (mmap)   0.444 +/- 0.016 (lines: 16)
pt (ignore)          0.159 +/- 0.008 (lines: 16)
sift (ignore)        0.344 +/- 0.002 (lines: 16)
git grep (ignore)    0.195 +/- 0.023 (lines: 16)
rg (whitelist)       0.108 +/- 0.005 (lines: 16)*+
ucg (whitelist)      0.165 +/- 0.005 (lines: 16)
 rg (ignore) still soundly beats ag, and our memory map conclusions above are still supported by this data, but the difference between rg (ignore) and ag (ignore) (mmap) has narrowed quite a bit! linux_literal_casei Description: This benchmark is like linux_literal, except it asks the search tool to perform a case insensitive search. Pattern: PM_RESUME (with the -i flag set) rg (ignore)          0.345 +/- 0.073 (lines: 370)
rg (ignore) (mmap)   1.612 +/- 0.011 (lines: 370)
ag (ignore) (mmap)   1.609 +/- 0.015 (lines: 370)
pt (ignore)          17.204 +/- 0.126 (lines: 370)
sift (ignore)        0.805 +/- 0.005 (lines: 370)
git grep (ignore)    0.343 +/- 0.007 (lines: 370)
rg (whitelist)       0.222 +/- 0.021 (lines: 370)+
ucg (whitelist)      0.217 +/- 0.006 (lines: 370)*
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: The biggest change from the previous benchmark is that pt got an order of magnitude slower than the next slowest tool. So why did pt get so slow? In particular, both sift and pt use Go’s regexp package for searching, so why did one perish while the other only got slightly slower? It turns out that when pt sees the -i flag indicating case insensitive search, it will force itself to use Go’s regexp engine with the i flag set. So for example, given a CLI invocation of pt -i foo, it will translate that to a Go regexp of (?i)foo, which will handle the case insensitive search. On the other hand, sift will notice the -i flag and take a different route. sift will lowercase both the pattern and every block of bytes it searches. This filter over all the bytes searched is likely the cause of sift’s performance drop from the previous linux_literal benchmark. (It’s worth pointing out that this optimization is actually incorrect, because it only accounts for ASCII case insensitivity, and not full Unicode case insensitivity, which pt gets by virture of Go’s regexp engine.) But still, is Go’s regexp engine really that slow? Unfortunately, yes, it is. While Go’s regexp engine takes worst case linear time on all searches (and is therefore exponentially faster than even PCRE2 for some set of regexes and corpora), its actual implementation hasn’t quite matured yet. Indeed, every fast regex engine based on finite automata that I’m aware of implements some kind of DFA engine. For example, GNU grep, Google’s RE2 and Rust’s regex library all do this. Go’s does not (but there is work in progress to make this happen, so perhaps pt will get faster on this benchmark without having to do anything at all!). There is one other thing worth noting here before moving on. Namely, that rg, ag, git grep and ucg didn’t noticeably change much from the previous benchmark. Shouldn’t a case insensitive search incur some kind of overhead? The answer is complicated and actually requires more knowledge of the underlying regex engines than I have. Thankfully, I can at least answer it for Rust’s regex engine. The key insight is that a case insensitive search for PM_RESUME is precisely the same as a case sensitive search of the alternation of all possible case agnostic versions of PM_RESUME. So for example, it might start like: PM_RESUME|pM_RESUME|Pm_RESUME|PM_rESUME|... and so on. Of course, the full alternation, even for a small literal like this, would be quite large. The key is that we can extract a small prefix and enumerate all of its combinations quite easily. In this case, Rust’s regex engine figures out this alternation (which you can see by passing --debug to rg and examining stderr): PM_RE
PM_Re
PM_rE
PM_re
Pm_RE
Pm_Re
Pm_rE
Pm_re
pM_RE
pM_Re
pM_rE
pM_re
pm_RE
pm_Re
pm_rE
pm_re
 (Rest assured that Unicode support is baked into this process. For example, a case insensitive search for S would yield the following literals: S, s and ſ.) Now that we have this alternation of literals, what do we do with them? The classical answer is to compile them into a DFA (perhaps Aho-Corasick), and use it as a way to quickly skip through the search text. A match of any of the literals would then cause the regex engine to activate and try to verify the match. This way, we aren’t actually running the entire search text through the regex engine, which could be quite a bit slower. But, Rust’s regex engine doesn’t actually use Aho-Corasick for this. When SIMD acceleration is enabled (and you can be sure it is for these benchmarks, and for the binaries I distribute), a special multiple pattern search algorithm called Teddy is used. The algorithm is unpublished, but was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of Intel’s Hyperscan regex library. The algorithm works roughly by using packed comparisons of 16 bytes at a time to find candidate locations where a literal might match. I adapted the algorithm from the Hyperscan project to Rust, and included an extensive write up in the comments if you’re interested. While Teddy doesn’t buy us much over other tools in this particular benchmark, we will see much larger wins in later benchmarks. linux_word Description: This benchmarks the PM_RESUME literal again, but adds the -w flag to each tool. The -w flag has the following behavior: all matches reported must be considered “words.” That is, a “word” is something that starts and ends at a word boundary, where a word boundary is defined as a position in the search text that is adjacent to both a word character and a non-word character. Pattern: PM_RESUME (with the -w flag set) rg (ignore)         0.362 +/- 0.080 (lines: 6)
ag (ignore)         1.603 +/- 0.009 (lines: 6)
pt (ignore)         14.417 +/- 0.144 (lines: 6)
sift (ignore)       7.840 +/- 0.123 (lines: 6)
git grep (ignore)   0.341 +/- 0.005 (lines: 6)
rg (whitelist)      0.220 +/- 0.026 (lines: 6)*+
ucg (whitelist)     0.221 +/- 0.007 (lines: 6)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: Not much has changed between this benchmark and the previous linux_literal or linux_literal_casei benchmarks. The most important thing to note is that most search tools handle the -w flag just fine without any noticeable drop in performance. There are two additional things I’d like to note. rg is searching with Unicode aware word boundaries where as the rest of the tools are using ASCII only word boundaries. (git grep can be made to use Unicode word boundaries by adjusting your system’s locale settings. In this benchmark, we force it to use ASCII word boundaries.) sift and pt are the only tools that gets noticeably slower in this benchmark compared to previous benchmarks. The reason is the same as the reason why pt got noticeably slower in the linux_literal_casei benchmark: both pt and sift are now also bottlenecked on Go’s regexp library. pt and sift could do a little better here by staying out of Go’s regexp library and searching for the PM_RESUME literal, and then only confirming whether the match corresponds to a word boundary after it found a hit for PM_RESUME. This still might use Go’s regexp library, but in a much more limited form. linux_unicode_word Description: This benchmarks a simple query for all prefixed forms of the “amp-hour” (Ah) unit of measurement. For example, it should show things like mAh (for milliamp-hour) and µAh (for microamp-hour). It is particularly interesting because the second form starts with µ, which is part of a Unicode aware \w character class, but not an ASCII-only \w character class. We again continue to control for the overhead of respecting .gitignore files. Pattern: \wAh rg (ignore)                 0.355 +/- 0.073 (lines: 186)
rg (ignore) (ASCII)         0.329 +/- 0.060 (lines: 174)
ag (ignore) (ASCII)         1.774 +/- 0.011 (lines: 174)
pt (ignore) (ASCII)         14.180 +/- 0.180 (lines: 174)
sift (ignore) (ASCII)       11.087 +/- 0.108 (lines: 174)
git grep (ignore)           13.045 +/- 0.008 (lines: 186)
git grep (ignore) (ASCII)   2.991 +/- 0.004 (lines: 174)
rg (whitelist)              0.235 +/- 0.031 (lines: 180)
rg (whitelist) (ASCII)      0.225 +/- 0.023 (lines: 168)*+
ucg (ASCII)                 0.229 +/- 0.007 (lines: 168)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: In this benchmark, we’ve introduced a new variable: whether or not to enable Unicode support in each tool. Searches that are Unicode aware report slightly more matches that are missed by the other ASCII only searches. Of all the tools here, the only ones that support Unicode toggling are rg and git grep. rg’s Unicode support can be toggled by setting a flag in the pattern itself (e.g., \w is Unicode aware while (?-u)\w is not), and git grep’s Unicode suport can be toggled by setting the LC_ALL environment variable (where en_US.UTF-8 is one way to enable Unicode support and C forces it to be ASCII). More generally, git grep’s Unicode support is supposed to line up with your system’s locale settings—setting LC_ALL is a bit of a hack. It gets a little worse than that actually. Not only are rg and git grep the only ones to support toggling Unicode, but they are the only ones to support Unicode at all. ag, pt, sift and ucg will all force you to use the ASCII only \w character class. (For pt and sift in particular, Go’s regexp library doesn’t have the ability to treat \w as Unicode aware. For ag and ucg, which use PCRE, \w could be made Unicode aware with a flag sent to PCRE. Neither tool exposes that functionality though.) The key result to note here is that while git grep suffers a major performance hit for enabling Unicode support, ripgrep hums along just fine with no noticeable loss in performance, even though both rg (ignore) and git grep (ignore) report the same set of results. As in the previous benchmark, both pt and sift could do better here by searching for the Ah literal, and only using Go’s regexp library to verify a match.) Looking at the benchmark results, I can think of two important questions to ask: Why is git grep (ignore) (ASCII) so much slower than rg (ignore) (ASCII)? And while the two aren’t directly comparable, it’s also a lot slower than ucg (ASCII). How is rg (ignore) (which is Unicode aware) just as fast as rg (ignore) (ASCII)? I actually don’t have a great answer for (1). In the case of rg at least, it will extract the Ah literal suffix from the regex and use that to find candidate matches before running the \w prefix. While GNU grep has sophisticated literal extraction as well, it looks like git grep doesn’t go to similar lengths to extract literals. (I’m arriving at this conclusion after skimming the source of git grep, so I could be wrong.) In the case of ucg, it’s likely that PCRE2 is doing a similar literal optimization that rg is doing. (2) is fortunately much easier to answer. The trick is not inside of rg, but inside its regex library. Namely, the regex engine builds UTF-8 decoding into its finite state machine. (This is a trick that is originally attributed to Ken Thompson, but was more carefully described by Russ Cox. To read more about how this is achieved in Rust’s regex engine, please see the utf8-ranges library.) The reason why this is fast is because there is no extra decoding step required. The regex can be matched directly against UTF-8 encoded byte strings one byte at a time. Invalid UTF-8 doesn’t pose any problems: the finite automaton simply won’t match it because it doesn’t recognize it. In contrast, git grep (and GNU grep) have a completely separate path in their core matching code for handling Unicode aware features like this. To be fair, git grep can handle text encodings other than UTF-8, where as rg is limited to UTF-8 (or otherwise “ASCII compatible” text encodings) at the moment. linux_re_literal_suffix Description: This benchmarks a simple regex pattern that ends with a literal. We continue to control for the overhead of respecting .gitignore files. Pattern: [A-Z]+_RESUME rg (ignore)         0.318 +/- 0.034 (lines: 1652)
ag (ignore)         1.899 +/- 0.008 (lines: 1652)
pt (ignore)         13.713 +/- 0.241 (lines: 1652)
sift (ignore)       10.172 +/- 0.186 (lines: 1652)
git grep (ignore)   1.108 +/- 0.004 (lines: 1652)
rg (whitelist)      0.221 +/- 0.022 (lines: 1630)*+
ucg (whitelist)     0.301 +/- 0.001 (lines: 1630)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: This benchmark doesn’t reveal anything particularly new that we haven’t already learned from previous benchmarks. In particular, both rg and ucg continue to be competitive, pt and sift are getting bottlenecked by Go’s regexp library and git grep has a slow down similar to the one observed in linux_unicode_word. (My hypothesis for that slow down continues to be that git grep is missing the literal optimization.) Finally, ag continues to be held back by its use of memory maps. rg, and almost assuredly ucg (by virtue of PCRE2), are picking on the _RESUME literal suffix and searching for that instead of running the regex over the entire search text. This explains why both tools are able to maintain their speed even as the pattern gets slightly more complex. rg does seem to slightly edge out ucg here, which might be attributable to differences in how each underlying regex library does literal search. linux_alternates Description: This benchmarks an alternation of four literals. The literals were specifically chosen to start with four distinct bytes to make it harder to optimize. Pattern: ERR_SYS|PME_TURN_OFF|LINK_REQ_RST|CFG_BME_EVT rg (ignore)         0.351 +/- 0.074 (lines: 68)
ag (ignore)         1.747 +/- 0.005 (lines: 68)
git grep (ignore)   0.501 +/- 0.003 (lines: 68)
rg (whitelist)      0.216 +/- 0.031 (lines: 68)+
ucg (whitelist)     0.214 +/- 0.008 (lines: 68)*
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. We drop pt and sift from this benchmark and the next one for expediency. In this benchmark and in a few previous benchmarks, they have been hovering around an order of magnitude slower than the next slowest tool. Neither get any better as the complexity of our patterns increase. Analysis: Yet again, both rg and ucg maintain high speed even as the pattern grows beyond a simple literal. In this case, there isn’t any one particular literal that we can search to find match candidates quickly, but a good regular expression engine can still find ways to speed this up. For rg in particular, it sees the four literals and diverts to the Teddy multiple pattern SIMD algorithm (as described in the linux_literal_casei benchmark). In fact, for this particular pattern, Rust’s core regex engine is never used at all. Namely, it notices that a literal match of any of the alternates corresponds to an overall match of the pattern, so it can completely skip the verification step. This makes searching alternates of literals very fast. linux_alternates_casei Description: This benchmark is precisely the same as the linux_alternates benchmark, except we make the search case insensitive by adding the -i flag. Note that git grep is run under ASCII mode, in order to give it every chance to be fast. Pattern: ERR_SYS|PME_TURN_OFF|LINK_REQ_RST|CFG_BME_EVT (with the -i flag set) rg (ignore)         0.391 +/- 0.078 (lines: 160)
ag (ignore)         1.968 +/- 0.009 (lines: 160)
git grep (ignore)   2.018 +/- 0.006 (lines: 160)
rg (whitelist)      0.222 +/- 0.001 (lines: 160)*+
ucg (whitelist)     0.522 +/- 0.002 (lines: 160)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: The case insensitive flag causes quite a bit of separation, relative to the previous linux_alterates benchmark. For one, git grep gets over 4 times slower. Even ucg gets twice as slow. Yet, rg continues to maintain its speed! The secret continues to be the Teddy algorithm, just as in the linux_alternates benchmark. The trick lies in how we transform an alternation of case insensitive literals into a larger alternation that the Teddy algorithm can actually use. In fact, it works exactly how it was described in the linux_literal_casei benchmark: we enumerate all possible alternations of each literal that are required for case insensitive match. Since that can be quite a large number, we limit ourselves to a small number of prefixes from that set that we can enumerate. In this case, we use the following prefixes (which can be seen by running rg with the --debug flag): CFG_

 We feed these literals to the Teddy algorithm, which will quickly identify candidate matches in the search text. When a candidate match is found, we need to verify it since a match of a prefix doesn’t necessarily mean the entire pattern matches. It is only at that point that we actually invoke the full regex engine. linux_unicode_greek Description: This benchmarks usage of a particular Unicode feature that permits one to match a certain class of codepoints defined in Unicode. Both Rust’s regex engine and Go’s regex engine support this natively, but none of the other tools do. Pattern: \p{Greek} (matches any Greek symbol) rg     0.414 +/- 0.021 (lines: 23)*+
pt     12.745 +/- 0.166 (lines: 23)
sift   7.767 +/- 0.264 (lines: 23)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: This one is pretty simple. rg compiles \p{Greek} into a deterministic finite state machine while Go (used in pt and sift) will also use a finite state machine, but it is a nondeterministic simulation. The core difference between the two approaches is that the former is only ever in one state at any point in time, while the latter must constantly keep track of all the different states it is in. linux_unicode_greek_casei Description: This benchmark is just like the linux_unicode_greek benchmark, except it makes the search case insensitive. This particular query is a bit idiosyncratic, but it does demonstrate just how well supported Unicode is in rg. Pattern: \p{Greek} (with the -i flag set, matches any Greek symbol) rg     0.425 +/- 0.027 (lines: 103)
pt     12.612 +/- 0.217 (lines: 23)
sift   0.002 +/- 0.000 (lines: 0)*+
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: sift doesn’t actually beat rg here: it just gets so confused by the search request that it gives up and reports no matches. pt seems to execute the search, but doesn’t handle Unicode case insensitivity correctly. Meanwhile, rg handles the request just fine, and it’s still fast. In this particular case, the entire Greek category, along with all of its case-insensitive variants, are compiled into a single fast deterministic finite state machine. One interesting thing to note about this search is that if you run it, you’ll see a lot more results containing the character µ, which looks essentially identical to the character μ that also shows up in a case sensitive search. As you might have guessed, even though these two characters look the same, they are in fact distinct Unicode codepoints: µ is MICRO SIGN with codepoint U+000000B5. μ is GREEK SMALL LETTER MU with codepoint U+000003BC. The latter codepoint is considered part of the \p{Greek} group while the former codepoint is not (the former codepoint appears to be the correct sigil to use in the case of the Linux kernel). However, the Unicode simple case folding tables map MICRO SIGN to GREEK SMALL LETTER MU, which causes rg to pick up on lines containing MICRO SIGN even though it strictly isn’t part of the Greek group. linux_no_literal Description: This is the last benchmark on the Linux kernel source code and is a bit idiosyncratic like linux_unicode_greek_casei. In particular, it looks for lines containing 5 consecutive repetitions of 5 word characters, each separated by one or more space characters. The key distinction of this pattern from every other pattern in this benchmark is that it does not contain any literals. Given the presence of \w and \s, which have valid Unicode and ASCII interpretations, we attempt to control for the presence of Unicode support. Pattern: \w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5} rg (ignore)                 0.577 +/- 0.003 (lines: 490)
rg (ignore) (ASCII)         0.416 +/- 0.025 (lines: 490)
ag (ignore) (ASCII)         2.339 +/- 0.010 (lines: 766)
pt (ignore) (ASCII)         22.066 +/- 0.057 (lines: 490)
sift (ignore) (ASCII)       25.563 +/- 0.108 (lines: 490)
git grep (ignore)           26.382 +/- 0.044 (lines: 490)
git grep (ignore) (ASCII)   4.153 +/- 0.010 (lines: 490)
rg (whitelist)              0.503 +/- 0.011 (lines: 419)
rg (whitelist) (ASCII)      0.343 +/- 0.038 (lines: 419)*+
ucg (whitelist) (ASCII)     1.130 +/- 0.003 (lines: 416)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. ag reports many more matches than other tools because it does multiline search where the \s can match a \n. Analysis: Since this particular pattern doesn’t have any literals in it, it’s entirely up to the underlying regex engine to answer this query. It can’t be smart and skip through the input—it has to pass it completely through the regex engine. Since non-literal patterns are pretty rare in my experience, this benchmark exists primarily as an engineered way to test how well the underlying regex engines perform. rg, regardless of whether it respects .gitignore files or whether it handles Unicode correctly, does quite well here compared to other tools. git grep in particular pays a 5x penalty for Unicode support. rg on the other hand pays about a 0.3x penalty for Unicode support. Interestingly, even though ucg doesn’t enable Unicode support, not even PCRE2’s JIT can compete with rg! What makes rg so fast here? And what actually causes the 0.3x penalty? rg continues to be fast on this benchmark primarily for the same reason why it’s fast with other Unicode-centric benchmarks: it compiles the UTF-8 decoding right into its deterministic finite state machine. This means there is no extra step to decode the search text into Unicode codepoints first. We can match directly on the raw bytes. To a first approximation, the performance penalty comes from compiling the DFA to match the pattern. In particular, the DFA to match the Unicode variant is much much larger than the DFA to match the ASCII variant. To give you a rough idea of the size difference: The ASCII DFA has about 250 distinct NFA states. The Unicode DFA has about 77,000 distinct NFA states. (These numbers are produced directly from the compiler in Rust’s regex library, and don’t necessarily reflect a minimal automaton.) A DFA produced from these patterns doesn’t necessarily have the same number of states, since each DFA state typically corresponds to multiple NFA states. (Check out the Powerset construction Wikipedia article. Although it doesn’t correspond to the same implementation strategy used in Rust’s regex engine, it should give good intuition.) However, the first approximation is a bit misleading. While Rust’s regex engine does have a preprocessing compilation phase, it does not actually include converting an NFA into a DFA. Indeed, that would be far too slow and could take exponential time! Instead, Rust’s regex engine builds the DFA on the fly or “lazily,” as it searches the text. In the case of the ASCII pattern, this search barely spends any time constructing the DFA states since there are so few of them. However, in the Unicode case, since there are so many NFA states, it winds up spending a lot of time compiling new DFA states. (I’ve confirmed this by inspecting a profile generated by perf.) Digging a bit deeper, the actual story here might be subtler. For example, the Unicode pattern might wind up with the same number of DFA states as the ASCII pattern, primarily because the input its searching is the same and is primarily ASCII. The slow down then must come from the fact that each individual DFA state takes longer to build. This is likely correct since a single Unicode \w is over two orders of magnitude larger than a single ASCII \w. Therefore, each DFA state probably has a lot more NFA states in it for the Unicode pattern as opposed to the ASCII pattern. It’s not clear whether we can do any better here (other than trying to minimize the Unicode \w, which would be totally feasible), since we don’t actually know the composition of the search text ahead of time. One idea for improvement is to have multiple types of DFAs. For example, you might imagine trying to match with an ASCII only DFA. If the DFA sees a non-ASCII byte, then it could cause a transition into a Unicode-aware DFA. However, the penalty here is so small that it’s hard to justify this kind of implementation complexity! Single file benchmarks In the second half of our benchmarks, we will shift gears and look more closely at the performance of search tools on a single large file. Each benchmark will be run on two samples of the OpenSubtitles2016 dataset. One sample will be English and therefore predominantly ASCII, and another sample will be in Russian and therefore predominantly Cyrillic. The patterns for the Russian sample were translated from English using Google Translate. (Sadly, I can’t read Russian, but I have tried each search by hand and confirmed that a sample of the results I was looking at were relevant by piping them back through Google Translate.) The English sample is around 1GB and the Russian sample is around 1.6GB, so the benchmark timings aren’t directly comparable. In this benchmark, the performance of the underlying regex engine and various literal optimizations matter a lot more. The two key variables we’ll need to control for are line counting and Unicode support. Normally, we’d just not request line counting from any of the tools, but neither of The Silver Searcher or Universal Code Grep support disabling line numbers. Additionally, Unicode support is tricky to control for in some examples because ripgrep does not support ASCII only case insensitive semantics when searching with a non-ASCII string. It’s Unicode all the way and there’s no way to turn it off. As we’ll see, at least for ripgrep, it’s still faster than its ASCII alternatives even when providing case insensitive Unicode support. As with the Linux benchmark, you can see precisely which command was run and its recorded time in the raw data. ripgrep utterly dominates this round, both in performance and correctness. subtitles_literal Description: This benchmarks the simplest case for any search tool: find all occurrences of a literal string. Tools annotated with (lines) were passed the -n flag (or equivalent) so that the output reports line numbers. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes rg             0.268 +/- 0.000 (lines: 629)*+

 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. This is the only benchmark that contains pt and sift, since they become too slow in all future benchmarks. Analysis: Whether it’s part of the underlying regex engine or part of the search tool itself, every search tool in this benchmark does some kind of literal optimization. ag will inspect the pattern, and if it doesn’t contain any special regex characters, then it will use a Boyer-Moore variant to perform the search instead of PCRE. GNU grep does something similar, although it has clearly been the subject of much optimization. If that’s true, how does rg beat GNU grep by almost a factor of 2? Well, first and foremost, we note that both sift and ucg beat GNU grep as well. I won’t be able to go into detail on ucg’s speed since PCRE2’s JIT isn’t something I understand very well, but I can at least tell you that the reasons why rg and sift are faster than GNU grep are actually distinct: sift uses Go’s regexp library, which will do at least one small literal optimization: if every match of a regex starts with the same byte, the regex engine will scan for that byte before starting a match. If you follow the code that does the scan for the byte all the way back to its source for x86_64 systems, then you’ll find that it is using AVX2 instructions and ymm registers, which permit scanning 32 bytes in each iteration. In contrast, GNU grep uses libc’s memchr, which doesn’t use AVX2. However, that C code will be autovectorized to use xmm registers and SIMD instructions, which are half the size of ymm registers. In other words, by virture of being written in Go, sift is making more efficient use of the CPU. rg also uses memchr from libc. The rg binary that was used in this benchmark was statically linked with musl, which provides its own implementation of memchr. Despite it being quite a bit terser than GNU’s libc implementation used in GNU grep, it appears to be doing roughly the same work. If that’s the case, how is rg faster? The answer lies not in memchr nor in the variant of Boyer-Moore nor in the number characters Boyer-Moore can skip. The answer instead lies in which byte is given to memchr. rg will actually try to guess the “rarest” byte in a literal, and use memchr on that. (A standard Boyer-Moore implementation will use memchr always on the last byte.) In this particular case, running memchr on either S or H is probably quite a bit better than running it on s because S and H are far less common than s. That is, rg tries harder than GNU grep to spend more time skipping bytes in a fast SIMD optimized loop. rg can get this wrong, but it seems strictly better to at least guess and probably get it right in the common case than to submit to an artifact of common Boyer-Moore implementations. Now that the secrets of literal search have been revealed, we can better analyze the Russian benchmark. The answer once again lies in which byte is used for quick scanning. Both sift and pt use the same AVX2 routine in Go’s runtime, so why did they get so much slower than every other tool in the Russian benchmark? The answer becomes more clear when we look at the actual UTF-8 bytes of the pattern Шерлок Холмс: \xd0\xa8\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xba \xd0\xa5\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbc\xd1\x81
 There are two key observations to take away from this: Every character in the pattern Шерлок Холмс is encoded with two UTF-8 code units, which corresponds to two bytes. Every character starts with either the byte \xD0 or \xD1. If we looked at the UTF-8 bytes of the Russian subtitles we’re searching, we’d end up seeing exactly the same pattern. This pattern occurs because the contents of the file are mostly Cyrllic, which are all mostly part of a couple small ranges in Unicode. This means that the \xD0 and \xD1 bytes occur a lot. If you recall from above, Go’s regex engine will scan for occurrences of the first byte. But if that first byte happens as frequently as it does here, the overall search will wind up going slower because there is overhead associated with doing that scan. This is precisely the trade off one is exposed to whenever memchr is used. As you might have guessed, rg works around this issue by trying to guess the rarest byte. rg specifically draws from a pre-computed frequency table of all 256 bytes. Bytes like \xD0 and \xD1 are considered to be among the most frequent while bytes like \xA8 and \x81 are considered more rare. Therefore, rg will prefer bytes other than \xD0 and \xD1 for use with memchr. GNU grep continues to do well on this benchmark mostly because of blind luck: Boyer-Moore uses the last byte, which will correspond to \x81, which is much rarer than \xD0 or \xD1. Switching gears, we should briefly discuss memory maps. In this benchmark, rg beats out rg (no mmap) by about 25%. The only difference between the two is that the former memory maps the file into memory while the latter incrementally reads bytes from the file into an intermediate buffer, and searches it. In this case, the overhead of the memory map is very small because we only need to create one of them. This is the opposite result from our Linux benchmark above, where memory maps proved to be worse than searching with an intermediate buffer since we needed to create a new memory map for every file we searched, which ends up incurring quite a bit of overhead. rg takes an empirical approach here and enables memory map searching when it knows it only needs to search a few files, and otherwise searches using an intermediate buffer. One last note: I’ve neglected to talk about (lines) because there’s really not much to say here: counting lines takes work, and if you don’t need to report line numbers, you can avoid doing that work. ucg has a rather cool SIMD algorithm to count lines and rg also has a packed counting algorithm that works similarly to the memchr implementations we talked about. If it were up to me, I’d probably remove benchmarks with line numbers altogether, since most tools tend to reliably pay just a little bit extra for them. However, neither ag nor ucg allow turning them off, so we need to turn them on in other tools in order to make a fair comparison. subtitles_literal_casei Description: This benchmark is just like subtitles_literal, except it does case insensitive search. Tools annotated with (lines) show line numbers in their output, and tools annotated with (ASCII) are doing an ASCII-only search. Correspondingly, tools not labeled with (ASCII) are doing a proper Unicode search. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes (with the -i flag set) rg                    0.366 +/- 0.001 (lines: 642)*+
grep                  4.084 +/- 0.005 (lines: 642)

rg (lines)            0.696 +/- 0.002 (lines: 642)
ag (lines) (ASCII)    2.775 +/- 0.004 (lines: 642)
ucg (lines) (ASCII)   0.841 +/- 0.002 (lines: 642)
 Russian pattern: Шерлок Холмс rg                    1.131 +/- 0.001 (lines: 604)
grep                  8.187 +/- 0.006 (lines: 604)

ucg (lines) (ASCII)   1.896 +/- 0.005 (lines: 583)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. There is no rg (ASCII) because rg can’t do ASCII-only case insensitive search. Analysis: This is a fun benchmark, because we start to see just how awesome rg’s support for Unicode is. Namely, that it not only gets it correct, but it’s also fast. It’s fast enough that it beats the competition even when the competition is using ASCII-only rules. Right off the bat, GNU grep pays dearly for doing a case insensitive search with Unicode support. The problem it faces is that it can no longer do a straight-forward Boyer-Moore search, so it either needs to fall back to some alternative literal search or its full regex engine. Even though GNU grep is much faster at ASCII-only case sensitive search than its Unicode aware variant, rg’s Unicode case insensitive search still handedly beats GNU grep’s ASCII-only case insensitive search. The reason why rg is so fast on this benchmark is the same reason why it’s fast in the linux_literal_casei benchmark: it turns the pattern Sherlock Holmes into an alternation of all possible literals according to Unicode’s simple case folding rules. It then takes a small prefix from each alternate so that our set of literals looks like this: SHER
SHEr
SHeR

 (Notice that we get Unicode right by including ſ as a case variant of S.) It then feeds these literals to the Teddy SIMD multiple pattern algorithm. The algorithm is unpublished, but was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of Intel’s Hyperscan regex library. The algorithm works roughly by using packed comparisons of 16 bytes at a time to find candidate locations where a literal might match. I adapted the algorithm from the Hyperscan project to Rust, and included an extensive write up in the comments if you’re interested. While essentially the same analysis applies to the Russian benchmark, there are a few interesting things to note. Namely, while the results show grep (ASCII) as being very fast, it seems clear that it’s completely ignoring the -i flag in this case since the pattern is not an ASCII string. Notably, its timing is essentially identical to its timing on the previous subtitles_literal benchmark. The other interesting thing to note is that ag reports 0 matches. This isn’t entirely unreasonable, if it somehow knows that it can’t satisfy the request (case insensitive search of a non-ASCII string when Unicode support isn’t enabled). If I had to guess, I’d say PCRE is returning an error (possibly from pcre_exec) and it isn’t being forwarded to the end user, but that’s just a shot in the dark. subtitles_alternate Description: This benchmarks an alternation of literals, where there are several distinct leading bytes from each literal. We control for line counting. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes|John Watson|Irene Adler|Inspector Lestrade|Professor Moriarty rg             0.294 +/- 0.001 (lines: 848)*+

 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: rg does really well here, on both the English and Russian patterns, primarily thanks to Teddy as described in the analysis for subtitles_literal_casei. On the English pattern, rg is around an order of magnitude faster than GNU grep. The performance cost of counting lines is on full display here. For rg at least, it makes returning search results take twice as long. Note that the benchmark description mentions picking literals with distinct leading bytes. This is to avoid measuring an optimization where the regex engine detects the leading byte and runs memchr on it. Of course, this optimization is important (and rg will of course do it), but it’s far more interesting to benchmark what happens in a slightly trickier case. subtitles_alternate_casei Description: This benchmark is just like subtitles_alternate, except it searches case insensitively. In this benchmark, instead of controlling for line counting (all commands count lines), we control for Unicode support. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes|John Watson|Irene Adler|Inspector Lestrade|Professor Moriarty (with the -i flag set) rg             2.724 +/- 0.002 (lines: 862)*+

grep (ASCII)   8.572 +/- 0.009 (lines: 691)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: While rg gets an order of magnitude slower on this benchmark compared to subtitles_alternate, it still comfortably beats out the rest of the search tools, even when other tools don’t support Unicode. A key thing this benchmark demonstrates are the limits of the Teddy algorithm. In fact, rg opts to not use Teddy in this benchmark because it predicts it won’t perform well. Why doesn’t Teddy perform well here? Well, the answer is in how we generate literals for this pattern. Namely, rg will try to generate all possible literals that satisfy Unicode simple case folding rules, and then will take a short prefix of that set to cut the number of literals down to reasonable size. In this particular case, we wind up with 48 literals: INS

 If we passed all of those to Teddy, it would become overwhelmed. In particular, Teddy works by finding candidates for matches very quickly. When there are roughly the same number of candidates as there are matches, Teddy performs exceedingly well. But, if we give it more literals, then it’s more likely to find candidates that don’t match, and will therefore have to spend a lot more time verifying the match, which can be costly. (A more subtle aspect of the Teddy implementation is that a larger number of literals increases the cost of every verification, even if the number of candidates produced doesn’t increase. As I’ve mentioned before, if you want the full scoop on Teddy, see its well commented implementation. Going into more detail on Teddy would require a whole blog post on its own!) When rg sees that there are a large number of literals, it could do one of two things: Try to cut down the set even more. For example, in this case, we could strip the last character from each prefix off and end up with a much smaller set. Unfortunately, even though we have fewer literals, we wind up with a still not-so-small set of two-character literals, which will also tend to produce a lot more false positive candidates just because of their length. Move to a different multiple pattern algorithm, such as Aho-Corasick. I have tried to implement (1) in the past, but I’ve always wound up in a game of whack-a-mole. I might make one common case faster, but another common case a lot slower. In those types of cases, it’s usually better to try and achieve good average case performance. Luckily for us, Aho-Corasick does exactly that. We do still have a few tricks up our sleeve though. For example, many Aho-Corasick implementations are built as-if they were tries with back-pointers for their failure transitions. We can actually do better than that. We can compile all of its failure transitions into a DFA with a transition table contiguous in memory. This means that every byte of input corresponds to a single lookup in the transition table to find the next state. We never have to waste time chasing pointers or walking more than one failure transition for any byte in the search text. Of course, this transition table based approach is memory intensive, since you need space for number_of_literals * number_of_states, where number_of_states is roughly capped at the total number of bytes in all of the literals. While 48 literals of length 3 is too much for Teddy to handle, it’s barely a blip when it comes to Aho-Corasick, even with its memory expensive transition table based approach. (N.B. In the literature, this particular implementation of Aho-Corasick is often called “Advanced” Aho-Corasick.) subtitles_surrounding_words Description: This benchmarks a pattern that searches for words surrounding the literal string Holmes. This pattern was specifically constructed to defeat both prefix and suffix literal optimizations. English pattern: \w+\s+Holmes\s+\w+ rg             0.605 +/- 0.000 (lines: 317)
grep           1.286 +/- 0.002 (lines: 317)
rg (ASCII)     0.602 +/- 0.000 (lines: 317)*+
ag (ASCII)     11.663 +/- 0.008 (lines: 323)
ucg (ASCII)    4.690 +/- 0.002 (lines: 317)
grep (ASCII)   1.276 +/- 0.002 (lines: 317)
 Russian pattern: \w+\s+Холмс\s+\w+ rg             0.957 +/- 0.001 (lines: 278)*+
grep           1.660 +/- 0.002 (lines: 278)
ag (ASCII)     2.411 +/- 0.001 (lines: 0)
ucg (ASCII)    2.980 +/- 0.002 (lines: 0)
grep (ASCII)   1.596 +/- 0.003 (lines: 0)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: In order to compete on this benchmark, a search tool will need to implement a so-called “inner literal” optimization. You can probably guess what that means: it is an optimization that looks for literal strings that appear anywhere in the pattern, and if a literal is found that must appear in every match, then a search tool can quickly scan for that literal instead of applying the full regex to the search text. The key thing that permits this optimization to work is the fact that most search tools report results per line. For example, in this case, if a line contains the literal Holmes, then the search tool can find the beginning and ending of that line and run the full pattern on just that line. If the literal is relatively rare, this keeps us out of the regex engine for most of the search. And of course, if the literal doesn’t appear at all in the corpus, then we will have never touched the regex engine at all. To achieve the full optimization, you probably need to parse your pattern into its abstract syntax (abbreviated “AST” for abstract syntax tree) to extract the literal. It is worth pointing out however that one can probably get a lot of mileage with simpler heuristics, but a real pattern parser is the only way to do this optimization robustly. The problem here is that for most regex engines, parsing the pattern is an unexposed implementation detail, so it can be hard for search tools to extract literals in a robust way without writing their own parser, and a modern regex parser is no easy task! Thankfully, Rust’s regex library exposes an additional library, regex-syntax, which provides a full parser. rg implements this optimization relatively easily with the help of regex-syntax, while GNU grep implements this optimization because the search tool and the underlying regex engine are coupled together. Why does the search tool need to perform this optimization? Why can’t the underlying regex engine do it? I personally have thought long and hard about this particular problem and haven’t been able to come up with an elegant solution. The core problem is that once you find an occurrence of the literal, you don’t know where to start searching the full regex. In a general purpose regex engine, a pattern could match an arbitrarily long string. For example, \w+\s+Holmes\s+\w+ mightly only match at the very end of a gigabyte sized document. There are ways to work around this. For example, you could split the regex into three pieces: \w+\s+, Holmes and \s+\w+. On every occurrence of the Holmes literal, you could search for the beginning of the match by executing \w+\s+ in reverse starting just before the literal, and executing \s+\w+ forwards starting just after the literal. The key problem with this approach is that it exposes you to quadratic behavior in the worst case (since \w+\s+ or \s+\w+ could cause you to re-scan text you’ve already seen). While I believe there is a general purpose way to solve this and still guarantee linear time searching, a good solution hasn’t revealed itself yet. Based on the data in this benchmark, only rg and GNU grep perform this optimization. Neither ag nor ucg attempt to extract any inner literals from the pattern, and it looks like PCRE doesn’t try to do anything too clever. (Of course, Rust’s regex library doesn’t either, this optimization is done in rg proper.) As for the Russian pattern, we see that only tools with proper Unicode support can execute the query successfully. The reason is because \w is ASCII only in ucg and ag, so it can’t match the vast majority of word characters (which are Cyrllic) in our sample. Otherwise, both rg and GNU grep remain fast, primarily because of the inner literal optimization. subtitles_no_literal Description: This benchmark purposefully has no literals in it, which makes it a bit idiosyncratic, since most searches done by end users probably have at least some literal in them. However, it is a useful benchmark to gauge the general performance of the underlying regex engine. English pattern: \w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5} rg             2.777 +/- 0.003 (lines: 13)
rg (ASCII)     2.541 +/- 0.005 (lines: 13)*+
ag (ASCII)     10.076 +/- 0.005 (lines: 48)
ucg (ASCII)    7.771 +/- 0.004 (lines: 13)
grep (ASCII)   4.411 +/- 0.004 (lines: 13)
 Russian pattern: \w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5}\s+\w{5} rg             4.905 +/- 0.003 (lines: 41)
rg (ASCII)     3.973 +/- 0.002 (lines: 0)
ag (ASCII)     2.395 +/- 0.004 (lines: 0)*+
ucg (ASCII)    3.006 +/- 0.005 (lines: 0)
grep (ASCII)   2.483 +/- 0.005 (lines: 0)
 * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. ag gets more matches on the English pattern since it does multiline search. Namely, the \s can match a \n. grep with Unicode support was dropped from this benchmark because it takes over 90 seconds on the English pattern and over 4 minutes on the Russian pattern. In both cases, GNU grep and rg report the same results. Analysis: Once again, no other search tool performs as well as rg. For the English pattern, both rg and rg (ASCII) have very similar performance, despite rg supporting Unicode. What specifically makes rg faster than GNU grep in this case? Both search tools ultimately use a DFA to execute this pattern, so their performance should be roughly the same. I don’t actually have a particularly good answer for this. Both GNU grep and Rust’s regex library unroll the DFA’s inner loop, and both implementations compute states on the fly. I can make a guess though. Rust’s regex library avoids a single pointer dereference when following a transition. How it achieves this is complicated, but it’s done by representing states as indices into the transition table rather than simple incremental ids. This permits the generated code to use simple addition to address the location of the next transition, which can be done with addressing modes in a single instruction. (Specifically, this optimization means we don’t need to do any multiplication to find the state transition.) A single pointer dereference might not seem like much, but when it’s done for every state transition over a large corpus such as this, it can have an impact. When it comes to the Russian pattern, such details are far less important because GNU grep takes minutes to run. This suggests that it isn’t building UTF-8 decoding into its DFA, and is instead doing something like decoding a character at a time, which can have a lot of overhead associated with it. I admit that I don’t quite grok this aspect of GNU grep though, so I could have its cost model wrong. Now, in all fairness, GNU grep’s locale and encoding support far exceeds what rg supports. However, in today’s world, UTF-8 is quite prevalent, so supporting that alone is often enough. More to the point, given how common UTF-8 is, it’s important to remain fast while supporting Unicode, which GNU grep isn’t able to do. Unfortunately, the other tools don’t support Unicode, so they can’t be meaningfully benchmarked on the Russian pattern. Bonus benchmarks In this section, we’ll take a look at a few crazier benchmarks that aren’t actually part of the suite I’ve published. Indeed, the performance differences between tools are often so large that a fastidious analysis isn’t really necessary. More to the point, these usage patterns aren’t necessarily representative of common usage (not that these usages aren’t important, they’re just niche), so the performance differences are less important. Nevertheless, it is fun to see how well rg and the other tools hold up under these requests. everything Description: In this benchmark, we compare how long it takes for each tool to report every line as a match. This benchmark was run in the root of the Linux repository. Pattern: .* rg                 1.081 (lines: 22065361)
ag                 1.660 (lines: 55939)
git grep           3.448 (lines: 22066395)
sift             110.018 (lines: 22190112)
pt                 0.245 (lines: 3027)
rg (whitelist)     0.987 (lines: 20936584)
ucg (whitelist)    5.558 (lines: 23163359)
 Analysis: This benchmark is somewhat silly since it’s something you probably never want a search tool to do. Nevertheless, it is useful to know that rg scales quite well to a huge number of matches. One of the key tricks that a good regex engine will do in this case is stop searching text as soon as it knows it has a match if all the caller cares about is “is there a match or not?” In this case, we will find a match at the beginning of every line, immediately quit, find the line boundaries and then repeat the process. There is no particular special cased optimization for .* in either rg or Rust’s regex library (although there could be). Interestingly, neither ag nor pt actually report every line. They appear to have some kind of match limit. Which isn’t altogether unreasonable. This is a search tool after all, and some might consider that returning every result isn’t useful. nothing Description: This is just like the everything benchmark, except it inverts the results. The correct result is for a search tool to report no lines as matching. This benchmark also searches the Linux kernel source code, from the root of repository. Pattern: .* (with the -v or --invert-match flag set) rg                0.302 (lines: 0)
ag                takes minutes
git grep          0.905 (lines: 0)
sift             12.804 (lines: 0)
pt                -----
rg (whitelist)    0.251 (lines: 0)
ucg (whitelist)   -----
 Analysis: While this benchmark is even more ridiculous than the previous one (“give me nothing of everything”), it does expose a few warts and omissions in other tools. Namely, ag seems to slow way down when reporting inverted matches. Neither pt nor ucg support inverted searching at all. sift redeems itself from the previous benchmark (perhaps it has a lot of overhead associated with printing matches that it doesn’t hit here). Neither rg nor git grep have any problems satisfying the request. context Description: This benchmarks how well a search tool can show the context around each match. Specifically, in this case, we ask for the two lines preceding and proceding every match. We run this benchmark on the English subtitle corpus. Note that all tools are asked to count lines. Pattern: Sherlock Holmes (with --context 2) rg        0.612 (lines: 3533)
ag        3.530 (lines: 3533)
grep      1.075 (lines: 3533)
sift      0.717 (lines: 3533)
pt       17.331 (lines: 2981)
ucg       -----
 Analysis: rg continues to do well here, but beats sift by only a hair. In general, computing the context shouldn’t be that expensive since it is done rarely (only for each match). Nevertheless, both ag and pt seem to take a pretty big hit for it. pt also seems to have a bug. (Which is understandable, getting contexts right is tricky.) Finally, ucg doesn’t support this feature, so we can’t benchmark it. huge Description: This benchmark runs a simple literal search on a file that is 9.3GB. In fact, this is the original English subtitle corpus in its entirety. (In the benchmark suite, we take a 1GB sample.) Pattern: Sherlock Holmes rg                1.786 (lines: 5107)
grep              5.119 (lines: 5107)
sift              3.047 (lines: 5107)
pt               14.966 (lines: 5107)
rg (lines)        4.467 (lines: 5107)
ag (lines)       19.132 (lines: 5107)
grep (lines)      9.213 (lines: 5107)
sift (lines)      6.303 (lines: 5107)
pt (lines)       15.485 (lines: 5107)
ucg (lines)       4.843 (lines: 1543)
 Analysis: At first glance, it appears ucg competes with rg when counting lines (being only slightly slower), but in fact, ucg reports the wrong number of results! My suspicion is that ucg gets into trouble when trying to search files over 2GB. The other intesting bit here is how slow pt is, even when not counting lines, despite the fact that sift is fast. They both use Go’s regexp engine and should be able to be fast in the case of a simple literal. It’s not clear what pt’s slow down here is. One hypothesis is that even though I’m asking it to not count lines, it’s still counting them but simply not showing them. Conclusions I started this blog post by claiming that I could support the following claims with evidence: For both searching single files and huge directories of files, no other tool obviously stands above ripgrep in either performance or correctness. ripgrep is the only tool with proper Unicode support that doesn’t make you pay dearly for it. Tools that search many files at once are generally slower if they use memory maps, not faster. I attempted to substantiate the first claim by picking a popular repository (Linux kernel) and a variety of patterns that an end user might search for. While rg doesn’t quite come out on top on every benchmark, no other tool can claim superiority. In particular, git grep edges out rg on occasion by a few milliseconds, but rg in turn will beat git grep handedly (sometimes by an order of magnitude, as in the case of linux_unicode_word) as the patterns grow more complex, especially when the search tool is asked to support Unicode. rg manages to compete with git grep and beat other tools like The Silver Searcher by: Implementing fast directory traversal with a minimal number of stat calls. Applying .gitignore filters with a RegexSet, which enables matching multiple globs against a single path all at once. Distributing work quickly to multiple threads with a Chase-Lev work stealing queue. Explicitly not using memory maps. Using an overall very fast regex engine. I also attempted to substantiate the first claim by showing benchmarks of rg against other tools on a single file. In this benchmark, rg comes out on top in every single one, often by a large margin. Some of those results are a result of the following optimizations: Attempting to pick a “rare” byte to use memchr with for fast skipping. Using a special SIMD algorithm called Teddy for fast multiple pattern search. When Teddy isn’t usable, fallback to an “advanced” form of Aho-Corasick that never moves through more than one transition on each byte of input. Building UTF-8 decoding into a finite state machine. For the second claim, I provided benchmarks that attempt to use Unicode features such as conforming to Unicode’s simple case folding rules and Unicode aware character classes such as \w. The only tools capable of handling Unicode are rg, GNU grep and git grep. The latter two tend to get much slower when supporting the full gamut of Unicode while rg mostly maintains its performance. For the third claim, I showed multiple benchmarks of rg controlling for memory maps. Namely, we measured how fast rg was both with and without memory maps, and showed that memory maps perform worse when searching many small files in parallel, but perform better on searching single large files. (At least, on Linux x86_64.) We also learned that memory maps probably pay an additional penalty inside a VM. My hope is that this article not only convinced you that rg is quite fast, but more importantly, that you found my analysis of each benchmark educational. String searching is an old problem in computer science, but there is still plenty of work left to do to advance the state of the art.

PayPal leverages its unique authentication ecosystem to continue making payments more secure and convenient. The goal? Reduce fraud and increase security, while making online authentication nearly frictionless with biometrics secured by built-in, hardware-level protection. As the use cases for Internet-connected devices grows at the enterprise and consumer level, there is a critical need for highly secure, but unobtrusive methods for protecting identities, data and machines. Lenovo and Intels shared hardware expertise allows for a unified, built-in security architecture thats more secure, private and hassle free. Likewise PayPal brings its authentication expertise and Synaptics their biometrics knowledge to deliver a much needed alternative solution to the password problem. Lenovo Quote The average user has to remember passwords for many different accounts, from PC log-in, email to online shopping. We wanted to help change that by freeing users from the burden of remembering complex passwords by providing a simple authentication solution, said Johnson Jia, senior vice president, PC & Smart Device Business Group, Lenovo.  Were excited to be the first PC company to partner with Intel, PayPal and Synaptics to bring users simpler and safer online authentication based on the released FIDO standards, through fingerprint readers designed for improved security on our laptops starting with the Yoga 910 convertible. Synaptics Natural ID Fingerprint Solution and Quote The Synaptics Natural ID fingerprint sensor solution combines enterprise-level security with design flexibility. OEMs can select from a wide range of Synaptics SentryPoint features, such as match-in-sensor, TLS 1.2 encryption and anti-spoofing algorithms, to enable robust, biometric authentication for device unlock and online transactions.   Todays notebook and PC users want solutions that are safer and more convenient for online transactions, said Godfrey Cheng, vice president of marketing, Human Interface Systems Division, Synaptics. Together with our ecosystem partners, were deploying strong security architectures to protect user identity and accelerating the adoption of biometric authentication solutions worldwide. PayPal Quote In an ongoing effort to enhance security in the financial services industry, we are working with Intel and Lenovo on a FIDO authentication solution which enables biometric authentication for Personal Computers, said Bill Scott, vice president, Identity Product and Engineering at PayPal. Security has always been a priority for PayPal, and we are committed to offering our customers secure, password-less authentication options leveraging FIDO standards. Intel Quote Intel continues to drive innovation to simplify and secure the computing experience, said Navin Shenoy, general manager of the Client Computing Group, Intel. We are excited about the close collaboration between Intel, Lenovo, PayPal and Synaptics using the new 7th Gen Intel Core processors to bring secure payments via biometric authentication to the PC. FIDO Alliance Quote I commend Intel, Lenovo, Synaptics and PayPal, all FIDO Alliance board members, for partnering to FIDO-enable biometric authentication on the desktop, said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. Passwords are a universal problem that is not limited to mobile devices.  Every internet connected device needs the ability to upgrade to simpler, stronger FIDO authentication and thanks to this partnership, the desktop ecosystem is on an accelerated path to get the same FIDO capabilities already well established across the mobile ecosystem. Hardware-based Protection Secure password-less sign on requires strong authentication that is ideally rooted in the hardware. Lenovo PCs using Natural ID and Intel Core processors achieve this by quickly and securely capturing user credentials, which are encrypted and stored in the hardware, making them less susceptible to malware attacks. Sign In With Your Fingertip Were making signing in simpler and safer on a PC. Though all the user has to do is touch the fingerprint reader, sophisticated technology is at work protecting the sensitive credentials. Each login is wrapped in three layers of protection designed so that neither the users fingerprint information nor their FIDO credentials, ever leave their device: built-in hardware security, a secure device ID, and FIDO-compliant biometric authentication.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Way back in January at CES, Oakley teamed up with Intel to unveil Radar Pace, a set of smart sunglasses designed to help improve your workouts. Now the company is finally set to release the gadget, which launches on October 1 for $499. The Pace Radar looks like a pretty standard pair of high-end sporty sunglasses with one key difference. Oakley includes a detachable earbud, which grips onto to the sunglasses using a bendable arm. It also features three built-in microphones so you can ask for feedback throughout your workout and respond to questions. The design is sweat-resistant and packs a battery that lasts 4 hours if you listen to music (6 hours without music). There’s also a built-in touchpad for quickly skipping between tracks. Pace Radar can also track your distance and even incorporate your heart rate into its analysis, but it doesn’t pack any of the sensors to actually take those measurements. Instead, it connects to your smartphone for GPS data. It can also sync with an attached smartwatch or fitness tracker. Once you’re ready to run (or jog or bike) Oakley’s sunglasses will act as a virtual workout coach. The Pace system will offer updates on your speed and stride, along with ways to improve. You can also ask for information directly. When you’re ready to stop just say that you’re finished, and if you haven’t completed the planned workout the sunglasses will urge you to keep going. If you’re a die-hard runner or biker looking for some extra encouragement this could be a fun option. The price seems a little high considering that it still relies on other connected gadgets to actually gather your data, but it’s possible that future versions of Pace Radar could bring costs down, add extra sensors or both.

XDC2016 Wraps Up After Many Wayland, X.Org & Mesa Discussions Written by Michael Larabel in Events on 24 September 2016. Page 1 of 1. 2 Comments The 2016 X.Org Developers' Conference (XDC2016) wrapped up Friday in Helsinki, Finland. Here is a summary of the major happenings for those that may have missed it or didn't yet watch the video streams. NVIDIA - NVIDIA is working towards HDR display support on Linux. NVIDIA already supports HDR displays on Windows and Android but for Linux support they and other stakeholders must agree to some common relevant APIs and design decisions about supporting this next generation of displays. - NVIDIA presented over their device memory/surface allocation API thoughts and with the GBM vs. EGLStreams debate panning out for what API(s) would be used by Wayland compositors, ultimately there is some agreement that there is room for a new API to build upon the best of GBM, EGL, Gralloc, Vulkan, etc. This could take some time but they've already made some progress in the new API's design. Nouveau - Aside from official NVIDIA talks, Nouveau developers were they and shared their frustrations over NVIDIA's firmware practices since Maxwell. It's a mess but there will hopefully be some change in the future. - There was also the Nouveau status update that aside from talking about NVIDIA's firmware blobs covered some work being done on SPIR-V, their goal to have OpenGL 4.5 support, their overall focus on GL and performance, and how there probably won't be a Nouveau Vulkan driver soon. - There was also a talk dedicated to Nouveau power management and how Linux 4.9 will be a bit more exciting for Nouveau users thanks to some of the boost patches finally landing. Wayland - There was the interesting talk about Google's use of the Wayland protocol within the Android Runtime for Chrome (ARC++). It will be interesting to see what else Google does with Wayland in the months ahead, especially considering they are now employing the Wayland founder and some other past contributors from Intel, etc. Intel - Intel's FastUIDraw is very promising for GPU-accelerated 2D drawing with a focus on web content. Early tests show FastUIDraw being much faster than Cairo, Qt, and other common drawing interfaces. - Another 2D-related talk and by an Intel developer, Martin Peres, was about the current state of the X11 2D acceleration. - Meanwhile, another Intel presentation was talking about their Vulkan driver anatomy. The early part of the presentation does cover a lot of the basics that frequent Phoronix readers are already familiar with, but the back half is more interesting with talking about more low-level design decisions, etc. AMD DAL - The only AMD presentation at XDC2016 was about the DAL display abstraction layer. Unfortunately, it's still not ready for the mainline Linux kernel yet it's needed for delivering a lot of modern display features to the AMD Linux stack. Other - A former GSoC developer talked about his work on a "soft" FP64 library for Mesa that will hopefully soon be able to emulate ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 support. - A variety of other interesting talks including about Wayland and Vulkan on Tizen, PRIME sync, and the GLVND vendor neutral dispatch library, among others. Aside from my numerous articles covering XDC2016 topics, there is also the XDC2016 video streams on YouTube for those interested. With XDC2016 a wrap, XDC2017 is to be hosted in Mountain View by Google. Enjoyed all my posts this week about XDC2016 from monitoring the livestream?

Encrypted iTunes backups created on a Mac or PC are protected by a password that can potentially be brute forced by password cracking software. The backup method in iOS 10 "skips certain security checks," allowing Elcomsoft to try backup passwords "approximately 2500 times faster" compared to iOS 9 and earlier operating systems. Obtaining the password for an iTunes backup provides access to all data on the phone, including that stored in Keychain, which holds all of a user's passwords and other sensitive information. At this time, we have an early implementation featuring CPU-only recovery. The new security check is approximately 2,500 times weaker compared to the old one that was used in iOS 9 backups. At this time, we are getting these speeds: iOS 9 (CPU): 2,400 passwords per second (Intel i5) iOS 9 (GPU): 150,000 passwords per second (NVIDIA GTX 1080) iOS 10 (CPU): 6,000,000 passwords per second (Intel i5)In specific terms, security analyst Per Thorsheim of Peerlyst says Apple has switched from using a PBKDF2 hashing algorithm with 10,000 iterations to using a SHA256 algorithm with a single iteration, allowing for a significant speed increase when brute forcing a password. Image via Peerlyst In a statement given to Forbes, Apple confirmed it is aware of the issue and is working on a fix. "We're aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups," a spokesperson said. "We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption."As Apple points out, this security oversight is limited to backups created on a Mac or PC and does not affect the security of iCloud backups. Most users likely do not need to worry about this issue as it requires access to the Mac or PC that was used to make the backup. Apple has updates for iOS 10 and macOS Sierra in the works, and it's possible a fix will be included in the new versions of the software. iOS 10.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 were seeded to developers and public beta testers earlier this week. Related Roundup: iOS 10 [ 218 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) joshwenke 8 weeks ago Physical access to ANY machine is a security risk, no matter how strong password encryption is. Rating: 20 Votes dwsolberg 8 weeks ago I love Apple, but this sort of thing is so frustrating from a company that is trying to make privacy be such a huge part of its brand. Without security, privacy cannot exist. It doesn't have a huge effect on me, but it lowers my level of trust that Apple knows what it's doing. As a developer, this is a pretty glaring flaw, so I can only assume (or hope, rather) it was a temporary implementation that accidentally got through to a release version. Whatever happened, it's bizarre. Rating: 16 Votes cicalinarrot 8 weeks ago They must hurry up. Yahoo was lucky enough their stocks were already worth nothing before the hacking. Rating: 16 Votes Hanzu Lao 8 weeks ago Pretty lazy on their part. Rating: 13 Votes Northgrove 8 weeks ago But this is NOT physical access to the iPhone. They are talking about decrypting the BACKUP data. This data is typically on e hard drive on a PC or Mac or maybe in Apple's iCloud This is iTunes backups. Most don't use iTunes backups these days, even fewer would have had time to make one for iOS 10. While this doesn't demand physical access to an iPhone, it seems to me like it would demand physical access to a PC or Mac (and only a PC or Mac, not an iPhone or iPad). Rating: 12 Votes asleep 8 weeks ago Lowered security threshold because hacking is becoming less of an issue in 2016...? Rating: 12 Votes solipsism 8 weeks ago Doesn't matter... https://www.elcomsoft.com/products.html Did you not read the description of what is required? Decrypt FileVault 2 Volumes FileVault 2 is a whole-disk encryption scheme used in Apple’s Mac OS X. FileVault 2 protects the entire startup partition with secure 256-bit XTS-AES encryption. If the user forgets their account password, or if the encrypted volume is moved to a different computer, a FileVault 2 can be unlocked with a special Recovery Key. If the user logs in with their Apple ID credentials, the Recovery Key can be saved into the user’s iCloud account. Should the user forget their password, the system can automatically use the Recovery Key to unlock the encrypted volume. It is important to note that Apple does not allow the end user to view or extract FileVault 2 recovery keys from iCloud. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can extract FileVault 2 recovery keys from the user’s iCloud account, and use these keys to decrypt encrypted disk images. Valid authentication credentials (Apple ID/password or iCloud authentication token) as well as volume identification information extracted from the FileVault-encrypted disk image are required. Rating: 11 Votes X--X 8 weeks ago I'd imagine this was a big mistake by one of their developers. They should have more code reviews. There was no reason to suddenly change the encryption mechanism, except to make it easer to crack.

SHA256 is a very fast algorithm, meant to produce hashes for dictionaries and sets and whatnot - basically, it helps make all your programs run quickly. Normally quicker is better, so SHA256 is preferable in almost all situations, except when it comes to storing your password. Either someone made an honest mistake and thought, hey, lets make this run faster because faster is better and they didn't consider the implications of hacking being faster, or they intentionally wanted to cripple security.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums SolidRun MicroSoM offers Braswell CPUs on a tiny package by Wayne Manion  3:23 PM on September 23, 2016 Technology enthusiasts looking to shoehorn computers into unusual places often turn to the Raspberry Pi. The Pi is inexpensive, with prices of $5 for the Pi Zero and around $35 for the more powerful Pi 3. It also consumes little electricity, has its own Linux distribution, and is backed by an active community. Some tasks are simply too much for even the ARMv8 1.2GHz quad-core atop the Pi 3, though. Israeli PC vendor SolidRun thinks it has the solution for that and announced the MicroSoM, a lineup of Intel Braswell-based system-on-a-module boards (SoM) for use in more demanding applications including medical equipment, drones, and industrial and point-of-sale systems. The SoM includes a choice of Intel Atom x5-8000 or Pentium N3710 CPUs from the 14-nm Braswell family, some memory, and 4GB eMMC storage on a 40mm x 53mm PCB. The basic option includes an Atom CPU and 2GB RAM, while the higher-end model packs a Pentium CPU and 8GB RAM. As optional accessories, SolidRun offers an aluminum enclosure, a CPU heatsink, and a Micro-USB power supply. The SoM requires additional hardware in order to be used in the same fashion as the Raspberry Pi, as the base module does not include any of the standard ports PC enthusiasts are familiar with. SolidRun's SolidPC Q4 carrier board adds HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, three USB 3.0 ports, a pair of Ethernet ports, and both analog and digital audio outputs. The Q4 carrier board measures 100mm x 80 mm. For comparison's sake, the Raspberry Pi 3 measures 85mm x 56mm. Alternative x86-based single board computers from vendors including UDOO, MinnowBoard, Up Board, Gizmosphere, and PC Engines (among others) are in varying stages of development and availability. SolidRun expects the MicroSoM to begin shipping in 4-6 weeks, and is asking $117 for the Atom version and $225 for the Pentium model. The Q4 carrier board goes for $40 when purchased with a MicroSoM module. Finally, the optional aluminum enclosure costs $25, while both the CPU heatsink and Micro-USB charger go for $10.

So it’s fitting that Lenovo announced a partnership to bring FIDO fingerprint authentication to its laptops. log into FIDO-compliant services without needing to enter a password The newly announced Lenovo / Intel / Synaptics / PayPal partnership will combine Lenovo’s laptops with Intel’s on-chip hardware security, allowing you to use Synaptic's biometric fingerprint sensors to replace passwords for logging into FIDO-compliant services (like PayPal). All of this is secured by FIDO's security spec, which already has widespread support across the industry. The FIDO Alliance is a consortium founded several years ago in part by Lenovo and PayPal — backed by tons of major companies like, Google, Bank of America, and Microsoft — with a goal to develop new methods of authentication that are simpler and more secure than passwords. The group has considered multiple approaches to replacing the password, with biometrics, USB keys, and voice and face recognition all being considered as new security standards. It's worth noting that Microsoft announced that it would be integrating FIDO support into Windows 10 back in 2015. The current president of The FIDO Alliance, Dustin Ingalls, is also Microsoft's general manager of the Identity & Security Operations, so it's clear that this kind of integration has been in the works for a while. No timeline was given as to when the first wave of FIDO-enabled laptops would be released, but with CES 2017 just around the corner, it’s possible we could see an announcement then.

(AAPL), General Electric Company (GE) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Options activity provides a bit of insight on AAPL, GE and BABA By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 23, 2016, 8:56 am EST     Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Facebook Inc (FB) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) 2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Earnings Recent Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Can’t Count on a Save From Santa Claus Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and United States Steel Corporation (X) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are dipping in premarket trading, as Wall Street looks to take a bit of a breather after rallying for three straight sessions. The Federal Reserve’s inaction on interest rates is largely responsible for the rally — because who doesn’t like easy money? — though key reports on August manufacturing and North American oil-rig counts as well as speeches from several Federal Reserve speakers have added a layer of pressure in the early going. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have tripped 0.07% lower, while S&P 500 dropped 0.14% and Nasdaq-100 futures have slipped 0.15%. Thursday’s options activity remained well above average heading into the expiration of weekly September 23 series contracts. Overall, an above-average 17.6 million calls and 14.5 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio retreated to 0.57, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.65. Underpinning Thursday’s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was upgraded again — not just once, but twice — on Thursday due to iPhone 7 preorder strength. Elsewhere, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) saw unusual options activity in the October and January 2017 series that appeared to be a diagonal calendar spread. Finally, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) drummed up chatter this week after it overtook Chinese rival Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) on ad revenue. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple bulls had more to cheer about yesterday after not one, but two brokerage firms lifted their price targets on the shares. RBC Capital boosted AAPL stock from $120 to $125 and reiterated its “outperform” rating on the shares, while Nomura lifted AAPL to $135 from $120 while restating its “buy” rating. Both brokerage firms cited strong preorders for the iPhone 7, with Nomura citing healthy data points from the U.S., U.K. and Japan, while RBC highlighted significant upside to the iPhone 7’s selling price due to a shift toward the larger model. Judging by options activity on AAPL this week, traders’ enthusiasm may finally be dying down a bit. Specifically, calls have accounted for increasingly less of AAPL’s total daily volume as the weeks have worn on. On Thursday, total volume came in at 983,000 contracts, with calls only accounting for about 61% of the day’s take — down from 63% yesterday and 71% shortly after last week’s iPhone 7 preorder data hit the Street. While declining daily call volume by itself isn’t a major concern for AAPL bulls, rising put open interest could be a warning sign. As I noted yesterday, AAPL’s near-term put/call open interest ratio has been on the rise, and currently rests at 0.90 — which is somewhat high, historically, for AAPL. General Electric Company (GE) Despite a lack of headline news to drive activity, General Electric stock still cracked the top ten most active options list on Thursday. Total volume jumped to more than 203,000 contracts, with a surge in put volume to 80% of the day’s take underscoring the session’s activity. A closer look GE’s put activity yesterday, via Trade-Alert.com, reveals what appears to be a diagonal calendar spread. Specifically, a block of 15,000 GE January 2017 $28 strike puts traded for the ask price of 54 cents, while another block of 15,000 October $30 strike puts crossed at the bid price of 49 cents. Assuming the trades are related, the total outlay for this neutral short-term/bearish long-term spread comes in at 5 cents, or $5 per pair of contracts. In short, the trader is looking for GE to hold steady until the end of the year before dropping, or a sharp rise in implied volatility for GE options. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Alibaba options traders had something else to crow about yesterday after reports broke that the Chinese e-commerce giant had overtaken rival Baidu in ad revenue. The feat is none-too-small either, considering that Baidu is widely regarded as the Chinese Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Explosive growth in mobile advertising was the catalyst for Alibaba’s rise to prominence, marking a major shift in the Chinese internet market. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (GLD) Is a Better Buy Than Stocks Options volume was unusually strong for BABA on Thursday. Total volume came in at 576,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 77% of the day’s take. If this trend takes hold on BABA, it could also mark a shift in sentiment for the stock. Currently, the September/October put/call open interest ratio for BABA rests at 0.93, with calls and puts nearing parity. However, a turn toward calls could push this ratio lower, indicating bullish expectations for the speculative options crowd. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Three high-quality copper heatpipes with 6 millimeter diameter are connecting the solid copper base-plate and the aluminum fins-stack heatsink. Both the copper-heatpipes and the copper-baseplate are nickel-plated in the final process, in order to avoid corrosion and to improve the quality. The new heatsink comes with a pre-installed Slip Stream 92 PWM (SY9225SL12M-P) axial-fan, which offers flexible speed range, starting at ultra-silent 300 RPM and going up to 2.300 RPM for best performance. This speed range allows steady airflow from 11,38 to 79,09 m³/h, respectively 6,70 to 46,55 CFM. Byakko is equipped with a simple yet versatile mounting system, allowing secure and fast mounting process on various CPU sockets. The list of compatible CPU Sockets is long and covers all major sockets, such as the Intel Sockets LGA775, LGA1150, LGA1151, LGA1155, LGA1156, LGA1366 as well as the AMD Sockets AM2, AM2+, AM3, AM3+, FM1, FM2 and FM2+. The package includes all required clips for mounting, a user-manual as well as a package of thermal grease.

Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff The “Cascadia” brand has been applied to various corners of the Pacific Northwest, for everything from an environmentalist call to action to a soccer championship. Variations of the term, in circulation since the 1970s, have had the region spanning Northern California to Alaska, the narrow stretch around Interstate 5, or the land inside the Columbia River and Salish Sea basins. Former Seattle Mayor Paul Schell long deployed Cascadia for his advocacy of high-speed rail from Portland to British Columbia, and a bid at a cross-border Olympic Games. But rarely has Cascadia been as geographically confined as it was this past week at a gathering aimed at tying the Seattle area closer to Greater Vancouver, B.C.

More than 300 business and government leaders converged on Vancouver on Tuesday for the “Emerging Cascadia Innovation Corridor” conference. Business cards were exchanged, memorandums of understanding were signed, and, later, salmon was served. As one Washington-side government official, scanning the crowd at end of the event, asked: “Where’s Portland?” Not invited, it seems. The Portland Business Alliance and Technology Association of Oregon both say they weren’t aware of the event. Neither was Portland Mayor Charlie Hales, though a spokesman pointed out that Portland’s Timbers of Major League Soccer were currently on top in the annual “Cascadia Cup” clashes with the Seattle Sounders and Vancouver Whitecaps, making Portland the toast of Cascadia by that measure. The reason the Rose City was left out might have something to do with the driving force behind the conference: Microsoft. The company has a sales office in Portland and manufacturing facility in nearby Wilsonville, but Vancouver, and its looser immigration restrictions, is the Northwest city that has held Microsoft’s attention this year. Helped by a B.C.-negotiated exemption to Canada’s temporary-worker program, Microsoft this summer opened a newly expanded Vancouver development outpost, which in part serves as a sort of way station for immigrant developers for a company long critical of what it says are too few guest-worker visas in the U.S. The company’s gleaming new office space, coincidentally located above a retail store owned by Seattle compatriot Nordstrom, has space for 750 workers. (A majority of those currently working there, Microsoft says, are Canadian citizens.) Portland, for all the advantages residents would claim in craft beer or soccer, is governed by the same immigration laws as Microsoft’s Redmond home. Perhaps Intel, Oregon’s largest private-sector employer and the Portland area’s technology anchor, will fire back with its own cross-border conference. — Matt Daymday@seattletimes.com Oracle’s Ellison challenges AWS Larry Ellison, the world’s ninth-wealthiest billionaire, is picking a fight with Jeff Bezos, who is No. 3 on Bloomberg’s list of richest people on the planet. Or at least with the Amazon.com cloud computing unit that helped catapult Bezos to that rank. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison, co-founder of enterprise computing behemoth Oracle, threw down the gauntlet at Amazon Web Services last week during the Oracle World conference in San Francisco. AWS is the business that largely dominates the growing field of cloud computing. “Amazon’s lead is over. Amazon is going to have serious competition going forward,” Ellison said, according to the Journal report. “We now have a tech advantage over Amazon in infrastructure service.” In a conference call earlier this month, Ellison touted the Redwood City, Calif., company’s new data centers, which compete directly with Amazon’s, and, according to Ellison, allow Oracle customers to move their entire operations and data from their own corporate servers to the Oracle cloud without making any changes. Amazon, which likes to say it focuses on customers and not competitors, didn’t respond to a request for comment. How likely is Oracle to eat Amazon’s lunch? Amazon, after all, helped usher in the continuing boom in infrastructure-as-services business by making its data centers available to third parties a decade ago, and now has built it into a business that collected $2.9 billion in revenue (and $718 million in operating income) in the quarter ended in June. “It’s a ridiculous claim,” said Justin Moore, CEO of Axcient, a company that specializes in combating data loss in cloud applications. Moore says it took Amazon 10 years to get where it is, half of which were spent finding its feet. “That isn’t something that comes overnight nor with bravado and chest-thumping,” he said. Then again, it might not be impossible to build a hugely profitable cloud franchise, an objective Microsoft, Google and IBM are also after. Many analysts say the mass migration of corporate data from proprietary data centers to those of cloud providers is only beginning, and many companies could meet that demand. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said as much in a conference call last June. “There’s plenty of room for multiple winners in this business,” he said. —Ángel Gonzálezagonzales@seattletimes.com Theo offers ‘healthful’ bite Seattle-based Theo Chocolate, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, is launching a new line of what it calls “a healthier chocolate-based snacking alternative.” Each serving of the bite-sized Theo Chocolate Clusters contains at least 50 mg of cocoa flavonols, a phytonutrient that some have said is good for cardiovascular health. The clusters are a combination of dark chocolate, crispy quinoa, toasted coconut and cocoa flavonols, and come in three flavors: salted almond, turmeric coconut, and lemon hemp. Packages of clusters sell for $5.99 and are available for purchase online and at Theo’s factory store. The clusters are the latest for the company, which has, over the years, introduced a Fantasy line (including flavors such as coconut curry and bread & chocolate), a Classics line of chocolate bars, a peanut-butter cup and almond-butter-cup line, coconut bites and more. Theo Chocolate is known for producing organic, fair-trade, non-GMO products. The company declined to disclose its latest revenue figures but said that it has experienced double-digit growth every year since it launched in 2006. — Janet I.

 Facebook has built a world-class, murderous, Doom-playing AI Rob Price Sep. 24, 2016, 5:09 AM 7,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Researchers from Facebook have built a highly efficient piece of artificial intelligence (AI), programmed to slaughter anything in its path. Luckily, it can only play "Doom". A team from the social network blasted its way to glory this week in a contest to build programs capable of autonomously playing the classic first-person shooter game. Called VizDoom, it's an irreverent test of skill for AI researchers, focused on eight-player deathmatches. Think your software is smart? Prove it: Defeat your rivals in a bloody eight-player shoot-out. (Engadget's Aaron Soupporis has talked to some of the human teams, and written a deep dive on their strategies and the outcome of the matches.) AI, of wildly varying levels of sophistication, has been in games since the earliest days of the medium. But what sets VizDoom apart is the kind of input the AI competitors are given. Traditionally, computer-controlled entities will be fed a stream of incomprehensible (in human terms) data: Coordinates, shifting variables, internal data (like maps) and so on, which they respond to according to preset rules. In contrast, the VizDoom competitors are only given access to the "screen buffer" — AKA the contents of the computer screen — for it to decide what to do, in the same way human players do. And the competing AI's also "learn" via constant reinforcement, adapting their strategies over time as they figure out what works and what doesn't. In short, it's forced to play exactly as a human does. There were two categories of play in the competition: Facebook's F1 team won the first, and chipmaker Intel's IntelAct team won the second. The one that Facebook won was simpler. It's a deathmatch that takes place on a map that AI competitors have played on and trained on in advance, with only one weapon available — the rocket launcher. Ammo and medkits (health) are scattered around to collect as required. You can watch them battle in the video below. By and large, they're pretty good. But the second is more complex — and makes Intel's achievement especially impressive. It takes place on a map the AI's haven't previously ever seen before, with a variety of mystery weapons and items in. The competitors can't just put their pre-match training into effect — they have to actively learn the map in their battle for supremacy. As you can see in the video below, this is where the competitors' failings become more apparent. PotatoesArePrettyOx (in the top right) struggles to walk in a straight line — when it's not just shooting the wall. On first glance, Intel's and Facebook's achievements seem both impressive, and slightly pointless. But you have to remember that this isn't really about Doom. The teams are stacked with incredibly sophisticated researchers, at the cutting edge of AI development. Just like Google DeepMind's successes playing boardgame Go, VizDoom is an accessible way to demonstrate to the world the nascent possibilities of artificial intelligence tech — and also encourage friendly rivalries between professionals at different companies. But that said, developing AI designed to destroy everything it sees with explosives in the most efficient way possible won't do much to assuage the fears of people worried about the rise of "killer robots."

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   RAID Controller Card Market Growth, Demand, Opportunity, Analysis And Forecasts To 2020 According to the report, increasing number of government data centers will be a key driver for market growth. ICT has become the backbone of many government operations across countries. (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 24, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global RAID Controller Card Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global RAID controller card market: Avago Technologies, Intel, Fujitsu, Dell, and HP. Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Increasing popularity of flash-based storage will be a key trend for market growth. SSD storage or flash storage offers greater efficiency than traditional HDD storage devices. In 2015, the cost of flash-based storage was greater than that of HDD-based storage arrays. Vendors are continuously decreasing their product prices due to the increased demand for storage infrastructure in the market. With the increased use of mission-critical applications, flash-based storage arrays offer 40 times better than hard disk input/output (I/O) performance and around 50% reduction in power consumption. Due to the higher cost involved in procuring flash-based storage systems, it will experience a higher growth in large and mega data centers. However, the price of these systems will drop by 5%-10% YoY, resulting in an increased demand for flash storage during the period 2018-2020. The overall market will experience a steady growth in the adoption of flash and traditional storage systems, where flash will add more revenue in the coming years. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/383390/global-raid-controller-card-market-2016-2020 According to the report, increasing number of government data centers will be a key driver for market growth. ICT has become the backbone of many government operations across countries. Over the past decade, many government agencies worldwide have established data centers for their operations. In the US, almost all the state and local government agencies operate data centers that are located across the country. This trend is spreading worldwide along with the increase in the adoption of cloud-based services, big data analytics, and the IoT. Further, the report states that erasure coding is a strategy for data protection in which data is broken into parts, extended, and encoded with repetitive data pieces and put away over an arrangement of different areas or capacity media. Erasure coding is a contrasting option to reinforcement, which has risen as a technique for ensuring against drive failure. It is an alternative solution for data protection in servers and client PCs and is a challenge to the market. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Baseband Processor Market Growth, Demand, Opportunity, Analysis And Forecasts To 2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Development of next-generation wireless networks will be a key trend for market growth (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 24, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Baseband Processor Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global baseband processor market: Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Broadcom, and Spreadtrum. Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Development of next-generation wireless networks will be a key trend for market growth. As mobile communication devices are gaining traction, the network traffic is rapidly increasing. This is leading to an increase in the deployment of next-generation wireless networks such as 3G, 4G, and 5G. These technologies offer wireless connection similar to home broadband connections. This, in turn, increases the number of users accessing the internet from anywhere, at any time. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/383374/global-baseband-processor-market-2016-2020 According to the report, at the end of 2013, Chinese government issued 4G licenses to three major telecom operators, namely China Mobile with frequency spectrum of 1880MHz-1900MHz, 2320MHz-2370MHz, and 2575MHz-2635MHz bands; China Telecom with frequency spectrum of 2370MHz-2390MHz and 2635MHz-2655MHz; and China Unicom with frequency spectrum of 2300MHz-2320MHz, marking the beginning of China's high-speed mobile network. The purpose of issuance of a 4G license by the Ministry of Industrial Information Technology (MIIT) is to increase consumer spending on information technology. Also, the launch of 4G is likely to drive the retail sales of smartphones. Hence, many smartphone manufacturers are launching 4G smartphones to grab this opportunity. This has also led to a decline in the prices of 3G smartphones, which in turn, propelled the sales of 3G smartphones in China. This factor will be a key driver for market growth, driving the demand for baseband processors. Further, the report states that one of the major challenges for the existing vendors in the market is that smartphone vendors such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, and Samsung are opting for in-house production of baseband processors. The vendors established with high economies of scale have capabilities to vertically integrate the supply chain and are financially strong to invest in new product lines and related R&D. Further, Xiaomi has announced that they will start manufacturing smartphone processors from the second half of 2016. Though this does not affect the global baseband processors market, it affects the established vendors such as Qualcomm and MediaTek, as they are highly dependent on the mobile devices manufacturers. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Technavios analysts forecast the global baseband processor market to grow at a CAGR of 13.7% during the period 2016-2020. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global baseband processor market for 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the baseband processors.

Enhancing Virtualization Performance with VMware VStorage –Dell, Inc. Dell Technologies is looking to tap channel partners in the desktop virtualization space to sell two new mobile thin clients. The Dell Latitude E7270 and the Latitude 3460, released this week, are the latest additions to Dell's virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) portfolio, which the company has steadily expanded throughout the year. Designed using Dell's Latitude laptop platforms and Wyse thin clients, the Dell thin clients target two classes of mobile workers within customer organizations: the highly mobile worker, such an employee who is frequently on the road, and 'the corridor warrior,' an employee that's mobile within an  office environment, said Dan O'Farrell, senior director of product marketing for cloud client computing at Dell.

The higher-performing of the two Dell thin clients, the Latitude E7270, is equipped with a 12.5-inch display and an Intel 6th Generation Core i5 processor, which provides the "local horsepower to ensure a great user experience," O'Farrell said. He added the E7220 best suits users "who need a fairly powerful end device for accessing their virtual desktops." The Latitude 3460, by contrast, has a larger, 14-inch screen and an Intel Celeron 3215U processor. He noted it suits an office worker who runs "the everyday mix of Office applications," such as Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint and Word. "We view the channel as key in the go-to-market model for [the new Dell thin clients]," O'Farrell said. "I think the way our partners will look at [the Latitude E7270 and 3460 release] is that it's even more choice and more capability for customers." He added the products are ideal for the five "usual suspect" verticals for thin client sales -- healthcare, retail, education, finance and government. Other relevant verticals include exploration and energy, manufacturing and media editing. While the mobile thin clients are "part and parcel to [Dell's] overall goal to make desktop virtualization easy to plan, easy to purchase, easy to implement and easy to operate," O'Farrell noted that VDI is "still a somewhat complex animal." The complexity presents an opportunity for partners to offer design, planning, education and training services to customers, as well as value-added services to oversee VDI environments. Dell's strategy for simplifying VDI also allows for a faster sales cycle, which gives Dell partners the opportunity to "flip over many, many more deals." "We've done great things to vastly simplify [VDI], but the other advantage to partners is that you can make a VDI opportunity much more transactional in nature," he said. BTG offers hyper-convergence, private clouds to partners Breakthrough Technology Group (BTG), a managed infrastructure, IT and telecom solutions provider, said it has transitioned its private cloud offering to a hyper-converged architecture and plans to ramp up its channel program in 2017. The company's Adaptable Cloud Services are hosted in SSAE 16-certified data centers. In addition, BTG provides offerings layered on top of its hyper-converged infrastructure. According to the company, those include AppsAnyplace, a managed hosted virtual desktop and application delivery offering; SaaSAnyplace, a suite of Microsoft productivity tools provided as a service; and DataAnyplace, a secure collaboration, data management and sharing offering built on Citrix ShareFile. BTG pursues channel ties with consultants, value-added resellers, managed service providers (MSPs) and other channel companies through its Private Cloud Partner Program. Jeff Kaplan, CEO of BTG, based in Morganville, N.J., said channel partners accustomed to supplying on-premises servers and storage could be left out as customers shift to the cloud. He said partners could find themselves "with a big, gaping revenue hole that they need to fill, or [they'll] be in trouble." He said more partners will need to transition to a recurring revenue model, but noted that cloud infrastructure is expensive to build. "Most [channel companies] are going to want to partner with someone," Kaplan said. Other news Users of LabTech's remote monitoring and management software can now integrate it with security capabilities from vendor Trend Micro Inc. The new Trend Micro Worry-Free Services plug-in offers protection against malware, spam, ransomware and other security threats, allowing MSPs to deploy Trend Micro's security services to devices across an entire customer base, as well as perform scans and updates within the LabTech console. Trend Micro MSP partners can access the plug-in through the LabTech Solution Center. A SADA Systems survey of more than 300 healthcare IT professionals in North America found most respondents believe cloud computing is having a positive effect on patient care and satisfaction. The MSP's survey noted 56% of respondents cited cloud-based applications as improving patient satisfaction, while 55% of respondents said such apps contribute to better treatment, according to the company. Improved productivity and efficiency for staff and patients was another plus, with 64% of those polled attributing those benefits to cloud technologies. CompTIA launched a campaign the organization said aims to make the IT industry more gender-inclusive. CompTIA released an e-book and associated website, Make Tech Her Story: What Needs To Change.

Taking a look at the minimum specs, the game will run on an Intel i5-4460 or AMD FX-6300, coupled with a Nvidia GTX 760 or AMD Radeon R7 260x, which is fairly low by today’s standards. Memory wise, 8 GB of RAM is required, along with any modern version of Windows (7, 8, 8.1, or 10, 64-bit versions only). These minimum specs target a rendering resolution of 1080p with a framerate of 30 frames per second. On the other hand, the recommended specs target a full 60 frames per second (once again at 1080p), though you won’t need high-end hardware to hit this target. GPU-wise, an Nvidia GTX 960 or AMD Radeon R9 280x is recommended, although the same 8 GB of RAM is listed. When it comes to CPUs, Capcom recommends an Intel Core i7 3770 or better, although there’s no mention of an equivalent AMD processor. While the mention of an i7 might turn some heads, it’s worth noting that the most recent line of i5 processors have been shown to compete with older-generation i7s, without requiring any sort of overclocking. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is set to release next year on January 24, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows.

For Kaloyeros, an empire falls Politics on the Hudson Joseph Spector , Albany Bureau Chief 4:20 p.m. EDT September 23, 2016 39 Shares Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share SUNY Polytechnic Institute President Alain Kaloyeros was arraigned in Albany City Court on Friday. ALBANY - Alain Kaloyeros was the architect of a vision: Create an Albany nanocenter owned by the state, but used by the largest private high-tech companies in the world for research and development. It’s a model that brought Kaloyeros extraordinary praise and money — and the vision has spread to facilities in Buffalo, Rochester, Canandaigua, Syracuse and Utica. It also appears to have given him something else: unchecked power. And that may be his undoing after he was charged Thursday with nine others in a sweeping corruption case that accused Kaloyeros of bid rigging in state and federal courts. "I think fundamentally it’s a question of accountability," said Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, D-Irondequoit, who battled with Kaloyeros over the $600 million Rochester photonics center. "In government, you need to ensure accountability and that one person does not have the ability to make decisions unilaterally." ► SUNY Poly's power extends into shadowy world ► 10 charged in sweeping New York corruption cases ► Photonics HQ squabble a clash of egos Kaloyeros, 60, who built the SUNY Polytechnic Institute into an Albany-based juggernaut, was put on unpaid leave Thursday by SUNY. On Friday, Cuomo stripped SUNY Poly of its oversight of projects across upstate New York. Kaloyeros appeared Friday morning in a crowded Albany city courtroom, where he was arraigned on three state felony charges. He was released on his own recognizance after his attorneys noted he posted bail Thursday in federal court. After a two-minute arraignment, Kaloyeros silently exited the courtroom, whispering to his attorneys as a swarm of television cameras and reporters followed him to an awaiting blue sedan. As they walked, Mike Miller, Kaloyeros' attorney, said his client is not guilty, declining further comment. In a statement late Thursday, Miller noted Kaloyeros' accomplishments.

(Will Waldron/The Albany Times Union via AP)  (Photo: Will Waldron, AP) Dr. Nano Kaloyeros was known for usually being the highest-paid employee in state government, typically earning more than $1 million a year. He drove Italian sports cars, had the license plate "Dr. Nano," and talked tough. He was also known for being able beat out other states to land major deals with global corporations, including IBM, Intel and GlobalFoundries, who all have operations at the Albany nanocenter. "These charges can’t be reconciled with Dr. Kaloyeros’ robust leadership of the SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Fort Schuyler and Fuller Road," Miller said, referring to nonprofits controlled by SUNY Poly. "Over the past three decades, Dr. Kaloyeros has done everything within his power to make SUNY a beacon amongst academic institutions focused on cutting edge technology and science." But Kaloyeros' model of having the state own the high-tech facilities and work with the private sector is drawing a new round of criticism. The criminal charges alleged Kaloyeros was part of a bid-rigging scheme that benefited major developers in Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. He was charged with one federal count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and three state counts of combination in restraint of trade and competition. Working in the shadows In the state case by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Kaloyeros is accused of steering contracts to an Albany-area developer, Columbia Development, for a SUNY Poly facility. In one email, Kaloyeros told Columbia's President Joseph Nicolla of the details of an unreleased request for proposals for a dormitory project, court records showed. Nicolla has also been charged. "This self-serving scheme alleged in the complaint was particularly egregious because it was aimed at enriching powerful people at the expense of the state’s public university system," Schneiderman said in a statement. The problem, some officials said, is that Kaloyeros was able to set up two nonprofit corporations, Fort Schuyler and Fuller Road, that ran SUNY Poly's empire. The corporations were able to largely operate in secret, allowing for contracts to be awarded with little public oversight. In the case of Fort Schuyler, the federal charges indicate that LPCiminelli in Buffalo and COR Development in Syracuse had "preferred developer" status for state contracts. Officials from both companies were also charged by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in the scheme. The corporations "were intended to and did evade all the protections that would have prevented this mess," said former Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Greenburgh, Westchester County. He added, "When you privatize public functions, you lose the protection of laws that work. The notion that large institutions like ESDC (Empire State Development) or SUNY were able to do this by creating nonprofit corporations is at the heart of the thing that needs reform here. Cuomo on Friday said the bidding system will be revamped, saying it was established before his administration, saying Kaloyeros worked for five governors, starting as a SUNY Albany professor. "He did a lot of work for a lot of governors through SUNY, and a lot of good work, I might add, using that process," Cuomo said "Was there a reason to revisit the process at SUNY? There wasn’t. It was in place. It was working well," Cuomo continued -- until now. Future without him Now there are questions about whether Kaloyeros' empire can be sustained without him. Cuomo  leaned on Kaloyeros to help the governor revive the upstate economy, but that also may have led to part of Kaloyeros' demise. The court papers suggested Kaloyeros hired Todd Howe, a lobbyist and former aide to Cuomo at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in part to build up a relationship with Cuomo. Kaloyeros had feared Cuomo could replace him or neutralize his power, Bharara's office alleged. Howe and Kaloyeros then arranged for lucrative contracts to go to LPCiminelli and COR, upstate developers who are major donors to Cuomo's campaign and also were paying Howe. Cuomo's former top aide, Joseph Percoco, meanwhile, also received $35,000 from COR. Both Howe and Percoco have also been charged, and Howe already pleased guilty to a eight-count indictment. In the state case, Schneiderman said Kaloyeros stood to benefit from a deal with Columbia Development, an Albany-area developer who promised to contribute research money to SUNY Poly. Kaloyeros' compensation with the SUNY Research Foundation was in part based on the research money he brought in, Schneiderman said. SUNY Poly has been a critical piece the Buffalo Billion initiative, the Rochester photonics center, a massive nanotech facility in Utica and construction projects in Syracuse. The college is also closely tied to IBM and GlobalFoundries, which runs a sprawling chip manufacturer near Saratoga and now owns much of IBM's footprint in Dutchess County. Former Assemblyman Ronald Canestrari, D-Cohoes, Albany County, said Kaloyeros should be credited for his vision and will leave a void in the state's economic development. "He is a visionary without a doubt," Canestrari said. "He did a tremendous amount for our area, not only in terms of tax revenue, but job creation as well. "That’s the sad part of it. He has an unfinished agenda that may not be realized."

Crunch Network The 5 technologies that are going to define the next decade in cities Posted Sep 23, 2016 by Colin O’Donnell (@colin_odonnell) 0 SHARES Next Story Gillmor Gang LIVE 09.23.16 Colin O’Donnell Crunch Network Contributor Colin O’Donnell is the chief innovation officer of Intersection. More posts by this contributor: Bad UX kills In the singularity, we’ll still be using the same garbage trucks How to join the network Cities have always been hubs of technological experimentation, shaped by the people who inhabit them and the tools they use. We can still see the marks, both charming and garish, from technologies of years past — from old aqueducts to telephone booths to the damage done by cars. The next wave of real-time technologies that will define the next decade are software (rather than hardware) upgrades to the city that will nonetheless transform the way we work, play and live in our physical environments — our “brick and mortar” cities. And these technologies, each transformative in their own right, when used in combination to develop new products and experiences, will have a multiplying effect on the rate of change we see in urban environments. (And clearly, in the future, all technologies will have two-letter acronyms.) Fifth-generation wireless (5G) 5G is just a marketing term right now, but there is no denying that mobile data consumption is exploding, and all of our future technologies will require vastly faster, ubiquitous wireless connectivity. Demands on networks are doubling every year. At this rate, with a bit of quick math, we can see that in the next decade we will have 1,000x the demand for mobile data. To meet these skyrocketing demands, we need to densify the mobile networks of years past. This means moving from macrocell sites that cover neighborhoods to small cells that cover blocks, down to femtocells and picocells that bring high speed, synchronized connectivity to your home and human-scale settings. Bandwidth has become the lifeblood of cities as much as water, good roads or electricity have supported thriving cities in the past. It’s really the base technology that all others are built on. Look for ubiquitous gigabit-speed wireless in leading cities over the next decade. Computer vision (CV) Of all the sensors available, video-as-a-sensor will emerge as the most important tool — and maybe the most controversial — for helping us understand cities over the next decade. Sound, air quality and others are important, but CV allows the broadest range of possibilities and supports the greatest number of possible use cases. From understanding density of populations, to usage patterns, to speed of traffic, to how resources are being used, CV will quite literally be the eyes of the city. The real power of these technologies will be unlocked when we combine them. This comes with well-warranted concerns for privacy, but with pioneers like Intel managing tight security and on-device processing, and Movidius promising insanely detailed chip-based object recognition, there’s reason to believe we’ll arrive at a scenario that protects our privacy. And if you can’t imagine the city being covered in cameras, take a look around and count the number of cameras already in the city. Nearly every store, street corner, cab and cop has a camera. The change will occur in swapping out the human who reviews a recording today for a computer that processes the images instead. The innovation will happen when this computer-generated data can be shared safely and securely across the city to foster new combinatorial innovations. For instance, it could support a real-time 3D map of the city that could be used for guiding autonomous vehicles around children playing in the street, supply city planning departments with real-time data on resource utilization or help business owners understand customer trends and create more responsive services and offerings. If 5G provides the base connectivity layer required for cities to evolve, CV will provide the understanding and “ground truth” of what’s going on. Mixed reality (MR) Where virtual reality, augmented reality and plain-old reality mix together to bring digital overlays that incorporate real physics and computer graphics and create immersive experiences with the best of the physical and digital, we call this mixed reality. MR has perhaps the most limitless possibilities of all five technologies listed here, and likely will serve as the eventual replacement to the mobile phone. From virtual goods that reduce strains on our resources to overlays on the world for entertainment, education and work, MR has astounding implications. With the help of companies like Samsung, Google and Magic Leap, use cases and interfaces that Google Glass or Pokémon Go have hinted at will transform into seamless, natural combinations of the internet, physical city infrastructure and society. Imagine changing the architecture of a city on-the-fly, or making certain information about yourself visible to different circles, like your relationship status in a dating-overlay or your blood type and heart rate for first responders. Autonomous vehicles (AV) We have more than one billion cars on the planet. That’s trillions of dollars of rapidly depreciating infrastructure sitting on the streets, used for only a fraction of its life. And even when cars are used, their most efficient use (when driven close to capacity at the top of their performance profile) happens briefly and rarely, like when you are loaded up with kids and all your stuff from your summer vacation. These real-time software technologies will drive the greatest rate of change in cities over the next decade. We have given these cars billions of square feet of prime real estate in cities around the world. Autonomous vehicles not only have the potential to change the idea of car ownership and last-mile travel, but also radically change the way we manage logistics and delivery of goods. We will see cities’ use of space and people’s travel habits change dramatically over the next decade, enabled by changes to vehicle sizes and the addition of intelligent routing, breaking down car travel into everything from package-delivering drones (think Amazon Prime Air or Starship), to micro-buses making commutes efficient and cheap, to intelligent, tiny, easy-to-use single-person rideables. Artificial intelligence (AI) We need brains to bring these technologies together and make them work. And we’re not talking about order-taking robots or computers we need to program with every detail. AI should let us manage by objective: tell the system what we want to achieve, help it when it needs it and course correct it as it goes along. With learning systems that can scale massively in scope via cloud computing and maintain responsiveness across billions of interactions on the most minute level via in-device edge processing, AI is the most unpredictable and existential technology of the bunch. It has the potential to bring things together to help us solve critical macro issues — we can use AI to make vastly better use of our resources, solve equity issues and prevent crime — and the smaller, more personal challenges, like finding a better way to get to work, meet a mate or optimize your schedule to better suit your desired lifestyle.

But, it’s 1,000,000,000 times harder to move an atom than an electron, so we think these real-time software technologies will drive the greatest rate of change in cities over the next decade. Think of them as your five basic ingredients with which you can build an infinite range of recipes. The real power of these technologies will be unlocked when we combine them — 5G-connected AVs, utilizing data sourced from the city via CV sensors to anticipate obstacles in real time, using AI to process the data and coordinate with other AVs for maximal street-level effectiveness, all while passengers look out a virtual MR window onto their individualized city (two-letter acronyms are the future!). Keep your eyes open and you’ll see these five technologies popping up in development today, and then gradually becoming a core part of pretty much all of our interactions with each other and the city over the next 10 years.

Capcom claims it uses the driver to stop players from hacking the high-def beat 'em up to cheat. Unfortunately, the code is so badly designed, it opens up a full-blown local backdoor. Let's drill down to the technical details: the capcom.sys kernel-level driver provides an IOCTL service to applications that disables SMEP on the computer, executes code at a given pointer, and then reenables SMEP. In other words, it switches off a crucial security defense in the operating system, then runs whatever instructions are given to it by the application, and then switches the protection back on. SMEP [PDF] is a feature in modern Intel and AMD x86 processors that, when enabled, prevents kernel-level software from executing code in user-owned memory pages. It's there to stop hackers from tricking the operating system into running malicious software smuggled into an application's virtual memory space – the OS should only be able to run its own trusted code, not anything provided by any old app. Capcom.sys completely blows this away on Windows: an application simply has to pass control codes 0xAA012044 and 0xAA013044 to the IOCTL, and a pointer to some instructions, and the driver will then jump to that block of code with full kernel permissions. oh dear god this capcom.sys has an ioctl that disables smep and calls a provided function pointer, and sets SMEP back what even pic.twitter.com/jBCXO7YtNe — slipstream/RoL (@TheWack0lian) September 23, 2016 Capcom is seemingly using this driver to allow its user-mode game to poke around the machine at the lowest level and spot any attempts by the player to cheat. The tool was bundled within an update, issued earlier this week, to Street Fighter V that brought in a new character, Urien. The title went on sale in February this year. "As a part of the new content and system update releasing later today, we’re also rolling out an updated anti-crack solution (note: not DRM) that prevents certain users from hacking the executable," a Capcom rep explained on Thursday. "The solution also prevents memory address hack that are commonly used for cheating and illicitly obtaining in-game currency and other entitlements that haven’t been purchased yet. "The anti-crack solution does not require online connectivity in order to play the game in offline mode; however, players will be required to click-confirm each time they boot up the game. This step allows ‘handshake’ to take place between the executable and the dependent driver prior to launch." Gamers realized something was a little off when the upgrade brought in a new driver and demanded operating-system-grade access to the computer before the game starts. A number of players say they couldn't even get the new version to work at all. A full-blown online meltdown ensued. Just after we published this article, a Capcom rep tweeted: We are in the process of rolling back the security measures added to the PC version of Street Fighter V. After the rollback process to the PC version, all new content from the September update will still be available to players. We apologize for the inconvenience and will have an update on the time-frame for the PC rollback solution soon. A lesson quickly learned, it seems. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 63 Comments More from The Register Pokémon-loving VXer targets Linux with 'Umbreon' rootkit We told you Pokémon are evil, but no, you wouldn't listen 11 Comments Definitely not another Stuxnet, researchers claim as they demo industrial control rootkit Black Hat EU Undetectable ghost in the controller 3 Comments Ad-slinging rootkit nasty permanently drills into Android mobes, tabs Kernel-exploiting Kemoge in 20 countries and counting 29 Comments Hacking Team spyware rootkit: Even a new HARD DRIVE wouldn't get rid of it No amount of scrubbing could shift UEFI BIOS nasty 50 Comments Mac bug makes rootkit injection as easy as falling asleep Apple hacker reveals cracker 0day rootkit whacker 14 Comments +5 ROOTKIT OF VENGEANCE defeats forces of gaming good Kernel-level code helps gamers to vanquish anti-cheatware 43 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

September 23rd, 2016 - By: Jeff Dorsch Security The Industrial Internet Consortium this week unveiled the Industrial Internet Security Framework, a set of specifications for connected health-care devices and hospitals, intelligent transportation, smart electrical grids, smart factories, and other cyber-physical systems in the Internet of Things. AT&T, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Infineon Technologies, Intel, Microsoft, and Symantec are among the companies contributing to the security framework. The consortium will host the West Coast Industrial Internet Security Forum on Thursday, Oct. 6, from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the headquarters of Real-Time Innovations in Sunnyvale, Calif. Deals Cisco Systems and Salesforce.com said Thursday they will collaborate on developing and marketing products for the Internet of Things and other areas, building upon their cloud-based services. The joint effort could help the companies in their competition with Alphabet/Google, Amazon Web Services, the Microsoft Azure service, and the Oracle Cloud. Cisco Jasper and the Salesforce IoT Cloud will be integrated to provide control, insights, and visibility. Those integrations will be available in the second half of 2017. “Cisco and Salesforce coming together to form a strategic alliance can eliminate the friction users experience today so they can become more productive,” Rowan Trollope, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s IoT and Applications Groups, said in a statement. The Bosch Group is partnering with SAP for Internet of Things applications, with Bosch providing its IoT cloud platform and SAP offering its back-end software. SAP’s HANA real-time database will be provided to Bosch customers under the agreement. Bosch CEO Volkman Denner said in a statement, “In order to make even better use of the major potential that connected industry holds, international companies must cooperate more closely than before, and they must base that cooperation on open standards.” PTC joined SAP’s PartnerEdge program, making its ThingWorx Internet of Things platform available to run on SAP’s HANA platform for IoT application development, analytics capabilities, and augmented-reality functionality. ThingWorx is also available through the SAP App Center. Market Research IDC reports that 31% of enterprises now have IoT offerings for analytics, cloud, and security capabilities, while another 43% plan to bring out such offerings in the next 12 months. Says Carrie MacGillivray, IDC’s vice president of Mobility and Internet of Things, “There’s a lot of education taking place in the market, and now IoT is such a hot topic that customers are talking about it with vendors or attending events to learn more.” Memoori Research forecasts the worldwide market for the Internet of Things in commercial buildings will increase from $23.5 billion last year to $75.5 billion by 2021 for a compound annual growth rate of 20.7%. The market research firm has a new report, The Internet of Things in Smart Commercial Buildings 2016 to 2021. Privacy The fourth annual Global Privacy Enforcement Network Privacy Sweep concludes that connected devices are falling short in securing the personal information of people. “With the proliferation of the Internet of Things, the activities, movements, behaviors, and preferences of individuals are being measured, recorded, and analyzed on an increasingly regular basis. As this technology expands, it is imperative that companies do a better job of explaining their personal information handling practices,” Daniel Therrien, Canada’s federal privacy commissioner, said in a statement.

Their staple method of course is to hike across the border wherever it is porous. Sometimes they bore tunnels into Indian territory. Now there is talk of them winging it. Lately, the Border Security Force (BSF) has been receiving inputs that terror camps operating in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) are training their recruits in paragliding to enable infiltration by air. And so BSF personnel are now having to scan the skies as well. The force is now putting in place what is called 'depth deployment' to thwart infiltration by air. Especially for this purpose, one company (roughly 126 jawans) of BSF personnel has been deployed at the Pittal border outpost (BOP) in the Arnia forward area of RS Pura, one of the most sensitive outposts that is subject to frequent heavy shelling and firing from Pakistan. The company arrived at the post three days ago after a final nod from Union home minister Rajnath Singh last week. Conventionally, BSF relies on linear formation (the first line of defence), a standard tactical formation focused on infiltration from the ground, to deter infiltration. Depth deployment is meant as a second line of defence. It will focus on the sky. Intel inputs suggest that fidayeen are being trained in paragliding techniques. The plan is to fly into Indian territory at night so as to escape the BSF's attention. The force's forward posts may not be able to pick up such infiltrators. But those who positioned slightly back will be in a better position to spot the intruders, said one BSF official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. As part of this second line of defence, at least three jawans will be posted at each point, some 2 km behind the forward line. At least 10 such points are being set up, wider apart than the forward positions, cutting a semi-circular arc. The men posted in depth deployment will be given night vision devices and sophisticated weaponry. Depth deployment near Pittal would mean that a 3.2 km stretch of the border up to the Mukesh BOP would leave no scope for infiltration. "We will back up the posts with area domination teams as well,'' the officer explained. "Plus, we maintain cordial relationship with the villagers who will inform us about any suspicious objects when it turns dark." Once implemented at Pittal, depth deployment will be put in place in other intruder-vulnerable areas as well. Sure enough, there are several points along International Border in Jammu from where paragliders can take off and gain altitudes up to a few thousand feet. "The agricultural fields on our side of the border would be perfect landing grounds at night. If armed with by a GPS, the infiltrators' job become easy. They can even determine the drift of the wind using GPS. Supposing they launch from Jarwal or even Maharajke (two posts on Pakistan side close to the border), the fidayeen can reach this side in no time,'' said a BSF officer. But what if the gliders fly over the depth deployment further infield? There they would risk capture by Army units posted 5 km from the IB. WHY PARAGLIDING?   1. Paragliders can launch from higher ground and land on flat land 2. They can attain speeds of 25-60 kmph even in light winds 3. Can land in small open places 4. Easy to carry 5.

(Will Waldron/The Albany Times Union via AP) (Photo: Will Waldron, AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE ALBANY - Alain Kaloyeros was the architect of a vision: Create an Albany nanocenter owned by the state, but used by the largest private high-tech companies in the world for research and development. It’s a model that brought Kaloyeros extraordinary praise and money — and the vision has spread to facilities in Buffalo, Rochester, Canandaigua, Syracuse and Utica. It also appears to have given him something else: unchecked power. And that may be his undoing after he was charged Thursday with nine others in a sweeping corruption case that accused Kaloyeros of bid rigging in state and federal courts. "I think fundamentally it’s a question of accountability," said Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, D-Irondequoit, who battled with Kaloyeros over the $600 million Rochester photonics center. "In government, you need to ensure accountability and that one person does not have the ability to make decisions unilaterally." ► SUNY Poly's power extends into shadowy world ► 10 charged in sweeping New York corruption cases ► Photonics HQ squabble a clash of egos Kaloyeros, 60, who built the SUNY Polytechnic Institute into an Albany-based juggernaut, was put on unpaid leave Thursday by SUNY. On Friday, Cuomo stripped SUNY Poly of its oversight of projects across upstate New York. Kaloyeros appeared Friday morning in a crowded Albany city courtroom, where he was arraigned on three state felony charges. He was released on his own recognizance after his attorneys noted he posted bail Thursday in federal court. After a two-minute arraignment, Kaloyeros silently exited the courtroom, whispering to his attorneys as a swarm of television cameras and reporters followed him to an awaiting blue sedan. As they walked, Mike Miller, Kaloyeros' attorney, said his client is not guilty, declining further comment. In a statement late Thursday, Miller noted Kaloyeros' accomplishments. 'Dr. Nano' Kaloyeros was known for usually being the highest-paid employee in state government, typically earning more than $1 million a year. He drove Italian sports cars, had the license plate "Dr. Nano," and talked tough. He was also known for being able beat out other states to land major deals with global corporations, including IBM, Intel and GlobalFoundries, who all have operations at the Albany nanocenter. "These charges can’t be reconciled with Dr. Kaloyeros’ robust leadership of the SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Fort Schuyler and Fuller Road," Miller said, referring to nonprofits controlled by SUNY Poly. "Over the past three decades, Dr. Kaloyeros has done everything within his power to make SUNY a beacon amongst academic institutions focused on cutting edge technology and science." But Kaloyeros' model of having the state own the high-tech facilities and work with the private sector is drawing a new round of criticism. The criminal charges alleged Kaloyeros was part of a bid-rigging scheme that benefited major developers in Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. He was charged with one federal count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and three state counts of combination in restraint of trade and competition. Working in the shadows In the state case by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Kaloyeros is accused of steering contracts to an Albany-area developer, Columbia Development, for a SUNY Poly facility. In one email, Kaloyeros told Columbia's President Joseph Nicolla of the details of an unreleased request for proposals for a dormitory project, court records showed. Nicolla has also been charged. "This self-serving scheme alleged in the complaint was particularly egregious because it was aimed at enriching powerful people at the expense of the state’s public university system," Schneiderman said in a statement. The problem, some officials said, is that Kaloyeros was able to set up two nonprofit corporations, Fort Schuyler and Fuller Road, that ran SUNY Poly's empire. The corporations were able to largely operate in secret, allowing for contracts to be awarded with little public oversight. In the case of Fort Schuyler, the federal charges indicate that LPCiminelli in Buffalo and COR Development in Syracuse had "preferred developer" status for state contracts. Officials from both companies were also charged by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in the scheme. The corporations "were intended to and did evade all the protections that would have prevented this mess," said former Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Greenburgh, Westchester County. He added, "When you privatize public functions, you lose the protection of laws that work. The notion that large institutions like ESDC (Empire State Development) or SUNY were able to do this by creating nonprofit corporations is at the heart of the thing that needs reform here. Cuomo on Friday said the bidding system will be revamped, saying it was established before his administration, saying Kaloyeros worked for five governors, starting as a SUNY Albany professor. "He did a lot of work for a lot of governors through SUNY, and a lot of good work, I might add, using that process," Cuomo said "Was there a reason to revisit the process at SUNY? There wasn’t. It was in place. It was working well," Cuomo continued -- until now. A sign for the SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Albany, NY  (Photo: AP) Future without him Now there are questions about whether Kaloyeros' empire can be sustained without him. Cuomo  leaned on Kaloyeros to help the governor revive the upstate economy, but that also may have led to part of Kaloyeros' demise. The court papers suggested Kaloyeros hired Todd Howe, a lobbyist and former aide to Cuomo at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in part to build up a relationship with Cuomo. Kaloyeros had feared Cuomo could replace him or neutralize his power, Bharara's office alleged. Howe and Kaloyeros then arranged for lucrative contracts to go to LPCiminelli and COR, upstate developers who are major donors to Cuomo's campaign and also were paying Howe. Cuomo's former top aide, Joseph Percoco, meanwhile, also received $35,000 from COR. Both Howe and Percoco have also been charged, and Howe already pleased guilty to a eight-count indictment. In the state case, Schneiderman said Kaloyeros stood to benefit from a deal with Columbia Development, an Albany-area developer who promised to contribute research money to SUNY Poly. Kaloyeros' compensation with the SUNY Research Foundation was in part based on the research money he brought in, Schneiderman said. SUNY Poly has been a critical piece the Buffalo Billion initiative, the Rochester photonics center, a massive nanotech facility in Utica and construction projects in Syracuse. The college is also closely tied to IBM and GlobalFoundries, which runs a sprawling chip manufacturer near Saratoga and now owns much of IBM's footprint in Dutchess County. Former Assemblyman Ronald Canestrari, D-Cohoes, Albany County, said Kaloyeros should be credited for his vision and will leave a void in the state's economic development. "He is a visionary without a doubt," Canestrari said. "He did a tremendous amount for our area, not only in terms of tax revenue, but job creation as well. "That’s the sad part of it. He has an unfinished agenda that may not be realized."   1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/2dpCc7Q TOP VIDEOS 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 Vatican says keep your loved one's ashes off the mantel 0:24 Baby uses hearing aids for the first time 0:25 Girl Scout cookie cereal is a real thing and happening soon 1:10 More Stories As deer season opens, a timeless battle begins Nov. 18, 2016, 1:02 p.m. Travel agent stole $13K from anniversary couple, DA says Nov. 18, 2016, 11:29 a.m. Metro population shrinks, gets smarter and more diverse Nov. 18, 2016, 11:23 a.m.

The company first hired the Omnicom shop in 2013 to “develop corporate image advertising.” DDB won a pitch that included Ogilvy & Mather for an account that was worth an estimated $2 million at the time. That review followed the appointment of CMO Anand Chandrasekher, who previously held several senior-level roles at Intel. He was “censured” several months later and effectively demoted after he referred to competitor Apple’s 64-bit A7 chip as “a gimmick,” prompting his employer to issue a correction; Qualcomm has yet to name a new CMO. Both Qualcomm and DDB declined to comment directly on the current review. A DDB spokesperson deferred to the client, and a representative wrote, “we don’t comment on our internal relationships with our agencies.” Multiple sources, however, have confirmed that the review is active and that DDB opted to defend. According to the same sources, the move was not unexpected as DDB’s original contract with Qualcomm ends this year. The agency has created a variety of work for the client, launching its first brand campaign last April under the “Why Wait” theme. The campaign emphasized the speed of Qualcomm’s wireless technologies, with its VP of marketing and branding telling Adweek, “We have tremendous capabilities, but we’ve never talked about them.” Since then, DDB continued to develop the “why wait” in an additional spot released this January and, more recently, a documentary series called “Invent Off” in collaboration with director Andrew Fried of the Netflix food fetish series “Chef’s Table.” We do not currently know which agencies are involved in the review beyond DDB San Francisco, which went through a round of downsizing this summer after founding client Clorox’s decision to send its creative business to FCB and mcgarrybowen. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Their staple method of course is to hike across the border wherever it is porous. Sometimes they bore tunnels into Indian territory. Now there is talk of them winging it. Lately, the Border Security Force (BSF) has been receiving inputs that terror camps operating in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) are training their recruits in paragliding to enable infiltration by air. And so BSF personnel are now having to scan the skies as well. The force is now putting in place what is called 'depth deployment' to thwart infiltration by air. Especially for this purpose, one company (roughly 126 jawans) of BSF personnel has been deployed at the Pittal border outpost (BOP) in the Arnia forward area of RS Pura, one of the most sensitive outposts that is subject to frequent heavy shelling and firing from Pakistan. The company arrived at the post three days ago after a final nod from Union home minister Rajnath Singh last week. Conventionally, BSF relies on linear formation (the first line of defence), a standard tactical formation focused on infiltration from the ground, to deter infiltration. Depth deployment is meant as a second line of defence. It will focus on the sky. Intel inputs suggest that fidayeen are being trained in paragliding techniques. The plan is to fly into Indian territory at night so as to escape the BSF's attention. The force's forward posts may not be able to pick up such infiltrators. But those who positioned slightly back will be in a better position to spot the intruders, said one BSF official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. As part of this second line of defence, at least three jawans will be posted at each point, some 2 km behind the forward line. At least 10 such points are being set up, wider apart than the forward positions, cutting a semi-circular arc. The men posted in depth deployment will be given night vision devices and sophisticated weaponry. Depth deployment near Pittal would mean that a 3.2 km stretch of the border up to the Mukesh BOP would leave no scope for infiltration. "We will back up the posts with area domination teams as well,'' the officer explained. "Plus, we maintain cordial relationship with the villagers who will inform us about any suspicious objects when it turns dark." Once implemented at Pittal, depth deployment will be put in place in other intruder-vulnerable areas as well. Sure enough, there are several points along International Border in Jammu from where paragliders can take off and gain altitudes up to a few thousand feet. "The agricultural fields on our side of the border would be perfect landing grounds at night. If armed with by a GPS, the infiltrators' job become easy. They can even determine the drift of the wind using GPS. Supposing they launch from Jarwal or even Maharajke (two posts on Pakistan side close to the border), the fidayeen can reach this side in no time,'' said a BSF officer. But what if the gliders fly over the depth deployment further infield? There they would risk capture by Army units posted 5 km from the IB. WHY PARAGLIDING?   1. Paragliders can launch from higher ground and land on flat land 2. They can attain speeds of 25-60 kmph even in light winds 3. Can land in small open places 4. Easy to carry 5.

Enlightenment EFL Adds Atomic Modesetting, Nuclear Page-Flipping Written by Michael Larabel in Desktop on 23 September 2016 at 11:16 AM EDT. 9 Comments The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) now has support for atomic mode-setting and nuclear page-flipping! This atomic mode-setting and nuclear page-flipping support is designed for the Linux 4.8 kernel and newer and so far has just been tested with the Intel DRM driver. Samsung developer Chris Michael commented with the nearly thousand lines of new code that on working systems it provides "buttery smoothness." Atomic mode-setting allows setting output modes more cleanly by either being able to succeed or fail in one-go while also being able to test a desired mode in advance of the operation, reducing possible flickering situations while also being quicker. Nuclear page-flipping synchronizes the update of a scanout between the different planes and makes it atomic. This is more work for trying to achieve "perfect rendering" of every frame on the Linux desktop by synchronizing all the updates to the vblank. After talking about atomic mode-setting and nuclear page-flipping for 6+ years, it's great the pieces are finally maturing and coming together in the latest Linux kernel when it comes to the DRM drivers and then in the user-space with software beginning to make use of the new ioctls. From the Phoronix Chernobyl tour. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 6 min read Make More Happen Want to Stay Ahead of the Competition? Get Virtual. Augmented and virtual reality can help you innovate in your field before you fall behind. Here are six ways to get started. Jim Marggraff Contributor of Eyefluence September 23, 2016 When “Pokémon GO” launched this summer, it got people talking -- and not just about gym takeovers and Pikachus. The game’s popularity signaled the growing power of augmented and virtual reality (VR). VR, in particular, is a hot tech trend right now, but it’s been in development for some time. The military began using VR years ago to simulate hazardous environments during soldier training. These hyper realistic settings prepare them for what to expect in combat zones. Companies such as SOLIDWORKS use 3D modeling to improve design detailing, visualization and functionality. And more recently, both Qualcomm and Intel announced standalone VR headsets featuring their Snapdragon and Atom ship sets, respectively. Pokémon GO, which requires people to walk to different physical locations to access new creatures and levels within the virtual world, made augmented reality ubiquitous. It brought the blended experience into the collective consciousness and created a demand for more experiences like it. Related: Everything You Need to Know About Pokémon Go, the App That Earned $200 Million in its First Month As a result, businesses are racing to out-innovate other innovators. Look at Magic Leap, which is developing augmented-reality technology that will create lifelike holograms shone directly into users’ eyes. Microsoft’s HoloLens is another one. Such investments and products will only increase as more companies recognize the power of these technologies. Related: Virtual Reality Offers Plenty Of Business Opportunities For Entrepreneurs For businesses looking to get ahed in the VR and AR world, here are some steps to get you started:  1. Be immersed in the trend Pokémon GO and similar platforms serve as gateways to augmented and virtual reality for most consumers. Reaching nearly 10 million estimated users per day, Pokémon GO is a particularly instructive case study.  Familiarize yourself with the trend so you understand its appeal. You don’t have to directly participate, but you should discuss its appeal with someone who does. At our company, one of our mechanical engineers is a prolific Pokémon GO player, and he has helped our team consider why it has captured so many users. Similarly, as you learn more about the product, discuss what it is about the product that has made it accessible to such a wide range of people. Identify the principles that have contributed to the success of the trend, and apply them to your own business. 2. Create virtual assets Companies that gain an edge in VR today position themselves to be industry leaders. The University of Washington’s CoMotion HQ is capitalizing on the trend by offering VR lab space as part of its new incubator location. The move allows CoMotion to attract forward-thinking clients and link itself with futuristic technologies in the minds of consumers. Consider how you might enhance your brand through virtual assets. Create third-party add-ons for a popular game, offer a virtual tour through your mobile app, or create standalone AR and VR products. After researching AR and VR, we realized that eye-tracking technology could transform intent into action very quickly, so we started looking into that model. What could you do to take your brand in a new direction? The demand for virtual assets is unprecedented in human history, so use this opportunity to shift gears if needed.  3. Establish product superiority Because everyone will be rushing to launch AR and VR products and services, it’s crucial for businesses to differentiate themselves now. Find the market segments where you possess unfair advantages, and capitalize on them. Once we started working with eye-interaction, we found market segments that needed to be able to work quickly with a hands-free input, but using head movements would hurt their necks and talking was cumbersome if they were in quiet areas. Not only are existing companies focusing on AR and VR, but up-and-coming organizations will as well. More than half a million people become new business owners every month, and 27 million working-age Americans are engaged in entrepreneurship. With those numbers, your business can’t afford to sleep on these technologies. Assert your edge, and maintain it at all costs. 4. Always serve the core market Remaining true to your core customers is a critical component of competitiveness and growth. As we develop and advance our technologies, we always ask how it serves our target audience members. Is it responsive to their needs? Does it provide them with a technological advantage or make them more efficient? Is it emotionally satisfying? As you do the same, don’t sacrifice a loyal user base while chasing after AR and VR trends. New assets should reflect the company’s mission and enhance its offerings. 5. Tailor branding to the VR era More than 75 percent of Americans engage with brands online before they make purchases or visit physical stores. As a result, we always make sure our consumers know that they’re buying from a company that offers the newest and best versions of particular products using a combination of PR and content marketing. We travel to conferences, demo our product and interact with consumers and publications all over the country to make sure our software is top of mind. As AR and VR become the norm, people want to see that your company is up to speed. You can certainly incorporate your marketing and brand into virtual worlds, though you should be sure to monitor and respect the attitudes of consumers toward the value of such exposure in virtual and augmented environments. 6. Emphasize innovation Smart companies innovate for the current market with an eye on the future. For instance, many automotive companies are already testing future hardware and software features that will integrate seamlessly into their evolving designs. Because they’re looking ahead, they’ll be able to build new models using existing processes and supply chains instead of starting from scratch. We stay innovative by hiring top talent and looking several technology generations ahead. To do the same, invest in research and development so your company stays a step ahead and is always in a position to develop new products.

The public isn’t going to sit patiently while companies scratch their heads about how to get in on the trend.

One of these pesentations by Martin was concerning 2D X.Org acceleration. Martin basically presented on that rendering 2D on a modern X.Org Server is barely faster than CPU rendering, unless compositing. While being barely faster, it consumes more power than CPU-only rendering. But the good news is that more and more software is moving away from X-based rendering. With the next GTK+ release there will be the GTK Scene Kit, Qt5 already has changed its renderer, and other projects are moving over to purely CPU-based rendering or GPU rendering with projects like Servo's WebRender, Google's Skia, and the new Intel FastUIDraw project. Toolkits and other projects doing their own rendering have also been moving away from X-based rendering in order to support Wayland where they must be responsible for the CPU/GPU rendering free of the old X acceleration architectures. Long story short while X.Org rendering isn't very performant, it's becoming less and less of a problem with modern Linux systems. Those wishing to go through Martin's 2D presentation can see these PDF slides or watch the video embedded below (jump to a little past the 5 hour mark). 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The risk is rated “high,” but the return is also rated “high.” In fact the “Q’s” have an annualized five-year market return of 17.56%, and a three-year return of 16.99%, as of August 31. In the past year they are up over 12%. Another investor benefit is its relatively low expense ratio of 0.2%. In the past year it paid a dividend of $1.24 for a yield just over 1%. The top ten holdings of the Q’s are: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). 9 Dividend Stocks for a Full Calendar of Safe Income In June, following its failure to punch through the resistance line at $111, the Q’s fell on a selling climax to about $102. However it quickly reestablished its up trend by slicing through the former resistance until consolidating at the $114 to $118 area. A quadruple top formed from August to September at $118 until yesterday when it broke out with a continuation gap of 40 cents. Prior to yesterday’s breakout, on-balance volume was positive from after the June low. Then, in late August the first of three CBR Buy signals was triggered from my proprietary indicator, and a new MACD buy was triggered yesterday. Since continuation gaps are usually covered by profit-taking, try to buy this ETF at $118 with a target of $130 for a possible trading return of over 10%. Long-term investors should consider this ETF as a cornerstone investment representing the big-cap technology sector.   Click to Enlarge Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/09/trade-day-powershares-qqq-trust/. ©2016 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 7 Stocks Investors Should Buy From the Scrap Heap Abercrombie & Fitch Is Beyond All Hope Will Apple iPhones Be Made in the USA? 10 Pharma Stocks That Are Prescribed Under Trump 3 Beaten-Down Biotech Stocks to Buy for Huge Gains Why MacBook Pro Fans Are Angry (Again) Comments are currently unavailable.

Credit: Dell More like this Dell to introduce new Wyse thin clients for Windows 8 Dell stops selling Android devices A new computer that defies category Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Dell wants to prove that you don't need a high-end GPU in your computer to create content for virtual reality headsets. Instead, the company wants to move VR content creation into the cloud with new computing products it plans to release. The goal is to add more mobility and security to VR content creation. Among the new products planned are thin clients that run applications stored in remote servers or appliances. The servers will have GPUs that power VR content creation on  virtual desktops. Virtual reality is an interesting market, and Dell will have products to talk about in the future, said Jeff McNaught, executive director of cloud client computing at Dell. Some products provide the linchpin to get the effort started, McNaught said. The company on Thursday released the Latitude E7270 Wyse mobile thin client, which has an Intel Skylake chip and an integrated GPU to handle client-side graphics. The company in May also started shipping the Precision Appliance for Wyse, a 2U rack server that can be packed with Nvidia graphics cards to power content creation on thin clients. As more data moves into the cloud, servers are getting busier processing data. Thin clients are already being used to create engineering applications and animation. It is also possible to deliver VR content over the web with emerging protocols like WebVR, which is under development but has already been integrated into Chrome and Firefox browsers. Dell's Wyse supports virtualization technologies from Microsoft, Citrix, VMware and Teradici. VMware became part of Dell after a recent US$67 billion merger with EMC, but the company will support all virtualization technologies. VR content creation on thin clients via centralized servers has its benefits, McNaught said. The data is secure on servers. Multiple thin client users can access the files on the servers and collaborate on content creation. Dell sells mobile and desktop thin clients with Windows, Linux and ThinOS, which is a proprietary Wyse OS. Thin clients are used in offices, airports, hospitals, classrooms, retail stores, casinos and other locations. Dell has built in local and cloud-based security features into its thin clients. Dell got into thin clients with the acquisition of Wyse Technology for about $600 million in 2012. It was bought as a way to boost Dell's client product portfolio and protect the company from a decline in PC sales. Wyse remains the top thin-client company, but companies like HP have competitive products and proprietary protocols. Other competitors include ClearCube and Ncomputing. Not all of Dell's thin clients have worked out. A failed product was the Cloud Connect, a thumb-sized PC that could plug into TVs. Originally called Project Ophelia, it had an Android OS and an interface and usage model similar to that of tablets. Project Ophelia was an interesting idea but the company didn't sell many of these. Customers wanted more USB ports and video capabilities, McNaught said. Dell has no product similar to Project Ophelia in the pipeline, but is keeping options open.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Lenovo More like this Yoga 3 Pro review: Intel's Core M processor delivers for this hybrid laptop Review: 4 mini-PCs give you full power in a very small package Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch: A lightweight contender Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles If you like the look of Lenovo's recently unveiled Yoga 910 and its 13.9-inch screen but need something a bit lighter, you may want to check out the 14-in. ThinkPad X1 Yoga. Both are convertible touch-screen laptops that fold back to become tablets, but the OLED display on the higher-end model (which is the one I reviewed) is one of the richest and most vibrant screens ever to grace a notebook. And unlike the Yoga 910, it's available right now. I've lived with the X1 Yoga for more than a month and it is one of the best designed and built computers I've ever come across. There are several models available. The entry-level model, which starts at $1,394 (vendor price), comes with a Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage as well as an FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS touchscreen. The test model, which at the time of this writing cost $2,195 (vendor price), comes with a Core i7-6600U processor, an OLED WQHD (2560 x 1440) touchscreen, 16GB of memory and 256GB of storage. (A model with a 512GB drive is also available.) The system has Intel's latest Graphics 520 accelerator along with 128MB of dedicated video memory. The OLED display is very impressive. In my tests, it registered 240 candelas per square meter (Cd/m²) of brightness, which objectively doesn't compare well to some other OLED displays I've tested, such as the one that comes with HP's EliteBook Folio G1, which rated 411 Cd/m². However, while the HP was brighter, the X1 Yoga had the advantage on color richness and saturation -- it delivered rich and vivid images that made most other displays look dull. (Unfortunately, the display also picks up fingerprints faster than a TV detective; I found that I needed to wipe it clean daily.) Laptop to tablet The X1 Yoga's pair of lid hinges allow the display to smoothly rotate 360 degrees. In its "normal" configuration, it's a no-compromises keyboard-centric notebook with a stable screen that doesn't wobble too much when tapped. If you turn the screen around to face the other direction, it becomes a presentation system. You can also fold the screen down in a tent orientation for easy video viewing. Finally, flip the display all the way down over the keyboard, and the X1 Yoga becomes a very useable tablet (although the keyboard and screen portions remain about an eighth of an inch apart and don't lock together into a single unit). I used it as a tablet for taking notes, sketching and watching video on the road and was quite comfortable using it as such -- with one caveat: Measuring 0.7 x 13.1 x 9.0 in. and weighing 2.9 lb., the X1 Yoga is a bit large and heavy to hold and use as a tablet for more than about five minutes. It works much better on a lap or a table top. A top-notch laptop The X1 Yoga has a magnesium alloy chassis surrounded by a carbon fiber case. Its soft rubbery coating feels supple and the X1 Yoga's backlit keyboard (with two brightness settings) is very comfortable to use, with 19mm keys that provide excellent feedback and 2mm of key depth. Lenovo still offers its users two ways to direct the cursor: The system has a smooth 4.5-in. touchpad and a pointing stick located between the G, H and B keys. Its speakers are underneath the system so that when used in traditional notebook orientation, the audio is muffled. The full range of its sound comes out when it's in tablet, tent or presentation mode. It comes with three USB 3.0 ports, a mini DisplayPort, an HDMI port and audio-out port. There's a well-hidden micro-SD card slot next to the left hinge. The X1 Yoga includes a pressure-sensitive stylus that slides into a slot in the system's side, which also charges the stylus in about five minutes. I prefer the stylus set-up of Microsoft's Surface Pro, which lets you start up an app by clicking its top -- still, this is a useful addition. The X1 Yoga includes Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi, but no Ethernet port. One the left side, there is a proprietary OneLink+ connector that works with Lenovo's optional ThinkPad OneLink+ to RJ45 Adapter (which costs about $70 -- Amazon price)  to yield an Ethernet port. The ThinkPad OneLink+ Dock (which runs about $145 -- Amazon price) takes this a step further with ports for Ethernet and audio, as well as a pair of mini DisplayPort connections for multi-screen external video. It also includes four USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 ports. The X1 Yoga has security covered with a fingerprint scanner and a second-generation Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for remote connections. In addition, its processor includes the vPro extensions for manageability and Intel's Trusted Execution Technology (TXT). Test results The X1 Yoga scored a reasonable 2,760 on the PCMark 8 benchmark tests, just ahead of the HP EliteBook Folio G1 touchscreen system, which has a slightly slower M7-6Y75 processor and scored 2,532. [ For specifics about our benchmarks, read: How we test Windows system performance ] While many other recent systems do without a fan, the X1 Yoga does come with one; this is probably why the system never got warmer than 96 degrees Fahrenheit. Its 3,150mAh battery powered the system for four hours and eight minutes as measured by PCMark 8's battery benchmark, which is in the ballpark for similar systems and indicates it should last a full day with normal on-and-off use. When I timed it while continuously playing videos, it ran for six hours and 21 minutes, which will get you through most intercoastal flights. In addition to Windows 10 Pro, the X1 Yoga came with Lenovo's Companion app, which can optimize the system and alert you to out-of-date software. Lenovo's one-year warranty can be extended to three years for a reasonable $109; three years of accidental damage protection adds $49. Bottom line Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Yoga is more than the sum of its parts. It may not be at the top of the heap if you look at the performance, battery life or display numbers by themselves, but in practice, I found it did everything I needed to do and did it well -- and was, in fact, a joy to use. The main problem with the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, however, is its price. For example, compare it to a convertible such as the 15.6-in. Samsung Notebook Spin 7. At the time of this writing, the Lenovo site quoted a price of $2,195 (after an online discount) for a Core i7 system with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and an AMOLED display, while the Samsung site gave a discounted price of $1,100 for a Spin 7 with a Core i7 processor, 16GB RAMM, 1TB HD/126GB SSD storage and a Full HD display. Even bearing other factors in mind (for example, the Samsung is larger and heavier, and comes with Windows 10 Home rather than Pro), that's a considerable gap. However, if you can get somebody to buy it for you -- or if price isn't an issue -- then the ThinkPad X1 Yoga should definitely be on your list. At a Glance ThinkPad X1 Yoga Lenovo Price (reviewed unit): $2,195 (vendor price) Pros: OLED screen with rich, vivid images; thin and lightweight; backlit keyboard; includes stylus; good security features Cons: Expensive when compared to similar systems; doesn't use newer USB-C port; screen doesn't completely lock flat when used as tablet To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Tax and investment incentives for foreign firms, together with low labour costs and high growth markets, have equipped Chengdu with a competitive edge to rival its coastal counterparts Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. This year World Routes makes its return to China as senior network and business development executives, senior airline and airport management, tourism ministers and travel industry specialists, aircraft manufacturers and suppliers and members of the international, national, regional and aviation press will all meet at Century City New International Exhibition & Convention Centre in Chengdu for the 22nd World Route Development Forum. Since Durban last year it has been another constantly changing landacape for the aviation sector mainly due to external factors. The event will, once again, be the place to examine air services, find out about new market developments and get up-to-speed on the up-and-coming destinations. For airlines, airports, tourism authorities and other stakeholders, World Routes is the place to learn, to negotiate, to build relationships and to help shape a business so that it has the competitive edge it needs in the coming years to grow and thrive. This year's host city, Chengdu, is leading the way in the finance and technology sectors, having transformed itself into a leading commercial hub in Asia. Traditionally, coastal cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong have been China’s primary centres for business. Chengdu’s increasing accessibility and dynamic economy have ensured that it is now recognised as a leading centre for foreign investment and development. Tax and investment incentives for foreign firms, together with low labour costs and high growth markets, have equipped Chengdu with a competitive edge to rival its coastal counterparts. The ancient city of Chengdu has always been recognised as a 'land of abundance'. The city’s GDP reached $161.5 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.9% on the previous year, and a growth rate that was 1.1% higher than the national average. Human capital, central government support and development in major sectors such as logistics, finance and technology have contributed to Chengdu’s economic growth. Chengdu has also benefited from £5.3 billion of foreign investment. The city has witnessed substantial economic growth over the past decade, and is now home to more than 270 Fortune 500 companies, including IBM, Intel and Microsoft. The influx of the world’s most profitable companies has created a significant increase in demand for business travel within the region. Committed to consolidating its position as a leading area for foreign investment and business, Chengdu has embraced the concept of connecting the city with new air services. One of the most important frontiers for aviation, the Asia-Pacific region is forecast to lead world traffic by 2030. Much of the growth is predicted to come from the Chinese outbound travel market, which is expected to grow at an annual rate of 11% until 2030. With more than 100 airlines serving 191 destinations and over 250 routes, World Routes 2016 host Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is mainland China’s fourth busiest aviation hub. The capacity of the airport is expected to increase to more than 63 million by 2020 and World Routes will provide delegates with a valuable insight into the significant air service opportunities the region has to offer. Chengdu has already begun to execute a strategy to accommodate this rapid increase in passenger traffic, through the construction of Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, which is expected to be completed in 2019. New infrastructure and air routes have also helped Chengdu to establish itself as a leading investment centre. With a dynamic economy and attractive growth prospects, Chengdu has been classed by the World Bank as a “benchmark city for the investment environment in inland China.” Each year the meetings between airlines and airports at World Routes are set against the economic and political backdrops of our time and once again the forum takes place against a backdrop of uncertainty in the aviation industry. Although airlines are predicted to post their biggest profits for some time, profit per passenger is still significantly less than the likes of Apple make per unit. As the world’s airlines, airports and stakeholders examine the markets they wish to serve, the only certainty we face is one of a constantly changing landscape within which we operate.  But, this is what makes events like this year’s 22nd World Route Development Forum so important to the industry. "With unique features, World Routes 2016 is unprecedented and has a great influence. It has attracted decision makers from world-famous airlines, airports, government organisations and tourism authorities. I sincerely hope that we can meet together here in Chengdu to discuss the strategy of global aviation development and share in the achievement of cooperation and communication," says Li Wei, board chairman, Sichuan Province Airport Group, the parent organisation of Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport. A packed schedule of meetings and profile raising opportunities are the beating heart of this world leading event. The dedicated Routes team are there to ensure that World Routes works for all delegates, making sure that the meeting opportunities, which directly affect route networks, are bigger and broader every year. More than 3,000 delegates from the world’s leading airlines, airports and tourism authorities are expected to attend this year’s World Routes from September 24 to 27, 2016. Alongside the meetings to discuss future air service opportunities, this year’s extensive conference programme will feature the World Routes Strategy Summit, Tourism Summit and Routes Talks. Each will cover a number of global issues affecting the aviation and tourism industries with a host of esteemed speakers and experts presenting. "We’re very grateful to this year’s host, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport and their partners for their dedication and the hard work they have put into delivering this year’s event," said Adrian Newton, group director, aviation & technology, UBM EMEA. "I hope that you will take the time to explore the city, as well as take advantage of the many networking and educational opportunities at World Routes. Thank you for being part of Routes and this dynamic community. I hope you have a very productive few days and enjoy World Routes 2016."

Is this the creepiest use of facial recognition tech yet? Posted Sep 23, 2016 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Scientists get us a step closer to graphene implants Welcome to the future, where you can face search for a live sex webcam performer and be served real-life humans to your telescreen who vaguely resemble the object of your desire within, well, hours depending on how busy the site’s servers are. (The rush of tech reporters trying to satisfy their appetite to see who their own live sex ‘doppelganger’ might be yesterday clearly put a strain on Megacams.me‘s backend after it announced the new feature. On a ‘normal’ day the wait time is, presumably, more likely to be minutes.) The Belgian company behind the live sex search site is not disclosing which tech giant’s algorithms it is using to power the face search feature, given the adult use-case and the latter’s evident lack of desire to be associated with porn. But TechCrunch understands the API in question belongs to Microsoft — namely its Cognitive Services (née Project Oxford) visual image recognition APIs, and specifically its Face API which lets developers add the ability to detect human faces and compare similar ones, organize people into groups according to visual similarity, and identify previously tagged people in images. So, yes, if you build a facial recognition API the porn use-cases will come… Hey there, Developers! Developers! Developers! Pricing for Microsoft’s Face API offers 30,000 free look-ups per month, after which it charges $1.50 per 1,000 transactions, supporting a rate of 10 transactions per second. Megacams would say it is doing the face detection portion itself — using the openCV open source library of machine learning and computer vision software, which was originally developed by Intel. It claims to be the first live sex webcam site to implement face search. “A lot of people watching porn have someone in mind and try to fulfill this fantasy by  finding  a doppelgänger doing porn. Searching for it using textual searches is very hard, that’s where technology comes in. Facial recognition is far more accurate than any textual search could be,” it writes, announcing the feature. The feature requires users to upload a photo of their chosen visage (snapped front on) to be emailed links to similar looking webcam performers shortly thereafter, annotated with a percentage lookie-likie (or not-so-likie) score. “None of the image data is stored by Megacams, we just process it and then it’s then deleted after giving you search results to respect your privacy,” it notes. Of course the feature does not respect the privacy of the webcam performers themselves, whose risk of being outed by someone they know IRL surely rises steeply here — given it is possible to perform a photo search for someone you know in real life to see if they can be found in its database of more than 180,000 webcam performers. (Although whether you could be sure it is the real deal, rather than just a very good doppelgänger, is a whole other question. After all, on the Internet no one knows if you’re the real you or just an impressively studied copy… ) The company says that on average some 5,000 of the performers in its database are simultaneously online at any one time — thereby reducing the odds of coming across a really good likeness vs if they were parsing their entire database. (But presumably they want to drive users to a webcam performer who is logged on for business there and then.) “The face recognition algorithm is trained with cam performer images when they are online, so this algorithm is improving minute after minute,” it adds. Not-so-lookie-likie In the interests of reportage, I tested the feature using a photo of myself and the results were, let’s say, underwhelming on the likeness front. Although interestingly the algorithm appeared to judge my race as Asian or African-American/black based on facial features (I’m actually caucasian). Admittedly the photo I uploaded was intentionally more creepshot than corporate headshot — the former seemed more fitting given the context here: The best match it served was only rated at 47 per cent likeness (below). And, to my eye at least, looked off the mark, although you can kind of see the facial contours the algorithm is matching for…   The image at the top of this post was rated a 41 per cent likeness, and really doesn’t look anything like me IMO. The image below was also rated 41 per cent:   And that was about as close as it got. Every result it served with a likeness under 40 per cent might as well have been randomly selected. Safe to say, if you’re hoping technology can deliver a really impressive likeness of the subobject of your desire, on-demand and in fully articulated human form, you’re probably going to have to wait for face substitution tech to get a whole lot better. And/or hope for huge advances in humanoid robotics. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Megacams.me Overview Megacams is a free and private live sex search engine that allows users to search for your model of choice.

PCIe SSD sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of 33.24 per cent during the period 2016-2020. The likes of Intel, Micron, Samsung, Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba are set to benefit the most as they invest heavily in flash memory technology to provide the biggest, fastest PCIe storage solutions available. The bulk of new sales of PCIe SSDs aren't predicted to be in the enthusiast and consumer market, where the core HEXUS readership interests lie. Instead, researchers think that cloud-based "managed service data centres will be a key driver for market growth". The adoption of PCIe SSDs by such enterprises is expected to help them with the challenge of "lack of availability of constant low latency" storage. Faster SSDs and improved device array architecture can both help to address this issue that Data centre-based businesses are up against. The global PCIe SSD market CAGR over the next few years is rather impressive. The 33.24 per cent figure represents the average of the yearly uptick in sales over the period – not the total increase over the half decade. While Samsung, Micron, and Intel have already invested big in 3D NAND to enhance their product portfolios they will soon be joined at the cutting edge by memory tech development partners Toshiba and SanDisk. The Technavio report also states that Intel will be investing up to $5.5 billion in its China-based flash memory chip plant during the forecast period. Such investment, scale, and competition should help keep the downwards pressure on prices.

In fact one of the more prominent examples of smart glasses would be Google Glass. It boasted an interesting premise and had a lot of potential, although safe to say that the hype has died down somewhat. However Oakley’s is looking to bring back the trend with its Radar Pace smart sunglasses. As you can see in the image above, the sunglasses keeps to Oakley’s signature design which exudes a sporty and futuristic look. However under the hood, there are a pair of removable earphones, a host of sensors which includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer and humidity and proximity sensors, three microphones, and it will also be powered by an Intel chip. Unfortunately unlike the Google Glass which seems to have some augmented reality leanings, there will not be information overlaid on the lenses of the glasses. Instead controls and information will be delivered to the user via Intel’s Read Audio natural language processing technology. Uses will be able to use features like Siri (if you’re on iOS) or Google Voice for Android users. There will be coaching provide so you can be assisted on your workout for that day. Unfortunately the glasses do not come cheap and are priced at $449 and will be available for purchase come 1st of October. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Intel and Wearable Tech.

  You are here: Home > Business > Technology, Media and Telecom GoPro's Karma drone to arrive in China to stir the market 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Daily, September 23, 2016 Adjust font size: GoPro, which makes wearable sports cameras and accessories, recently unveiled its long-awaited consumer drone, aiming to ignite consumers' enthusiasm for distinctive video-making experience. Dubbed Karma, the device is priced at $799.99 and will go on sale in China on October 23. Karma's remote provides a video tutorial that simulates the conditions of flying the drone. [Liu Zheng/chinadaily.com.cn] It features a compact, fits-in-a-small-backpack design and includes an image-stabilizing grip that can be handheld or mounted on vehicles, gear and more. Nick Woodman, founder and CEO, said in an interview that the drone, unveiled together with the company's latest action cameras Hero 5 and Hero 5 Session, is not just a piece of hardware but an end-to-end solution that provides content building and sharing under its own ecosystem. Nick Woodman, founder and CEO of GoPro Inc, unveils Karma during the company's products launch event held on September 19, 2016 in Squaw Valley, California. [Liu Zheng/chinadaily.com.cn] "The more people, whether they own a GoPro or a smartphone, become visual storytellers, the larger our market share will grow," said Woodman. After years of investment boom in the drone sector in China, analysts say newcomers have to create new application scenarios to stimulate people's interest. Jean Xiao, a research manager who tracks drones and virtual reality at IDC China, said the sales of the GoPro drone will increase thanks to the number of GoPro's existing user base and the rise in fans of the brand in the country. "Compared with other quadcopters, the foldable drone has a higher price tag but is easier to handle," said Xiao. "Meanwhile, due to the limitations of the existing technologies in the consumer drone industry, policy regulations, such as flight duration and altitude, will not pose a big challenge to the device." Given the superior price and limited differentiation of the product, Xiao predicts that Karma will face a fierce competition with domestic brands in the country's market. "As performances of drones' CPUs get improved by chipmakers, such as Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia, and also the technology integration with VR and artificial intelligence gets better, the next generation drone will become 'smarter'," she said. Chris Fang, senior client service executive at another consulting company GfK Retail and Technology China Co Ltd, also noted that the launch of Karma will push forward the brand awareness of GoPro in the consumer drone market. He said the removable 3-axis camera stabilizer and Karma Grip, which are shipped with the drone and available for capturing smooth handheld and gear-mounted footages, are creative combination rather than innovations. Staff member of GoPro demonstrates Karma to press after the company's products launch event held on September 19, 2016 in Squaw Valley, California. [Liu Zheng/chinadaily.com.cn] Similar China-made handheld stabilizers have been on the market for several years and have secured a certain number of loyal users from the globe. "The industry is expecting a double-digit growth each year despite a tepid market," said Fang. "Technology bottlenecks such as battery life, facial recognition and obstacle avoidance and regulation uncertainty have all been considered in upcoming solutions." According to Fang, compared with domestic maker Xiaomi's price-oriented product and DJI's tech-centered drone equipped with optic flow sensor, GoPro's own user generated content platform will contribute to its own sales volume and support the brand's business expansion. The existing consumer drone market consists of three segments: aerial photography drones, handy drones with foldable airfoils and entertainment and sports drones. In late May, Beijing-based ZeroTech Intelligence Technology Co Ltd unveiled a pocket drone that specifically focuses on selfie. The product sold more than 10,000 units in the first month after it was launched. Statistics from IDC China's latest report show that in the first quarter of 2016, DJI dominated 70 percent market share of aerial photography drone. More products will make debut and drive the industry's development from variety of perspectives in the near future. After GoPro stepped into the consumer drone sector, more products manufactured by other brands, such as DJI, 3D Robotics and Parrot, are expected to launch new gears in the market. According to Beijing-based iResearch Consulting Group, the value of China's drone industry could rise as high as 75 billion yuan ($11.4 billion) in the next decade. At the end of 2025, the drones will be used largely for aerial photography, farm chemical spraying, forest protection and security, it said, adding that the civilian drone market has grown more than 50 percent in recent years.

Here are some of the top names in the semiconductor sector today. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Sep 22, 2016 at 10:09PM Image source: Getty Images. Much as the steam engine helped power the Industrial Revolution, semiconductors are in many ways the backbone that power today's information revolution. A semiconductor is a microchip that allows any computing device to carry out the instructions a program sets forth. The size of the semiconductor industry should continue to climb with the levels of technology in our daily lives, though the growth won't be evenly distributed. Here's a quick snapshot of some of the world's largest semiconductor companies today. Semiconductor Stock Ticker Symbol Market Cap Intel Nasdaq: INTC $168 Billion Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE: TSM $148 Billion Qualcomm Nasdaq: QCOM $91 Billion Broadcom Nasdaq: AVGO $67 Billion NVIDIA Nasdaq: NVDA $39 Billion NXP Semiconductor Nasdaq: NXPI $27 Billion Infinera  Nasdaq: INFN $1.2 Billion Data source: Google Finance. This is a diverse industry, but for now let's focus on some of the more compelling opportunities for investors in the semiconductor space today. Qualcomm Image source: Qualcomm. I'm a huge fan of Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) business. The two core operating businesses -- Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) -- both play important roles in driving the performance of this semiconductor stock. QCT, the chip business, dominates revenue production, having generated between 68% and 71%  of Qualcomm's total sales in each of the past three fiscal years. If you're familiar with Qualcomm's products, it's probably through one of the names that come from QCT -- its Snapdragon processor, which powers mobile devices produced by a wide range of OEMs, including Samsung, HTC, BlackBerry, Microsoft, and many others. The QTL division, meanwhile, produces a disproportionate amount of the company's operating profits. Thanks to its high-margin structure, it has accounted for 87% of Qualcomm's earnings before taxes in each of its past three fiscal years. This division is the straw that stirs Qualcomm's financial drink, and its outlook remains largely positive, thanks to the company's trove of patents relating to the foundational connectivity technologies that power 3G and 4G wireless devices. This potent financial engine helps make Qualcomm a powerhouse in terms of both earnings and dividend growth, making it worthy of serious consideration for income-oriented tech investors. As just one of many impressive dividend stats, Qualcomm has averaged 25% annual dividend growth over the past three years alone. Little wonder this company stands as one of the top semiconductors stocks on the market today. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA It's easy to look at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) soaring stock price over the past several years -- up over 235% in the past two years alone -- and conclude that you missed the boat. However, NVIDIA's exposure to several long-term secular growth categories makes that unlikely to be the case. Considered a sleepy second fiddle to the biggest makers of mobile chips a few years ago, NVIDIA has skated where the figurative puck was heading in its industry. The company's high-end graphics processing chips have benefited from the rise of video-game trends such as multi-player online games and e-sports, and they'll probably continue to do so. This part of its business alone has led to impressive double-digit revenue growth in the gaming segment over the past several quarters. Yet that only scratches the surface of this top chip stock. The kind of graphics processing in which NVIDIA specializes is well positioned for emerging growth industries within technology. One such application is deep learning and artificial intelligence. For example, teaching a computer to recognize images of an item requires the ability to process those images, a task for which NVIDIA's graphics semiconductors are ideally suited. This kind of graphics-heavy AI functionality will serve as a cornerstone for other growth verticals involving image recognition, such as self-driving cars, speech recognition and translation, and medical imaging, to name just a few. It's for this reason analysts see NVIDIA's earnings per share growing at an average annual clip of 23.7% over the next five years. So while its forward P/E ratio of 33 isn't cheap, NVIDIA's place at the epicenter of several large tech growth markets still makes it one of the top tech stocks you can buy today. Image source: NXP Semiconductor. NXP Semiconductor With NXP Semiconductor's (NASDAQ:NXPI) stock essentially flat since its March 2015 merger announcement with Freescale Semiconductor, you might think the market isn't enamored with the Internet-of-Things play. But you'd be wrong. True, NXP Semiconductor's most recent quarterly report revealed some softness in demand for its various chips. NXP chief Rick Clemmer cited an "increased sense of caution" among the company's customers, and it bears reiterating that key NXP customers such as Apple are undergoing their own cyclical product sales slowdowns. Apple in particular is seeing its quarterly sales contract for the first time in 13 years. Taking the longer view, though, it's easy to see how NXP Semiconductor's potent combination of its leadership position across several core product categories and its long-term growth potential will translate into continued growth for its shareholders. Case in point: NXP Semiconductor stock currently trades at 27 times its trailing-12-month earnings, which is reasonable given that its average profit growth over the next five years is forecast at an astounding 27%. Perhaps the rise in the Internet of Things was somewhat overhyped in 2014-15, but as long as the trend continues to grow, NXP Semiconductor figures to benefit tremendously.

Some are forecasting a future full of security compromises, embarrassments, and even liability claims. Others say that view is an overreaction. They are convinced that our networked devices can be separated and locked down. I believe that if we don’t educate ourselves and practice diligence, the first opinion is eventually more likely to be more correct than the second. In this Byte-Sized Lesson, I’ll elaborate on why I hold this view. AV devices are evolving quickly. Ten or 15 years ago: ● AV devices were each essentially fixed functions and never needed to be upgraded. ● None, or almost none, were connected to an Ethernet/IP network or the Internet. ● You needed to be physically present at the device in order to configure or manage the device. However, today, any or all of these statements could be false about a typical AV device. Today’s AV systems are more often embedded devices using an embedded operating system (OS). According the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers), an embedded system is a computer system built into a larger device that usually has a specialized purpose. Encoders, transcoders, gateways and signal processors fit this definition nicely. There are two essential components here—the embedded processor and the operating system. The best way to understand their role is to consider examples. Toshiba, Intel, Analog Devices, and many more companies make embedded devices. One of them, ST Microelectronics, is a multi-billion dollar manufacturer of embedded microcontrollers. Some of these are used in the audio industry. According to Michael Markowitz, their STM-32 microcontroller family has a very large market share with support for several operating systems. They recently added STSAFE-A100, a capability with built-in authentication, secure communication, and key provisioning. Remote communications is secured with TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is used across the computer industry. There are dozens of embedded operating systems. Just a few of these include Android, Ubuntu Touch, Windows CE, and Yocto Linux. VXWorks, used by AMX, is an embedded OS that is widely used across several industries. It features a full TCP/IP stack, FAT compatible file system (like USB sticks), a firewall, mobile IP, a C+ compiler, and other features commonly found in Windows, Linux and Apple computer systems. Therefore, like any other computer system, it must be configured and managed properly to be secured. Prysm, a manufacturer of large displays and collaboration solutions, focuses on the security of the content and video that is exchanged among participants. They use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which is widely accepted as very secure. Paul Harris, of Aurora Multimedia Systems, said that their transceivers are based on commonly available embedded systems. However, Harris suggests that device developers should not follow the embedded system manufacturer’s reference design. That design is often published, making the system more vulnerable. So, what does this all mean for the AV industry? First, I don’t think we are at a point where security of our devices is currently critical. Most Linux or Linux-derived devices are thought to be lower priority targets for hackers. However, Linux is rapidly growing in popularity. So the target is getting larger. I believe we must: ● Continue to educate ourselves about computer and network security. Our ignorance is the hacker’s best friend. ● Make security of our AV devices a high priority, on par with the security of our pcs and business systems. ● Expect AV device manufacturers to make security a dominant design criterion. The IT industry is watching development in the AV industry. A spokesperson for Symantec, a leading vendor of IT security products, already has subsections focused on embedded devices in medical, aerospace and industrial control. As the AV industry evolves, you can expect companies like Symantec to appear. Phil Hippensteel, PhD, teaches information systems at Penn State Harrisburg.

But it’s worth taking a look at what we still don’t know.  Were there two breaches? For around two months, a hacker known as Peace has been selling what is advertised as breach data on 200 million Yahoo accounts.  ADVERTISEMENT Peace is one of the most trusted names in the dubious business of selling gigantic databases of user data. Peace is where the dark web goes to buy 360 million accounts from Myspace, 170 million from LinkedIn, or 70 million from Twitter.  In August, Yahoo told Motherboard it was ‘aware’ of the purported sale of its accounts.  When rumors started circulating on Thursday that Yahoo was going to announce that hundreds of millions of accounts had been breached, most people within the security community assumed that had to refer to Peace.  But, though Yahoo has not said it directly, it seems like breach it announced might be unrelated to Peace. Peace claimed his 200 million account list for sale is from around 2012, Yahoo announced a breach of 500 million names from 2014 from an international actor - not a dark web hustler.  It is not beyond the shady world of dark web sales for vendors to sell fake lists. Peace, however, is a particularly well trusted vendor.  Just how many breaches were there? And if Yahoo is right and a nation-state did breach its systems, how does Peace fit in? What does this mean for Verizon’s purchase of Yahoo? The breach comes at an interesting time. Verizon announced a $4.8 billion deal to purchase Yahoo around the time Peace’s sales of Yahoo credentials became widely known. Yahoo has not said whether it found out about the breach before the deal was announced. With a deal that has not been finalized, and reports in the Washington Post that Yahoo only let Verizon know about the legitimacy of the breach two days ago, there’s a very real chance that the price for the sale will plummet with Yahoo stock.  “As law enforcement and regulators examine this incident, they should investigate whether Yahoo may have concealed its knowledge of this breach in order to artificially bolster its valuation in its pending acquisition by Verizon,” said Sen. Richard BlumenthalRichard BlumenthalEffort to allow federal government to discriminate in the name of religion must not prevail Facebook under pressure to stop fake news Overnight Tech: Tech industry's message to Trump | Busy week for Congress | Google, Facebook take heat over fake news MORE (D-Conn.) in his statement about the attack. How does this affect data breach notification laws?  Blumenthal worried about more than Yahoo artificially bolstering its valuation. He also noted “If Yahoo knew about the hack as early as August, and failed to coordinate with law enforcement, taking this long to confirm the breach is a blatant betrayal of their users’ trust. E-mail accounts can be a trove of sensitive personal information.” He was not the only one. Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerOvernight Tech: Lawmakers dig into internet security | FCC drops agenda items | Twitter cracks down on alt right | Intel shakeup Shakeup on Senate Intel: Warner becomes top Dem The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Va..) also said he was “troubled” by the time it took for Yahoo to announce the breach in his written statement. “Action from Congress to create a uniform data breach notification standard so that consumers are notified in a much more timely manner is long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to work together to pass this essential legislation.” Data breach notification laws are currently a mishmash of 47 wildly differing state regulations - Alabama, New Mexico and South Dakota have no notification laws. The industry and consumer groups have advocated for a strong, consistent national plan. There is a chance Yahoo might have spurred Congress into action. What was the point? Yahoo may be the only company for whom a breach of 500 million accounts can be met with such a sense of “so what” – just try a quick Twitter search for “who still uses Yahoo”. Savvy, and even not-so-savvy consumers moved on from Yahoo to Google years ago. But remember this: The head of the CIA used AOL for email until at least last year.  Taking Yahoo at their word that the breach was orchestrated by a state actor, 500 million accounts serve up a vast number of intelligence gathering opportunities, including, inevitably, at least a few people with direct access to information with security consequences.   The point of the attack does not have to be the content of emails – it could easily be email accounts and connections to use for phishing attacks. Newsmakers are prone to open files sent to them by Katie Couric, Yahoo news anchor, in emails referring to past conversations. It does not have to be to siphon information actively used accounts – it could easily be data never deleted from accounts people long forgot about. It does not even need to be about the 500 million accounts. Yahoo is required under various state and international laws to notify users of the breach. It is not required to notify the public about siphoning of intellectual property (as China is believed to have done with Google during a 2010 attack also believed to involve tampering with dissident email accounts) or notify the public about that a foreign actor checked which accounts had been served warrants - and therefore, which agents might be compromised (as a foreign actor did in a 2010 Microsoft breach).  Why didn’t Yahoo have people reset their passwords as soon as they were aware of Peace?  Even Peace is confused why Yahoo waited on changing their passwords after they knew that 200 million credentials might be for sale. He told Motherboard “well [explitive] them… [W]ell better for me they dont do password reset.”  Tags Richard Blumenthal, Mark Warner   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | September 24, 2016 -- 12:19 GMT (05:19 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Chromebooks could be on sale for under $100 during Black Friday 2016. With the rise of online shopping, Black Friday has lost a bit of its luster -- or insanity, depending on your point of view. But despite Amazon extending the shopping holiday to the whole month of November, and Cyber Monday rivaling its brick-and-mortar predecessor, Black Friday deals remain the focal point for the Christmas buying season, complete with the type of speculation usually reserved for NFL and Academy Award predictions. So what do deal prognosticators envision while they wait for the first Black Friday ads to leak? As you might expect, most of the focus is on doorbusters, those limited time, limited quantity mega-sales that draw headlines and frenzied shoppers. What you might notice in the PC realm, however, is that we've nearly reached a floor on what can be charged with laptops and top-tier tablets. For instance, while a site like BestBlackFriday.com can predict no-name Android tablets could cost as little as 5 bucks, you still won't see an aging iPad mini 2 for less than $149. Of course, the stinginess of discounts on Apple products has only increased over the years -- the company's stores don't even bother to have Black Friday specials anymore after giving out iTunes cards instead of discounts for the previous couple of years -- and that hasn't been helped by the trend of offering store gift cards in lieu of dropping the everyday price. Still, it seems like the iPad Air 2 -- now its "mid-sized" tablet model between the mini and the iPad Pro -- is the most likely to see its price slashed, according to DealNews. In fact, BestBlackFriday expects that you might be able to find it for $299 this Black Friday, or $50 less than its best price last year. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows Also expected is a repeat of Amazon offering its cheapest Fire tablet for chump change, possibly even cheaper than the $33.33 it sold it for during the company's Prime Day in July. Deal sites predict an approximate 20%-25% discounts on tablets in general, with even larger deals on older tablets that remain unsold as the market for the device has dipped. Those tablets might look especially enticing when retailers list their original price to boost the supposed discount (a staple of Black Friday pricing trickery), so make sure to see what the tablet has been actually selling for before getting too excited. Last year, $95 Chromebooks set the pace for the lowest-priced laptops of Black Friday, Deal pundits expect the $90 Chromebook doorbuster trend to continue this year. Obviously you'll get one with the lowest specs possible (2GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, non-Intel processor), but Google's intent with the Chromebook design was to minimize the need for a laptop with powerful components, so that might not be a deal-breaker for buyers. For the last couple of Black Fridays, the expectation has been that Windows notebooks would break the $100 barrier, after Microsoft decided it should lower the price of some licenses of the operating system to compete with tablets and Chromebooks. That hasn't really happened -- though refurbished minimally spec'd smaller-sized two-in-ones could be an exception -- and predictions are more reasonably set for $150 laptops for this Black Friday. Though desktops have fallen out of fashion enough that they don't even warrant much speculation, you can expect similar pricing for the lowest cost mini-PCs. If you're looking for a system with a little more heft spec-wise, however, prognosticators say you're more likely to get a better deal on Cyber Monday, since the prices on those models won't be as eye-poppingly low. Just be careful that the retailers are not stating the original price as "market value," which tends to be higher than what it was selling for in the weeks before Black Friday and is bumped up to increase the discount percentage. (Dell did this last year, for example.) And, again, don't look to Apple itself if you want a new MacBook or iMac on sale for Black Friday--you'll have better luck at retailers like Best Buy, B&H, Frys, and MacMall, where a MacBook Air could cost as little as $700 and an iMac for $950. We could be less than a month away from the first major Black Friday ad to leak (as this handy chart of past ads leak suggests), with big guns like Best Buy and Walmart seeing their ads pop up online a couple of weeks before the shopping date (November 25).

A Kaspersky Labs report indicates that using biometric data as a replacement for a password or PIN at an ATM is not only already in the process of being hacked by cybercriminals, but the potential downside of a person having their biometrics stolen is much more severe than losing a username or password. The first test running biometric scanners on ATM started about a year ago, but Kaspersky has found for sale on the Dark Web 12 sellers of devices allegedly capable of stealing fingerprints. In addition, the research has located evidence that three other groups or individuals are working on a way to steal data from palm print and iris recognition systems. “The problem with biometrics is that unlike passwords or pin codes, which can be easily modified in the event of compromise, it is impossible to change your fingerprint or iris image,” said Olga Kochetova, security expert at Kaspersky Lab told SCMagazine.com in an email. “Thus, if your data is compromised once, it won't be safe to use that authentication method again. Kochetova went on to describe the potential loss of biometric data as the type of threat the cybersecurity industry has never yet experienced. However, the potential problems posed by depending upon biometrics for security are not stopping other industries from implementing this technology. A collaboration between Intel, Lenovo, PayPal and Synaptics is attempting to accelerate biometric adoption through the use of the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance standard. FIDO's mission is to develop technical specifications that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce the reliance on passwords to authenticate users. Lenovo announced on Sept. 23 it will begin including FIDO biometric authentication in its laptops that will enable customers to use a finger swipe to authorize payments with FIDO-supported services like PayPal.  The first such equipped product will be Lenovo's Yoga 910 convertible. These computers will combine Intel's 7th generation processors, known as Kaby Lake, with the company's Software Guard Extensions along with Synaptic's Natural ID fingerprint sensor that includes TLS 1.2 encryption and that firm's Natural ID Fingerprint Solution software.

Current Mac computers feature graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia, which is the leading manufacturer of high-end graphics chips used in gaming machines, hasn’t been an option for multiple generations of computer models from Cupertino, California-based Apple. Nvidia, in a job ad for a software engineer, said a successful applicant will “help produce the next revolutionary Apple products.” The role would require “working in partnership with Apple” and writing code that will “define and shape the future”’ of graphics-related software on Macs.

All three job listings for the Santa Clara, California-based company cite software development for the Mac, while one specifies an Nvidia Mac graphics driver team, pointing to the potential of Nvidia chipsets returning to the Apple computers. Nvidia and Apple both declined to comment. Graphics chips from Nvidia and Sunnyvale, California-based AMD are increasingly important as computer users take on tasks, like 3D graphics editing, that need faster processing. Virtual reality, which requires the highest-level of graphics processing, and artificial intelligence workloads, such as computer vision and voice recognition, can also benefit from the latest chips. Most Apple machines rely on lower-power graphics that are integrated into the processor from Intel Corp. Graphics chips, which supply more performance, are usually available as optional extras in Apple computers. A return to orders from Apple would help cement Nvidia’s leadership in graphics. While Nvidia still dominates in market share, new chips from AMD have been winning orders from some computer makers. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In a blog post published Friday by Elcomsoft, a Russian company that makes software to help law enforcement agencies access data from mobile devices, researcher Oleg Afonin showed that changes in the way local backup files are protected in iOS 10 has left backups dramatically more susceptible to password-cracking attempts than those produced by previous versions of Apple’s operating system. Specifically, the company found that iOS 10 backups saved locally to a computer via iTunes allow password-cracking tools to try different password combinations at a rate of 6,000,000 attempts per second, more than 40 times faster than with backups created by iOS 9. Elcomsoft says this is due to Apple implementing a weaker password verification method than the one protecting backup data in previous versions. That means that cops and tech-savvy criminals could much more quickly and easily gain access to data from locally-stored iOS 10 backups than those produced by older versions. Being a company known for breaking into iPhones, Elcomsoft unsurprisingly did not disclose the vulnerability to Apple before publishing its blog. But CEO Vladimir Katalov told Motherboard that his company responded to Apple’s security team after it requested more information about the bug through the company’s online support system early Friday morning. “Apple is definitely aware they have implemented [the flaw] themselves :)” Katalov told Motherboard in an email. An Apple spokesperson confirmed that the company is working on a fix. “We're aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update,“ the spokesperson said in a statement. “This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” The flaw could be a huge boon for law enforcement, spies, and sophisticated criminals who are able to gain possession of a victim’s iOS backup file. While iOS devices themselves are known for having fairly solid security backed by a hardware module called the Secure Enclave, one of the remaining avenues of attack is to trigger a device to backup either to iCloud or a local computer, where data enjoys far less protection. Normally, local backups are protected by a user’s password. But in iOS 10, Apple has implemented a weaker hashing algorithm—a function used to verify and store passwords in an unrecognizable format. This allows police and hackers to more easily “brute force” the backup file’s password by having a piece of forensics software guess millions of different passwords per second until it finds one that matches the stored hash. Using an Intel i5 processor, Elcomsoft says it was able to guess passwords on iOS 10 backups 2,500 times faster than using the same hardware against an iOS 9 backup. That same processor was still 40 times faster than using a top-of-the-line graphics processor to brute force passwords on backups created by iOS 9. (Elcomsoft doesn’t support GPU-based password cracking yet on iOS 10, but it should increase the speed even more once it becomes available.) When compounded with lists of commonly-used passwords, Elcomsoft says the amount of time it takes to crack an iOS 10 backup’s password can be reduced even further. Once an attacker has unlocked the backup, they can gain complete access to the device’s data in its saved state—including the keychain, a file that’s normally impossible to retrieve from the physical device which stores all the user’s logins and passwords. For its part, Apple at least seems interested in issuing a fix. But given the various pieces of software involved, it remains unclear how long it would take to roll out. “The fix itself is probably not so easy, because that hash might be used for some other purposes we are not aware of,” Katalov told Motherboard in an email. “So I guess that not just iOS update is needed, but also iTunes update as well, and probably some changes to the backup format.” UPDATE: Sept. 23, 5:50 p.m. ET: This story has been updated to include Apple's statement. Also, a previous version of this article mentioned rainbow tables as a method for determining a backup file's password, however rainbow tables would in fact not be usable in this case.

/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed changes to its SBIC Early Stage Program, a feature of the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program.  SBA has proposed a number of regulatory changes that seek to broaden access to the Early Stage Program and strengthen the impact of SBIC's on early stage small businesses. SBA has introduced regulatory changes based on extensive consultation with SBIC Program stakeholders and experts in the early stage investment industry as part of SBA's advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning its SBIC Early Stage Program published in the Federal Register in March 2015.  The major changes include: Allow Early Stage SBIC applicants to apply to the program on a rolling basis.  Allow existing Early Stage SBIC applicants to apply for a subsequent fund. Allow Early Stage SBICs to utilize a line of credit subject to certain terms without SBA's prior approval.  Increase maximum leverage from $50 million to $75 million. These proposed changes are open to public comment for 30 days. To submit comments on the proposed changes to SBA's Early Stage Program, please visit https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=SBA-2015-0002-0009.  For additional information, visit SBA's website at www.sba.gov/inv/earlystage. About the Small Business Investment Company Program The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program is a multi-billion dollar, government-sponsored investment fund created in 1958 to bridge the gap between entrepreneurs' need for capital and traditional sources of financing. SBA invests long-term capital in privately-owned and managed investment firms licensed as Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). Once capitalized, SBICs make debt and equity investments in some of America's most promising small businesses, helping them grow. Since the program was created in 1958, over $80 billion has been invested, helping finance 170,000 American small businesses, including companies like COSTCO, Amgen, Apple, FedEx, Staples, Intel, and Tesla.  About the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA was created in 1953 and since January 13, 2012, has served as a Cabinet-level agency of the federal government to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small businesses, to preserve free competitive enterprise and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation.  SBA helps Americans start, build and grow businesses.  Through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations, SBA delivers its services to people throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. www.sba.gov Release Number: 16-69 Contact: Tiffani S.

Anthony Mirhaydari The Fiscal TimesSeptember 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share It's feeling like 1999 again. The Clintons are in the headlines. Everyone is enamored with new technologies (VR, autonomous vehicles, robotics). And the sluggish pace of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve is growing a nice bubble in financial markets. Investors don’t see any more attractive options for their money, so stocks keep chugging ahead. Never mind a corporate earnings recession now in its sixth quarter. Never mind the outright contraction in manufacturing activity. Never mind disappointing GDP growth. Or the recent slowdown in job gains. After the Fed delivered its "no hike" policy decision on Wednesday just as Wall Street wanted, we're back to the races. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has surged to new highs for two straight days. At the same time, investors are shunning boring areas of the market like consumer staples. That could be a problem, as I'll explain. Related: Will Our Rotten Politicians Kill This Bull Market?  First, let's revel in the areas moving higher. The Nasdaq gapped over the 5,300 level on Thursday, breaking out of a three-month sideways channel that's capped a two-year flirtation with resistance near the 5,200 level. The index is in clear air now and well above the dotcom bubble high of 5,132. The stocks driving the move are the who's who of big-tech investing. Facebook (FB) looks ready to jump above $132 a share to a record, up more than 650 percent from its post-IPO low of $17.55 set in 2012. Amazon (AMZN) shares appear to be riding one of its newfangled delivery drones higher and higher, soaring above the $800 level for the first time. Alphabet (GOOGL) is making a run at $820. Even Apple (AAPL) is on the mend, as interest in the iPhone 7 has transcended the underwhelming initial reaction to its unveiling. Shares are up about 25 percent from their May low. AMZN ChartMore AMZN data by YCharts Old guard tech stocks are playing along too. Microsoft (MSFT) is closing in on its record high set in August thanks to the announcement of a bigger dividend and a new share buyback program. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has returned to levels not seen since 2000, up 20 percent since May, thanks to reports of rebounding PC demand and inventory restocking. Even tech turnaround plays like Yahoo! (YHOO) and HP (HPQ) have been climbing higher. Related: Theft of 500 Million Yahoo Accounts Is the Biggest Single Hack Ever Yet other areas of the market are being left in the dust. Cyclical sectors like financials, materials and energy are being ignored. Retail is in the tank. And defensive areas like consumer staples are underperforming. No wonder then that, while the superstars in the Nasdaq are riding high, broader measures of the stock market such as the NYSE Composite Index are well below record levels. The index is down about 4 percent from highs seen in May 2015 and is trading at levels first reached in the summer of 2014. The result is a dangerous narrowing of market breadth that's creating a sense the move in big-tech is all about momentum and chasing returns, not about reasoned investments in future earnings growth — classic, late-stage bull market behavior, but the sort that is very risky for those that don't realize the broader context of these moves. If you want to chase the rise in tech, be aware these are trades; this environment isn't conducive to buy-and-hold thinking. At least, not unless buyers quickly broaden their interest to stocks outside the tech sector. Related: Record Number of Americans Have $5 Million to Invest Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader notes that the Nasdaq was alone in setting a new high on Wednesday, with the other major averages all closing more than 1 percent below their own highs — the first time this has happened to such a degree since 1999. Going back 40 years, the historic result has typically been some near-term weakness (the S&P 500 managed to rise in only two of six occurrences two weeks later) before the enthusiasm spread to other areas and the market gains become more broad-based. Turning back to consumer staples stocks, Goepfert finds that less than 20 percent of shares in that area have been trading above their 50-day moving averages, a sign of just how forlorn these names are. Since the bull market began, such a thing has only happened two times before: in June 2010 and in August 2011. The good news is that both times marked a low for staples stocks. The moral of the story: Unless stocks like Coca-Cola (KO) and Wal-Mart (WMT) perk up soon and follow the lead of tech favorites like Amazon, it could be a sign that the Fed's latest stock market bubble has entered its terminal, and most dangerous, stage.

Developed by Relic Entertainment™ for Windows PC and set in Games Workshop®’s grimdark fantasy universe, Dawn of War II is a compelling combination of RTS and RPG gameplay. Driven by an innovative campaign narrative steeped in the lore of Warhammer 40,000 armies, technologically advanced warriors wage brutal war against remorseless enemies in a series of addictively fast-paced and visceral combat missions. It’s the 41 st Millennium in the sub-sector Aurelia, a cluster of worlds on the edge of the Milky Way, where a battle of epic proportions is about to begin. As a newly promoted Force Commander of the Blood Ravens chapter, it is your privilege to lead crack squads of Space Marines into battle against the forces of Orks, Tyranids and Eldar that threaten the Imperium of Man. Chaos Rising takes place one year after the events of Dawn of War II, and is set on Aurelia, long-lost home world of the Blood Ravens. Players once again take command of the Blood Ravens in order to free the planet from the forces of Chaos. Retribution takes place ten years after Chaos Rising and presents a new threat to the Imperium of Man in which players may command any one of six races in a campaign that ranges across all the planets of sub-sector Aurelia. In addition to their imaginative single-player campaigns, all three games feature highly-accomplished multiplayer in which players can either plunge into skirmish mode or team up with others in The Last Stand™, a cooperative survival mode.    “We're delighted to be bringing such enduringly popular games to Mac and Linux,” said David Stephen, Managing Director of Feral Interactive, “Their quality and appeal have more than stood the test of time and it’s a privilege to introduce them to a new audience.” Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II will be available through Steam, the Feral Store and other online stores for $19.99/£14.99/€19,99.

This isn’t about Target vs. Wal-Mart or Suicide Squad’s terrible reviews vs. Suicide Squad’s global box office haul. This post is about an entirely different version of the quality vs. quantity discussion. A friend of mine, James Andrews, who is CEO of Smashd, posed a question on Facebook earlier this year, asking what marketing trends people expect to see in 2017. One of the early comments was about the anticipation of greater focus on quality moving forward. I agree with this sentiment, but also believe that this push toward greater quality will take root in the way startups are measured, too. What I see happening right now in the venture capital business, both with private startups or with public companies that relied on VC dollars to grow, is a growing and perpetual lack of concern for quality if the quantities are right. Meaning: if user growth is rapid and revenue is steadily increasing, investors are routinely showing disregard for whether or not companies are doing the right thing. In the cases of Twitter, Snapchat and Airbnb, those decisions are coming back to hurt them. Related 'Experiences' Startup Besomebody Is Moving to Boston From Austin See, late last month, Snapchat pushed out yet another new filter that led to renewed tweets and Medium posts calling the company racist and offensive. While the unicorn said the filter was inspired by anime (similar to how their April 20th filter that was "inspired by" Bob Marley), many people including Katie Zhu, a product manager for the popular blogging platform Medium, called bullshit. Let me ask you something: is anyone really surprised? No. Twitter, another tech darling of the past decade, has had very well-publicized bouts with discrimination internally. First it was the lack of female representation on its board prior to their appointment of Marjorie Scardino in 2013 in the leadup to their I.P.O. Later came chronicled exits of black employees. A year ago, all any investor could seem to talk about was whether or not Twitter will ever grow quickly again to increase its stock price. In 2016, some began to wonder whether a climate of harassment and vitriol was keeping users away. As if on cue, alt-right Twitterati launched a campaign of harassment against celebrity comedian Leslie Jones, who quit the service very publicly (and temporarily). Twitter is waking up to the quality problem. In August it rolled out plans to introduce a quality filter. Then there’s Airbnb, the hospitality industry disruptor, that is facing the most significant hit to its reputation as a company in what had previously been a largely positive wave of praise on its way to a reported $30 billion valuation. The reason? A number of black users have experienced discrimination by hosts who are less inclined to offer their apartments and homes to people of color. So much for sharing and belonging, right? Airbnb's near-term solution of hiring former Attorney General Eric Holder to help address the problem seems sound, but also less likely to fix the underlying issue at the source (the product itself as Nextdoor realized) than would, say, hiring black engineers and product managers. But perhaps the investors who are about to pour the next $1 billion into the company at a whopping $30 billion valuation don't take the issue as seriously as its CEO. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and US Commerce Sec'y Penny Pritzker at GES 2016 Money isn’t lost if they’re jerks. Money isn’t lost if you’re late to address a major issue. Money is lost if they aren’t growing. Nice guys finish last in Startupland, according to the ongoing and vibrant action of tech industry investors. That is the message that is being sent over and over again to tech startup founders, whether you’re Jack Dorsey hiring a white man to run your diversity and inclusion efforts or you’re Evan Spiegel at Snapchat who, unlike Airbnb’s Brian Chesky, has not called his company’s discriminatory practices (or filters) the most challenging issue facing his company today. How fast are you growing? What’s your recurring revenue run rate? How many monthly users do you have? What is your annual revenue forecast for this fiscal year? Many of the most important metrics in business, the technology industry in particular, are focused on the quantitative attributes of a company. It’s understandable. Successful businesses need to grow their customer bases, their monthly users and their bottom lines. But what about quality?  Very few are nearly as adept at predicting the value of quality-driven metrics.  If Uber gets in a fight with a major city’s government officials, exhibits what many of those officials believe to be asshole behavior then leaves the city (as it has in Austin), does that have implications on the quality of the technology or on the quantity of users and revenue potential? Perhaps investors don’t mind this happening in a city of just a million residents like Austin, but what if it happened in Paris or New York? Would that merit investor concern or a valuation adjustment? Or if Airbnb has highly-publicized issues with discrimination against a segment of its customers as it has with black users in America, is that a factor of the marketplace’s quality or quantity? What happens if those discrimination concerns are coming from the gay community or French people or females? Does that give investors confidence in the company focused on belonging? These occurrences and these questions should matter to you if you're a founder or startup investor or even if you work for a tech company. The industry today trains itself - the investors, the media, the employees - to be highly skilled at gauging the potential of a startup on quantitative aspects like user growth and revenue. Very few are nearly as adept at predicting the value of quality-driven metrics. Twitter investors who bought in at the company's $45-a-share IPO pop are understandably frustrated with its plummet to less than half that number. Would a better understanding of quality have helped them spot its problems earlier? Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Credit Bloomberg Media Source We may find out as transparency in business grows. Just look at the growing wave of criticism against tech companies and their lack of diversity since Intel, Apple, Amazon and others began publishing their hiring statistics. Hiring political figures like Eric Holder only goes so far. Eventually these companies - startups, even - will actually need to find a repeatable process that helps them consider quality over quantity. This, as it turns out, will help them recruit people of color, provide equal pay and promotion opportunities to women and stop being assholes in general. Of course, the tech industry wants you to believe this is simply a case of a few bad apples. That would be a lie. When these “bad apples” have as much business ownership as a senior executive at Uber or as much product leadership as the people who choose the filters at Snapchat, there is plenty evidence that this offensive behavior goes largely unpunished by investors who fuel the industry. And it all starts by placing as much focus on quality as quantity, and - in some instances - even more focus on quality if the quantity is lacking. Today, everything we’re seeing in the business community, be it ethical manufacturing or diversity in recruiting and leadership, points to a growing role for quality (alongside quantity) on the success of companies. The tech industry may be living in its own bubble of sorts, thanks to the continued success of Facebook, Uber, Airbnb and others, but that bubble will pop if enough users continue to feel like this is perpetually breaking the one rule Google was smart enough to deploy as its motto: don’t be evil. Why does a tech company need to tell the public it won't be evil? Because a successful tech company - Google, Apple, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb - can transform an entire industry, people's lives and their behaviors. So if your company is racist or sexist or has a few bad apples in prominent positions, that behavior may just seep out into the mainstream via an apartment for rent or a Snapchat filter. Quantity is about repeatable processes. Good news in knowing how to measure for it is that you scale more quickly by doing the thing that worked over and over again. Hire another white male engineer. Ignore another complaint from a black user or customer. We’re still growing so who cares, right? Bad news is you lack diversity because your business relies on duplicating and building on the past rather than constantly seeking out what's new. You miss opportunities to build bridges with city officials. You miss signals from underrepresented employees and users. You miss out on future growth with customers you don’t presently have. There's no filter for failure, but if success looks like a continued disregard for people, then I hope this is what they meant when they said "fail fast."

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Titanfall 2 PC requirements point to a smooth experience by Eric Frederiksen  9:00 AM on September 23, 2016 Titanfall 2 is still just short of a month away, but details are starting to come out about what we can expect from our gaming rigs while running the game. Of course, it's still up to Respawn Entertainment to get the game out the door in working condition, but the developer has revealed what kinds of systems players will want to be running on to run the game at not only minimum and recommended specs, but also to pull 60 FPS at 4K resolution. Regardless of what hardware you're running, you'll need 45GB of storage available, DirectX 11, and Windows 7 or later. Here are the full specs: Minimum CPU: Intel Core i3-6300T or equivalent RAM: 8GB GPU: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 660 2GB or AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB Recommended CPU: Intel Core i5-6600 or equivalent RAM: 16GB GPU: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 6GB or AMD Radeon RX 480 8GB Ultra settings at 4K and 60 FPS CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K or equivalent RAM: 16GB GPU: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080 8GB The minimum spec for the game is actually relatively low, and most of us who consider ourselves PC gamers should be able to run it without a problem. Even the recommended specifications for the game are pretty reasonable. To get the full 4K experience, you'll need a top of the line system, though, with the best Intel and Nvidia have to offer. Producer Drew McCoy explains in the post that lower spec rigs might even be able to handle the game. The minimum spec is intended for users to run the game at 1600x900 with most of the details turned on and pull an average of 60 FPS, McCoy said. The recommended specs, meanwhile, assume you're running at 1920x1080 and have most of the graphical detail in the game cranked up as far as they'll go. The post goes into deeper detail, making note of all the PC video options we can expect to be tinkering with next month, as well as the tech powering the game. The team saw fit to include some benchmark graphs comparing performance at various resolutions, too. Titanfall 2 is set to be released on October 28.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Guides Destiny PlayStation 4 Xbox One Destiny Khvostov Quest - schematic location, 7G-OX weapon parts and manual pages for Rise of Iron's We Found a Rifle Quest How to start and complete Rise of Iron's Quest to get an Exotic version of Destiny's very first gun. By Matthew Reynolds Published 29/09/2016 Destiny: Rise of Iron has a neat callback to the very first weapon players wield in the game - the Khvostov - by making it the Exotic weapon Khvostov 7G-OX. The path to get there isn't signposted by the game, but once you're on the Khvostov Quest in Rise of Iron, it will only take you around an hour to 90 minutes to get it - though expect some exploration and a tough boss battle before you do so. Once you're done, maybe you'd want to take on another Exotic - the Gjallarhorn Quest, Thorn Quest or Outbreak Prime Quest perhaps? - which are required to complete an entry in Rise of Iron's Record Book. How to get the Khvostov Quest 'We Found a Rifle' in Destiny: Rise of Iron First, you need the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic to unlock the questline. There are two ways to do this: Dismantle the original Khvostov weapon Use a Splicer Intel Relay to board the Ketch ship in The Plaguelands If you managed to keep hold of that weapon from way back in 2014, then great - pull it out of your Vault, dismantle it and move on to the next step. Of course, most people got rid of it as soon as possible, and thankfully there's another way to get the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic. Here's the Khvostov 7G-OX up close. You need to head to the place you started Destiny, just outside the Cosmodrome walls. Fire up The Plaguelands patrol (complete the game's final story mission, The Iron Tomb, to access this) and head back in the direction of the Rocketlands (from where you spawn in, go right, through the doorway on the upper walkway). Once in the Rocketlands, go left to The Divide, then left round the corner into the sewers to access The Breach. You need to make sure you have a Splicer Intel Relay on you, because before you can go exit the wall, you'll have to open a doorway in The Breach. (Note that this won't work if you try and access the ship from story The Walls Come Down - we tried it.) Once you do, work your way through the pile up of cars to the Ketch ship in the distance, and kill everything on board, including a rather persistent Pilot Servitor. Once taken care of, a chest will appear in the far right corner, containing the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic. Whichever way you get it, take it to the Iron Temple to continue the next part of the quest. How to complete the 'We Found a Rifle' Quest, Khvostov weapon parts and manuals pages locations You now have to locate 10 manual pages and 3 weapon parts while in Patrol in The Plaguelands area. 10 Manual Pages for Khvostov 7G-OX - These are dropped by killing Fallen enemies within Patrol, so kill everything you come across and they'll drop from time to time. For some players this step was rather quick, with a steady stream of drops, but for us it took a while. We also had more success when not doing patrols, but you can do other things at the same time - we had two drop in a single Acheon's Forge session, for example. In short, you can get most of these pages while getting weapon parts, then just stay in Patrol until you're done. 3 Weapon Parts for Khvostov 7G-OX - These three weapon parts are found in specific places. Start The Plaguelands, and make your way back to the Rocketyards, which will act as your starting point. From here, you want to go to the Refinary, and essentially take the route the Devil's Lair Strike takes you on. Two of the three Weapon Parts are on this route: 1. One is located in the room after you face waves of enemies as your Ghost opens the door, on the right side in the corner. The first Weapon Part in the 'We Found a Rifle' Quest. Please ignore the photobombing dancer. 2. The next is in The Blast, the vast area where you face the Walker, outside in the centre of the map, against the purple pipe. The second Weapon Part is outside near where you fight the Walker in the Devil's Lair Strike. 3. For the third Weapon Part, go back to the Rocketyard, and head in the other direction so you go to The Divide. Instead of going left to The Breach, go right to Dock 13 (as if you are going to where you spawn into the Cosmodrome in the original Patrol). After the large room with enemies, the Weapon Part is under the stairs. Check under the stairs in Dock 13 for this third Weapon Part. Once you have 10 manual pages and 3 weapon parts, return to the Iron Temple to get a mission that'll finish off the Quest. Completing the Khvostov Quest 'We Found a Rifle' in Destiny: Rise of Iron This final A Khvostov Rising mission is home to a particularly tough boss encounter. Make sure you're a decent level (our article on how to reach Light level 400 can help) and come equipped with something that can take down a Void shield and do strong follow-up damage. If possible, team up with one or two other players too. Start the mission, use your Ghost on the scan point then head outside to meet Kaviss. As mentioned, he's pretty tough, so take his shield down with a Void Heavy or Super, then follow it up with more rapid damage. When his health is low enough, he'll retreat. Go to The Breach where you'll encounter a path of SIVA clouds through the tunnels, and be wary of the trip mines along the way. When you reach the wide, snow-filled area, head to the far end upper walkway to start another battle with the Captain. Kaviss is pretty tough, so make sure you have a powerful Void attack to knock out his shield. Again, same rules apply as before - use a Void Heavy or Super to quickly drop his shield then follow up with the opposite or some more to get in some damage. The problem here is the amount of surrounding enemies; the two things you mainly have to watch out for are the Servitors on the walkways (a few sniper shots will drop them) and the dropships that occasionally appear. Wait until the dropships disappear before coming out into the open (we had to 'approach' them to make them move one time, so consider that if they aren't budging) and try and clear as many regular enemies as you can. Then, when the coast is mostly clear, go in with a Super / Heavy combo to drop a chunk of the Captain's health, then retreat and repeat the process. It's a tough battle solo, and no doubt will be easier with a few of you, so consider grouping up if you can.

Then read our Wrath of the Machine walkthrough and guides, complete list of all Dormant SIVA Cluster locations, Rise of Iron Artifacts, tips on how to reach Destiny's max Light level and how to complete the Exotic Gjallarhorn Quest, Khvostov 7G-OX Quest and Thorn Quest. Once Kaviss is downed, he'll immediately drop the Khvostov 7G-OX as an Engram, which you can equip straight away. We're not done with the mission just yet though; make your way onward to beyond the wall, where you started the game and the new Ketch ship is, and clear out all the Fallen along the way. Once you've taken out all the enemies on the ship, your Ghost will want to have a chat with you while admiring the view. Once you've done the cutscene, head back to the Tower, and chat to Shiro-4 to complete the Quest.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Computer & Technology A brief Introduction to the Advantages of DVDFab Blu-ray Copy PR-Inside.com: 2016-09-23 13:42:49 When searching for a coping / burning application, internet will display multiple choices and advertisements, making it’s harder to decide. Surely each brand or company holds its outstanding qualities and characteristics; DVDFab still presents its strong points. DVDFab Blu-ray Copy is a best seller within DVDFab product’s family. It aims at solving the problem of copying and burning original Blu-ray movie discs to a blank Blu-ray / DVD disc to save the source from scratch or damage and view the burnt disc with excellent quality. DVDFab Blu-ray Copy is superior to other competitors in below three aspects: 1. Multiple Copy modes as a versatile tool to extract the contents from the source disc to your PC or to a blank media. So users are free to make different choices. With DVDFab Blu-ray Copy (Full Disc, Main Movie, Customize, Merge, Clone/Burn five modes available), a customer can output a copied movie folder or ISO on the hard drive with or without compression. Then be able to burn the copied file to a BD50/BD25 or DVD9/DVD5 disc. Also, a user is expected to directly copy from the source to the blank. To be noted, DVDFab Blu-ray Copy can not only take Blu-ray 2D discs but also Blu-ray 3D discs as source. So to 3D discs users, it is a relief. 2. Immediate response and support for new movies. Whenever there is a new movie, there is DVDFab trying to knock it down at once. DVDFab is keen on supporting a new movie as fast as possible. They pay great attention to new movies and gather feed-backs from users as well. So when a problem appears, they get to it right away and let users be capable of copying the disc at the very beginning. Besides, DVDFab Blu-ray Copy supports different versions or region codes of one movie. No matter where you are from, you can always reply on DVDFab Blu-ray Copy to successfully make a backup of your newly purchased Blu-ray disc. 3. Home-brew technology which facilitates the copying process and promotes user experience. In the past decade, DVDFab is devoted to advancing the compression technology by adopting new methods like Lightning-Recoding & Lightning-Shrink, which takes advantage of nVIDIA’s CUDA acceleration and Intel Quick Sync, making it’s quicker and time-saving for consumers to get a replica of their money-spent discs. All in all, DVDFab Blu-ray Copy is a fine product certified by thousands of users in the past several years and will be upgraded to a more professional copying tool.

Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Sep 23, 2016 at 6:05AM Image source: Getty Images. The best dividend ETF should pay a high yield from a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks while offering the potential for investors to earn additional returns from capital appreciation. To that end, here's a list of what I believe to be the five best dividend ETFs out of more than 100 dividend ETFs on the market today: Dividend ETF Ticker Annual Expense Ratio Dividend Yield (SEC Yield) Type Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF VIG 0.09% 2.1% Dividend Achievers Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF VYM 0.09% 3.1% Diversified mid- and large cap stocks Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD 0.07% 3.1% Quality large cap stocks SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY 0.35% 2.4% Dividend aristocrats WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund DES 0.38% 3.1% Small cap Sources: Vanguard, Charles Schwab, State Street Global Advisors, WisdomTree. Before buying any of these, it's important to know how the funds work. Here's the case for each fund, and why each one deserves a spot in the list of the best dividend ETFs for an income portfolio. Vanguard's dividend Goliath The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF lays claim to being the largest dividend ETF, with assets of more than $22.5 billion. It's not hard to see why this fund is so popular, given its tiny annual expense ratio of 0.09% of assets and a focus on high-quality dividend-paying companies. This isn't your average dividend ETF. The fund tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which invests in companies that have paid increasing dividends for at least 10 consecutive years, excluding REITs and master limited partnerships. The index uses proprietary and undisclosed screening mechanisms to sort out the top companies from a broader dividend index. Broadly diversified, the fund held 185 different mega and large-cap companies at the time of this writing, with its largest stakes in popular dividend stocks such as Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, and PepsiCo. But keep in mind that this fund is focused primarily on capital appreciation over income. The fund's investments had an average yield of just 2.1% at the time of this writing, putting the ETF's yield roughly in line with the S&P 500. What makes this fund so attractive to investors is that it has roughly matched the return of the S&P 500 while investing in companies with rock-solid dividend policies. In addition, a focus on blue-chip stocks with the capacity to grow their dividends resulted in less pain during the Great Financial Crisis, when the fund lost much less of its value than the stock market on average. Vanguard's simple yield ETF What would happen if you took a list of high-yield large cap stocks, sorted it by dividend yield, and then invested in the highest-yielding half? Well, you'd get something that looks a lot like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. The strategy isn't particularly fancy, but it works. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which invests in the highest-yielding of U.S. stocks in the FTSE All-World Index, excluding only REITs. The fund weights each stock by market cap, thus investing most heavily in dividend-paying large-cap companies. Despite its simplicity, returns have been excellent, beating the S&P 500 marginally over the most recent three- and five-year periods, largely because of outsize dividend yields. At the time of this writing, the fund offered a yield of about 3.1%, roughly 50% more than the S&P 500. Note that this is one of the most diversified ETFs on the list -- it holds more than 420 stocks -- yet it carries an annual expense ratio of just 0.09% a year. That's a very low price to pay to get broad diversification across dividend stocks in every sector. Schwab's fundamentally focused dividend ETF A late entrant into exchange-traded funds, Charles Schwab has rapidly attracted assets with its low-cost ETFs. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is no exception, boasting a microscopic 0.07% annual expense ratio that makes it the least expensive of any fund on this list. The prominent feature of this fund is that its methodology is designed to select from the very best of dividend-paying stocks. The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which invests in large-cap stocks that have paid dividends annually for the past 10 years. Importantly, the index also considers fundamental metrics in stock selection, requiring that companies have high cash flow to debt, earn a high return on equity, offer a generous dividend yield, and have a history of dividend growth. Like other ETFs on this list, it excludes bond-like companies such as real estate investment trusts, which offer high yields but less opportunity for capital appreciation. This fund favors large-cap stocks, because of its market-cap weighting. The top three holdings are Intel, Procter & Gamble, and Microsoft, common companies in any high-quality portfolio. Its 3.1% yield stands out as one of the highest, but note that it isn't as diversified as other funds, as it holds only 100 different stocks. State Street's royal dividend ETF After a company increases its dividend for 25 consecutive years, it joins an elite group of stocks known as "dividend aristocrats." The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF invests in these companies by tracking the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 20 years in a row. Relaxing the requirement to 20 years of dividend increases from 25 years doesn't necessarily cost much in the way of portfolio quality, but it does allow for a little more diversification. (A stricter dividend aristocrats ETF sponsored by ProShares holds just 50 stocks.) Note that this ETF held 108 stocks at the time of this writing and was most heavily invested in traditional high-yield sectors including utilities, financial services, and industrials.  State Street's ETF is a little different in that it weights stocks in the portfolio by their indicative yield. Thus, a stock that has a dividend yield of 5% will make up a bigger part of the portfolio than a stock that yields just 3%, for example. The result is that the fund tends to invest more heavily in slower-growing companies that return more of their income to shareholders. At the time of this writing, its three largest holdings were HCP Inc., People's United Financial, and Caterpillar. (Its largest holding, HCP, is a REIT, which would be excluded from many other ETFs on this list.) Performance has been spectacular, as the ETF has put up annualized returns that were about 0.5 percentage points better than the S&P 500 over the last five- and 10-year periods. This is especially impressive when you consider that the ETF carries a much higher annual expense ratio (0.35%) than other dividend ETFs. With a current yield of about 2.4%, the fund has a slight advantage over the S&P 500's 2.1% yield. WisdomTree's fund for big yields from small stocks Most dividend ETFs focus on large companies and completely ignore high-yield small caps. WisdomTree's SmallCap Dividend Fund is a great way to round out a dividend portfolio so that it includes dividend payers of all sizes, not just megacap companies. This fund selects stocks by ranking all dividend-paying stocks by size and then throwing out the largest 300 stocks, as well as stocks with market caps of less than $100 million, which can be impractical for some funds to own. The largest companies that make up 75% of the remaining companies' total market cap are put into WisdomTree's large and mid-cap dividend ETFs. The smallest companies, which make up 25% of the value of the list, are put into the WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund. WisdomTree weights stocks in the portfolio by the total dollar amount of dividends it expects a company to pay over the next year. The result is a diversified portfolio of about 700 different investments, many of which won't be familiar to investors who primarily stick to American large caps. Targa Resources (oil and gas services), Cal-Maine Foods (egg farmer and distributor), and Covanta Holding Corp. (waste disposal) were the three largest companies in its portfolio. Small caps typically generate higher returns, albeit with more volatility, than large-cap stocks. It's notable that the WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund has beaten the returns of stock indexes large and small, trouncing both the S&P 500 (large caps) and Russell 2000 (small caps) over the most recent five- and 10-year periods. It also pays out a much higher dividend yield of about 3.1% vs. about 1.6% for the Russell 2000 and 2.1% for the S&P 500. If there is one big downside, it's that the ETF leans toward the costly side. An annual expense ratio of 0.38% is cheap compared with active funds, particularly active small-cap funds, but it is the highest of any ETF on this list. That said, if the fund's forward returns look anything like its historical returns, investors will find it easy to look past higher expenses.    Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Vessel rolled out of beta in March 2015 and offered users a free one-year subscription. The video streaming service, which provides exclusive access to content from some of the web’s top personalities and influencers, is the brainchild of former Hulu CEO Jason Kilar and CTO Richard Tom. As Re/code notes, however, the service hasn’t found the level of success that it was initially hoping for since many of YouTube’s biggest stars elected to stay with the Google-owned video service rather than jump ship. Verizon has tried to enter the streaming video industry on multiple occasions, having purchased Intel’s streaming assets in 2014 and launching mobile video service Go90 last October. The latter service, marketed to youth, hasn’t really caught on according to people both inside and outside of the company. Verizon has also spent large sums of money to acquire Internet pioneers AOL in 2015 and Yahoo just a couple of months ago. One of the main reasons for those purchases was video. That said, Vessel has reportedly shifted its strategy and is now working on a new product described by one person as a Snapchat-like app with image filters and other trendy features. An acquisition would give Verizon yet another streaming video service to try and do something with plus a mobile communications app, a category that’s red hot at the moment.

From left: See Sense’s Philip McAleese and Ryan Farrelly, Ambie’s Larry Wawro and Mark Bennett, Smartcharge’s Mick Berry, Hidnseek’s Xavier Torres-Tuset and Liberty Bell’s Conor Cahill and Sile Ginnane. Image: Jason Clarke Dublin City Council (DCC) has financed five companies to trial new technologies that could improve the city’s cycle network. Here, we take a closer look. City planning is not an easy task, with various forms of transport forced to interact with each other as roads, paths and tracks collide. It’s never safe enough, clean enough or enjoyable enough. However, that doesn’t mean improvements are disregarded. DCC is, like many city councils throughout the world, seeking smart solutions to dumb problems. How can sensors fix what general human intuition has failed at for decades? How can city road networks enhance the tourist experience, while also serving the business needs that finance the whole affair? Finally, how can drivers, pedestrians and cyclists co-exist? The last of these is being looked at in a serious way in Dublin at the moment, with a small funding initiative for five companies recently announced to help improve the cycling experience. Armed with €12,500 each, Ambie, Fluidedge, Hidnseek, See Sense and SmartCharge will now aim to prove the viability of their proposed solutions; taking in bike security, monitoring and complementary street lighting along the way. The companies have three months to develop their solution to pre-prototype stage, after which some will be selected for further funding (up to €25,000 each) to complete their prototype solutions. Ambie Whether it is a high-end bicycle used for racing, or an old mountain bike used to get from A to B, the threat of it being stolen by someone in a major urban area remains quite high. According to one estimate, 20,000 bicycles are stolen in Dublin each year – what can we do to bring this number down? Ambie’s solution is BikeLook, a project led by CEO Mark Bennett that will see sensors installed on bike racks throughout the city. They will notify cyclists that their bicycle – with their own sensor – was stolen from the rack. If there were enough of these sensors across the city, a stolen bicycle within a 450m range of one of these racks could ping the sensor, allowing its location to be tracked across the city. Larry Wawro and Mark Bennett of Ambie. Image: Jason Clarke All details of the bicycle’s whereabouts can be seen on a companion app on the user’s phone with plans to launch the service across all platforms, including iOS and Android. Speaking to Siliconrepublic.com, Bennett said that along with his colleagues Wawrzyniec ‘Larry’ Wawro and Brian Henry, the trio are putting the “pedal to the metal” to get the test infrastructure in place for future trials. To keep costs down, the Ambie team is looking at Bluetooth sensors that would allow them to build their own devices using technology like LoRa, rather than relying on commercial options. Using such wide area IoT technology, BikeLook is already beginning a trial run with DCC to gather data on bike traffic and thefts across the city. At the time of writing, Bennett has confirmed that one as yet unnamed university is also to begin testing the technology with a smart bike rack soon. SmartCharge Cyclist visibility is something handled by both the cyclists themselves, through lighting and high-vis clothing, and the location in which they are cycling, through street lights and clear line-of-sight on roads. DCC is clearly investing in the latter, with improved road networks and dedicated cycle paths easing the friction between cyclist and driver. The Gardaí help out on the former, with regular giveaways of lights and reflective clothing as nights grow longer and dangers rise. With that, SmartCharge’s novel idea stands out. The company has a plan to arm bikes throughout the city with Bluetooth transmitters, as well as putting complementary receivers on street furniture dotted throughout the metropolitan area, like bollards or road signs. These receivers light up when cyclists are within a range of 50-100m, thus alerting motorists and pedestrians to their presence. “The device is the size of a cigarette box,” said SmartCharge’s James Fryar, hinting at the potential for widespread use. “What we are most interested in is the combination of broadcasting and detecting; this enables a lot of what we want to do. We can obviously use it to activate street signage, but you can monitor where bicycles are being cycled, where they are parked and other things.” With the creation of an entire tracking, logging and data harvesting system for the city’s cycle network, the benefits of visibility and security are obvious, should the project prove successful. See Sense See Sense was founded in 2013 by husband-and-wife team Philip and Irene McAleese. The award-winning technology company is based in Newtownards, Co Down, and all of their products are manufactured in Northern Ireland. Spurred on by his chaotic commuting experience in Singapore, Philip was inspired to create an intelligent bike light to make cyclists more visible to motorists. Enter the Icon light, launched earlier this year. Philip McAleese and Ryan Farrelly of See Sense. Image: Jason Clarke The gadget aims to combat impaired daylight visibility by using sensor technology and Cree LEDs to flash faster and brighter in hazardous areas. However, its usefulness in this campaign is in its Find My iPhone-like tracking system. It syncs up to a smartphone app in a special theft detection mode, which sends message alerts to your phone, via Bluetooth if your bike is moved or tampered with. Emergency details, too, can be installed into the app, which will automatically notify next of kin of your precise location in the event of a crash. Information was crowdsourced anonymously and compiled over the last five years by See Sense to provide a clearer understanding of city infrastructure, and how it can better facilitate cyclists. The company claims that, when utilised to the full, Icon retains sensory data about collisions, near misses, uneven road surfaces etc. HidnSeek Devised by former Intel Leixlip worker Xavier Torres-Tuset, HidnSeek is a low-power device attached to a bike that has the ability to generate real-time data. It can be integrated with existing data sources and information to create an overall accurate picture of the cycling experience in Dublin. The device can measure GPS co-ordinates, speed and environmental conditions using the low-cost Sigfox network. Sigfox is a nationwide IoT network managed in Ireland by VT Networks and enables devices to communicate in low-power, low-data bursts across a wide variety of applications. HidnSeek was started a year ago and launched a successful Kickstarter campaign with its first GPS tracker. It featured earlier this year as a Siliconrepublic.com Start-up of the Week. John O’Brien, HidnSeek’s European marketing manager, explained that they plan to use other technologies “to compliment the Sigfox capability to create a more robust end user product”. “Our product will be connecting bikes across Dublin to the internet at a low cost. It will allow bike owners to keep tabs on their bike and recover them if stolen. The city can better understand the movement of bikes in Dublin and adopt a data-driven approach to improving the bike infrastructure. “It will also improve safety through monitoring the bike-related incidents around the city. “Our product can be adapted for any [city] bike scheme or for an individual owner. Our approach is considering both the individual bike owner as well as the bike scheme in Dublin and other cities across Europe.” Fluidedge One of the biggest problems facing Dublin cyclists is the realistic viability of their route. That can be affected by many things, from obstacles like glass or garbage on the road, to areas where cycle lanes disappear or drivers take more risks. Bluetooth technology Liberty Bell, from website designer Fluidedge, seeks to make those obstacles more transparent and, hopefully, devise fixes. The Liberty Bell is a simple research device designed to generate data that DCC can use to improve the cyclist’s lot. To gather the data that Fluidedge needs, volunteers install Bluetooth ‘bells’ on their bikes. To register an issue – or, indeed, something that DCC is doing well – the cyclist rings the bell. This ‘bookmarks’ the rider’s location and the time of the incident. Later, the rider can go back into their online history and add details about why they rang the bell. Conor Cahill and Sile Ginnane of Liberty Bell. Image: Jason Clarke Fluidedge web developer Conor Cahill says this can be as simple as marking a pothole, or saying that you think a new bike rack was a good addition. Aside from benefitting those who cycle for their commute, the technology may have a surprising knock-on effect for children’s safety. Fluidedge reached out to An Taisce Green-Schools to discuss its potential. The organisation was receptive, saying that the system would be ideal for the organisation’s regular cycling audits. The use of the Liberty Bell could make it far simpler to track children’s perceptions of riding a bike. Liberty Bell is driven by open-source content management system Drupal. The data created by volunteers will be turned into dashboards that Fluidedge can share with the council, hopefully leading to some targeted changes that will genuinely make cycling in Dublin safer and easier. While the Liberty Bell project is currently confined to Dublin’s city limits for now, Cahill says that it will hopefully one day have a global impact. Updated, 10.42am, 23 September 2016: This article was updated to clarify the relationship between An Taisce Green-Schools and Fluidedge.

The European Commission had no specific concern about the Irish tax system, nor is it anxious to harmonize corporate tax rates in Europe.  Nevertheless, its decision on Apple and on other firms is part of two problems, issues that should be important for discussion in the U.S. presidential campaign.  One is the specific problem of whether large business corporations, especially American firms, are paying a fair share of taxation.  The other, which should be particularly pertinent in the U.S. election, is whether the European Union can attempt to decide tax laws, or whether all sovereign states, like Ireland in the case of Apple, have the sovereign right to determine their own tax laws. The European Commission (E.C.) has been actively investigating tax deals in the European countries since 2014.  Its surprising departure has been to use a device – in a sense, a ploy – to the effect that favorable tax exemptions or "sweetheart" tax deals are in reality state aid bestowed on a firm.  State aid is defined as in place when a company receives government support, thus gaining an advantage over its competitors.  This is held to be incompatible with the single market, the central principle, of the EU.  State aid is prohibited by Article 107 of the EU Founding Law, which has been amended several times, unless it is justified by reason of general economic development. The central figure involved in the current controversy on the issue is Margrethe Vestager, Danish politician and former minister, who since November 2014 has been European commissioner for competition.  As a minister in Denmark, she believed in a freely trading economy.  As commissioner, a powerful position that affects global as well as European companies, she was instructed to enforce rules and policy on competition to contribute to jobs and economic growth.  To do this, she has focused with intensity on cases concerning tax benefits and state aid to large firms, many American, though she claims she is not anti-American.  Her views on this, however, are implied in her comment that the American market gives consumers very little choice and higher prices than in Europe in general. Within a few months of her appointment as commissioner, Margrethe Vestager brought antitrust charges against Google.  She initiated investigations into the tax affairs of a number of prominent companies, including Starbucks, Amazon, Fiat, Gazprom, and now Engie in France, as well as Apple. In 2015, Vestager ordered Cyprus Airways to pay back to the Cyprus government more than 65 million euros in what she considered "illegal" state aid the organization received in 2012 and 2013 as part of a "restructuring program."  As a result, the Airways, 93% of which was owned by the state, suspended operations, resulting in the loss of 550 jobs and, ironically reducing competition.  Vestager explained her decision by saying the Airways had no chance of becoming viable without continuing state subsidies and that the restructuring plan was based on unrealistic assumptions. In addition, Vestager has dealt with other agreements involving selective tax advantages, ordering Luxembourg to get 30 million euros from Fiat, the Netherlands to get 30 million euros from Starbucks, and Belgium to get 700 million euros from Anheuser Busch and 35 multinational companies.  In these cases, a tax ruling lowered the tax paid by the various companies. In the Irish case, Vestager acted because she claimed that Apple had paid only 0.005% corporation tax on its European profits in 2014.  She held that Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits to Apple that enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses.  Benefits of this kind were equivalent to a bundle of cash.  Money had flowed through Apple subsidiaries in Ireland. This selective tax treatment, Vestager held, was illegal, and also gave Apple a significant advantage.  Apple was able to avoid taxation on almost all profits made in the whole European Union, because Apple had recorded all its sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. In its defense, Apple agreed it had shifted income to Ireland and its Irish subsidiaries because of the growth of its sales overseas.  It said it paid 30.5% on profits made on its U.S. sales and that it paid standard Irish tax, 12.5% corporate tax, in respect to its Irish branch, and employed 6,000 in Ireland, many in the town of Cork. For its part, Ireland had prospered from the entrance of large corporations – Apple,  Microsoft, Intel, the internet social networks, and chemical and pharmaceutical companies.  Ireland argued that jobs had been created by Apple, especially in Cork, and the flow of international investment might slow or stop if there was a retroactive tax demand.  These international companies had transformed Ireland's regional economy. The problem for Apple started with an inquiry by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Democratic senator Carl Levin, who thought Apple's corporative arrangements were unorthodox because it did not have to file publicly for its Irish subsidiaries.  It was that investigation, which found that Apple had paid "essentially no tax" on its income in Ireland, that spurred what led to the E.C. investigation. The tax problem goes beyond Apple.  In November 2014, the LuxLeaks scandal revealed that large companies in Luxembourg were able to exploit legal loopholes and get tax rates as low as 1%.  In the U.K., Amazon paid only £11.9 million by routing much of its British sales through its Luxembourg subsidiary.  The essential problem is that global corporations use mechanisms to reduce or avoid corporate tax by shifting profits to tax havens.  There is universal agreement that international tax rules must be changed so the corporations will pay tax based on economic activity in a country. The issue for the U.S. and European countries is the isolated nature of decision-making by the E.C. on tax and other issues., virtually acting without consultation of the U.S. or other countries.  The U.S. presidential candidates should note that Commissioner Vestager plans to look into tax affairs concerning the companies linked to Business Roundtable.  This group, with 185 CEOs and  a collective revenue of $7 trillion, has already argued that such an inquiry would increase business uncertainty, with an adverse effect on foreign investment in Europe, because the tax uncertainty will disrupt trade and investment. It is essential that at least one of the U.S. presidential candidates take a firm stand on the issue and make clear that tax policies, whether they need to be changed or not, remain in the hands of sovereign states, including the U.S. Rarely in history has an offer of 13 billion euros been refused by a state or organization.  Yet the government of Ireland entered the book of records on September 2, 2016 by not taking the offered gift.  Instead, it decided to appeal against the ruling of the European Commission that it had granted Apple undue and illegal tax benefits that allowed the company to pay substantially less tax than other businesses, and that Ireland should recover the illegal aid.

That would be Google, it appears. Internet firms dominated technology sector lobbying in Washington, D.C. in the first half of this year, and Google led the pack by a substantial margin, according to a new report from The Hill. The Mountain View tech giant spent more than $8 million on lobbying in D.C. through the end of June, the online news site reported Thursday. The next-highest spending came from Amazon, which shelled out about $5.8 million. Facebook spent nearly $5 million, while Oracle put out $4.1 million. Opening up the coffers to the tune of $2.3 million to $2.4 million were Apple, Intel and IBM. Google has taken heat over its lobbying from the Google Transparency Project, a group revealed by Fortune to be funded in part by Oracle. The group referred to Google’s “lobbying juggernaut” in a report issued earlier this year that documented 427 visits to the White House by employees of Google and associated entities since President Barack Obama took office. “Senior Google executives have met at least 21 times with President Obama in small, intimate meetings,” the report said. “Senior company executives also met at least 20 times with President Obama’s key political and economic advisers.” The primacy of internet firms in tech sector lobbying reflects their evolution into “major players” in Washington policy debates, according to The Hill.

News & Analysis TSMC Expands its 3D Menu Options slice across tech barriers Rick Merritt 9/22/2016 09:15 PM EDT 14 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Taiwan’s largest semiconductor kitchen released its latest menu, a 3D matrix that spans process, packaging and applications-specific options. TSMC described at an event here FinFET processes down to 7nm it will serve up over the next few months as well as an expanding set of 3D packaging options. “We are getting into a 3D x 3D era that will carry us into the next decade, said Jack Sun, chief technologist and vice president of R&D at TSMC. The foundry will have volume production of its 10nm process before the end of the year and be ready to take orders for its 7nm process by April, said Sun. He showed two new variants in the works for the so-called InFO stacks analysts say Apple is now using for its A10 Fusion SoC. And he sketched out a handful of other 3D packaging options for different uses. The processes and packages are being supported across design platforms being tailored for four markets. “From this year, beyond an enhanced mobile platform we will add design platforms for high performance computing, automotive and the Internet of Things,” said Cliff Hou, vice president of R&D for design technology platforms at TSMC. The high performance computing (HPC) platform promises 1V processors running at 3.8 GHz data rates in the 7nm process. The IoT platform will approach but not embrace near threshold voltages, and its cousin for automotive will support chips rated to an operating temperature of 150 degrees C. One fabless engineering manager expressed an enthusiastic appetite for the breadth and variety of combinations now available at TSMC. “Imagine what you could do with it…it slices across technology barriers,” said Michael Campbell, a vice president of engineering at Qualcomm, noting--for example--the potential to mate an SoC to a CMOS image sensor for use in robotics. TSMC is essentially cranking out a new process every year. Its 28+ HKMG and 16FF+ processes are in production now, and the 16FFC and 10nm processes are ramping this year. Yields for 256 Mbit SRAMs at 7nm are two months ahead of plan with risk production starting in the first quarter of 2017, said Sun. The 16nm processes provide about 45% more speed and 80% less leakage than 28+ and supports four voltage levels, TSMC said. The 10nm process provides a 50% die scaling and 20% speed gain or 40% power reduction over 16FF+ and provides “the highest density in the industry today in contact pitch,” said Sun. Compared to 10nm, TSMC’s 7nm node delivers 15-20% more speed or 35-40% less power consumption and a 1.63x better routed gate density, said Sun. An ARM Cortex-A72 core in the 7nm process could deliver 30% more performance or 56% less power consumption than in 16FFC, said Hou. Rival Globalfoundries said earlier this year the 10nm process does not push triple patterning to the limit nor does it offer a full node shrink over 16nm. Thus it recently announced plans to skip 10nm and move from 14 directly to 7nm. Intel announced its 10nm process last month, claiming it will be the most dense process in the industry. Naming conventions for process technology have generally run amok, but observers believe Intel has an edge at 10nm given it is its third-generation FinFET process. Sun said 7nm “will be a broad, long-lasting platform after 16FFC for many applications,” suggesting the 10nm node could be short lived. Indeed, observers believe the 10nm shrink was driven probably to offer Apple an edge for its next-generation iPhone SoC. It could take until the end of 2017 to fully validate in silicon the 7nm process, Hou said. Most EDA functions are now in a 0.5 version state of readiness, and new compilers are needed to deliver historical shrinks in SRAMs, he added. Nevertheless, TSMC has more than 20 customers for the 7nm process with multiple tape outs expected before June, said Sun.

How is the 1.63x increase in density consistent with an earlier statement by TSMC (as reported by EETimes): "TSMC has made a working SRAM at 7nm, Sun reported. The node should deliver 40-45% less area and either 10-15% higher speeds or 25-30% lower power than the 10nm node, he said." The lower end of this area, the -40%, converts to a 1.67x increase in density, still higher than the 1.63x here. So I guess this confirms that TSMC doesn't mind lying? Also, the current article states 15-20% speed and 35-40% power, more than the previous article.   Secondly, how is the 2.1x density claim consistent with following: "TSMC made a working test chip in its 10nm FinFET process, said Sun. The process should deliver a 0.52x area scaling compared to 20nm and support either 18% higher speeds or 40% less power than TSMC's current leading-edge 16FF+." Well, at least their power/performance claims here are consistent... Source: http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1327725.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – Is the Syrian Ceasefire a Dead Man Walking? By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on September 23, 2016 Is the Syrian Ceasefire a Dead Man Walking? “Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception.” ― Niccolò Machiavelli by  Jim W. Dean, VT Editor   … with New Eastern Outlook, Moscow Dead Man Walking – the movie [ Note: I would like to thank NEO for getting this piece up quickly, as war material can become old news fast on a moving target like a ceasefire, where evening news can look like a different conflict than reports from the morning. There is enough evidence to support anyone being fatalistic about ever seeing the warring sides in Syria stop fighting as long as the ammo and supplies keep flowing in. That is why I used the “Dead Man Walking” symbolism, as it seems that Syria has been sentenced to death by its Western and Gulf State tormentors, and praying for a reprieve before the end. We saw some very shady blame-game maneuverings going on during the first week, and shameful reporting from the West, almost like reading Pravda from the old Soviet days. The secret ceasefire agreement triggered a battlefield all on its own. The term “state-sponsored terrorism” is never used to describe the foreign backers of the many opposition groups, some who change names more often than their underwear. Even Mr. Ban ki-Moon will never touch the term with a ten foot pole. That failure is what is giving legitimacy to those countries using proxy terrorists. Why should they stop, when they don’t see serious efforts to make them do so, or even discussions? I fear that this could get worse before it gets better … JD ] ____________ – First published  …  September  23, 2016 – The Syrian ceasefire exists in name only, after the Kerry-Lavrov UN side meeting when they stated they would carry forward even after fighting resumed. But realistically, how can they do that when the ceasefire itself has become a war of words, charges and counter-charges, deceptions and half-truths? On death row, when a condemned man is walking to his execution, “Dead man walking” is called down the cell block so those next in line can give their last salute to one about to meet his end, along with any illusions of a last minute reprieve. This will go down as one of the hardest to negotiate ceasefires; and we can see it began unraveling before the ink was dry. The US opposition racked up 300 violations, and used the week to rest and restock to begin a new offensive on southwestern Aleppo. That attack was defeated by the Syrian coalition which had expected it. At the talks, a key ingredient of ceasefire credibility was missing, as there were no enforcement mechanisms in the agreement. There were no consequences whatsoever to rein in the rogue elements caught violating the ceasefire, and for whom obeying the rules does not seem to be a lifelong aspiration. US Syrian Envoy Michael Ratney and Gen Martin E. Dempsey, US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2014 I wrote here on NEO on September 13th , Has the Syrian War Finally Reached the Tipping Point?, that US Syrian envoy Michael Ratney was tasked to poll the US-supported opposition groups to get their formal acceptance of the ceasefire and to warn them of “dire consequences” if they did not disengage with the al-Nusra forces that were still on the target list. We know now there were none. His statement was a PR stunt. The opposition groups decided just go ahead and sign onto the ceasefire so the US would have its list to submit to the Russians, and then they did whatever they wanted. We saw this quickly when, in the first few days, the opposition continued to violate the ceasefire, but Kerry and the Western media generally ignored it. The Western Press played its usual sordid role by ignoring the details of large violations by the opposition, while giving front page coverage to anti-Damascus news, despite the Syrian Air Force standing down for the week on attacks against the ceasefire-approved opposition forces. The Russians had gone to great lengths to publish that they have deployed their ability to monitor the ceasefire quite extensively, perhaps hoping to discourage violations. But when these violate reports were treated as nothing by the US coalition, then the violations increased. The rebel groups read between the lines that they could use the ceasefire to their advantage, and they did. We next saw Lavrov asking for the ceasefire agreements to be made public, so the public could see which side was the major violator. The US ignored that request, as it seems there was an agreement that it could not be disclosed without both parties agreeing, and the US has taken advantage of that. As the rebel violations continued to increase throughout the week, it became obvious that the US either had no control over getting compliance from the opposition groups, or was playing make believe in actually trying to, or the Gulf State backers had made an end run around the US and other groups that it has funded to wreck the ceasefire. I mentioned in my NEO article on the 13th that this was a possibility. The Ceasefire goes out with a bang This truck shows no munitions damage at all, but looks like it was hurriedly, but lightly burned. The tires were just singed. The US’ casual attitude toward the ceasefire violations increased the anger of the Russians, who then began to accuse the US of breaking the agreement that the Russians would guarantee Damascus’ compliance and the US would guarantee the opposition’s. After this, things got much worse. We had the irresponsible US coalition attack on the Syrians at the Deir Ezzor airport, followed immediately by an ISIL offensive against the Syrians. This was followed by a weak admission of its being a mistake, and then the revelation that, out of the four planes involved, Australia and Norway had been involved. This appeared to Cold War veterans like the US allies wanted to get some of their pilots “blooded” with a strike from Iraqi bases. So far, we have heard nothing from the Iraqis about their bases being used for the strike. We have to ask why the US would run such an operation during the first delicate and critical week of the ceasefire, when the agreement allowed for joint strikes to begin the second week. Veterans Today analysts do not believe the Deir Ezzor strike was a mistake but payback to the Syrians and Russians for being too public about the US side doing all of the ceasefire violations and the Russian requests to have the agreements made public. All US coalition bombs are GPS guided, and the Syrians have been at the Deir Ezzor airport position for a long time now. There is no way the US coalition could not have known exactly where they were. This the strong smell of an act of war provocation to cause the Syrian coalition to break the ceasefire themselves in retaliation, so the US would put that blame on them, but they did not bite. For even a general artillery attack on a spread out convoy, we would expect to see at least some craters in the roadway. There are none. As the ceasefire closed in on its last day, it now seems that the US decided it needed a psychological operation to counter any bad press of the past few days. It knew the Syrians had picked up on opposition plans to launch a new offensive against Aleppo, and the Syrian and Russian Airforce would do an airborne counterattack, which they did. So, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, we had the night attack on an aid convoy on SW Aleppo, just as the opposition launched its new attack on that flank. We wake up in the morning to find a well-coordinated media campaign alleging Syrian coalition responsibility. We right away saw this at VT as a ploy to move the press coverage off the US and opposition responsibility for the ceasefire failure. But so far they have failed. Even the UN has retracted its early charges of a bombing attack as a translation mistake. But even that was a sham, because the Syrian Air Force has never flow night operations, not having the required equipment in their planes to do so. Although the US State Department instantly condemned the night bombing, it had to know better from its extensive battlefield surveillance. General Igor Konashenkov Major-General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, stated that it tracked a Predator drone from the Incirlik Air base in Turkey that flew to the convoy location that night, arriving just before the claimed attack. The general third party consensus now is that the convoy was probably shelled, as it was a static target; and which the opposition in that territory easily could have done as a false flag operation, of the kind so typically used in this Syrian war. John Kerry had the gall at the UN Security Council Meeting on the aid convoy event to demand that Russia take responsibility for it and ground the Syrian Air Force to “restore credibility to the process”. But once again we see the US refusing to accept any responsibility for its proxies’ violations, playing the “do as I say, not as I do” game. But mind you, the US has put no drone or satellite Intel on the table to prove that the convoy was bombed. Lavrov has countered by calling for an independent investigation, when Kerry does not want one at all. Lavrov also stated that the Syrian government forces would not unilaterally stop fighting, since their having done so during the ceasefire week was exploited, with the US bombing the Syrian Army in Deir Ezzor. We could possibly see an escalation in the conflict. The Russians are bringing in their flagship aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, to boost their Mediterranean fleet firepower. Everyone seems to have forgotten about the published news two weeks ago on the Iranian Hamadan Air Base being refitted to host the return of the Russian heavy bombers to repeat their shorter range sorties to Syria from there…if needed. Hamadan Air Base, north of the city And last, we have the offensive on Mosul on schedule for early October, where US-supporting air assets will be busy concentrating on that key battle. We could possibly see Russian bombers flying overhead on their way back and forth between Hamadan and Syria. Would the Russian Hamadan-based planes run support missions against Mosul if requested by the Iraqi government? Nobody knows at the moment, but I can clearly see the preparation for an escalated conflict being put in place, where another “payback” like we saw in Deir Ezzor could take the Syrian war into a new realm. There are those who would love to see that, and I think we all know who they are. Jim W.

Log in to Reply lastugro  September 24, 2016 at 6:30 pm Edward Longshanks: the location is too far from the front lines for hostile artillery to reach there. If it was no air attack, it was a ground based bombing from the proximity of the parked trucks. Edward Longshanks  September 25, 2016 at 7:11 am I know, thanks to Southfront. Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  September 24, 2016 at 10:56 am Very good analysis, Jim. Interesting to see the Russians laying low on fixing responsibility for the aid convoy attack. The Russians & Syrians know what happened and who did it — with evidence soon to show that U.S.-backed moderate head choppers aided in a false flag attack to shift focus away from the U.S. bombing on the known-to-U.S. positions of Syrian troops at Deir Ezzor. The Syria/Russia-led coalition still has the upper hand. The U.S.-Russia deal on Syria was a gift to Obama, on which Bush/NeoCons in U.S. mil/intel and some GCC nations could not allow consummation. Kerry is now frantically trying to salvage the ceasefire and the U.S.-Russia deals on Syria, because working with Russia is the only way for ObamaCo. to salvage any credibility whatsoever on Syria. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  September 24, 2016 at 5:41 am The Western strategy is taken from Orwell’s book 1984. It promotes the permanent, ongoing and never ending war, which is needed to convince to own voter at home. This is difficult to understand for the Russian diplomats who think with common sense, that a war with a none-decisive result would bring people to deal together in table talks. Simply written: Insanity against Ratio. The Russian strategy to lead the warfare into a stalemate failed. And it will take time, that Russia is able to establish better and more successful tactics.

The components within a 32GB iPhone 7 are estimated to be worth $219.80, teardown experts IHS Markit have said, with the most expensive piece within the handset being the screen at $43. Compared | iPhone 6s, 6s Plus and 7 Once the $5 "basic manufacturing costs" of assembling and testing are taken into account, the total cost for Apple to produce the 32GB iPhone 7 is $224.90, IHS Markit estimates. In the UK the iPhone 7 starts at £599. That's £60 more than the iPhone 6s, even though the latest handset cost just $36.89 more to make, thanks to the upgraded camera, better battery and faster chips. In the US the phone retails at $649, the same price as its predecessor. Apple has slightly better margins on its handsets than Samsung, IHS Markit said, but the cost of production for the iPhone 7 is "in line" with Samsung's flagship Galaxy smartphones. "All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past," Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking at IHS Markit. Teardown specialists IHS Markit pull phones apart to work out the costs of the components Credit: IHS Markit The teardown price does not take into account the time and money spent on research, software and transport, among others. As a result, Apple has previously indicated that the production cost is higher than teardown estimates.  "Generally there are cost breakdowns around our products that are much different than the reality. I've never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate," said Tim Cook last year. The iPhone 6, 5s and 5 were all estimated to cost around $200 to make, while the components in Apple's latest 4-inch device, the iPhone SE, are worth just $160.   IHS Markit has not yet produced a cost estimate for the iPhone 7 Plus Credit: David Rose iPhone 7 parts and how much they cost The display, which is the most expensive part of the iPhone 7 at $43, is closely followed by an Intel Modem and other chips that cost a total of $33.90, said IHS Markit. The new A10 Fusion chip meanwhile costs around $26.90 and the two cameras add up to $19.90. Perhaps surprisingly, the newly expanded 1,920mAh battery is worth just $2.50, while the Lightning EarPods and charger together cost $11.80.

So, can anyone here tell me if win10 parks core by default? (and how do I unpark in that case?) Is it enough for me to change power saving plan to high performance (set min and max cpu power state to 100%) , and disable C-states/Intel Speedstep in bios, to have max cpu performance, or do I also have to unpark cores somehow? thanks for any help!     alexander1986 View Public Profile Find all posts by alexander1986     (#2) mbk1969 Ancient Guru   Videocard: GeForce GTX 970 Processor: I7-4930 Mainboard: Asus p9x79 Memory: G Skill RipjawZ, 16GB Soundcard: Onboard + FiiO E17 PSU: 1000 W 09-22-2016, 13:08 | posts: 2,770 | Location: Moscow, Russia Core parking is off by default in Win8 and Win10.

Win8 and Win10 has core parking switched off by default in Balanaced and Performance power plans. But to answer the question - there are hidden power plan settings for setting the minimum and the maximum amount of cores in parked state. When minimum setting is equal to (or greater then) maximum setting then core parking is switched off. User can either unhide these settings and set them in advanced power plan settings dialog, or set them directly with the help of powercfg.exe utility (which is a part of Windows). And user can unhide any power plan setting either through registry or through powercfg.exe.

You can quickly check with parkcontrol and you will see if its parked or not and disable there.. https://bitsum.com/parkcontrol/ EDIT: although now I see Skylake has this new feature.. Guess it "needs" a tweak then Quote: Core Parking and Skylake Due to the inefficiencies of OS managed core parking, Intel took over core parking in its latest generation of CPUs, nick-named Skylake. These thus have different core parking settings. The most important may simply be the ON/OFF switch of its Autonomous Mode, though there is also an aggressiveness %. Autonomous Mode turns on/off the CPUs smart parking, but does NOT turn off OS managed core parking. To do that, use ParkControl or the usual ways. Download .REG Tweak to Unhide Skylake Power Options (for SkyLake CPUs only!) Importantly, Skylake adds an Autonomous mode that you turn on or off to disable core parking. Within this is a percentage to adjust its aggressiveness.
