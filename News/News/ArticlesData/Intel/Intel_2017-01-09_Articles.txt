Intel's ANV Vulkan Driver Now Supports Tessellation Shaders Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 10 January 2017 at 05:44 PM EST. 13 Comments In addition to Mesa's "ANV" Intel Vulkan driver getting Float64 shader support this week, another important addition has made it into the latest Mesa Git code. Tessellation control and evaluation shaders are now supported within Intel's ANV Vulkan driver. Obviously the Intel Mesa OpenGL driver had been supporting tessellation shaders for a while now, but up until now they weren't supported by the company's open-source Vulkan driver. The .tessellationShader bit was flipped on today with this commit after a lot of earlier work landed to the ANV driver as well as NIR and the SPIR-V code within Mesa. Other VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures not yet supported by the Intel ANV Vulkan driver include multiDrawIndirect, depthBounds, pipelineStatisticsQuery, shaderStorageImageMultisample, shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat, shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat, shaderInt64, shaderInt16, shaderResourceMinLod, variableMultisampleRate, and inheritedQueries. Some of those remaining features are big ticket items, but will hopefully be scratched off the list in time for more Vulkan Linux games arriving later in the year. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel's dying Atom chip takes a last gasp in Chuwi's cheap Surface Book clone Could this be the inexpensive, quality Windows tablet we've been waiting for? Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 11 January, 2017 09:47 0 - - - - print email I’d love to pay less for a lower-end Windows tablet—especially one that has the look and feel of a premium device like Microsoft’s Surface Book. That’s the category Chuwi is targeting, snatching up the remnants of Intel’s Atom lineup and stuffing them inside a line of 2-in-1 devices that bear a resemblance to the Surface Book. In fact, Chuwi’s Hi13 offers exactly the same dimensions and screen size as the Surface Book, which costs at least $1,500. In addition to its 13.5-inch screen with 3000x2000 resolution, the Hi13 includes 4GB of RAM and Windows 10 Home. The Surface Book, though, uses Intel’s pricey Core chip, while Chuwi’s Hi13 features the far cheaper Apollo Lake Atom. Launched last year at IFA, Apollo Lake uses Intel’s new Goldmont architecture, and straddles the desktop and the mobile space, with both the Pentium and Celeron lines.  Why this matters: What makes this announcement particularly intriguing is Chuwi’s build quality, which was evident in the company’s earlier (and otherwise unimpressive) HiBook. The Hi13 looks to be a straightforward detachable Windows tablet, that will likely deliver minimal performance in specialized applications. But I confess to being somewhat obsessed with finding a solid low-end Windows tablet, and this one shows promise.  (The earlier 10-inch 2-in-1 HiBook cost about $250 for both tablet and keyboard. We expect Chuwi to price the Hi13 at slightly more than that, but we don’t know the official price yet.) ’Good enough’ computing Intel’s Atom struggled to find a niche, as it consumed too much power for phones and couldn’t upend the ARM chips found in Android tablets. As a result, Intel killed off its remaining Atom chips for smartphones and even tablets, rendering Apollo Lake the last 6-watt option for 2-in-1 devices. While Apollo Lake is manufactured on the same 14nm process as Cherry Trail, its predecessor, the new chip’s base clock speed actually dropped to just 1.1GHz. (We reviewed Chuwi’s Cherry Trail-based tablet, the Chuwi HiBook, and Intel’s ARK tool provides a comparison between its Z8300 chip and the new Celeron N3450.) The key will be how long the new Celeron Atom can maintain burst mode, as its clock speed can climb to 2.2GHz, far above the 1.8GHz burst of the earlier chip. The new Apollo Lake chip also includes a more powerful HD Graphics 500 Core, though we doubt you’ll be playing Battlefield games on the new tablet. Basically, this device populates the space of “good enough” computing: As performance continues to climb in the high-end, low-end chips will satisfy more and more customers while maintaining a low price. I’m eager to test a Hi13, and to compare it to the upcoming lineup of Windows 10 tablets that use Qualcomm’s processors. Let’s hope for the same level of competition in the low-end PC space as we’re expecting between Intel’s Core and AMD’s Ryzen!

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The line between Pentiums and Core i3s is blurring with the release of Kaby Lake Pentium chips, though. Eagle-eyed Hardware.info forum user J_C_W spotted the HT-enabled Pentiums in Intel's ARK and tipped off his forum mates to the change. Here's a list of the SMT-enabled Pentiums arriving with Kaby Lake: Pentium G4560 Pentium G4560T Pentium G4600 Pentium G4600T Pentium G4620 Aside from the clock speed boosts common to many Kaby parts and the addition of Hyper-Threading, there's little difference between these chips and their Skylake counterparts. In its endless march to segment its product lineup, however, Intel has decided to cut out ECC RAM support from these CPUs. That could annoy folks who relied on Pentiums to power home servers or NAS boxes. The lower-end G4560 and G4560T models come with Intel's HD Graphics 610 IGP, while the more expensive chips come with the HD Graphics 630 processor. The only difference we can spot based on the information in ARK is a 50-MHz clock speed deficit in the HD Graphics 610 when compared to the 630's 1.10 GHz max frequency, though it's possible that there are also differences in shader count in play. We published a story about rumors of a multiplier-unlocked Core i3 back in November. That story mentioned the possibility that HT-enabled Pentiums and Core i3s with Intel's Turbo Boost could appear. Thus far, no Turbo Boosting Core i3 CPUs have been released, but the unlocked Core i3-7350K is real.  The addition of Hyper-Threading could make the Kaby Lake Pentiums a bit more attractive for usage in an entry-level gaming system, and it's entirely possible they may eventually find their way into some budget builds in our System Guide.   Tags: CPUs User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Intel's Joule 570x and 550x are powerful computer boards that can be built as a PC, or be used to build robots, drones, or smart devices. But Intel is now seeking government certification so the boards can be cleared for shipment in those countries. Joule shipments have currently been blocked in a number of countries, including Taiwan, Japan, and Israel, all of which have active technology markets where hobbyists design hardware. Users that have ordered Joule boards from retailers abroad can't receive shipments in the blocked countries. China is not listed on the page describing the blocked shipments, and Intel can ship and sell the device in Hong Kong. Intel is currently going through the certification process in blocked countries, which may take some time. The Joule boards are on sale in countries like U.S. and Canada, where the certification process was quick. Device makers have to get certifications from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory agencies before putting hardware on sale. Some of the certifications depend on the communications technologies and materials used to make the board. Intel couldn't provide a specific date on when Joule shipments will start in other countries. However, as the boards are certified in countries, shipments will start. Intel will keep its website updated to signify where the Joule boards are available, a company spokesman said. Joule is similar to the Raspberry Pi 3 and targeted at hobbyists and device makers, but it is more powerful. It also has features not found on Raspberry Pi 3 like 4K video and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The boards are based on Atom x86 processors. The first Joule to go on sale was the 570x, back in August. It is priced at US $219 on Mouser. Recently, the 550x went on sale for $179. The boards can also be bought with development kits, but that costs more.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto</p> <p>Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include http://fusion.net/story/364420/twitter-abuse-filter/ hashtag] viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. </p> Panelists: Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #mozSS Previous Speakers November 16: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation, with Ashley Good, Fail Forward Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, November 16 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation When you start a new job or project, you envision exciting things you and your team will accomplish together. When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here.

Name: Subject: Message: Here are the top trends we witnessed at CES 2017 Features Newsby John Callaham5 days ago 3 296 4 CES 2017 is now in the history books, but the massive trade show in Las Vegas revealed some of the trends we can expect to see in the gadget world for the next 12 months. So what did we see that will become a “thing” in the new year? Read on to find out. VR is slowly getting cheaper and ditching wired connections Hardcore virtual reality for consumers finally showed up in the real world in 2016, with the launch of the PC-based HTC Vive and Oculus Rift headsets, along with the PlayStation VR hardware for the PS4 console. At CES 2017, we saw that companies were trying to get rid of those pesky wires, with HTC’s third-party solutions and the promise of a WiGig solution, in partnership with Intel, later this year. Intel also showed off its updated wireless Project Alloy mixed reality headset as part of its CES 2017 presentation, with the promise that some OEMs will launch products based on the design by the end of 2017. At the same time, Microsoft also promoted cheaper PC VR headsets with wired connections. Microsoft says that companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo and others will begin selling these headsets for as low as $400 in 2017. That’s much lower than the current price of the Vive or Rift, but we will have to wait and see how they perform, as none of the prototypes shown at CES actually worked. We even got an announcement of AR/VR smartglasses coming from ODG that will be released later in 2017, which will be powered by the upcoming high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Curved is out and thin is in for TVs The curved TV trend that has been around for the past couple of years seems to be disappearing. CES 2017 was all about getting flat-screen TVs to be as thin as you could get. Indeed, LG showed off TVs at the show that were so thin and light, they have to be placed on walls with magnets. CES also showed that more smart TVs will be using AI to help out. Amazon announced that a number of TVs will be using its Fire TV operating system, which also connects to its Alexa digital assistant. Xiaomi also showed a super-thin TV, the Mi TV 4, that will use AI to help its owners find the best content currently available for their particular tastes. AI assistants like Alexa are trying to come in your home and car We have already written about how Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant seemed to be everywhere at CES 2017. A number of connected devices for the home and for cars will be using the AI. The idea is that you will be able to lock your doors, raise or dim your lights, or start your morning cup of coffee without having to lift a finger. Alexa was not the only AI assistant that was shown at CES. The Google Assistant is being incorporated into the new version of the NVIDIA Shield Android TV set-top box, and Microsoft said it was working to bring its Cortana assistant into cars as well. Electric and self-driving cars are all the rage CES has always been a place for new consumer technology in cars, and this year’s show was no different. This time, however, the focus was on bringing both electric and self-driving cars closer to reality for most consumers. We finally got to see the once mysterious Faraday Future FF91 electric car, and more EV cars from Fiat Chrysler and Nissan were shown off. We even got to see a demo of an upcoming fast charging electric car station at the show. Self-driving car prototypes were shown at CES 2017 by NVIDIA, and BlackBerry also revealed plans to develop technology for making self-driving vehicles as well. Of course, most of these demos are for concepts that are still years away from actually being available, but it shows that the trend toward smart, electronic self-driving cars is not going away anytime soon. The Windows PC platform is still very much alive CES 2017 showed that good old-fashioned Windows PCs can still generate a ton of excitement when they are offered in new ways. At the show, we saw a ton of new and upcoming thin-and-light notebooks that also offer all-day battery life, including one from Samsung. The 2-in-1 trend for touchscreen notebooks and tablets also shows no signs of slowing down, as many of those models are in the works from Dell, Lenovo and others. We even saw one upcoming business notebook from Dell that supports wireless charging. At the other end of the PC spectrum, the hardcore gamers could check out the $9,000 Acer Predator 21 X, a notebook with a huge, and curved, 21-inch screen and desktop PC graphics cards. There were lots of high end 4K and even 8K PC monitors shown at CES. Razer even showed a gaming laptop concept with three displays (yes, three) that folded up into one relatively thin case. Smartphones were not a big focus This has been the case in past CES shows, but the 2017 event only had a few major announcements in the Android smartphone industry. Huawei revealed its unlocked Mate 9 phone’s official US launch date and ASUS showed off two upcoming devices; the ZenFone 3 Zoom, with its 500mAh battery and its dual rear camera, and the ZenFone AR, with its support for both Google’s Daydream VR and its Tango AR technology. There were other smartphones announced at CES, but they were in the mid-to-low budget range. Just like previous years, the smartphone industry is waiting until the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona in late February to make a number of major flagship reveals. Conclusion All in all, CES 2017 was a show that put a spotlight on how technology and devices continue to connect with each other, with the help of digital assistants, and that the arrival of virtual reality is still something that needs to find a focus. In the meantime, PC and smartphone companies still have a huge part to play in current technology trends. What are your overall impressions of what was shown at CES 2017? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. Any interesting trends we didn’t mention?

During the show we also got a chance to see a demo of how Alexa, combined with a smart hub from Intel, could be used in a tiny 210 square foot home. See also: Will AI be the next big smartphone feature? 6 days ago Yes, the small home trend that you may have seen on TV shows like Tiny House Nation on HGTV made it to CES last week. In this case, Intel used their version of a tiny home to show how a number of things could be controlled with voice commands. With an Amazon Echo connected speaker and an Intel smart hub, we got to see how a potential owner of this small house could control the lights, locks and even the BMW parked outside with voice commands. The Intel smart home hub will allow the owner of this tiny house to issue more complex commands that will activate multiple devices at once. For example, saying just one command will put the house in a “movie time” mode. The blinds went down, the lights were turned off and a screen also came down. Finally, a TV projector was turned on so you could begin your home theater experience. If you were sleeping and woke up to begin your day in this small home, you could say, “Hey Alexa, turn on Good Morning”. The blinds would then come back up, lights would turn on, the thermostat would raise the temperature and even your morning tea kettle would start heating up water. All of this showed how people with a bunch of connected smart devices could get them to work together in combination with Alexa and Intel’s hub. It’s something that would have been shown in a sci-fi movie just a few years ago but is now a reality, and we suspect more and more homes, in tiny, normal and large sizes, will incorporate this technology in the next few years. What are your impressions of this tiny smart home shown at CES 2017? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Existing investors Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates (NEA) also participated in the round. Above: Name that object. Founded out of Seattle in 2014, Spare5 has hitherto partnered with big-name companies such as Microsoft, Pinterest, and IBM, among others, who provide the Spare5 community with “tasks” — these generally focus on identifying the meaning of media assets such as photos, videos, and audio. For example, someone may be presented with a picture of a landscape, and they would have to tell the system what the mountain is, and whether the large body of water it identified is a lake. It’s all about improving companies’ in-house AI efforts such as computer vision and natural-language processing. Moving forward, the company will be known as Mighty AI, and in addition to the funding round, it has signed deals with Intel and Accenture. Both companies will work on behalf of Mighty AI to sell and promote its so-called “training data as a service” (TDaaS) offering to their own customers around the world. Prior to now, Spare5 Mighty AI had raised around $13 million in funding, and with its latest cash injection it will push to grow its TDaaS platform and network of individuals who carry out the microtasks, according to a company statement. It will also bolster its in-house team of data scientists, engineers, and sales specialists. AI is increasingly touching on just about every facet of society, from the workplace to customer service and everywhere in between. While AI systems are becoming more intelligent and “aware,” they’re not quite at the stage of being able to teach themselves — there are things that only humans are able to decipher and detect. And this is what Mighty AI is promising companies: human input that’s tailored to suit whatever AI system they’re looking to build. “In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better,” said Mighty AI CEO and founder Matt Bencke. “AI will manage our information, schedules and energy use. It will make our factories, roads and homes safer and more efficient. It will provide us each with a personal shopper and investment advisor. But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops.” Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 10, 2017 at 11:00AM In a recent interview with CNBC, Brian Krzanich, CEO of microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), highlighted the fact that between 60% and 75% of the company's chips are manufactured in the United States and that the company exports 75% of its products. Image source: Intel.  "We're the second largest exporter in the United States, so we consider ourselves kind of the role model manufacturer," Krzanich said. The interviewer then asked Krzanich the following question: "What do you want to see policy-wise that's going to help Intel to do more exporting to the rest of the world?" Krzanich responded with the following: "The real answer is not a trade war, is not restrictions; it's really about making the U.S. more competitive -- lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here, all of that discussion. That's what will bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and/or make it stronger in the U.S." With all of that in mind, it's important to recognize that there's not a lot that the new administration can do to help Intel increase the number of manufacturing jobs that it creates because of one simple fact: Intel isn't seeing enough demand to justify new factories in the U.S., or elsewhere. Remember Fab 42? Chip manufacturing companies put in chip manufacturing capacity commensurate with where they believe demand will be over the next couple of years. If the company thinks demand will grow significantly, then it will start putting in capacity to support that growth. If the company expects demand for their chips to be flat to down, then it's not going to invest in building out additional capacity, since it would be expected to sit idle, hurting the company's financial results. Indeed, that's exactly what happened with Intel's Fab 42. In 2011, Intel announced that it would be building "a new $5 billion-plus factory in Arizona." The plant was supposed to be "the most advanced, high-volume semiconductor manufacturing facility in the world," says the company, and that it would create "thousands of construction and permanent manufacturing jobs at Intel's Arizona site." Three years later, Intel announced that it wouldn't be completing the factory. The reasoning behind this decision was obvious: The demand that Intel expected to enjoy when it first started to manufacture the plant back in 2011 simply didn't materialize. What this meant is that although the manufacturing plant itself was "built," Intel did not fit it with the expensive chip manufacturing equipment required to produce chips. The good news is that this means Intel doesn't have to deal with the high depreciation costs associated with a fully equipped-but-idle manufacturing plant, but the bad news is that all of those "permanent manufacturing jobs" simply never happened. So, how can Intel bring more manufacturing jobs to the U.S.? The truth is that if Intel wants to create more manufacturing jobs in the United States, it's going to need to sell a lot more chips than it does now. I don't see Intel needing to equip an all-new factory with its core microprocessor businesses (PC, server, Internet of Things). Significant volume growth for Intel is going to need to come from sales of non-volatile memory products, and to that end, Intel recently converted its logic factory in Dalian, China, into a NAND and 3D XPoint memory factory. Or it will have to come from large orders to build chips for others. Perhaps one day Intel will have good reason to equip Fab 42 with expensive chip manufacturing equipment and create many permanent manufacturing jobs, but the prospects of seeing that happen in the near term aren't good.

Share story By Rachel Lerman Seattle Times business reporter Spare5, a spinout from Madrona Venture Labs, is changing its name on the heels of inking new partnerships with Intel and Accenture. The Seattle startup, which uses humans to fine-tune artificial intelligence engines, will now be known as Mighty AI. The name change comes at the same time as a new $14 million funding round, raised from Intel Capital with participation from Google Ventures, Accenture Ventures, Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group and New Enterprise Associates. Mighty AI uses machine-learning technology and actual humans to look through data and make sure it is accurate and being collected correctly.

Intel and Accenture will market and sell the startup’s products to their customers. Spare5 launched in 2014, and quickly debuted an app that recruited people to complete short tasks in their spare time. The company also sent a note to people that use its app, assuring them nothing would change. “We are not changing or altering your account, tasking, or earnings history in any way,” the company wrote in an email to app users, called “Fives.” The Spare5 app, which is keeping that name, pays people small amounts of money to complete short tasks, such as identifying objects in pictures. The tasks help Spare5 partners “clean” their data. Rachel Lerman: rlerman@seattletimes.com; on Twitter @rachelerman.

More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Powering the new XPS 13 2-in-1 is a choice between a 3.2GHz Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor or a 3.6GHz Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor, both 7th-generation Kaby Lake silicon, and both featuring Intel HD Graphics 615. Despite packing the latest silicon, Dell has designed the new XPS 13 2-in-1 to be completely fanless. RAM options span 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB dual-channel LPDDR3, while storage options go from a basic 128GB SATA all the way up to 1TB PCIe SSD with Intel RST. On the battery front, the 46WHr pack is good for up to 15 hours when combined with the full HD display. There is also a webcam, a fingerprint reader that's Windows Hello-compliant, a couple of USB Type-C ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, microSD card reader, display port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

There's also a built-in kickstand, a soft keyboard, and stylus support. Again, just like the Surface Pro 4. There is one place where the Latitude 5285 deviates away from the Surface Pro, and that is the display. Microsoft opted for a pricy high-resolution 2736 x 1824 panel, while Dell went gone for a more traditional - and cheaper - 1920 x 1080 option. It's an interesting corner for Dell to cut in order to scrape in some additional revenue. On the connectivity front there are two USB Type-C ports, a single USB 3.0 port, one microSD card reader, a micro-SIM slot (in selected models), and a connector for a keyboard. Coming February.

It starts with a 21-inch 2560 x 1080 resolution curved IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Powering this monstrous display is Intel's 3.9GHz seventh-generation Intel Core i7-7820HK silicon powerhouse, dual GeForce GTX 1080 X graphics cards, four DDR4 slots that can hold a maximum of 64GB of RAM, up to four 512GB solid-state drives (two of which can be NVMe PCIe SSDs which are five times faster than SATA SSDs), and a single hard drive bay which is home to a 1TB unit. But that's not all. There's a full-sized mechanical keyboard featuring Cherry MX Brown key switches with customizable backlight options, a numeric keypad that flips over to reveal a precision touchpad, four speakers and two subwoofers, two power supplies, five AeroBlade cooling fans, and nine heat pipes. All this is packed into a black shell that looks like it's been hacked out of granite or marble, which brings the total weight of the package to 19.4 pounds. All you need is a spare $8,999 and this beast can be yours. More information.

You get everything that you'd expect from a high-end system -- plenty of ports, a claimed 16 hours of battery life, an SD card slot, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics chip powering the graphics. There's as a stylus and touchscreen display for those who are artistic or just like jabbing at things with their fingers. But as I've already said it's not cheap -- a 13.5-inch system equipped with a 6th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD will set you back a cool $2,400. More information.

Unfortunately, while the Surface Pro 4 comes with a stylus, the Type Cover keyboard is an optional extra, adding an extra $130 to the price. An Intel Core m3 system with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD costs $900 (excluding Type Cover keyboard), but I'd recommend spending an additional $100 and getting the 6th generation Intel Core i5 model.

Continue Reading Mighty AI segmentation mask for autonomous driving Relaunching as Mighty AI reflects the company's core business of delivering the human insights artificial intelligence (AI) engines need to see, hear, talk and "think" like people. Its Training Data as a Service™ (TDaaS™) platform helps businesses obtain the datasets they need to train and scale their computer vision and natural language models. "In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better," said Mighty AI Founder and CEO Matt Bencke. "AI will manage our information, schedules and energy use. It will make our factories, roads and homes safer and more efficient. It will provide us each with a personal shopper and investment advisor. But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops." Mighty AI will use the new funding to extend both its TDaaS platform and community of Fives—a network of tens of thousands of individuals who conduct microtasks in their spare time, such as identifying and labeling objects in images or doing sentiment analysis of text. With the funding, Mighty AI will also grow its team by adding new data scientists, engineers and product, sales and marketing professionals. "As our CEO, Brian Krzanich, has said, AI is not only the next big wave in computing; it's the next major turning point in human history," said Doug Fisher, Intel Corporation Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Software and Services Group. "Intel is investing in AI, with the goal of driving breakthrough performance while making AI solutions more accessible and easier to deploy for all. We see a significant opportunity across applications such as automated driving, robotics, healthcare and the Internet of Things. To produce high quality data for training models to deploy, it is essential to obtain clean, accurate human annotations at scale. With today's announcement, Intel is pleased to team with Mighty AI to power the world's AI engines, operating on Intel® architecture and guided by Mighty AI's training data platform." "As a leader in applying AI to both our own business and our clients' businesses, we know that AI will drive the next wave of business and societal transformation," said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's Chief Technology & Innovation Officer. "Data is the fuel required to power AI solutions, but many clients lack the right tools and solutions to achieve the business value they are looking for from their AI initiatives. By teaming with Mighty AI, we see a great opportunity to break this bottleneck, accelerate the integration of training data, and drive better business outcomes more rapidly." Mighty AI's agreements with Intel and Accenture gives customers better access to tools and services across the AI stack, also known as the four components of any AI model: The infrastructure, such as the chips Intel builds; The large-scale mathematical algorithms that process tremendous amounts of calculations in parallel to "think;" The training data that turns these blank slates into simulations of human knowledge; and The application of the resulting AI models in interfaces that make it easy for people to use. With the new agreement, customers of Accenture and Mighty AI will get a more streamlined experience as they execute across the full AI stack to apply their models. The formation of the relationship with Mighty AI was led by Accenture Ventures, which focuses on teaming with and investing in companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. "We couldn't be more excited to team with Intel and Accenture, both of which are second to none in their respective industries," said Bencke. "Our mission at Mighty AI is to tap the world's potential brainpower so that our customers' AI engines have heroic impact. Words matter, and today we declare that we operate the world's best platform to make our customers' AI models mighty, together with our industry-leading partners."

It won't be easy. A prototype drone at a Qualcomm lab in San Diego [Photo: Sean Captain] More from The Sensor Revolution The Everything Chip: Qualcomm's Plan To Power Drones, VR, Cars, PCs, And More The iPhone 7 Plus Is Easily Outselling Smaller iPhone 7, New Holiday Data Suggests Sean Captain 01.10.17 9:00 AM Remember "Intel Inside"? The ad campaign transformed a maker of components for beige boxes into a top consumer brand two decades ago. San Diego's biggest tech employer, smartphone chip provider Qualcomm, is still a long way from matching Intel's feat, both in name recognition and in revenue. But the company dreams of going much farther by being inside seemingly everything: smart cars, high-end fitness bands, VR headsets, smartwatches, AI systems, consumer and commercial drones, and internet-serving satellites. Qualcomm even thinks it can kick Intel out of PCs and server farms. It's shelling out tens of billions of dollars to achieve its heady ambitions. You might expect a flamboyant, aggressive CEO to be driving Qualcomm's ballsy charge for world domination. That doesn't describe my impression of the man sitting across from me in a spare conference room in early December, wearing jeans and a gray University of Michigan fleece (honoring the school where he got his masters degree in electrical engineering). Forty-seven years old, with bushy gray hair and smart looking, dark-rimmed glasses, Steve Mollenkopf has the quiet voice and cool demeanor of the engineer he is. Over 22 years, Mollenkopf worked his way up the ranks at Qualcomm and took over as CEO in March 2014. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf It wasn't an easy start. Qualcomm's hot new smartphone processor, the Snapdragon 810, was a bit too hot, according to some reports that it overheated in phones such as the LG G Flex2 and HTC One M9. (Qualcomm insists the chip performs fine.) The Chinese government was pushing an antitrust case over what it considered Qualcomm's excessive licensing fees for 3G and 4G cellular tech; and a big shareholder, hedge fund Jana Partners, was pushing to split the company in two—between its chip design and patent royalty divisions. And Taiwan's MediaTek, though smaller than Qualcomm, is rising to challenge it in the smartphone chip market. "I feel like this management team has been through a tremendous amount of major issues in a short period of time, probably faster than anyone I can think of," Mollenkopf says, calmly. He's leaning back in his chair with hands clasped around his knee. "We decided ultimately to do the biggest restructuring in the company's history. Then at the same time, we also repositioned the company and really changed the narrative of the company." That narrative, in essence: Powerful processors and wireless connections are going to be in tens, perhaps even hundreds of billions of new devices, and Qualcomm wants to provide chips for as many of them as possible. That requires remaking the company and starting, sometimes from scratch, in businesses already dominated by rivals. It wouldn't be the first time for Qualcomm to charge into industries it seems to have no business being in. Qualcomm has bought over $50 billion worth of companies since Mollenkopf became CEO. Instead of splitting, Qualcomm is swelling, buying over $50 billion worth of companies since Mollenkopf became CEO, including a pending $47 billion deal for Dutch chipmaker NXP. The tie-up will likely more than double Qualcomm's staff (even after some layoffs that Mollenkopf says will come) and extend its reach to cars, medical devices, home automation, wireless payments, and unsexy-but-important machines like point-of-sale terminals at store checkouts. In China, Qualcomm got back in business by paying a $975 million settlement and adjusting licensing fees. (However, a South Korean investigation recently charged anticompetitive practices that may result in an $865 million fine.) But even as Qualcomm takes on new challenges, Mollenkopf has been jettisoning projects that weren't clearly connected to its core chipmaking business, such as augmented-reality software platform Vuforia, which it sold in 2015. (A mural celebrating Vuforia still covered the side of a Qualcomm warehouse when I visited.) Altogether, the company has cut $1.4 billion in annual expenses, along with about 1,700 jobs. Smartphones And Beyond With the great big exception of Apple (which designs its own chips for iOS devices), Qualcomm dominates the high-end phone universe. Its top Snapdragon chips power flagship Android smartphones like the new Google Pixel, the HTC 10, Moto Z, and even many of Samsung's Galaxy S7 line, as well as the exploding Note 7. (Samsung uses both Qualcomm's and its own Exynos chips). Qualcomm also makes a fortune—likely about two thirds of its profits—from other people's chips through licensing fees on the cellular technologies it has developed. These include the CDMA wireless standard that powered 2G and 3G Verizon and Sprint phones for two decades, much of the 4G technology in phones around the world today, and—Qualcomm hopes—technologies that will get incorporated into the insanely fast 5G standard coming on line in the next four years. Like Apple, Qualcomm designs chips and hires other companies, such as Samsung, to make them. Intel and Samsung have to worry about reconfiguring their factories and having enough demand to keep them busy before they can introduce new chips. Qualcomm and Apple just pick whatever factory provides the best deal. "We don’t care exactly how full Samsung's fab is. We let them worry about it," says Keith Kressin, Qualcomm's senior VP for product management. Jumping between manufacturers has allowed Qualcomm to shrink its chips four years in a row. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 is 35% smaller and uses 25% less power than last year's top chips, the 820 and 821. (In buying NXP, however, Qualcomm will now own some chip factories.) Dominating one industry is no guarantee for the future. Intel owns the PC (and Mac) and server businesses, but its smartphone and tablet plans flopped. "I think Intel's sin was that they didn't listen to what Apple wanted," says Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. "They said, 'Here's what we have. Want some?'" Intel tried to wedge its processors, based on its design technology called x86, into mobile devices. But the mobile industry was using a chip type created by a British company called ARM. In the mobile market, everyone but Intel, including Qualcomm, builds ARM-based chips—the platform for iOS, Android, and the floundering mobile version of Windows. The phone business is still growing, especially in developing countries, but more slowly than it had been—in single-digit vs. double-digit percentages each year, according to market research firm Gartner. Qualcomm and other chip companies hope that gangbuster growth reminiscent of the go-go smartphone years will come for all those newly connected machines—clumped into a catch-all category called IoT, the internet of things. Mollenkopf believes that Qualcomm's smartphone chips will be perfect for all these new devices and even for the "cloud" of server farms that hold the IoT together. In every new category, it faces competition: Intel, for instance, is challenging Qualcomm on just about every front, such as drones, virtual reality, cars, and 5G wireless. And Qualcomm is way behind other companies on some fronts, like Nvidia for smart and autonomous cars. Not The Same Kind Of Sea Change As it tackles all these new markets, Qualcomm has to avoid the peril Intel met with phones: failing to convince customers that what it's selling, Snapdragon, is perfect for whatever they are looking to buy. But Mollenkopf dismisses the Intel parable: "Almost every other transition that people talk about—PC-to-smartphone, for example—it was a big technology change. What you had to be good at changed dramatically." Mollenkopf claims that's not the case today: The trend toward ever-smaller and more energy-efficient chips that phones engendered dovetails into the needs for other connected gadgets. "It's all really being disrupted by communication and low-power computing and the synthesis of many different technologies together," he says. A big part of this trend is the SoC—system on chip. A phone's CPU, graphics, modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other components, now including artificial-intelligence engines, are squeezed into a single chip to save space, money, and power, while boosting speeds (with shorter distances for electrons to travel). Those are benefits for any device. "You can use the [technology] roadmap from cellular to really help out automotive and internet of things," says Mollenkopf. Qualcomm's rivals also build SoCs. Prototype drones packing Snapdragon processors In San Diego, I visit a lab full of consumer drone prototypes. About a half dozen 3D-printed models sit on a workbench; a few steps away, engineers test image-stabilizing algorithms for drone-mounted cameras. The drones run on the Snapdragon 801 SoC, Qualcomm's top smartphone chip from 2014. Qualcomm has to build working models of drones, headsets, and other products to figure out elements like software needed to make its phone chips work in them, says Raj Talluri, who runs Qualcomm's IoT division. Only then can it pitch the chips to companies making the devices. The $599 Hover Camera Passport drone, from Chinese company Zero Zero Robotics, is in a growing category of selfie drones that can hover steadily in front of people, able to recognize and lock onto faces to take photos, and even follow people as they move about. Most drones don't run on Snapdragon, yet they can be quite sophisticated. The Phantom 4 and Mavic Pro drones from Chinese drone maker DJI use the Myriad 2 machine-vision chip from a startup called Movidius (now owned by Intel) to rapidly recognize people it's following or to map a safe flight path over rough terrain. Qualcomm is making some progress: Tencent, Zerotech, Pegatron, Nine Eagles, and Sunly have announced plans to build drones on the Snapdragon Flight chips-and-software platform. Those aren't household names, but the business is wide open. "There aren’t any dominant chipmakers in the drone market, as it’s still very fragmented," says Gartner analyst Mark Hung. Part of Qualcomm's pitch is that the same Snapdragon capabilities can serve many types of products. The Snapdragon VR820, Qualcomm's prototype VR headset, is powered by a built-in 820 chip. That makes it self-contained, in contrast to headsets that rely on a tethered computer, like Facebook's Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, and those that make you snap in a smartphone, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View. Qualcomm's prototype VR headset With a camera on the front of the VR820 headset, the same image recognition that a drone uses to spot and avoid obstacles can also reference nearby objects to figure out where someone wearing the headset is and how far they move. The technology can also recognize and transpose real-world hand movements into the virtual world. Trying it out, I could not only look up and down or side to side; I could also step toward or away from 3D characters, which appear closer or farther as I move, and look above or underneath them. Most other VR systems require external devices like infrared beacons around the room in order to track the wearer, and they require holding controllers to read hand movement. As with drones, Qualcomm wants others to make their own headsets based on the VR820 design. Chinese companies Coocaa, Focalmax, Pico, and Whaley have announced plans to build VR820 headsets, all for the Chinese market. Once again, Intel is right there. In August 2016, it showed off a very similar headset design called Project Alloy, including the same type of movement tracking. But Intel is a bit behind: It won't have the developer kits until the spring, and no one has committed to using the tech in consumer products. No matter how good the technology, both chipmakers will have a challenge breaking into an already crowded market. Intel's Project Alloy headset Qualcomm is jumping into a market that's in its infancy even compared to VR: mixed-reality glasses that superimpose a screen over the wearer's view of the world. San Francisco-based Osterhout Design Group will put the new Snapdragon 835 in its R-8 and R-9 "smartglasses." They promise to actually do what people expected of Google Glass—blend the real and online worlds together in one view. Mollenkopf doesn't get overly exuberant about drones, VR, and other "high-complexity, smartphone-like" consumer gadgets, as he calls them. These are, "things that people believe generally will happen," he says. "They don't know when. They are interested in them. They're wondering whether it's going to be the new smartphone or the new iPod or whatever." ODG's smartglasses incorporate Snapdragon processors. In more mature markets as well as emerging ones, Qualcomm is betting that ever more connected gadgets will require ever-more powerful processors. Take fitness trackers: The iconic Fitbits run on fairly low-end chips, called microcontrollers, typically made by STMicroelectronics. Qualcomm is an investor in Fitbit, though, and many other companies that it's banking will require more powerful chips. "We invest in companies that could be future partners or customers of Qualcomm. They don't have to use our silicon today," says Patrick Eggen, who manages the company's investment arm, Qualcomm Ventures, in the North America. It's invested hundreds of millions of dollars (the company doesn't reveal specific numbers) in startups pushing technologies that Qualcomm wants to get into, including drones, virtual reality, augmented reality, medical devices, and even satellites. Fitness trackers are getting more complex and resembling smartwatches, which have cellphone-like capabilities. (Polar's new fitness tracker, the M600, runs Google's Android Wear smartphone OS, though not on a Snapdragon chip.) "What started out as a simple job of tracking your steps…the expectation is increasing," says Talluri, mentioning features like touch screens. Qualcomm does provide Snapdragons to about a dozen smartwatches, including from Asus, Fossil, Huawei, LG, Michael Kors, and Samsung. All other brands are tiny compared to Apple's share of the market, though, and even the Apple Watch isn't an iPhone-like phenom. "We got strong feedback five years ago to not try this," admits Grob. Maybe Qualcomm's steepest uphill battle is for PCs—hardly machines of the future, but still a giant business. In December, Microsoft and Qualcomm announced a version of Windows that will work on the ARM-based chips that Qualcomm makes, and will be able to run all current Windows applications. (Microsoft's earlier attempt to put Windows on the ARM chips in some of its Surface tablets flopped because it couldn't run older apps.) "If you're [a company] that makes a high-end smartphone, then you have the process and technology to manufacture a thin laptop," says Matt Grob, Qualcomm's CTO. Like Mollenkopf, Grob is a longtime Qualcomm engineer, with 25 years at the company and 59 patents. Stocky, with dark hair, he's very soft-spoken, sometimes nearly whispering. "You can think of it like a smartphone with a laptop-size battery… so the battery life will be tremendous," he says. No one has announced plans to build Qualcomm PCs, but Grob says to expect ultra-thin, low-cost laptops by the end of 2017. Qualcomm is making the same kind of pitch for the server business—that its chips are smaller, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than Intel's. On the surface, Qualcomm's dream to push its incompatible chips into servers looks as fraught as Intel's attempt to get its incompatible chips into phones. "We got strong feedback five years ago to not try this," admits Grob. But a lot has changed, argues Gartner's Mark Hung. Internet giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are custom-building hardware and software for their server farms, and they might be up for trying new technologies, he says. Driving Ambitions Starting from the smallest consumer gadgets, Qualcomm now wants to increase its stake in the biggest: cars. Modern cars are packed with sensors and processors, and NXP makes scores of them: antilock brake controllers, tire pressure sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, radio tuners, Ethernet switches, keyless entry systems, and a lot more. Chipmaker CSR, which Qualcomm picked up in 2015 for $2.4 billion, also makes automotive components like Bluetooth and GPS chips. They provide the foundation that Qualcomm can top off with a Snapdragon chip. "We're good at all the non-car pieces that are going into the car and really changing how the car is architected, but we're not good at the car pieces," says Mollenkopf. Already, Qualcomm has sold over 340 million chips to over 20 carmakers, things like modems and other wireless components. It's still getting up to speed with smart cars, which started with "infotainment" systems. They power both navigation and entertainment features like streaming audio apps and Bluetooth connections to cellphones—platforms like Ford Sync, Apple Car Play, and Android Auto. Now smart cars are evolving into autonomous cars. Nvidia, which crashed and burned trying to get into cellphones, has been a lot smarter with cars. Its Tegra chips—which, like Qualcomm's Snapdragons, incorporate ARM technology—power the infotainment systems in cars from Audi, BMW, and Honda. Its autonomous car "supercomputer," the Drive PX 2, was picked by Tesla, which will use it to control its self-driving cars in the future. At this year's CES, Nvidia announced deals to put Drive PX 2 in Audi cars starting in 2020 and to co-develop an AI-powered car with Mercedes-Benz. As almost always, Intel is competing with Qualcomm here. Its Atom processors, which flopped in smartphones, are getting a second chance in car infotainment, already installed in 30 models. Intel also just announced its own autonomous car project, using both Atom and more powerful chips, called Intel GO. BMW is partnering with Intel on developing self-driving car tech, and the automaker strongly hinted that Intel GO will make its way into its iNEXT project for an electric, semi-autonomous car set to hit the road in 2021. In San Diego, I saw some concept cars Qualcomm was getting ready to show off at CES in early January. The star would be a Maserati Quattroporte gutted and rebuilt with Qualcomm chips packed inside. Qualcomm's infotainment chip, the 820A, powers features like safety cameras, GPS, and voice commands. Bluetooth chips embedded throughout the car don't just connect riders' cellphones; together with microphones, they track who is in the car, and where. (Only the person in the driver's seat has full control through voice commands.) The gutted interior of a Maserati being reconfigured as a tech show car. Qualcomm doesn't have a deal with Maserati; it just bought a car and tricked it out, including reverse-engineering Maserati's engine computer system—showing what it could do for companies if it can convince them to pair up. (It did similar with a Cadillac.) That is starting to happen. Audi's 2017 cars will run on Snapdragons, and at CES, Qualcomm announced a similar deal for Volkswagens starting in 2019. Automotive is another example of the hopeful, long-game approach. So far, Qualcomm barely registers in the autonomous-car market, but Qualcomm Ventures has been investing in companies that it hopes will build that market. One of them is Cruise, a San Francisco startup that makes sensors for autonomous cars. GM bought Cruise for about $1 billion in 2016 and is using the tech on the Chevy Bolt autonomous cars it's testing on the streets of San Francisco. Qualcomm is starting a research program in Germany that could develop technologies for autonomous cars, but it's far from having a platform as Intel and Nvidia do. Qualcomm has been building the artificial intelligence it will need for self-driving cars, drones, and other futuristic machines. In 2016, it added to its Snapdragon 820 smartphone chip a neural network capability called Zeroth, a name inspired by Isaac Asimov's robot laws. After the science-fiction legend created his first, second, and third laws about how robots should behave, he added a new law, called the Zeroth, to precede them all—that a robot may not harm humanity. "We found that no one had trademarked it or even knew what it was. It was perfect!" says Grob. Qualcomm later decided the term was a bit esoteric, though, and it settled on the sedate "Qualcomm Machine Learning Platform." The Sky Might Not Be The Limit Wireless is where Qualcomm made its fortune. And no matter which new tech categories matter most in the future, it will remain mission-critical for Qualcomm. The company got lucky with its first invention, called code division multiple access—CDMA. The technology allows cellphone towers to transmit multiple calls at once by assigning each call its own encryption code. The phones on the other end decrypt only the data packets meant for their call. CDMA challenged the prevailing technology, called GSM, which instead divided calls by assigning bits of each one into tiny time slots. Most of the world stayed with GSM, in part because it was a free, open standard. Qualcomm owned CDMA technology and charged licensing fees. But Sprint, Verizon, and a smattering of other companies around the world opted for CDMA, and Qualcomm got rich on the fees. An early prototype CDMA phone Qualcomm then bought up rights to a technology called OFDM that formed the basis of 4G wireless (and will for 5G, too), and the world paid Qualcomm licensing fees. LTE has come very far since it was introduced with a maximum speed of about 12Mbps back in 2010. As speeds grew, so did the name; the latest version, called LTE Advanced Pro, will have a top speed just shy of a gigabit per second and be in Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 and its platform for smart cars. Many of the tricks that went into that speed explosion, like combining five or more signals to carry more data, will be the foundation of 5G. "It's still based on OFDM. Patent-wise, Qualcomm…is still a significant player," says Akshay Sharma, who tracks wireless tech for Gartner. OneWeb can potentially bring Qualcomm billions of new customers. 5G's final form will come from collaborations between many companies in an international standards body (called 3GPP). But Qualcomm is trying to assure a big role through facts on the ground. In October, it came out with the first 5G chip, the X50 modem, even though the standard won’t be fully baked till likely some time in 2018. The X50 is designed for trials, so gadget makers and networks can get a sense of which technology ideas work and which ones don't. In the process, they will get used to Qualcomm's 5G technologies—maybe improving the chances that its royalty-earning technologies make it into the 5G standard. Guess who's right behind? Intel, which launched its own chip, simply called "5G Modem," at CES, saying it will be ready for tests in late 2017. Qualcomm's plans go above the atmosphere to OneWeb, a project to blanket the Earth with internet access using a fleet of 648 small, mass-produced satellites. Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm's chairman and Mollenkopf's predecessor as CEO, serves on the OneWeb board along with Richard Branson and tech captains like Airbus CEO Thomas Enders and SoftBank chairman Ronald Fisher. "It's one of our bigger projects," says Grob. Qualcomm's cellular modems will be in the solar-powered ground stations that connect to the satellites and link in devices on the ground through Wi-Fi and small cellular networks. Qualcomm also designed the antenna systems throughout, from base stations to satellites, and its modems will likely be in the second-generation of spacecraft, says OneWeb. The satellites, expected to launch beginning in 2018, will also provide internet connections to planes, cars, and ships. Altogether, OneWeb could potentially bring Qualcomm billions of new customers. A Dash Of Hubris However all its plans turn out, Qualcomm has already succeeded at one thing: being really ambitious. Some schemes, such as getting into mobile gear like VR headsets, seem like a natural expansion from phones. Others, like tangling with Intel on PCs and servers, seem almost cheeky. But being cheeky has served Qualcomm well in the past. In 1993, the company, which at the time made satellite-connected text-messaging machines for truckers, crashed the cellphone party. A novice in the burgeoning field, it had the hubris to say that its new technology, incompatible with everyone else's, was better and that people should pay extra to license it. Enough companies did. Now Qualcomm is a giant in 4G, and its prospects for 5G are strong. Qualcomm's first product, a satellite-based communications system for truckers In 2007, when Snapdragon debuted, Qualcomm was a nobody in the phone processor business. "I can remember sitting back in the mid-2000s timeframe and people said, "Yeah, you're good at the modem but you'll never, ever have a position in the smartphone,' because smartphones are all about—just name your technology—it's about CPU, it's about GPU, it's multimedia," says Mollenkopf. "We're number one in all those things today." Being daring also means making mistakes. One of them was Mirasol, an almost-impossible-to-explain display technology that promised LCD-like color image quality with E Ink-like power savings. (Pixels reflect ambient light and use power only when the image changes, instead of constantly refreshing, as LCDs, OLEDs, and other displays do.) Despite the promise, Mirasol never made it. The late, lamented Toq watch Qualcomm tried to keep Mirasol alive by using it in its own smartwatch brand, called Toq. Introduced in 2013, Toq never caught on, either. "It was so cool we maybe made a mistake and decided to sell it commercially, and it was not a good idea," says Jim Merrick, the director of marketing. "We don't make commercial products." With Mirasol, Qualcomm also broke with tradition by having its own factory, a Taiwan facility it sold in 2014. It didn't sell the technology, though. (Reports say that Apple is now developing display technology at the factory.) In all my conversations with people at Qualcomm, they didn’t shy away from admitting to failures—neither getting defensive nor wallowing in mea culpas. "Qualcomm doesn't get real amped up in the high points. It doesn’t get real low in the low points," Mollenkopf says. Qualcomm's low-key leadership over the years isn't a sign of timidity. As engineers, Mollenkopf, Grob, and their predecessors have the kind of quiet confidence from looking at the problem and doing the math. Sometimes that means admitting that the numbers don't add up. "We have the ability to change ourselves when we need to change ourselves, and a track record of doing it," says Mollenkopf. Never miss a story.

INNOVATE What CES 2017 Says About the Future of the Smart Home Movement From gadgets to thoughtfully created spaces, the smart home movement is taking a page from the wearables book. By Marley Kaplan Marley is passionate about technology and the impact it has on human communication, consumer behaviour and the media landscape. Leading innovation strategy across Fortune 500 brands, Marley shares insights to various publications and panels. In addition to her Inc Innovate column, Marley has contributed to Advertising Week NY, Campaign US, WPP's The Wire and more. In 2014, AlleyWatch named Marley one of the '21 People to Watch in Wearables’ for her consulting work with Intel. Marley earned her MA in Marketing in London, where she spent her early career in digital advertising roles. Keep up with Marley here. @MarleyLive Innovation Specialist@MarleyLive WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The smart home showing at CES 2017 lays out the future of the smart home industry --interior designers and architects will be called upon to join forces with technologists, much in the way that fashion designers and gadget developers have been co-creating wearables in recent years. While many manufacturing and technology companies have announced expanded partnerships at CES, the smart home industry might look to wearable fashion tech as a crystal ball of sorts. During my time as a consultant with Intel, I was witness to one of the first true wearable collaborations of a Silicon Valley technology company, Intel, and a high-end NYC fashion company, Opening Ceremony -- both at the top of their game in respective industries. The combined intelligence of these leaders developed in the co-creation of MICA, an intelligent smart bracelet with style. The luxury bracelet - made from materials including watersnake skin, pearls from China and Madagascan lapis stones - acts as a subtle personal assistant of sorts: alerting of pre-selected incoming calls, recommending restaurants nearby, and even notifying the owner when it's time to leave an event for the next appointment based on travel time. Collaborations in the smart home space have been brewing, such as Lutron's smart shades and lighting switches integrating with music system Sonos and voice technology Alexa by Amazon. The 360-degree integration allows users to leverage custom keypads and voice-activated controls in order to create lighting and music scenes to their liking, such as a wake up call with accompanying lighting and music scenery. Where voice technology and IoT are concerned, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) -- also the producers of CES -- released a new report in anticipation to the conference, stating that smart homes would be the "most popular means of Internet of Things engagement." Ikea's smart charging furniture integration, which launched last year, is an example of what a mass-market IoT design consideration looks like. Designed with form and function in mind, IKEA has developed a smart phone charging pad built into a table lamp. As technological capabilities grow exponentially, it will be the designer's role to incorporate meaningful and user-friendly integrations into our everyday objects. Scandinavia is synonymous with design. Petrus Palmer, CEO of HEM, a design studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, has been considering the role technology plays in the design industry. "In the same way as no one normal wanted to wear the Google Glass, no one will want to sit in a sci-fi sofa. And so, tech in furniture will surely be commonplace, but it has to be seamlessly integrated." Palmer tells Inc. An innovation in line with this sentiment that smart home creators are striving toward is Hyundai's "Mobility Vision," which debuted at CES 2017. The imaginative -- albeit symbolic futuristic illustration -- smart car model is designed to exist as an extension of a home's living space, blurring the lines between utility, form and function. Hyundai is re-imagining not only the automotive model, but also the meaning of personal space. Including a seating area, speaker system and detachable interior furniture, the reimagined automobile seamlessly docks as a living station in your home. Hyundai says their vision is to "blur the line between mobility and living and working space, integrating the car into the daily lives of users." Innovation requires collaboration -- incorporating consideration from experts in a diversity of relevant disciples -- along with a holistic point of view. Just as designers have continued to create designs to suit evolving living spaces, technologists have been developing code to improve the human experience. When the two train of thoughts combine, we will see the smart home market reach its full potential. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

TECHNOLOGY 9 Predictions for AI in 2017 The biggest tech companies in the world are devoting more and more resources to AI. By Babak Hodjat Co-founder and chief scientist, Sentient Technologies WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement 2016 was a banner year for artificial intelligence. Alpha Go's victory over Lee Sedol was perhaps one of the most important, but we saw advancements in self-driving cars, the continued embrace of bots and personal assistants for retail, adoption and competition around in-house assistants like Amazon Echo, along with frequent, sometimes weekly, breakthroughs on the academic side, mainly relating to machine learning. With the biggest tech companies in the world--Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and others--devoting more and more resources to AI, the momentum is going to increase. For those of us who've been in the field for a while, it's an incredibly exciting time. AI and Machine Learning have come to the fore in the recent past, but we believe that the next few years hold even more far reaching successes. So what advances will we be seeing exactly? With a little help from my friends Nello Cristianini and Andreas Gal, here are nine predictions for AI in 2017: We will start to accept that AI can sometimes be wrong In 1994, a man named Thomas Nicely found a bug in one of Intel's processors that could cause incorrect results when dividing a number. And though Intel calculated that the average user would hit this bug once every 27,000 years, press and consumers reacted very negatively. Intel had to eventually recall the processors at a cost of roughly a half billion dollars. As humans, we fundamentally expect machines to be flawless, and Intel's processor violated this basic belief. AI is not only inherently non-deterministic--a well-trained model is mostly right, but sometimes randomly wrong--but being non-deterministic is actually the core strength of AI. AI can often solve problems for which people don't know how to program a precise solution. The more "human-level" problems (voice recognition, image recognition) AI solves, the easier it will get for humans to relate to machines making mistakes since we make similar mistakes. This will help us adapt to this new world where machines make mistakes, just like us! (Not to mention it won't cost $475 million when they're wrong once in a great while). --Andreas Gal Expect false negatives in the Turing Test People ask me a lot about Turing Test. And what I keep saying is this question will simply not feel all that important as we start texting and chatting with bots at call centers or online. At some point, we will not even care who gets the job done, just so long as the job is done well. Meaning, if we're chatting with a customer service agent, it won't matter if it's a person or a bot, so long as our requests are handled. And increasingly, we won't know whether we're talking to a person or a machine. I suspect this means that the errors in Turing Test will not be false positives (labeling a computer as a person) but false negatives (interacting with a person while thinking they are actually a computer). --Nello Cristianini​ Increasingly, AI will author itself Recently, the biggest breakthroughs in AI have come about by virtue of AI experts and PhDs designing elaborate Deep Network architectures for tackling audacious problems. This trend will continue. But a new class of approaches will enlist AI itself to come up with the best architectures for tackling those problems. One approach showing early promise in this area is evolutionary computation (EC) which interestingly can also be used as a catalyst to massively distribute the process. Keep in mind: EC has already been used to automatically generate regular computer programs (Genetic Programming), not AI programs. This approach will also continue gaining more attention since the result of Genetic Programming is human readable, which has helped various AI systems pass regulations recently introduced in Europe. --Babak Hodjat AI will fundamentally alter the technology job market For the last decade, a computer programmer was the highest in-demand and highest paid job profile in the digital economy. Every year, they write billions of lines of code, design and implement algorithms and programs to solve new problems. But AI will fundamentally change this. That's because AI models can be trained to solve arbitrary new problems, without writing a single line of new code. What that means for computer programmers is a changed landscape where some of their work ends up with AI or data scientists. --Andreas Gal AI-designed products will come to market Imagine if you were able to buy a pair of shoes that are best suited for you by simply interacting visually with an existing inventory of shoes. Imagine every action that goes into training a designer to know precisely what you like. And imagine those shoes are one of a kind, unique to your preferences and sensibilities. That's coming. Today, AI has the ability to identify features of products in a brand's inventory. AI can also broker the interactions between consumers and the inventory, helping them discover the products they need. And, by tracking the feature sets most popular among different user groups, AI can come up with designs for new products that have a high likelihood of being popular to the public at large. --Babak Hodjat The interface between AI and the world--including us--will keep on improving In addition to working on the AI itself, 2017 will be the year when we really start tackling the interface between AI and the world. This will include conversational interfaces, speech, vision, question answering, text understanding, and a whole lot more. Take bots for example. The technological underpinnings for bots are still improving, of course, but the interface is where we'll start seeing real differentiation. This means that "content" for bots (skills, capabilities) will become a strategic issue. Alexa has opened up its platform to third parties, meaning they can create skills for Alexa, and Google has hired comedians to improve the interaction with Assistant, which will also be in Google Home and Allo. The race to introduce content into voice conversational assistants will result into more meaningful interfaces, as the meaning ultimately depends on their connectivity. --Nello Cristianini AI will enable devices to have digital "ears and eyes" Humans perceive their environment principally with their eyes and ears. For machines to interact with us, to understand us, and to be easier understood by us, they will start relying more and more on the same senses we use to understand our surroundings. As an example, today, fire detectors use a radioactive isotope to detect smoke particles in the air. In the future, the same fire detector will likely have several cameras that use AI trained on detecting the sight of fire. This will lead to earlier detection and a safer world for humans. --Andreas Gal AI running on devices will actually reduce privacy concerns Imagine if your security system could tell when you walk in and not force you to hurriedly switch the alarm off every time. Currently, to make this work, in-home systems need to send raw data (say from cameras in the home) to the cloud in order to sense what is happening around them. But the transmissions of those images have very legitimate privacy concerns. By processing and making decisions from the raw data at the point of need--instead of sending it to the cloud where the data can be vulnerable--AI can solve for those concerns. And as the processing power and memory available on IoT devices allow us now to run AI on top of our in-home devices, solutions like this will become more and more commonplace, as required response times for such decisions decrease, and applications encapsulate the decision/action loop locally. --Babak Hodjat Regulation of AI will start becoming a topic As 2017 sees more and more applications of AI, expect government to notice. After all, employment will start being affected by AI. Task crowdsourcing will continue to grow, and so will the automation of call centers, logistics, some aspects of retail. The concept shop developed by Amazon could be the wave of the future. Driverless cars will gain further acceptance. And, well, you get the idea. As a result, regulators will start looking a bit closer, and pressure groups might start campaigning for closer regulation of automated technologies, not just for their impact on employment, but for a range of issues. Another issue triggering regulation might be the aftermath of the fake-news story: are we going to hold platforms like Facebook responsible for their content? And if so, what is going to be their technological response? Are we going to like a technology that enables them to remove content considered unsuitable? --Nello Cristianini Published on: Jan 10, 2017 Advertisement

The first generation version has two RealSense cameras for tracking and room localization, an Intel Atom processor for vision processing, and the best available Wi-Fi tech to communicate with the host computer. It’s an ambitious project, maybe too ambitious, even for a silicon giant. To be clear, the first generation Alloy we spent time with is a very early design concept, and not one Intel plans to bring to market. That role will be filled by the Alloy Gen 2, which will cut down to one RealSense camera, and will replace the Atom chip with a dedicated Movidius motion coprocessor. Even that likely won’t be a product Intel itself sells for long. This technology is destined for partner headsets. More: Look ma, no wires! Intel’s Project Alloy gives VR full freedom of movement Its implications in the VR marketplace are much larger. You’ll have trouble finding anyone who argues that untethered and standalone headsets aren’t the future of the industry. Cutting the cord is one of a few major hurdles on our way to perfect immersion, but it still has a ways to go. Where we are today For now, Alloy is what Intel has, and it’s a little rough. The clarity of the headset wasn’t great, but that’s to be expected from a preview version of a headset. The real issue was tracking. Alloy scans the room ahead of time and creates a map, allowing it to replace the furniture and objects in the room with digital game objects. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite line things up correctly, and we found ourselves knocking knees and tripping over invisible objects frequently. The motion controller worked relative to where we held it, but didn’t associate correctly for point-and-click operation, and moving it outside a small area caused it to skip around and jutter. That’s not to say it’s all bad. If anyone is going to solve the problem of heavy cables connecting high-end HMDs, it should be Intel. The chip manufacturer has access to powerful RealSense cameras, infinite control over its own processors, and employees engineers experience with building platforms from the ground up. But Intel is not the only company trying to crack the secret of wireless VR. Oculus Oculus has an early concept, as well, the Santa Cruz protoype, which we saw at Oculus Connect this year. Like Alloy, Santa Cruz packs all of the necessary hardware inside the headset itself, and uses four cameras embedded in the front for tracking. When we spent time with the wireless HMD, it was clearly very early in the design process. It looked like a Rift headset, with a set of batteries and exposed circuit boards attached by tape. That version of the headset worked remarkably well, at least where tracking is concerned. Holographic, and the future Speaking of increasingly specific hardware, Windows Holographic is right around the corner, promising to bring everyone’s favorite OS to the mixed reality world. It’s another huge step towards solidifying the AR/VR community, but like Alloy, the HoloLens itself isn’t necessarily the most important part of that evolution. In the case of Windows Holographic, the partner headsets are likely to be much more common than Microsoft’s likely-expensive option. It’s also the first true full platform for productivity and computing in VR, although there are alternatives for a few programs that bridge the gap. The ultimate goal there is standalone computing, and more headsets means more options. You couldn’t walk two booths at CES this year without seeing a VR headset of some sort. Whether it was an HTC Vive or a Gear VR, last year’s hottest demo has become the norm, but that doesn’t mean work on the format is done. Wireless and untethered headsets, along with mobile phone-powered options that are growing more powerful every day, are going to continue to define most users’ interaction with VR. Oculus is buying startup The Eye Tribe for its advanced eye-tracking technology Oculus opens up pre-orders for third sensor, enabling room-scale VR Spec Comparison: Does the Rift’s Touch update make it a true Vive competitor?

Demecillo (staff@latinpost.com) First Posted: Jan 10, 2017 04:13 AM EST Share This Tweet This Gigabyte's RYZEN Motherboards Detailed!(Photo : YouTube/HardwareCanucks) Share This Tweet This At CES 2017, AMD bumps into Intel's best CPU that utilizes its seventh-generation Core processors, yet AMD has not been sitting still as it introduces of its Ryzen CPU that has high-end performance. AMD made the hardware industry shocked by demonstrating its Ryzen design that could compete with Intel's best. Currently, AMD has now uncovered more details about what executives call its most exciting processor in 20 years that include its brand name, clock speed, and the five basic "SenseMI" technology that make the chip so productive. PCWorld was there when AMD launched Ryzen PC's and its motherboard as they uncovered the deeper technical information of Ryzen and guaranteed to have a long-term support for the AM4 platform. Ryzen represents more threatening change over AMD's previous design with the new Zen chips that offers an entire 40 percent of improvement. It is a huge compelling than Intel's more conservative changes with its most recent generation of CPU's that concentrated on a smaller performance growth and better battery life. According to Digital Trends, AMD has an averaged of three to four years interval of every brand new designs, while Intel's technique will only bring about every two years of the interval in every brand new designs. AMD's primary concern is basically must present an amazing new performance metrics in every cycle since the new models must remain competitive for far longer. There are various leading motherboard producers that announced Ryzen-based components, with a sum of 16 AM4-based solutions that are prepared to connect to the new Ryzen desktop processors. Advertisement However, there are certain AMD Ryzen CPUs new details that are revealed at CES 2017, there is the army of Ryzen hardware which the AMD's new chips have the capabilities to offer various levels of features that the seller can do the adjustment just to provide truly differentiated hardware. A long life for AM4 motherboards, which AMD expects the AM4 platform will last until 2020. The AM4 motherboard's several chipsets are simply supported extra capacity, which gives a flexible approach for AM4 that gives space to develop in the years to come.   SEE ALSO Nokia 6 Release Date and News: Nokia 6 Premium Design with affordable Price, Exclusively release in China early this year 2017 Spyware App: Turned From Safety To Threat; Tips and Guidelines To Protect Your Phone Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe: A World-Class Premium Build With A Powerful Processing Capabilities As MacBook Samsung Latest Update: Samsung Flagship QLED TV Series Revealed on CES 2017 with Three Accessible Models TCL Unleash BlackBerry 'Mercury' at CES 2017, As TCL Shows off a 4-second Video about the Phone Through Twitter TagsAMD Ryzen CPU, CES 2017 News, AMD motherboards, Latest AMD processor Advertisement Advertisement © 2015 Latin Post.

March 2017 now looks most likely, although Tim Cook has been dropping some worrying hints... We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017: the new Mac Pro's release date, price, tech specs, design changes and new features by Karen Haslam | 10 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Tech specs Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro for 2017? And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Is there any chance Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013 and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. But when will Apple announce a new Mac Pro? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? There's some good news for expectant Mac Pro fans: code in Mac OS X El Capitan hints that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) could arrive soon. But nothing is certain at this point, and some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued. Whatever the future holds for the Mac Pro, in this article we will be looking at all the rumours surrounding the next update of the Mac Pro line: the new Mac Pro's UK release date and pricing, its expected design, and the new features and specs we hope to see in the next version of the Mac Pro. Updated, 22 December 2016, to include comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our New iMac rumours and our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Launch date We expect the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013, and it's been more than three years since it went on sale. It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. In the event Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro instead: a rather lovely new laptop with a customisable touch bar above the keyboard. (You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) Despite the lack of news about the new Mac Pro in October, we remain optimistic that Apple will refresh the line in the near future. A few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect this by the end of November, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it seems likely that March 2017 will see the Mac Pro updated alongside other Apple products. (However, we suspect the update will only involve spec/component bumps rather than a full-blown redesign of the Mac Pro.) Read more: iPhone 7 release date | iPhone 7 Plus release date New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell. If so, this would signify the end of the Mac Pro line, a line that was once the pride of Apple, but has now been neglected for three years.  New Mac Pro 2017 release date: El Capitan code hint Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. The current Mac Pro is similarly codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it's plausible that the code refers to a new version of the professional-level workstation. Another clue that this is the Mac Pro: the code hints that there are 10 USB 3.0 ports on the new machine, and only the Mac Pro has anywhere near that many ports. (Currently there are 4 USB ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro, while the iMacs have 4 USB and 2 Thunderbolt.) We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. More on that below. It's been well over a year since El Capitan was launched, and many Apple fans have now moved on to macOS Sierra. We'll update this if any smoking guns are discovered in the Sierra code. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: Delays in 2013/2014 When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: New delays We had hoped to hear new developments about a new Mac Pro, so we're growing impatient and are hoping for an update soon. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches  the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) It's possible, indeed, that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, rendering the actual Pro line irrelevant. As a thought experiment, TechRadar has imagined the specs of an 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling.  Many professional Mac users are still using old Mac Pros from pre 2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Those who did upgrade to the 'new' trashcan-like Mac Pro are also finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Tech specs Currently there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor described above, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. New Mac Pro specs: Ports The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code in the El Capitan beta actually suggests that the next generation Mac Pro will offer 10 USB 3.0 ports. Currently there are 4 USB 3 ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro. We think that it would make more sense if Apple adopts Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro - this standard of Thunderbolt supports USB Type-C and offers 40Gbps transfer speeds, so Mac Pro users would get the best of both worlds. Thunderbolt 3 offers double the speed of USB 3.1, which is only 10Gbps.   Another thing Apple could add is a Lightning port as seen on the iPhone. Yes really. There are rumours that the lightning port will be used on Macs for plugging in headphones which could allow for high-res audio. However, many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays, with Mac Observer noting that a 3.5in hard drive bay would allow for archival space to be added. New Mac Pro specs: Current processor The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. New Mac Pro specs: New Xeon E3-1205 v6 or Xeon E3-1585 v5 processor It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. Update (08/03/2016): After a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as Stormfront, Square Group, Solutions Inc, iStore, Western Computer, MR Systems, KRCS, HardSoft, and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2016-2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

(Photo: Gareth van Zyl) RELATED ARTICLES IN PICTURES: CES shows off latest 4K TVs, VR headsets Amazon’s personal assistant ‘Alexa’ coming to Huawei phones IN PICTURES: Tech giants preview new gadgets at CES Johannesburg - Digital assistants, virtual reality headsets and 4K televisions are this year’s hot technology trends as seen by the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The world’s biggest technology show, which this year turned 50 and saw a record 180 000 visitors, turned the US gambling capital into the centre of the technology world last week. READ: IN PICTURES - 50 years of gadgets at CES Technology giants - ranging from phone makers Samsung and Huawei to chip-maker Intel - teased their product offerings and planned developments for the year ahead. And the tech world, in a big way, is moving on rapidly from smartphones, which have defined and dominated the last decade since the launch of Apple’s iPhone in 2007. Below then are the key major trends that I witnessed while attending this year’s CES. Digital assistants Amazon’s personal assistant technology ‘Alexa’ is being built into every major gadget type possible. The cloud-based artificial intelligence tool - which can handle tasks such setting an alarm, building to-do lists; getting weather and traffic reports, and connecting to an array of smart home devices - was a big talking point at this year’s CES. Chinese PC and phone maker Lenovo announced that it was launching a smart home assistant powered by Amazon's Alexa. Meanwhile, another Chinese company, Huawei, laid out its plans to bolt on Alexa to the Huawei Mate 9 as part of its US debut sometime in early 2017. READ: Amazon's personal assistant 'Alexa' coming to Huawei smartphones Huawei's Consumer Business CEO, Richard Yu, announcing a tie-up with Amazon Alexa. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Alexa is even making its way into cars as Ford announced a partnership with the Amazon service.   Ford said it plans to let drivers ask Alexa to find destinations from their cars, control smart home devices, and, of course, order products from Amazon itself. Other big technology players such as Google and Apple already play in the personal assistant space with their respective Assistant and Siri tools. What will drive the adoption of this technology is the growing presence of the internet of things. Personal assistants will particularly have an impact in smart homes where switching off a light or activating an alarm can all be done through voice activated prompts on a smartphone. Virtual reality headsets Giant leaps are are being made in virtual reality technology as headsets get lighter and computer processors more powerful. A day before the kick-off of CES, chipmaker Intel held a press conference that mainly occurred in virtual reality. Upon arriving at the press briefing, media were presented with a black comfortable chair, an Oculus Rift headset, a laptop and a bag in case of possible nausea. READ: PICS - Intel teases new VR headset at CES For most of the briefing, Intel showed off how far virtual reality has come with 360 degree videos of a live basketball game, a live crossing to a drone flying over solar panels in Nevada and a video game featuring zombies. Intel showing off its new virtual reality headsets in the run-up to CES 2017. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) It’s clear that the opportunities for virtual reality are going to blow open in coming years, especially with sports content. Intel also teased the first version of its Project Alloy headset. The company said the headset, which is expected to go on sale later this year, will feature a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality. This means that it is capable of featuring immersive video content as well as augmented reality in which it projects computer generated images on real-life settings. Intel plans to tap partners in making and selling the device. Apart from Intel, virtual reality headsets could be seen at a range of other vendors stands at CES from Samsung to Panasonic and more. Google also announced key partnerships with Asian phone makers such as Huawei, ZTE and Asus to take forward its 'Daydream' virtual reality system. At this stage, it looks as if little can stop the virtual reality wave. READ: Asian phone makers flock to Google's VR 'daydream' Samsung with its virtual reality experience at a stand at this year's CES. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Other vendors also showed off VR headsets at a multitude of stands at this year's CES. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) 4K televisions While VR headsets are providing an immersive viewing experience, television makers - ranging from Samsung to LG and Hisense - have gone all out on making bigger and bolder 4K and QLED TVs - the latest buzzwords for the industry. Samsung launched its new QLED 4K lineup, which offers brightness, colour and other improvements over last year's high-end SUHD lineup. LG also debuted its ‘wallpaper-thin’ high-definition TV that measured 2.57mm thick in a 65-inch screen model. LG this year has gone big on its ultra-think, super high-definition televisions. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) South Africa and China’s biggest TV seller, Hisense, unveiled its plans to sell a 100-inch 4K laser projection TV system later this year. Hisense’s use of a projection system is set to provide a similar experience to that of 100-inch televisions but at lower cost, said the company. Using a short-throw projector, Hisense’s Laser TV projects a 4K HDR picture on an included screen via HDMI or USB. READ: Hisense unveils 100-inch 4K laser-projection TV It will be available later this year for $12 999.99 (R176 000) and Fin24 understands that Hisense is preparing to show off the television in South Africa soon. Hisense grabbed attention with its cheaper 100-inch projection TV system. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Big companies like Samsung are also tapping 'quantum dot material' technology which lets TVs show off a wider range of color. Apart from the big name companies, a number of smaller vendors also showed off their 4K TV sets - both flat and curved screens - meaning that the technology is set to become the new standard. A range of TV makers look set to flood the market with 4K television sets. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Overall, all of these technologies - be it virtual reality or high definition televisions - are set to talk to each more through internet of things technology and personal assistants like Amazon Alexa. Our world, and the things around it, are about to get a lot smarter. Be prepared for everything to be connected.

Should Update the MacBook Pro Lineup in the Spring The Mac Maker should consider a mid-cycle update of its MacBook Pro computers to Intel's latest processors so as to avoid appearing to be at a competitive disadvantage to competing notebook computer vendors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 9, 2017 at 9:51PM In October, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally rolled out long-awaited and much-anticipated updates to its MacBook Pro family of notebook computers. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch variants saw significant overhauls, including new track pads, faster processors, brighter and more colorful displays, and even the inclusion of a new touch bar on higher end 13-inch and all 15-inch models. Image source: Apple.  The machines represented nice steps forward for the MacBook Pro lineup, which hadn't seen substantial updates for quite some time. Nevertheless, I believe that Apple would be wise to update the lineup to include new processors as soon as possible, perhaps in a refresh in the March/April time frame. Here's why. An easy update to the current lineup The current MacBook Pro systems use Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. Those chips first made their debut in the third quarter of 2015, but it took Apple a full year to adopt them in its systems. The new chips, which you can read more about here, essentially deliver greater speed and improved video playback capabilities. Those chips are also what is known as "pin compatible" with the prior generation sixth-generation Core processors, which means Apple wouldn't need to go and completely redesign its logic boards and systems to accommodate the new chips. How much of an upgrade would these chips be? The chips used in the current 13-inch MacBook Pro computers are the following, based on how much a customer is willing to pay: Core i5-6267U (2.9GHz base/3.3GHz single core turbo/3.1GHz dual core turbo) Core i5-6287U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.3GHz dual core turbo) Core i7-6567U (3.3GHz base/3.6GHz single core turbo/3.4GHz dual core turbo) The direct replacements for these chips from the seventh-generation Core processors are the following: Core i5-7267U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.5GHz dual core turbo) Core i5-7287U (3.3GHz base/3.7GHz single core turbo/3.7GHz dual core turbo) Core i7-7567U (3.5GHz base/4GHz single core turbo/3.9GHz dual core turbo) The performance gains generation-over-generation here are significant, ranging from 12% to 15% in dual-core turbo speeds. That's on top of whatever gains in graphics and media capabilities that come with these chips. Image source: Intel.  Why Apple should update the systems ASAP Although Apple does have the benefit of being the sole vendor of macOS-based computers, meaning that customers who want to buy computers that run macOS have no choice but to buy Apple's computers, there's little reason for the company to put itself at a competitive disadvantage relative to its Windows-based competitors. Apple's Macs are generally competitive, well-built devices, boasting best-in-class components in areas such as track-pads, displays, keyboards, wireless connectivity, and industrial design. However, I believe that Apple's MacBook product lines would be stronger if the company were quicker to adopt Intel's latest processors. Doing so might mean Apple pays a little bit more for processors (though I can't imagine the premium is significant), but a modest bill-of-materials increase is probably worth it, as the latest processors give Apple an additional marketing point and its competitors one less potential advantage.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

According to Digital Trends, the company has spent four years in developing its Ryzen microprocessor. The new microprocessor has the same length of time that the company expect to have with its ongoing war with Intel in the PC processor space. The AMD's chief technology officer, Mark Papermaster has confirmed the four-year lifespan of the microprocessor at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The technology officer said that the Ryzen represents an improvement compared to AMD's previous architecture. Advertisement The previous architecture known as Excavator contains a new Zen chip that offers a full 40 percent improvement. The improvement is more significant compared to Intel's improvement in the current generation of CPUs they have. Intel only focuses on smaller performance increase and better mobile battery life. According to the PC World, the said improvement is one of the important accomplishments for the AMD because it's going to last for four years. Jim Anderson, the senior vice president and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics business, said that the Ryzen chips would already be available from day one.  "We're not going to do a paper launch," he said, referring to a "launch" where customers have to wait weeks or months for the products actually to arrive. "We've done that before. We're not going to mess with it," Anderson said. The next step that the company is planning to do is to put Ryzen in the hands of customers and journalists. AMD has already set the stage for its customers by revealing a dozen of motherboards and 16 performance PCs which are committed to Ryzen. AMD also-also revealed that the Ryzen chips are all overclockable.

Five Of The Best New Phones On Show At CES 2017 We've spent the last week scouring the halls and show floors of the Consumer Electronics Show in gaudy Las Vegas, and we've found something worth writing home about. A few new smartphones big and small, expensive and inexpensive, and a few world firsts, were on display — and will be coming to Australia. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market — and that's a big if — prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colours across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us ageing millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $US80 ($109)! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2 and Link's Awakening. Intel's VR Keynote Was Actually Pretty Cool Press conferences are typically a dull, boring affair filled with speeches. Until Intel took (mostly) everyone into a room at CES 2017 and told them to put on an Oculus Rift headset. I Took A Ride In Nvidia's Self-Driving Car (And Didn't Die) When I was a kid, self-driving cars were the sci-fi future. They were the stuff of Isaac Asimov's Sally and the Johnny Cab from Total Recall. I didn't actually think that they'd ever happen — the concept itself was a long way from reality, a lot more fi than sci. But smarter brains than mine, with the help of some surprisingly old-school tech, have built cars that can drive on everyday roads. B&O Play's M5 Is The Most Beautiful Wireless Speaker I've Ever Seen B&O Play is the Danish audio brand's more accessible, younger, funkier sibling, and it has a new wireless speaker to take on Sonos in your home. Design has always been a hallmark of Play and its much more distinguished older brother, and accordingly the new M5 is an utterly beautiful device — probably the most stylish I've ever seen. Gigabyte Has New Gaming Laptops Using Intel's Latest Chips It's CES, and every laptop manufacturer is taking the opportunity to refresh its product lines with Intel's latest seventh-gen Kaby Lake CPUs and Nvidia's Pascal GPUs — both of them much more efficient than their predecessors. That combo means gaming laptops that can actually game away from a power point, and Gigabyte's new machines are no different. LG's Newest OLED TV Is Another Small But Definite Improvement Amidst a swathe of competing high-end screens on show at CES this year, LG has another iteration on its flagship OLED TV. The 77-inch OLED TV W, which will be the first released into Australia under a new 'Signature' sub-brand, includes a bundled Dolby Atmos soundbar, supports all of a quickly growing list of HDR standards, and measures just 2.57mm thick. Nvidia Has Come A Long Way, From Gaming Graphics To Self-Driving AI Nvidia started out as a graphics card company. Nvidia basically invented the performance GPU. But Nvidia does a lot more than desktop graphics these days. VR, AR, mixed reality, self-driving and autonomous vehicles, deep learning neural networks — all these use technology that started out running the first 3D-accelerated PC games 20 years ago. Sony Has An OLED TV Too Now Step aside, LG. You're not the only player in the game with a perfect-black-level OLED television any more. Sony just announced a new OLED 4K TV at CES, and it ups the ante with a new, more powerful imaging processor and sound that comes from behind the screen rather than below it. This Weird-Ass Bed Will Roll You Over If You're Snoring Beds are beds, right? No. Beds are smart now. The newest in a long line of gadgets that we're not sure necessarily needed to have electronics integrated into them is a bed that can tell exactly how well you're sleeping, and then do a whole bunch of funky shit, including warming your feet, to make your life better. So Samsung Has A Gaming Laptop Now Not content with making every other technology product under the sun, Samsung now has a gaming laptop in its repertoire. It actually sounds pretty good on paper, too, if you want a powerful 15- or 17-inch machine that'll run double duty for workday tasks and casual PC gaming. NVIDIA's GeForce NOW Wouldn't Work For Australia In front of thousands, the pitch sounded good. Bring PC gaming to the hundreds of millions who can't, or haven't experienced it before. It's a sensible, reasonable goal for a publicly listed company like NVIDIA to aim at. And the idea of putting a gaming PC in the cloud has a certain logic to it. Problem is, we've been here before. It didn't work. And even if the streaming technology was sound, it still wouldn't work for Australians. Samsung's New Chromebooks Can Run Android Apps The biggest problem with Chromebooks was that they had no apps. Not really, anyway. Sure, there were a few decent ChromeOS apps, but it made no sense that they couldn't run the zillions of apps that Google's own Android mobile OS enjoyed. That problem is finally sorted. Watch The Faraday Future Reveal From CES Right Here Faraday Future's CES livestream revealed its flagship vehicle at 1pm today, and you can watch it all right here. Last year the start-up revealed an, er, interesting electric Batmobile concept, this year? On stage issues galore. Ouch. Samsung's Tough 2016 Hasn't Slowed Down A Torrent Of New Gadgets Samsung had a tough 2016, both in Australia and around the world. Most of that came from its difficult and ongoing Galaxy Note7 recall, but it's also facing renewed competition within the TV market — from LG's OLEDs and LCDs in particular — and across all different kinds of tech. But Samsung is one of the world's largest gadget brands, and it's gearing up for a big year. These Aussie-Made Wireless Earbuds Are A Cure For Pub Deafness Imagine a pair of completely wireless earbuds that can block out the ambient noise of crowds or busy offices or loud restaurants, but that still let you have a perfectly audible — amplified, in fact — conversation with the person in front of you. Think of a hearing aid, but that connects to your phone via Bluetooth, with dynamically adjustable noise cancellation and boosting. Think of Apple's AirPods, but on steroids. Samsung's Quantum Dot QLED TVs Want To Leave OLED For Dead If you're a big-name TV maker, 'LCD' is a dirty word. OLED is a different technology, but in recent generations LCD panels have been rebranded with modern monikers, from LED to ULED to Samsung's own SUHD. Now, Samsung has a new line of TVs it's calling QLED, with a quantum dot LED-backlit LCD panel that promises huge improvements to picture quality. LG's New Super UHD TVs Use 'Nano Cell' Tech For Better Colour CES is kicking off with its traditional showing of really fancy TVs. Combining all the good top-end stuff we're already used to like Dolby Vision HDR with new 'nano cell' tech that reportedly improves colour quality and viewing angles, LG's three newest Super UHD panels are the most advanced the company has produced — and promise the best ever picture quality from a LCD. TVs that seem to disappear  TVs are always a big draw at CES, and this year was no exception. Mercifully, the curved TV gimmick finally looks like it's on its way out. In the biggest trend to emerge, Sony, LG and Samsung all moved the core components of their flagship TV sets to outside hardware. In the case of Samsung, all of the ports and brains of its new models are housed in an outside box. Sony built the guts for its top TV into a subwoofer that doubles as a TV stand. But for my money, the most impressive TV was the new W7 from LG. This OLED TV is just 2.5mm thick — literally thinner than my finger. Everything that actually powers the TV is jammed into a futuristic-looking Dolby Atmos soundbar. I want it. LG also had a prototype OLED TV that is 40 per cent translucent. I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than 5km/h (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't on board, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. LEGO's new robots LEGO has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With LEGO Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer and a LEGO stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-arse computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier — and potentially more useful — its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, memory and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card — think everything from kiosks, smart TVs and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at shopping centres and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Sony's crazy thin E Ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables — mostly because no one is buying smartwatches — Sony still showed an amazing concept for an E Ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and colour — meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the E Ink display is thinner than a credit card. If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only — but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.

Credit: Dell More like this Dell’s Latitude 7285 to be world’s first wireless charging 2-in-1 I don’t expect Energous wireless charging in iPhone 8 Cutting the cord: GM tests wireless car chargers for EVs, self-driving cars Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Back in 2014, Intel declared it wanted laptops to be free of wires, and a centerpiece of that plan was wireless charging. But the technology has been slow to mature, and it may be years before it takes off. At CES last week, Dell showed a wireless charging PC called the Latitude 7285, a 2-in-1 with a detachable screen attached to a keyboard base. It's the first wireless charging laptop based on the AirFuel Alliance's emerging wireless PC charging standard. But Dell doesn't have widespread plans to put wireless charging in a host of new devices. That's partly because the technology, with slow charging speeds, is limited to low-power devices and isn't mature enough to replace wired charging. The wireless charging Latitude 7285 has a low-power Intel Kaby Lake chip that draws just 4.5 watts of power. Wireless charging in the Latitude 7285 is an optional feature, and wired charging can be done through a USB-C port. For wireless charging, a specialized keyboard dock can be attached to a wireless charging mat. It's similar to the way smartphones are charged today, except the Latitude 7285 is a much larger device with a 12.3-inch screen. The Latitude 7285 will be available in June with prices starting at about $1,099, and the wireless charging mat and keyboard will cost extra. For Dell, the Latitude 7285 is a pilot device that will give the company an idea of how customers respond to wireless PC charging, and if there's a real need for it. Wireless charging hasn't set the mobile device world on fire. There are questions about whether people need it for laptops. Dell hopes to answer those questions with the Latitude 7285. The usability of wireless charging will depend on charge time and user convenience, said Shannon MacKay, marketing director for Latitude at Dell. The wireless charging will be powerful enough for on-the-go charges and fueling up between meetings, Mackay said. Dell hasn't benchmarked how long it takes to fully charge a battery, but it isn't as fast as wired charging. "It would never work on an Alienware [gaming laptop] today," Mackay said. "You're going to see us play in the low-wattage processor space to get that started." Mackay said mainstream laptops with wireless charging could be a year-and-a-half to two years away. Dell's decision to bring wireless charging to more laptops will mostly depend on usability, charging times, and battery types. The Latitude 7285 can be ordered without a wireless charging keyboard base. It supports up to 512GB of solid-state drive storage. It also has two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. With the keyboard base, the device can provide up to 15 hours of battery life. It hasn't been smooth sailing for wireless PC charging. Intel had earlier taken the lead on establishing the wireless PC charging ecosystem. But the company scaled back efforts after laying off 12,000 people last year and restructuring operations to focus more on servers, internet of things, automotive tech, and other areas. Intel was also leading an effort by AirFuel Alliance to establish the Resonant standard for wireless PC charging. AirFuel last November reconstituted a PC Task Force to drive adoption of wireless charging in PCs, with partners including Dell, Lenovo, and STMicroelectronics. Intel also took on the job of trying to convince airports, cafes, and other locations to install wireless charging stands for laptops. But the efforts have not yet shown any tangible results.

(AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead AMD stock has turnaround potential, but not much else By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 9, 2017, 10:20 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead 10 Best Stocks for Retirement Investors Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Recent Posts: Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a “Hold” at Best Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the Cure Is Coming View All Posts Back in 2011, semiconductor chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) generated about $100 million in free cash flow. Since then, it has bled cash. On an earnings basis, AMD stock was also last profitable in 2011. Those are two pretty long dry spells. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Sales also haven’t moved much for the better part of a decade. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices has a fair amount of debt (around $2 billion), and has accumulated $7.3 billion in deficits on the balance sheet. This indicates it hasn’t generated a cumulative positive return for AMD stock owners since it was founded in 1969. The profit outlook for Advanced Micro Devices is pretty grim. Analysts are projecting a loss of 23 cents per share for the company’s full year (AMD reports its fourth quarter on Jan. 17). But 2017 could see a return to profitability, as analysts expect 6 cents in earnings for the year. A recent investor presentation on AMD’s website does tout that the company is a leader in “visual” computing that includes gaming, artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality. It is a claim-to-fame that resembles why rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is popular among investors right now. I recently covered why Nvidia’s stock has been on fire. NVDA also sells chips that power the gaming and AI space, but also data centers. The greatest hype surrounds its autonomous car initiative, including the Nvidia Drive PX 2 in Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) autos. 10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street The upside for AMD is that it also operates in growing areas of the market. It has sold chips to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its Xbox and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) for its PlayStation, but is well behind Nvidia in gaming. Advanced Micro Devices Lags Intel Badly Advanced Micro Devices says it is also a “strong No.2 in computing”, but has struggled for years to successfully compete against industry titan Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel is expected to report sales of around $59 billion this year. AMD stock will log just over $4 billion in sales, making it about 7% the size of Intel. Advanced Micro Devices has lagged Intel for years now. The race was much closer around 2000, but Intel has moved forward and AMD stock has not. Obviously, Intel is much larger and can easily outspend Advanced Micro Devices in research and development. Last year, Intel invested $12.1 billion in R&D, qualifying it as one of the largest spenders on R&D in the world. AMD spent less than $1 billion, and its annual R&D spend has fallen in recent years. Advanced Micro Devices is said to be at least a couple of years behind Intel in terms of technology.  AMD is just rolling out 14-nanometer chips while Intel has had the technology for a couple of years now. Advanced Micro Devices also doesn’t have the strength to produce its own chips any longer. Instead, it has to pay outside parties to do so, which increases costs. The market share differential says it all. Intel’s computing market share is nearly 88%, while AMD’s is only 12%. Intel has also been increasing its share recently.

Sign up now Menu ARN Dell: Mainstream laptops with wireless charging are still years away Dell: Mainstream laptops with wireless charging are still years away Dell shows a 2-in-1 with wireless charging but says the technology for mainstream laptops is two years out Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 10 January, 2017 07:43 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Back in 2014, Intel declared it wanted laptops to be free of wires, and a centerpiece of that plan was wireless charging. But the technology has been slow to mature, and it may be years before it takes off. At CES last week, Dell showed a wireless charging PC called the Latitude 7285, a 2-in-1 with a detachable screen attached to a keyboard base. It's the first wireless charging laptop based on the AirFuel Alliance's emerging wireless PC charging standard. But Dell doesn't have widespread plans to put wireless charging in a host of new devices. That's partly because the technology, with slow charging speeds, is limited to low-power devices and isn't mature enough to replace wired charging. The wireless charging Latitude 7285 has a low-power Intel Kaby Lake chip that draws just 4.5 watts of power. Wireless charging in the Latitude 7285 is an optional feature, and wired charging can be done through a USB-C port. For wireless charging, a specialized keyboard dock can be attached to a wireless charging mat. It's similar to the way smartphones are charged today, except the Latitude 7285 is a much larger device with a 12.3-inch screen. The Latitude 7285 will available in June with prices starting at about US $1,099, and the wireless charging mat and keyboard will cost extra. For Dell, the Latitude 7285 is a pilot device that will give the company an idea of how customers respond to wireless PC charging, and if there's a real need for it. Wireless charging hasn't set the mobile device world on fire. There are questions about whether people need it for laptops. Dell hopes to answer those questions with the Latitude 7285. The usability of wireless charging will depend on charge time and user convenience, said Shannon MacKay, marketing director for Latitude at Dell. The wireless charging will be powerful enough for on-the-go charges and fueling up between meetings, Mackay said. Dell hasn't benchmarked how long it takes to fully charge a battery, but it isn't as fast as wired charging. "It would never work on an Alienware [gaming laptop] today," Mackay said. "You're going to see us play in the low-wattage processor space to get that started." Mackay said mainstream laptops with wireless charging could be a year-and-a-half to two years away. Dell's decision to bring wireless charging to more laptops will mostly depend on usability, charging times, and battery types. The Latitude 7285 can be ordered without a wireless charging keyboard base. It supports up to 512GB of solid-state drive storage. It also has two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. With the keyboard base, the device can provide up to 15 hours of battery life. It hasn't been smooth sailing for wireless PC charging. Intel had earlier taken the lead on establishing the wireless PC charging ecosystem. But the company scaled back efforts after laying off 12,000 people last year and restructuring operations to focus more on servers, internet of things, automotive tech, and other areas. Intel was also leading an effort by AirFuel Alliance to establish the Resonant standard for wireless PC charging. AirFuel last November reconstituted a PC Task Force to drive adoption of wireless charging in PCs, with partners including Dell, Lenovo, and STMicroelectronics. Intel also took on the job of trying to convince airports, cafes, and other locations to install wireless charging stands for laptops. But the efforts have not yet shown any tangible results.

Trump relied heavily on Kushner's advice during the campaign, and his move to the White House was expected. But ethics experts have raised questions about whether Kushner's role in the new administration will run up against a federal anti-nepotism law and how he will separate himself from his real estate business to avoid conflicts of interest. His appointment is expected to be formally announced later this week.

Here's a closer look at the man who is expected to be a senior adviser to the president in Trump's White House. Kushner, 35, is married to Ivanka Trump and has run his family's multibillion-dollar business over the past decade, after his father pleaded guilty to corruption-related charges. As Trump campaigned for president, Kushner played a key role, acting as an adviser and gatekeeper. Kushner, whose family has donated to pro-Israel causes, also played a role as a Middle East policy adviser. Related Content The daunting task of bringing order to White House's rival centres of gravity Trump insider Jared Kushner chases a massive Chinese deal for family firm Kushner's appointment was telegraphed over the weekend by a statement from his lawyer that said that Kushner is preparing to resign from his position overseeing his family's real estate empire and to divest "substantial assets" if he takes a role in Trump's White House. Some ethical experts question whether a Kushner appointment would violate a federal anti-nepotism statute. The 1967 law, which came about after President John F. Kennedy named his brother as attorney general, forbids public officials from hiring family members in agencies or offices they oversee. It explicitly lists sons-in-laws as prohibited employees.

But both Richard Painter and Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyers under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, respectively, say they counselled their presidents to avoiding appointing relatives to West Wing jobs.

Now dont let a "one size fits all" marketing approach prevent you from meaningfully connecting with them. Klaviyo's email personalization & automation platform puts your data to work for more money. Sign up Now. CES was a fascinating show this year. One of the things that made it so fascinating was that everyone and their brother had cars demonstrating one form of technology or another. It kind of makes me wonder what we'll see at the next car show -- PCs, drones, tablets and smartphones? That wasn't the only surprise at the show, though. Nvidia, long thought of as living in Intel's shadow, broke out, taking over the prime keynote spot in a big way and demonstrating that it has all but cornered the market for car brains. I'll close with my product of the week, the most important product at CES. Dell Embarrasses Apple Apple for decades has rubbed Dell's face in the fact that it builds a better creative set of products. When Apple launched the iPhone, it embarrassed all of CES by pulling virtually all attention away from the show. Well, this year, Dell got even. Dell formally launched two products, the XPS 27 and the Dell Canvas 27, which together make the iMac look like last decade's solution. Which it kind of is if you think about it. Dell got there by bringing in a bunch of artists to help define the products. Animators, musicians and engineers worked together to create their dream tool, basically a touchscreen all-in-one with studio monitor speakers, incredible performance, and a touchscreen work surface that can transform into any digital interface the job requires. This interface can represent everything from digital musical instruments to an animator's canvas and digital ink. It can be pretty much anything the user or an application developer could imagine. The CEO of Avid, along with an animator and a number of musicians, raved about the product at CES, and it made the latest iMac look pitiful in head-to-head comparisons. Now that's revenge served cold. Nvidia Steps Into the Lead Nvidia is now the fastest-growing company in the fortune 500, according to the head of CES, who opened for Nvidia CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang. I don't think many understand how amazing this is. Nvidia has long been viewed as a small player when compared to Intel. Like all of the PC companies, Nvidia bet heavy on mobile and lost badly. After its Tegra mobile platform seemed to crash and burn, many thought Nvidia was done. Then it pivoted like I've never seen a company pivot before. It doubled down on graphics, pushed hard on gaming, and made huge bets on deep learning and artificial intelligence -- and you know what? Those bets paid off -- oh man, did they ever pay off -- and now Nvidia pretty much has the market cornered for self-driving cars, and it supplies a critical part of the deep learning solutions of every major IT vendor. You have to admit that is pretty impressive. Corning's Glass Car One of the most impressive marketing efforts I've ever seen is Corning's "A Day Made Of Glass." It is visionary, and it not only makes you believe in a future with tons of touchscreens and smart windows, but also makes you want to live in that future. Well, Corning pulled out all the stops at CES and commissioned a car with displays all across the dash, in the steering wheel, in the doors, and even replacing the license plate. It is actually a pretty decent car -- racy, electric, and apparently very fast. Sadly, I didn't get to drive it. The Gorilla Glass Windshield is one of the most interesting parts. It not only resists nicks and scratches, as you'd expect, but it is substantially lighter, far clearer, faster to defrost, and works better with heads-up displays. Even the roof is glass -- smart glass, in this case -- that can be electronically shaded. The display license plate makes sense, given that it would be digitally connected to the car, arguably more secure, and could be used to broadcast a signal in the event of a stolen car or driver in distress. Panasonic's Robot Family It never really occurred to me that a true home robot solution would require a family of robots, each with different skills to complete tasks around the house. A small robot to greet you at the door and patrol the home protecting it from bandits could be supplemented by larger robots that could clean and maintain the home. That approach would be far better than trying to build a single robot to do everything, which is often the science fiction solution. The idea of a family of robots, each specialized to do a series of tasks, just makes more sense -- and you have to admit that living with a robot family just seems kind of cool. Given that one of the robots likely would be your autonomous car, the biggest robot could be impressively large. I should add that Panasonic showcased its idea of an autonomous car, and it was more like a rolling sitting room, with tables and chairs. If you don't have to drive, there are likely a lot of other things you'd want to do during that time. AMD's Ryzen and the Power of the Desktop CES marked the coming-out party for AMD's latest processor, now named "Ryzen." The company showcased some of the coolest PCs I've ever seen at its cocktail party, and I honestly had lust in my heart for a large number of them. Most of the PCs on display were water cooled, with water blocks for the major components. Some even had coolant that looked like blood. I thought I'd entered techno geek heaven, and it was hard not to drool every time I turned around. AMD is another company that is firing on all cylinders. Expect to see some amazing hardware when these PCs hit the market in a few months. Wrapping Up I'm writing this after midnight on my last day at the show. I'm beat, but I'm also kind of excited about the future. These products all promise a future when our homes will do much of the work, when we won't care much about traffic because we are being entertained or sleeping and not driving, and when company turnarounds actually work. CES promises that this future not only will be amazing, but also will arrive far sooner than most expect -- and I think that is very cool. The product that most stood out for me at CES is Norton Core, a router and security solution from Symantec. You see, with all of this connected and ever-smarter stuff, we really, really need to be secure -- and our home networks are anything but. What makes the Norton Core router special is that it secures not only against outside attacks, but also against inside attacks, and it is part of an overall solution in the home. It's an overall solution because it is packaged with a subscription that contains 20 licenses for security software for your PCs, smartphones and tablets. Because it uses Qualcomm's latest technology, it's not only a strong security solution, but also is likely one of the highest-performing routers. It will be upgradable to support a mesh network, allowing you to cover even the biggest home with WiFi. It is even pretty cool to look at, bringing back the geodesic dome and placing a halo light at the bottom for effect, so you can feel good about putting it in the open. With all of this connected stuff, we desperately need a better home security solution. With Symantec's Norton Core, we get one -- and thus it is my product of the week.

The information comes from the Dutch website Hardware.info who confirmed the information with Intel. (Image credit: Hardware.info and users  Sw333t and J_C_W) Intel’s website states that the Pentium G4560, G4560T, G4600, G4600T and G4620 will all support Hyper Threading. Previous Pentium chips normally  featured a maximum of two cores and two threads with the exception of a special model that was on the market a couple of years ago. With the addition of Hyper Threading the Pentium CPU have become pretty similar to Core i3 CPUs. According to Hardware.info the major difference is now the support of the Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) instruction set which becomes clear by comparing the CPUs on Intel’s website. When comparing the Core i3 7300T and Pentium G4560, which both run at 3.50 Ghz,  the main differences appear to be the cache of respectively 4MB and 3MB, the TDP of respectively 35W and 54W and indeed the support of AVX2. But the major difference is the price, the Pentium has a MSRP of $64, while the Core i3 has a MSRP range of 138.00 – $147.00. The AVX2 instruction set that is missing on the Pentium CPUs was introduced with Haswell and should optimize the performance of floating point operations. AVX2 is mainly an advantage for high intensity database and video processing. The information was confirmed by Intel’s chat support.

Now we're right at the beginning of 2017 and Intel has only just launched its seventh-generation Kaby Lake CPUs on the new 200-series Z270 chipset, leading many to believe Cannon Lake would be pushed into 2018--but Intel has set the record straight.   At CES 2017 Intel CEO Brian Krzanich demoed a prototype 2-in-1 device running an eight-gen 10nm Cannon Lake CPU that displayed a promo video. "For those who are wondering if Moore's Law is alive, if 10 nanometers going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes," Krzanich said on stage.   Expect to see 10nm Cannon Lake CPUs shipping in late 2017, bringing reduced power consumption and heat and boosted performance to smaller mobile devices and notebooks.   NEWS SOURCES:Hexus.net, Theinquirer.net Recommended for You AMD's 4-core Ryzen CPUs ready to take on Core i3/i5...

Instead of fixing the problem and re-releasing it, Intel decided that they were done with it and announced that they would be shutting down Peak’s software support, which seemed to suggest that the company was done with Basis. Recently at CES 2017, Engadget’s Daniel Cooper managed to sit down and talk with Dr. Jerry Bautista, the VP of Intel’s wearables division. According to Engadget’s report, it seemed that Intel could be done releasing their own wearables in the future, or at least that’s the feeling they got from the interview. In particular it seemed that Bautista’s response to Intel pursuing partnerships in favor of making their own wearables was what led to the conclusion. According to Bautista, the idea behind the partnerships is to allow Intel to address various parts of the market that they might not be able to do by themselves, like teaming up with TAG Heuer to target the luxury watch market, or New Balance where they get to target the sporting sector. While Bautista never outright said that Basis was dead, the fact that partnerships seem to be Intel’s new focus, we guess if you’re hoping for new Basis products in the near future, maybe you shouldn’t hold your breath.

The Wall Street Journal.2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money3:21 UP NEXT Twenty-five years ago, the man who is now CEO of the world's largest maker of computer chips was an engineer at the company. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▲ 36.79 +0.08 +0.22% And he made an error that almost got him fired. "I wiped out the output of an entire factory for a week," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Fortt Knox podcast in an interview. "I'm lucky to be employed at Intel, sometimes I say." Instead of dooming him, his handling of the problem influenced the company culture, helping to birth a system called "Copy Exactly" that's become part of its identity. Krzanich went on to make a name for himself as the executive responsible for all of Intel's factories, a job that prepared him to be CEO. It happened in the 1990s; Krzanich was in his early 30s. At the time, Intel was just beginning to hit its stride with a strategy that would make it the world's top supplier of chips for personal computers. His job was to transfer the chip manufacturing process from one facility in New Mexico to the one next door. It didn't work. Production ground to a halt. And for an agonizingly long time, he had no idea why. "It went all the way up to the CEO. And my boss at one point walked into my office and said, 'You have about two more weeks to figure out this issue, and if you don't, I've got to let you go,'" Krzanich recalled. "And luckily, a friend of mine and I, we said we're just not going to sleep until we solve this. And then, sure enough, we found the problem about a week into that two week time period." What sets Krzanich apart as a leader isn't just the way he rallied in a situation like this, though his conversation with Fortt Knox did unearth some gems that should help anyone navigate a career crisis. What sets him apart is the no-frills approach he brings to his work, and the adaptability that has allowed him to push his career – and now, Intel itself – in unexpected directions. Here are just a few of the concepts explored in a fascinating episode of Fortt Knox: © Provided by CNBC Krzanich grew up in San Jose, California, just miles from Intel headquarters. He didn't go to an Ivy League school: He got his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from San Jose State University. The prestige of a college's brand on a résumé doesn't impress him. "I've told my daughters this; my older daughter's about to go into college. It doesn't matter what college you go to. The thing that was great about San Jose State was, I got connected with some very good professors," he said. He did research for their projects on the side. "When I went into interviews, I could talk about real work that I'd done, not just textbook stuff," Krzanich added. That informs how he deals with job candidates today. "I ask real simple questions that just tell me, does this person know how to think?" © Provided by CNBC Krzanich had some more advice. "The other thing I tell my daughters is, I've had to terminate or fire more people for being difficult to work with than being dumb." That said, former CEOs of Intel haven't exactly distinguished themselves by being easy to work with—the legendary Andy Grove comes to mind. So what does he mean? "I think if you don't give people the tools and the expectations for success, and yet hold them to some value, then you're difficult to work with. I think the one thing about Andy was, if you listened to him, if you tried to understand him, then you actually understood what the expectations were," the CEO said. "They may be hard, and you may not have been able to do it, but you at least had a chance. The difficult bosses – the ones that have been hard for me to work for – have been the ones where, I never knew what success meant," Krzanich added. In other words, it's okay to challenge your team. But it's also important to recognize the value of their different perspectives, give them the tools, and clearly define success. In the show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," contestants can solve difficult problems by asking the audience, or phoning a friend. Moments in Krzanich's career are reminiscent of that. A friend helped him solve the early puzzle that had brought production to a halt. And when Intel began searching for a new CEO about four years ago, he took an unorthodox approach to competing for it: He teamed up with another Intel executive and presented to the board together. The board ended up naming him CEO, and his teammate president—the number two position. "It was more important to me that it was an insider, because I felt like anybody from the outside would slow the company down," Krzanich said. "Even if they were better, it would take them two years to learn how Intel works and to figure out how to make Moore's Law happen." The CEO "was willing to do whatever it took to have an insider, even if that wasn't me, or if it was a group of us, I was going to figure out a way .... By partnering up, I figured that was our best chance. Two of us could beat one outsider." Fortt Knox is a weekly podcast from CNBC anchor Jon Fortt.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch By Joel Hruska on January 6, 2017 at 5:08 pm Comment AMD released some additional information about its upcoming Ryzen chips at CES this week. Having spent over four years designing the architecture, the company plans to keep it around for at least that long. That’s according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who was on-hand to discuss the chip. First things first — AMD is promising a hard launch for Ryzen, without any paper launches, limited availability, or limited product introductions. When Zen debuts it’ll debut in multiple (still unknown) configurations, not a single eight-core part. As PCWorld details, Papermaster also confirmed the four-year target and emphasized that it didn’t mean AMD wouldn’t iterate the core. “We’re not going tick-tock,” Papermaster said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” There are several ways to read this sentence. Tick-tock refers to Intel’s previous practice of introducing new CPU architectures in one product cycle and new manufacturing nodes in the other. AMD has never strictly deployed an equivalent approach over multiple product cycles. I wouldn’t necessarily conclude that Papermaster is saying AMD won’t deploy Zen on new manufacturing nodes over time, but that AMD intends to implement an aggressive series of tweaks and improvements to the current core as time goes by. There’s a significant lag between when a design tapes out and when it ships to consumers. This means AMD’s CPU design team is almost certainly hard at work on Zen’s successor already, even though Zen hasn’t actually shipped yet. While I can’t make any concrete predictions about how Zen will compete against specific products in Intel’s lineup, the demos we’ve seen and the product information already available has convinced me that Ryzen will be at least a meaningful and significant improvement on AMD’s overall power efficiency, performance, and performance-per-watt. With Intel’s CPU performance largely stuck and performance gains relegated to single-digit increases year-on-year, there’s a great deal of excitement for Ryzen. Even if it doesn’t seize the pole position from every price point, there’s pent-up demand for strong parts at good pricing. AMD wants to capitalize on that, and the best way to do so is to keep delivering core improvements year-over-year. I think we can reasonably look forward to that. The first Ryzen APUs are probably going to be DDR4-based, but there’s no reason for AMD not to push into HBM2 as that standard becomes more affordable. Power consumption and efficiency will continue to be important targets in years to come because AMD is unlikely to match Intel clock-for-clock and core-for-core with its very first launch. Ryzen is the beginning of AMD’s comeback, not the end of it, and setting a four-year target for the architecture now makes sense. It also gives AMD time to think about what it wants to come next. Intel’s Kaby Lake debut this week didn’t do much to excite the enthusiast community, but we’ll have a much better sense of how the two chips compare once we get a little closer to Ryzen’s still-unspecified (Q1) launch date. Overclocking features, Crossfire Meanwhile, PCWorld’s Brad Chacos reports on some interesting news on the overclocking front. All AMD Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked and overclockable, but only three motherboard chipsets — X370, X300, and B350 will have overclocking support. If current rumors are accurate, that corresponds to the upcoming enthusiast-class chipset (X370), mainstream (X300), and small form factor (X300) chipsets. That’s most of the chipsets AMD is launching (most of the non-budget ones, at least) and should cover virtually the entire overclocking market. AMD motherboards have historically been cheaper than their Intel counterparts, so this shouldn’t be a major issue. Crossfire and SLI support will only be implemented on the X370, however. According to AMD, the relative handful of people who use multi-GPUs always use higher-end motherboards. Practically, this makes sense, since most people can’t afford or don’t want a second card, and if you do want one, you can probably afford a slightly more expensive motherboard. Given the typical price gap between AMD and Intel we don’t see this being a major issue, either.

Until Intel took (mostly) everyone into a room at CES 2017 and told them to put on an Oculus Rift headset. The virtual reality keynote was an opportunity for Intel to showcase three areas they expect virtual reality to become increasingly prevalent: sports and live entertainment, tourism and, of course, video games. And that meant telling everyone - or at least the press and industry folk who lined up early enough to get inside the conference - to pop on the Oculus Rift in front of them. As far as Intel is concerned, VR can play a major factor in three things: travel, work and play. The travel pitch was pretty simple: imagine you could look and move around your next holiday spot, the hotel room you're going to book, the monument you'd like to go visit. So to demonstrate, Intel fired up a VR experience of flying over the desert, complete with jumping out of a helicopter while wearing a wingsuit. The people in the conference weren't wearing wingsuits, but it was pretty good to see a few queasy reactions. The next part required the co-founder of Hype VR, Ted Schilowitz. While video has enjoyed jumps in fidelity, resolution and quality over the years, it's still predominantly a moving image shot from a single camera, a single perspective. Hype VR and Intel's answer was a high-def video from a Waterfall in Vietnam, viewed through the Rift. The kicker with Hype VR's technology was the ability to move around the physical space in the video, without distorting the perspective or point of view. That theme revolved throughout the conference: being able to control the perspective, to become the cameraman. Perhaps the strongest theme of the keynote was Intel's alignment with real-world sports, both through a deal with La Liga to introduce their 360-degree video technology to three stadiums, and a live broadcast of a college basketball match. The trick with the live basketball match in VR was the ability to look around and choose different camera perspectives. It wasn't a free-roaming camera like one would hope, and when Intel first cut to the game it was half-time (leaving viewers with bugger all to see beyond warmups). The live feed - which took about 40 seconds to beam simultaneously to all the headsets in the conference - was truly live courtesy of a platform called Voke. Voke's currently available for the Samsung Gear VR, and is scheduled for release for the Oculus Rift at the end of the year. Krzanich added that the content available won't just be limited to sports, but music and other forms of live entertainment as well. It's hard not to see it as a future route for pay-per-view content, especially when broadcasters have the ability to overlay statistics and information throughout. As far as work is concerned, Krzanich pitched the idea that virtual reality could be a way to reduce the danger associated with hazardous jobs. Intel then streamed 4K, 360-degree live video from a drone inspecting solar panels, a job that would typically be done by a human. While it wasn't the smoothest feed, it was also pretty functional. The idea is that VR could be used in these situations to scope out hazardous work, or for use in search and rescue missions where conditions make it too problematic for a helicopter and crew to investigate. Intel also showed off the work they've been doing on Project Alloy, their open-source HMD first announced at the Intel Developers Conference last year. All of the sensors and processing power is done in the headset itself, using Intel's RealSense technology and a Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU. There's no word on how it matches up to a Rift or Vive that relies on far beefier hardware - but Intel said they would begin productising Project Alloy by the end of the year. Image: Twitter (@intel) Apart from the promise of a VR headset that doesn't have wires and is hooked into something with more processing power than your smartphone, Intel also pulled off a neat trick with "mixed reality". It's basically a fancy term for scanning the space around you and incorporating that into the environment into the headset, which gets around VR's current problem of not having enough space in your living room to move around. As an example, the stage opened up and showcased two people wearing Alloy prototypes in a faux living room. The couches were transformed into bunkers that could be used for cover in-game, which is wonderful encouragement to leave large objects lying around every now and again. Nobody in the crowd got to get hands-on with Project Alloy, but that was besides the point. The demo, much like the whole keynote, showcased ways in which VR might actually have a role in our day to day lives. The technology behind VR has come an awful long way. But from a gaming perspective, developers are very much still figuring things out. Many titles are little more than short experiences, rail shooters and short experiments lasting no more than a few hours at most. It's still very disposable. But being able to watch live sport, or a concert, or the live feed of a drone, isn't. It's something we already do every day, and will continue to do going forward. The conference helped give VR a place in our lives that made sense, and that was the cool part. The technology is almost there, but what we don't have yet is purpose. It probably still won't happen by the time 2017 comes to a close, especially when you factor in the capabilities of Australian internet. But it's not far off. The author travelled to CES 2017 as a guest of CORSAIR. Comments pooh_bear @pooh_bear Jan 10, 2017, 9:03am Im looking forward to VR becoming a more mature product. Had a go of a friends rift with assetto corsa the car racing game and while it is incredible the resolution at distance was still a bit of a problem that slighty tarnished the experience. when they reduce the weight of the head sets and make them wireless it will also be a huge step forward. Reply 1 Roland @roland Jan 10, 2017, 10:25am hope ur friend had it tweaked to get the most out of it... sure resolution isn't there like a 4k screen but the immersion is the winner hands down... :) Reply 0 pooh_bear @pooh_bear Jan 10, 2017, 11:26am yeah had it running well. Driving it with a titan only thing better would be the latest titan or a 1080. That's just me being super super picky. Did really enjoy my first real Vr experience.

As timing would have it, AT&T also announced their “5G Evolution” plans for 2017, which detail what they hope to achieve with the new wireless technology. The global 5G modem announced by Intel today reportedly achieves speeds “exceeding 5 Gbps” while maintaining ultra-low latency connections. Intel’s 5G modem is already compliant to multiple industry 5G specifications, along with being able to provide fallback to a 4G connection when needed. It can even interwork 4G/5G connections. Intel says they should begin testing the 5G modem in the second half of 2017, before going into production. AT&T’s 5G announcements show that the company is tackling the evolution head on. John Donovan, chief strategy officer of Technology and Operations at AT&T says, “Our 5G Evolution plans will pave the way to the next-generation of higher speeds for customers. We’re not waiting until the final standards are set to lay the foundation for our evolution to 5G. We’re executing now.” As part of their 5G Evolution plan, AT&T is aiming for: 1 Gbps speeds in 2017 at some cell sites using their 4G LTE-Advanced network, 5G video trials with DIRECTV NOW in the first half of 2017 to residents in Austin, 5G business customer trials that launched last fall in Austin, and additional 5G trials in a team up with Qualcomm Technologies and Ericsson in the second half of 2017. After the iPhone 7’s original release, Jeff Benjamin wrote a detailed report on the distinct differences that both Qualcomm and Intel’s modems bring to the iPhone 7. Most readers seemed to be on the side of supporting the Qualcomm chip as those particular modems have the capabilities to enable Ultra HD Voice, something that only T-Mobile currently supports. Intel and AT&T’s announcement today begs the question if Apple will move in the direction of Intel’s new 5G modem for future devices. With the iPhone 7’s modem variations between Qualcomm and Intel it seemed as though Apple was testing both chips for a variety of reasons. Doubts remain if Apple will use Intel’s new global 5G modem in the next iPhone as the modem’s production will be after the second half of 2017.

Audi, BMW and Daimler own Here, whose mapping technology is designed to assist self-driving cars. Intel’s investment follows its May acquisition of a computer vision startup called Itseez, and a July deal with BMW to pursue autonomous vehicles. The companies did not report the value of Tuesday’s investment, but the automakers paid 2.8 billion euros ($2.9 billion in U.S. dollars) in 2015 to buy Here from Nokia. Fifteen percent of that is more than $400 million. In November, Intel created a new organization within the company to focus on self-driving cars. The chipmaker hopes its microprocessors can be adapted to run the new technology as Intel’s core business, the PC market, fades.   Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

That conclusion may put Gen. John Kelly at odds with his future boss who has refused, thus far, to endorse the intelligence community conclusion. Trump insisted for several months after the November election that intelligence agencies’ focus on the breaches was politically motivated. The president-elect has declined to say whether he’s changed that position following a classified briefing Friday, which included intelligence gathered since the election. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Trump may address the question during his first press conference since the election Wednesday. Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and ranking member Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., expressed confidence after the hearing that Kelly will be rapidly confirmed. McCaskill praised Kelly’s statement on the Russian cyber attribution, calling him a “straight shooter.” “If you spend time with that report and if you have the ability to get a brief on the information that’s not been declassified, I haven’t met very many people that want to argue about it,” she said, adding she hopes Kelly will be a “moderating influence” on the Trump administration.  Trump’s attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., gave a more shaded answer when questioned about the report’s conclusions during his confirmation hearing Tuesday, saying, “I have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise.” Kelly hedged similarly in a questionnaire submitted in advance of the hearing, describing “numerous (and sometimes conflicting or speculative) news stories about Russian efforts to reportedly influence” the election. “I do not have access to data that would allow me to validate those claims, or to provide an informed response to the questions posed here,” Kelly wrote. DHS is the nation’s top civilian cybersecurity agency and  is responsible for helping the private sector secure critical infrastructure, a category that, as of Friday, includes computer servers that manage voter databases and election tallies. If confirmed, Kelly’s agency could also be responsible for distributing federal money to state election officials to improve the cybersecurity of their networks. Kelly expressed some skepticism about that new role in his questionnaire, stating, “the notion that DHS can or should exercise some degree of influence over state voting systems is highly controversial and appears to be a political question beyond the scope of DHS’ current legislative cyber mandates.” DHS’ decision to label election systems as critical infrastructure was unpopular among some state officials wary of a federal power grab. Asked about his broader cybersecurity priorities during the hearing, Kelly acknowledged as a retired Marine Corps general, he’s more familiar with international cyber conflict than DHS’ role protecting civilian government networks. “If confirmed, I’ll get deep into it,” he said. One priority, he said, will be to gather input and advice from the private sector in Silicon Valley and elsewhere similar to initiatives outgoing Defense Secretary Ash Carter launched at the Pentagon. “There’s unbelievable talent out there in the civilian sector,” he said. “Working together makes an awful lot of sense.” Kelly endorsed Trump’s call for a 3-month review of cyber vulnerabilities across the U.S., including in critical infrastructure in his written questionnaire. “We must be faster and more agile across everything we do to safeguard and secure cyberspace—hiring, technology deployment and response,” he wrote. Kelly will also urge DHS departments to rapidly hire cyber professionals, he said in the questionnaire.  Kelly also said he’s interested in proposals to change the name of DHS’ National Protection and Programs Directorate to better reflect its role as the department’s main cyber division. He declined to fully endorse a name change before consulting with officials at DHS. Kelly did not say if he supports legislation that would elevate NPPD to a full cyber operational unit. House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, championed such legislation last year, but it failed to wend its way through all committees with jurisdiction before the close of the Congress.  recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Jeff Sessions emphasized a need for cyber rules of engagement during the first day of his confirmation hearings. “Partnerships will also be vital to achieving more effective enforcement against cyber threats. The Department of Justice clearly has a lead role to play in that essential effort,” Sessions said in his opening statement. “We must honestly assess our vulnerabilities and have a clear plan for defense as well as offense when it comes to cybersecurity.” » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Cybersecurity was only a small slice of the Tuesday confirmation hearing interrupted frequently by protests and dominated by questions about whether Sessions would uphold laws he opposed as a legislator. Here are some notable moments: Russian Election Interference Sessions broke from President-elect Donald Trump on the issue of whether the Russian government directed cyberattacks during the presidential election, accepting the conclusions of the FBI and the intelligence community when pressed by senators. Sessions said he had “no reason to doubt intelligence findings” and though he hadn’t been briefed by the FBI, that its conclusions were “honorably reached.” The government, specifically the State and Defense departments, need to create protocols so “a price is paid” if U.S. systems are breached, he said. Sessions reiterated retaliation when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked whether he would allow the department and the FBI to continue to investigate Russian interference even if it led to the investigation or prosecution of the president. Sessions said if laws were broken, “the appropriate actions should be taken.” He also stated multiple times an appropriate response to foreign governments that hack the U.S. is a foreign policy determined by Congress and chief executive, and having “the world know that if you do X to us, you can expect we’re going to do Y to you.” Lock Her Up? On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to investigate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server or the Clinton Foundation. Though the president-elect later told The New York Times he wouldn’t pursue such an investigation, Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked the nominee what his role would be. “The proper thing to do would be to recuse myself,” Sessions testified, stating it would look like a conflict of interest after comments he also made during the campaign. “This country does not punish its political enemies,” he said. Whitehouse asked whether Sessions chanted “lock her up” during Clinton’s presidential campaign, to which Sessions replied, “No, I did not—I don’t think.” Muslim Registry Sessions said he does not support a registry of Muslims living in the U.S. or surveillance of mosques. Encryption Sessions didn’t expand on his opinions on encryption, but he agreed to continue to work with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to ensure law enforcement has access to data on encrypted phones like the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. Last Congress, Cornyn proposed an amendment to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that would require service providers to metadata to the FBI without a warrant. International Data Privacy Sen. Orrin Hatch asked Sessions whether he would support the International Communications Privacy Act, a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies with a warrant to get U.S. citizen’s electronic communications regardless of where the information is housed. Current law prohibits the law enforcement agencies from accessing data held outside of the U.S. Sessions said individuals have a right to privacy, but he doesn’t have “firm and fast opinions” about the subject. Online Poker Responding to a question from Graham, Sessions said he may revisit the 2011 Justice Department memo on the Wire Act that reversed the department’s long-held stance that it banned online poker and the selling lottery tickets online. Sessions, however, said he couldn’t give an opinion today. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts    5415065 The intelligence community believes Russia hacked both the Republican and Democratic parties in an effort to influence U.S. policy, according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. “We are confident Russian intelligence carried out operations targeting both major political parties,” Clapper told the Senate Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during his testimony Tuesday. Comey’s testimony confirms an intelligence community assessment which determined that the Russian intelligence apparatus likely hacked into the servers of both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee. “There’s no doubt they hit an RNC domain,” said FBI Director James Comey, who joined Clapper in the Tuesday afternoon hearing. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report assessing evidence of Russian hacking Friday based on an investigation conducted by the FBI, CIA and NSA. It noted that “Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets, but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign.” In an exchange with Sen. Tom Cotton, Clapper noted that the Russians initially had little faith in Trump’s chances to win the election over Clinton. “Initially no,” said Clapper after Cotton asked if Russia thought Trump was going to win the election. “They thought he was a fringe candidate.” The report noted that in June, Putin began avoided publicly praising Trump, “probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States.” Clapper explained that Russians began to develop a preference for Trump after the summer time frame. The report also found that Russia engaged in hacking against U.S. government, think tank and non-governmental organization personnel in an attempt to gather future intelligence on the incoming Trump administration.

Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. "We can say that we did not see evidence of the Russians altering vote tallies," Clapper stated. The key findings in the classified and public versions of the recent US intelligence report on Russian hacking of the US 2016 election are the same, Clapper said. "We can’t discuss the full range of all information that supports our conclusions because of the extreme sensitivity of these sources, but the key judgments in the public and classified versions are the same." After receiving an intelligence briefing on the US Intelligence Community's report, Trump said the election outcome had not been affected.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Lawmaker: Intel shows Gitmo transfers aiming to rejoin fight By Associated Press Published: 17:04 EST, 10 January 2017 | Updated: 17:04 EST, 10 January 2017 e-mail WASHINGTON (AP) — A key U.S. lawmaker warned Tuesday that new intelligence shows former detainees released recently from the Guantanamo Bay detention center are trying to return to terrorism. In a letter to President Barack Obama, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said his committee had received a "troubling new report" from the U.S. intelligence community about detainees recently transferred to foreign countries. He said the report also showed that detainees were recently transferred to a country poorly equipped to stop them from returning to battle. "In light of this dangerous revelation, I again ask that you immediately halt all transfers from Guantanamo Bay and take steps to secure former detainees who pose a threat to U.S. national security," Royce said. Despite the long-running protestations of Republicans, Obama is expected to continue whittling down the prison's population in his final days in office. A senior Obama administration official declined to provide details on the intelligence assessment that Royce cited, but said the administration takes any signs of recidivism "very seriously" and works to stop it through military, law enforcement, intelligence and diplomatic means. The official wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. The U.S. opened the prison at a U.S. naval base in Cuba to hold militants suspected of ties to al-Qaida and Taliban after the 9/11 attacks. Most were never charged with a crime. But their indefinite detention and mistreatment in early days of the prison triggered a global outcry that Obama has argued undermines U.S. national security. Although Royce argued the recently released detainees were part of a broader pattern of former Guantanamo detainees pursuing a return to terrorism and posing a continuing threat to the U.S., the Obama administration had disputed that charge. Royce didn't name the country to which the detainees were transferred, and his office declined to provide more details, citing the classified nature of the intelligence report. In recent months detainees have been sent to Saudi Arabia, Camp Verde, Mauritania and the United Arab Emirates. Royce sent a copy of his letter to President-elect Donald Trump, who has called for a halt of releases from Guantanamo Bay. Most of the 693 detainees formerly held at Guantanamo were transferred under President George W. Bush. Of Bush's transfers, 21 percent are confirmed by the U.S. as having re-engaged in the fight. Only 9 of the 161 detainees transferred by Obama — or 6 percent — are confirmed as having re-engaged, although more are suspected of having done so. Closing the prison was a key Obama campaign promise that he was never able to fulfill, stymied by opposition by Congress, which refused to allow Obama to transfer detainees to prisons in the U.S. In a bid to empty the prison out, Obama tried to transfer as many as possible to third countries willing to accept them. The current population stands at 55, including 19 cleared for release. ___ Associated Press writer Ben Fox in Miami contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The ASUS PRO B9440 is powered by Intel’s new Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake-U CPUs, weighs only around one kilogram and can work for 10 hours on one charge. Since various people have different requirements and workloads, there are many types of business notebooks: from 12” ultra-thin and compact machines to 15” laptops with workstation-like performance and features. The ASUS PRO B9440 is located somewhere between in terms of design and performance: it comes in 13”-class chassis made of magnesium alloy and has so thin display bezels that it actually features a 14” display with FHD resolution and anti-glare coating. To make the PC more comfortable to use, ASUS installed a spill-resistant keyboard with large keycaps, backlighting, and 1.5 mm key travel. Meanwhile, the weight of the PC is around a kilogram (2.31 lbs), but it is MIL-STD 810G-rated for durability so it can survive shocks, vibration, exposure to low/high temperatures and so on. From hardware standpoint, the ASUS PRO B9440 is a mainstream PC running Intel’s Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake-U processor, equipped with 8 or 16 GB of LPDDR3 memory, up to 512 GB SSD, a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT module, two USB 3.0 Type-C connectors, stereo speakers, a fingerprint reader, and a 48 Wh battery. ASUS customers can order PRO B9440 machines with enabled Intel’s vPro for remote management as well as Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for hardware-based data encryption. The ASUS PRO B9440 Laptops Preliminary Specifications   Mainstream Premium Screen Resolution 1920×1080 CPU Family Core i5 Core i7 Core Kaby Lake-U Options vPro Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 or Iris Plus Graphics 640 RAM 8 GB LPDDR3 onboard 16 GB LPDDR3 onboard Storage Up to 512 GB M.2 SSD (SATA or PCIe) Wi-Fi 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT USB 2 × USB 3.0 Type-C (one port supports docking, power delivery) Fingerprint Sensor Yes Other I/O Microphone, Harman Kardon stereo speakers, TRRS audio jack Battery 4-cell 48 Wh Li-polymer Thickness 8.9 - 14.85 mm Weight 1.04 kilograms 2.31 lbs Price Starts at $999   ASUS SimPro Dock USB-C Docking Station Display Outputs 2 × DisplayPort 1 × HDMI 1 × D-Sub USB Type-A 2 × USB 3.0 Type-A Type-C 1 × USB 3.0 Type-C Card Reader SD card reader Gigabit Ethernet Yes To make the PRO B9440 compact, thin and durable, ASUS had to make certain design decisions. First, the company eliminated the webcam, which helped to shrink the display bezel (and will also please corporate IT security personnel). Second, ASUS removed all I/O ports except two USB 3.0 Type-C and a TRRS audio jack from the PC, which helped to shrink the chassis. While an ultra-thin form-factor is generally an advantage, it also means that to connect an external display, mouse and a keyboard, the ASUS PRO B9440 will require the ASUS SimPro Dock USB-C docking station that is sold separately, which effectively makes the system more expensive. Engineers from ASUS are not the only to make the aforementioned design decisions, so it looks like for many laptops docking stations will be required in the future. ASUS will ship the PRO B9440 notebook in May for the price that starts at $999. The cost of the ASUS SimPro Dock is unknown, yet its MSRP will be an important factor for those who plan to use the ASUS PRO B9440 in office environments. Ian says: Ultimately it's a clear shot across the bow of Dell's XPS 13, and seeing one at the show I was mightily impressed by form factor and weight. The trackpad had a good feel, and for writing it came across well. Other editors had reservations with the hinge mechanism, as it props up the keyboard and angles any hot air across the screen, but having used the Zenbook Infinity for 3 years, that doesn't bother me personally so much. Personally I guess I would have liked to see 32GB DDR4 and a touch screen model, and a key proponent here will be battery life. My current ZBI barely holds an hour of 'active' use (up to 5 hrs 'airplane word editing' use), and the B9440 looks pretty enticing right now if the battery life can hold up.

POST A COMMENT 29 Comments View All Comments BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link I like the specs and design with the exception of USB port placement. It strikes me as a bit strange to see the USB ports will move as the screen is opened, closed, or adjusted. It'd take a little adjustment time.

I started buying my own laptop for work several years ago when my employer decided we should all use toys. (I know I'm an old curmudgeon. No need to point out that opinions and usage may vary.) Reply rocky12345 - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link This is a nice unit but without the proper ports it is pretty much useless to most people. I could see it if they included the docking station with the laptops but to pay extra for something that should have been included is a no go for sure. It was stated that this is the way most companies are gonna do thing in the future. Here is a thought don't buy these products and vote with your wallet yes going thin is all cool and all but if it means giving up all of your connection options then it is not worth it. Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link Microsoft excluded the keyboard cover from the Surface and the New Nintendo 3DS didn't come with a battery charger. It's tough to quantify what impact those omissions had on overall sales numbers, but excluding things in the initial purchase package is pretty common.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 10, 2017 at 8:29AM In 2015, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hosted what it called its Data Center Day. During this event, the heads of the various divisions within the company's data center group (DCG) went over their respective strategies along with progress updates for their portions of the business. Intel DCG chief Diane Bryant holding a silicon photonics module. Image source: Intel.  During the presentation, Intel executive Alexis Bjoerlin talked about the company's strategy with respect to silicon photonics connectivity products. Indeed, at the time Bjoerlin's title was vice president and general manager of Intel's silicon photonics solutions group. However, Intel recently formed a new organization that encompasses the silicon photonics solutions group called the connectivity technology group. Bjoerlin, per her LinkedIn profile, is now the general manager of this new group. And, per Intel's job board, the company is now searching for a new general manager for Intel's silicon photonics solutions group. Let's take a closer look at what the formation of the broader connectivity technology group means for DCG. Intel expecting significant growth in this business Intel has made no secret of the fact that it expects the non-processor portion of DCG to grow substantially over the next several years, serving as a key enabler of the long-term growth that it expects from DCG. These non-processor products, per Intel, include Intel's Silicon Photonics connectivity technology, its Omni-Path connectivity technology (for high-performance computing), as well as its 3D XPoint memory modules. Two of those three technologies/product lines are data-center connectivity products.  Intel's current public long-term DCG revenue growth forecast is a 15% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, though this figure may be revised when the company hosts its annual investor meeting next month. Indeed, the company has said that it expects its data center processor business to grow at a 12% compounded annual growth rate through that time, which implies that it expects the non-processor portion of this business to grow at a 42.6% compounded annual growth rate through 2019. So, if these products are going to become serious contributors to Intel's revenue in the coming years (by 2020, Intel expects the total addressable markets for Omni-Path and Silicon Photonics products to total $6.6 billion), then it likely makes sense to have an overarching organization dedicated to connectivity technologies. The organization is in place, but let's see how it does Intel only recently began shipping Omni-Path and Silicon Photonics products last year, so it's unlikely that the revenue contributions from either of those product lines was significant in 2016. Nevertheless, with the products now in the market, it would be helpful for the company to provide insight into the initial revenue that the company is seeing from sales of these products, what kind of market share it expects to have in these segments over the next couple of years, and what sort of margin/profitability profile investors should expect from these products. Intel is unlikely to break down sales of these products in each of its quarterly reports (though the company does report consolidated revenue from non-processor products in DCG, which is helpful), but annual updates at its investor meetings going forward would be appreciated.

By: Steven Bassiri | SFF PCs in Computer Systems | Posted: 5 days, 13 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 90%Manufacturer: BIOSTAR Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging and System] Page 3 [Teardown of the RACING P1] Page 4 [BIOS and Software] Page 5 [Test Setup and Benchmarks] Page 6 [Temperature and Power Consumption] Page 7 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     Mini PCs, otherwise known as Small Form Factor PCs (SFF PC), have been increasing steadily in number and range of power. Some of them are capable of replacing your desktop at home, while others are used as media/streaming devices. On that spectrum, BIOSTAR's Racing P1 is positioned on the much more integrated side of things, meaning that it's not a full desktop replacement.     It uses an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 SoC, based on Cherry Trail; it is one of Intel's more recent Atom options. It's not a full-blown Core series product, and as such, it is capable, but not as powerful. Even so, the RACING P1 is a versatile device that can serve many purposes around the home or office, as it can run Windows 10.   To spice up the little computer, BIOSTAR has added RGB LEDs in the lid and even provides a 5050 RGB header for an external RGB cable.   Let's take a look at what this tiny PC has to offer.     Specifications     The RACING P1's Atom x5-Z8350 features a 64-bit quad-core CPU, includes Intel's HD graphics (max resolution 1080p), and has a TDP of only 2W with a base frequency of 1.44GHz and burst of 1.92GHz. Oddly enough, Intel lists the SoC as supporting up to 2GB of DDR3L, but BIOSTAR has actually engineered it to support 4GB DDR3L, which is preferable for 64-bit Windows 10 installations.   There is 64GB of built-in eMMC flash storage. BIOSTAR went ahead and added in both wireless AC and a 1Gbit NIC. The device has one USB 3.0 port and five USB 2.0 ports. Its only video output is through HDMI.     Pricing   The price of the Racing P1 is only $159. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Transparency Market Research Jan 10, 2017, 08:30 ET Share this article ALBANY, New York, January 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Leaders of the global Internet of things market in 2015 included the likes of Google, Inc., Apple, Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon, Intel Corp, and Cisco Systems. As seen, a lot of the key players in the global internet of things market are predominantly from consumer electronics or ICT fields, and a majority of the market leaders are headquartered in the U.S. As one of the highly trending markets in the world today, the global internet of things market is expected to be crowded by a large number of players of all sizes, according to a research report released by Transparency Market Research. Key players in the market are already ahead in terms of development rates and the acquisition of proprietary technologies. Wi-Fi is expected to continue being the leading technology in the global internet of things market, despite the grand entrance of alternative device communication methods such as ZigBee and NFC, which are also gaining an intense amount of demand and popularity. The global internet of things market is expected to reach US$334.22 bn at the end of 2016. Gaining strength at a whopping projected CAGR of 20.55%, this market's revenue is expected to reach US$1,492.31 bn by the end of 2024. Download PDF brochure for this Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=7214 Cloud Computing Opens New Doors in Global Internet of Things Market  "It is only natural for two of the leading concepts in device communication, software, and interfacing to find a way to merge with each other to create a whole new world of developments. The global internet of things market is currently finding a massive scope of growth through the growing demand for cloud computing across the world, because IoT communication can help resolve the constraints faced by cloud computing. IoT technologies can help supplement cloud platforms with additional storage options, processing power, and even help out with the energy constraints of hosting large-scale cloud computing solutions," states a TMR analyst. The global internet of things market is also being augmented by the increasing rates of globalization and urbanization in all regions. A staggering number of users across the world today have access to multiple branches of information technology, data sharing and storage methods, cloud computing solutions, and communication portals. The global internet of things market adds a beneficial layer to all this unlike any other concept and is therefore in extremely high demand. Real-time Analytics for IoT Lagging Behind  The phenomenal rate at which the global internet of things market currently can unfortunately not yet be matched by data safety and integrity analytics solutions. As the scope and usage of IoT concepts increases by the day, there is a very high need for real-time assessment of failures and data integrity across all networks.

As seen, a lot of the key players in the global internet of things market are predominantly from consumer electronics or ICT fields, and a majority of the market leaders are headquartered in the U.S. As one of the highly trending markets in the world today, the global internet of things market is expected to be crowded by a large number of players of all sizes, according to a research report released by Transparency Market Research. Key players in the market are already ahead in terms of development rates and the acquisition of proprietary technologies. Wi-Fi is expected to continue being the leading technology in the global internet of things market, despite the grand entrance of alternative device communication methods such as ZigBee and NFC, which are also gaining an intense amount of demand and popularity. The global internet of things market is expected to reach US$334.22 bn at the end of 2016. Gaining strength at a whopping projected CAGR of 20.55%, this market's revenue is expected to reach US$1,492.31 bn by the end of 2024. Download PDF brochure for this Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=7214 Cloud Computing Opens New Doors in Global Internet of Things Market  "It is only natural for two of the leading concepts in device communication, software, and interfacing to find a way to merge with each other to create a whole new world of developments. The global internet of things market is currently finding a massive scope of growth through the growing demand for cloud computing across the world, because IoT communication can help resolve the constraints faced by cloud computing. IoT technologies can help supplement cloud platforms with additional storage options, processing power, and even help out with the energy constraints of hosting large-scale cloud computing solutions," states a TMR analyst. The global internet of things market is also being augmented by the increasing rates of globalization and urbanization in all regions. A staggering number of users across the world today have access to multiple branches of information technology, data sharing and storage methods, cloud computing solutions, and communication portals. The global internet of things market adds a beneficial layer to all this unlike any other concept and is therefore in extremely high demand. Real-time Analytics for IoT Lagging Behind  The phenomenal rate at which the global internet of things market currently can unfortunately not yet be matched by data safety and integrity analytics solutions. As the scope and usage of IoT concepts increases by the day, there is a very high need for real-time assessment of failures and data integrity across all networks. The real-time vehicle diagnostics, for instance, are critical in allowing a vehicle's sensors of dangerous road conditions, collision threats, and internal system failures. This is difficult to achieve as in reality, these scenarios require a very fast rate of analysis backed by a constant monitoring status.

The entire Dell PC portfolio features Windows 10 and new 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, helping people maximize productivity and creativity while enjoying lifelike viewing experiences. Dell Canvas – Work at the speed of thought What began as the Dell smart desk concept in 2014 evolved into Dell Canvas —a new category of smart workspace technology that expands creative productivity for content developers and designers. The 27-inch QHD smart workspace can be used at an angle or flat on a desk so professionals can create, communicate and express their thoughts and ideas as naturally as they do with pen on paper. For example, through the use of touch, digital pen and totems, the Dell Canvas turns drawings into part of the digital workflow and enhances collaboration. The best just got better – XPS 13 adds convertible model; XPS 15 more powerful Dell XPS has won more product awards than any other brand in Dell’s history. Building on that success, Dell is adding the XPS 13 2-in-1, the world’s smallest 13-inch 2-in-1¹, to the beloved XPS family. It offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity and viewing options using Continuum, up to 15 hours of battery life² and eye-popping clarity with a gorgeous QHD+ (5.7M pixels) InfinityEdge touch display—another first for a 2-in-1. XPS & Precision AIOs – The best sound quality of any all-in-one PC Some All-in-One (AIO) PCs on the market today treat the audio experience as an afterthought. Co-created with Jack Joseph Puig, Grammy™ award winning producer and director of creative innovation at Waves Audio, the new XPS 27 AIO, and its Precision business sibling, crank sound to a whole new level with built-in audio quality that previously required an external sound bar. With full frequency range high-fidelity audio built in, they deliverthe best sound available in an AIO with 10 speakers pumping out sound at 50W per channel. Dell’s first VR-ready mobile workstation cements Dell’s leadership as virtual reality PC authority Dell is a world leader in virtual reality (VR) with the most PC options in the market including XPS, Alienware and Precision workstations supporting Oculus and HTC headsets. As more headsets fly off the shelves, there is a huge opportunity—and demand—for VR content creators. Enter the Dell Precision 7720 mobile workstation—Dell’s first VR-ready mobile workstation designed specifically for VR content creation. I 5K is so yesterday… Dell expands displays leadership with UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor The Dell UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor is the world's first 32-inch 8K resolution display. It has more than 1 billion colours, 33.2M pixels of resolution, 100 percent Adobe RGB and sRGB colour gamut and an unprecedented 280 ppi—which is four times more content than Ultra HD 4K resolution and 16 times more content than Full HD. Products built for business also feature 7th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro™ and Xeon® processors and new ultrathin notebook and 2-in-1 designs—reflecting customer demands for thin and light professional products that don’t compromise on productivity, security and manageability. For example, Dell expands its leadership in workstations with the Precision 5520, the world’s lightest 15-inch mobile workstation and a darling among creative professionals . The Latitude 7000 Series Ultrabooks™ and an award-winning 12-inch Latitude 5000 Series 2-in-1 are also added to the line-up . This detachable 2-in-1 weighs less than 2lbs, features a unique auto-deploy kickstand that extends up to 150 degrees for multiple viewing angles and has multiple connectivity options. Dell has also redefined the desktop experience with the new OptiPlex 5250 AIO and an updated line of OptiPlex small and micro form factor desktops. These sleek productsprovide full desktop performance and productivity in compact chassis that can be mounted behind corresponding displays with our innovative AIO stands or under a table to free up desk space. Perfect for pairing with a desktop or laptop, new monitors also include the Dell 24 Monitor for Video Conferencing, which features a two megapixel Full HD IR camera with privacy shutter, noise-cancelling microphone and dual 5W speakers built in, and the Dell 24 Touch Monitor.

And we weren't totally wrong-Amazon's Alexa assistant was baked into gadgets everywhere, even in cars! But looking back at all of our coverage, there was plenty we had no idea about. This is the best stuff we saw at CES 2o17. TVs that seem to disappear TVs are always a big draw at CES, and this year was no exception. Mercifully, the curved TV gimmick finally looks like it's on its way out. In the bigget trend to emerge, Sony, LG, and Samsung all moved the core components of their flagship TV sets to outside hardware. In the case of Samsung, all of the ports and brains of its new models are housed in an outside box. Sony built the guts for its top TV into a subwoofer that doubles as a TV stand. But for my money, the most impressive TV was the new W7 from LG. This OLED TV is just 2.5mm thick-literally thinner than my finger. Everything that actually powers the TV is jammed into a futuristic-looking Dolby Atmos soundbar. I want it. LG also had a prototype OLED TV that is 40 percent translucent. I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than three miles per hour (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't onboard, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market-and that's a big if-prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight, and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colors across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us aging millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $80! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2, and Link's Awakening. Lego's new robots Lego has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With Lego Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer, and a Lego stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-ass computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier-and potentially more useful-its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, wi-fi, memory, and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card-think everything from kiosks, smart TVs, and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at malls and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Hulu's new live TV service It wasn't just about the gadgets at CES-we also got a sneak preview of Hulu's upcoming live TV service. There are still a lot of open questions about the service-including specific channel lineups-but from what we can see right now, it has the potential to be the cordcutting skinny bundle service we've all been waiting for, Hulu is basically going to combine its existing service with Live TV channels, all in a brand new interface. In a world where current services such as PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, and DirecTV Now make you switch between live and on-demand, having everything in one interface is super smart. Plus, Hulu includes a built-in cloud DVR and for certain programs, you'll be able to start watching from the beginning, even if you started recording after a program started. Hulu's live product will be out in the next few months-if we had to guess, we'd say May or June-and will cost under $40 a month. We've been burned by live online TV services before, but Hulu has a track record that makes us very excited about the potential. Sony's crazy thin e-ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables-mostly because no one is buying smartwatches-Sony still showed an amazing concept for an e-ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and color-meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the e-ink display is thinner than a credit card, If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only-but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.it FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit Tags: ces 2017TVSretro bitRazerLGIntelHuluHondabest of ces 2017 Follow Gizmodo on facebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to Gizmodo Write for Us Next StoryYou Can Buy 'Vintage Milk' on Amazon Comments () Characters Remaining: 3000 SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION X Sort By:NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown Voted More from this author How to Watch Nintendo's Big Switch Launch Event Ebay Is Finally Doing Something About Counterfeit Goods The Nintendo Switch Rumors We Hope Are True Related stories Dell XPS 13 Convertible tipped for CES 2017 Huawei Unveils Mate 9 running Amazon Alexa at CES 2017 Dear God: Please Save This Poor Soul From the Saddest Booth at CES 2017 Asus enters CES 2017 with the Zenfone AR and the Zenfone 3 Zoom Lenovo shows off a prototype of a Microsoft Holographic VR headset at CES 2017 Samsung announces boring Galaxy A series smartphones before CES 2017 Personalized Recommendations Editor's Pick From EDM to Funk Pop, Our top 7 picks on what should go in your playlist this 2017 10 years of the iPhone: How Apple changed the way we communicate Lenovo Yoga 510 Review: Inconsistent Performer The Magic of George Michael: Bringing the “Faith” over a Glorious 30-Year Music Career OnePlus 3T review: Still the best damn phone for less than Rs 30,000 Nucleya Adds His Signature Bass To Papon’s Bihu in The Dewarists’ Latest Music Collaboration Hot Right Now The Genius Who Lived in a Storage Locker for $200 a Month Was Evicted ...

(Photo : Mike Coppola/Getty Images for DELL) Dell has recently announced its improved Dell XPS 15 for 2017 during the Consumer Electronics Show and it's good for it's patrons. The Dell XPS 15 is already impressive but the company has decided to listen to its customers rather doing what they want.  Although the overall performance of the Dell XPS 15 was as good as its competitors, there are still some issues that their customers raised -- like battery life and speed. This time, Dell made sure that consumers will appreciate the new enhancement on the device. The specs of the new XPS 15 varies and consumers will get to choose what type they. However, all types of the model laptop sports a 15.6-inch Full HD screen with touch screen capability that is optional. Last year's XPS 15 ran an Intel Skylake CPU, but the 2017 version will have the latest 7th Gen Intel Kaby Lake processor to solve heating problems. This change in processor will ensure that the laptop can perform its full potential. What's more interesting is that Dell incorporated the latest Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU for more graphics improvement, Digital Trends reported. Simply put, Dell has just made a powerful laptop for a mid-sized machine. However, the Intel Kaby Lake CPU varies and has three options: the dual-core Core i3-7100H, Quad-core Core i5-7300HQ and the Core i7-7700HQ. There is need not worry about the performance messing up on the battery life because the Intel Kaby Lake processors will take care of it with an increased battery life of up to 97 watt-hours, PC World reported. Dell also made the XPS 15 work with most professionals as it upgraded the new 32GB of RAM. The new XPS 15 also has an upgraded 1535 Wi-Fi chipset for better connection. The device includes wired ports such as HDMI, two 3.0 USB ports, a USB Type-C port and SD card reader. As for the storage options, users can opt to use the traditional 500MB of hybrid drive or a 1TB hard drive that is paired with the M.2 drive with the use of the Intel Smart Response Technology caching. Users can also choose to go on a straight M.2 PCle SSD with 256GB, 512GB or 1 TB capacity.

It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colours across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us ageing millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $US80 ($109)! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2 and Link's Awakening. LEGO's new robots LEGO has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With LEGO Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer and a LEGO stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-arse computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier — and potentially more useful — its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, memory and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card — think everything from kiosks, smart TVs and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at shopping centres and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Sony's crazy thin E Ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables — mostly because no one is buying smartwatches — Sony still showed an amazing concept for an E Ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and colour — meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the E Ink display is thinner than a credit card. If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only — but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.

The world has changed substantially over that time - the Web, Wi-Fi and smartphones top the list - but, as was true back then as well, most of the blinking trinkets at CES are destined for a quick trip from factory to landfill. Who really needs a 4K-per-eye VR headset that a) can’t be driven by any released graphics card, and b) can’t be worn over your face because the engineers (and I use that term loosely) simply glued two six-inch smartphone panels together? Sure, it’s a prototype, a promise for the future, but if that’s the future you’re promising, perhaps you could rethink your life choices. I mention VR because this year CES featured an entire exhibition hall filled with nothing but drones, VR and AR - all of the most-hyped and currently least-useful of consumer electronics. Sure, drones will be amazing in a few years, when we’ve figured out how to keep them away from aircraft above and out of the hands of paparazzi down below, but for now they’re simply noisy, annoying, and, at the consumer grade, not much more interesting than radio controlled aircraft from 25 years ago. VR and AR? So much hype and so much hoping that after the failures of the 90s this time will be different, because Google and Facebook and Sony and Microsoft want it to be. Many Shenzhen hardware manufacturers had their wares on display, from all-in-one Android headsets that had none of the features or functionality of the high-end headset Qualcomm showed off in its football-field sized booth, down to humble plastic cases for your smartphone that - if you’re really lucky - might work with a Google Cardboard-compatible app. I went to CES expecting to see a lot of VR consumer froth, but in addition I got a bellyful of augmented and mixed reality: the thick, see-through projection lenses familiar to Hololens users have been turned into commodities, so almost anyone can create a system that mixes the real-world with computer-generated imagery. None of these systems have the sophisticated ‘inside-out’ tracking of Hololens, nor Windows 10 Holographic Edition, so they basically delivered all of the worst features of the Google Glass experience - at several times the price. It’s as if now that we finally have VR, no one knows what to do with it. Case in point: the Intel VR ‘special press event’, hosted by CEO Brian Krzanich, featuring comfortable overstuffed chairs and a complete VR system for each of the 300 media who made it into the event. Krzanich took us through a tour of some state-of-the-art VR applications - including a livestream from a drone overflying a solar electric array somewhere out in the Nevada desert - but it all seemed a bit disparate and/or desperate. We don’t really know what VR will be good for, he seemed to be suggesting, but please play with it. The unbranded air sickness bag conveniently placed next to each Oculus CV1 headset perfectly framed Intel’s ambivalence about this so-exciting-it-makes-you-sick future. nVidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang barely mentioned VR at all in his Jobs-esque keynote, despite the fact that a big part of nVidia’s recent uptick in revenues comes from PC-based VR systems. Instead, Huang seemed more interested in anything but gaming, including a new ‘Spot’ gadget that functions like an Amazon Echo, connecting to Google Assistant, and - with a few scattered through the household - uses ‘beam forming’ to track your location all the time. Ideal for turning on the lights just before you enter a room -- and perfect for a stalker who wants to know your exact whereabouts. Such largely-unnoticed but increasingly pervasive ‘surveillance capitalism’ has become a persistent topic of conversation among the folks I ran into at CES, many of whom have spent their entire careers in tech and now wonder if the whole thing hasn’t become a bit too comprehensive. Sure, the machines just want to help us, but what about the opaque powers behind those machines, gathering data for their own ends? Should we be concerned - or should we just lie back and think of Zuck? I came away from CES feeling like we need a proper spring cleaning in technology, taking all the shiny, blinking, connected tchotkes off our shelves, considering whether they serve us well. If not, we need to bin them, filling the landfill with bad products, bad business, and bad actors. Clearing away the trash and distractions will help us focus on the world we really want to create. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 49 Comments More from The Register Wi-Fi for audiophiles: Alliance preps TimeSync certification program Nice market you have there, Bluetooth.

Linux 4.11 To Enable Frame-Buffer Compression By Default For Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 9 January 2017 at 07:28 PM EST. 7 Comments Skylake and newer hardware is set to have frame-buffer compression (FBC) enabled by default when the Linux 4.11 kernel rolls around in a few months. This feature can reduce power consumption while reducing memory bandwidth needed for screen refreshes. To date only Broadwell hardware has enabled frame-buffer compression by default. Earlier generations of Intel graphics hardware have had FBC support but it remains disabled by default due to various bugs and hardware issues. There have been several attempts over time at enabling FBC going back to around Haswell, but it's never panned out for keeping it on by default. But now Broadwell has been riding FBC by default and for Skylake+ it appears to be in good enough shape to flip the default switch. Back in December I wrote that Intel May Finally Enable Framebuffer Compression By Default For Skylake+ while today that drm-intel-next work officially landed in DRM-Next. So unless any big regressions come up in the weeks ahead, that DRM-Next code will be merged into mainline Git and hopefully remain on for Linux 4.11. The code landed in DRM-Next today via this pull request. Aside from flipping on FBC by default for Gen9 graphics and newer, there were also some fixes, documentation improvements, and other clean-ups. There was also a drm-misc-next update that landed. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

He added that there was "not one source of information" in Friday's US intelligence report. On Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a report saying it and other US intelligence agencies had a high degree of confidence that Russia meddled in the US election. Russia has repeatedly denied US allegations it was behind the breach or that it had any desire to interfere with the US election. ...

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links Search Popular Mass Effect Hardware Guides Games of 2017 Overwatch Best RPGs Star Wars on PC Worst Ports Gigabyte has a range of new Kaby Lake gaming laptops By Matt Porter Powerful and slim. Shares Gigabyte had a range of new laptops to show off at CES this year, each featuring Intel's new Kaby Lake generation of processors, and pretty powerful graphics cards too. The P56 is a 15.6-inch laptop which comes with an optional 4K display if you want it. The processor is the new Core i7-7700HQ, and to run that high resolution it has a GTX 1080 graphics card. The laptop has a Thunderbolt 3 port, and a fancy keyboard with per-key RGB lighting.  The Sabre 15 will also have a 7th generation Intel processor, and but isn't quite as beefy as the P56 as you only get a choice of a GTX 1050 Ti or a GTX 1050. Still, these cards will run games at 1080p medium/high just fine, and you get the same RGB backlit keyboard. (You can get a good estimate of 1050/1050 Ti performance from our desktop GPU reviews.) There's also the Aero 14, which comes with a GTX 1060 running a decent 2560x1440 IPS screen. Gigabyte also showed off what it calls the "world's lightest 14-inch GTX 1050 Ti laptop" in the P34, which weighs just 3.73lbs. Plus, the company is boasting the "world's slimmest 15.6-inch GTX 1070 laptop," which is 20.9mm and has a rather tasty 3840x2160 IPS display. It also houses a swappable bay that allows you to swap between a Blu-ray drive or 2TB of extra HDD storage. Gigabyte hasn't announced the prices of these laptops yet, nor do we know when exactly they'll be released, so keep an eye on PC Gamer for more information soon.

Supercomputers the size of a credit card, 4K TVs as thin as wallpaper, and smartphones that can 3D map their environment were just a few of the inventions showcased during this year’s exhibition. But while CES can be a showcase for trends that are likely to dominate the tech world over the coming months, it’s also home to the bizarre and strange. This year’s conference, which officially concluded on Jan. 8, included demonstrations of everything from “smart” hairbrushes to “intelligent” toothbrushes and shoes that suck up dust and crumbs as you walk. Here’s a look at some of the strangest devices from the CES show floor this year. View as 1 of 10 Replay SHARE Kérastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings L'Oréal You know what your next hair brush really needs? No, not softer bristles or a rounder shape for easier styling — an Internet connection. That’s what L’Oréal, Nokia-owned fitness tech startup Withings, and luxury haircare company Kérastase are betting. The three companies collaborated on a smart hairbrush with a microphone that “listens” to the sound of hair brushing, as well as an accelerometer, gyroscope and other sensors. The brush then feeds data to a mobile app, with the goal being to prevent users from damaging their hair. The most surprising aspect may be its price; the brush will retail for “under $200” when it launches in mid-2017, making it pricier than even most high-end hairbrushes. Replay SHARE Hushme Voice Mask Roman Sakun via YouTube We’ve all been stuck next to that loud person bellowing over the phone, whether it be at a coffee shop, on a bus, or while waiting at the airport. The HushMe aims to get rid of these unpleasant encounters, but in a seemingly uncomfortable and utterly bizarre way. The HushMe consists of a pair of earbuds attached to a padded mask that covers the wearer’s mouth to muffle his or her voice while speaking. It doesn’t look like an accessory most would choose to wear. Replay SHARE Swagtron Swagsurf Electric Surfboard Swagtron Swagtron is hoping that the electric “hoverboards” that dominated 2016 will be equally as popular with the beach crowd. The company debuted the Swagsurf, a $2,400 motor-powered surfboard that can reach up to 15 miles per hour on water, during this year’s conference. Let’s just hope the Swagsurf’s battery isn’t as prone to overheating as those found in Swagtron’s older Swagway scooters. Replay SHARE Denso Vacuum Shoes CES is full of peculiar home products, but perhaps the oddest came from Japanese firm Denso. The company showcased a pair of vacuum-cleaning shoes capable of sucking up dirt as you walk. The heel includes a pedal which activates the motor, as CNET explains, prompting the shoe to inhale nearby debris and store it in a tiny box in the shoe’s sole. It’s a concept in the prototype stage, so there’s a slim chance you’ll ever be able to wear Denso’s housecleaning footwear. Replay SHARE Uzer Eugene Trash Scanner Uzer French company Uzer wants us to think twice before throwing something in the trash. Its Eugene gadget tells users how to sort recycling and trash items by scanning its barcode, assuming the product packaging is still in good enough shape to do so. Each time an item is scanned, the app stores it so that it can easily be reordered. Replay SHARE Hypersuit VR Simulator Hypersuit VR, the-ory.com Virtual reality can trick your mind into feel like you’re standing on the edge of a cliff or using a jetpack to soar above the clouds. But it does little else to simulate the sensation of movement, which is where the Hypersuit comes in. The simulator is a massive exosuit that can be controlled via arm movements while lying on the device. This, its creators hope, will make the virtual reality experience all the more convincing. Replay SHARE Jagger & Lewis Smart Dog Collar Jagger & Lewis Wearable tech is usually easy to find on the CES showroom floor, but most of these gadgets are typically meant to monitor a person’s health and activity. This isn’t the case for Jagger & Lewis’ latest product, which it bills as a high-tech dog collar that can help owners understand how their pets are feeling. It claims to detect changes in behavior, which can make it easier for dog caretakers to pick up on illnesses earlier. Replay SHARE Kolibree Ara Smart Toothbrush Kolibree The tech industry has developed an obsession with artificial intelligence over the past several years, as evidenced by gadgets such as Kolibree’s new toothbrush. The oral hygiene product includes its own processor and is said to use deep learning algorithms that learn about the user’s habits, complete with an “offline” mode. Replay SHARE Ekko Connected Mirror French company Miliboo is betting people want to use their mirror for much more than grooming and assembling outfits. The startup showcased its Ekko smart mirror at CES, which plays music and video, displays the news, tells the time, and more. Replay SHARE Lovebox Jean Gregoire via YouTube The Lovebox is being promoted as a discrete way to correspond with a significant other. It looks like a $99 wooden trinket box that connects to the Internet and works with a mobile app. When the recipient receives a new message, a heart on the front of the box spins, and the text appears on a mirror that sits on top of the box.

This announcement coincides with Sherpa Technology Group’s rebrand from 3LP Advisors, reflecting its role in advising clients at the intersection of business, technology and IP.  The name change will become effective immediately. Mr. Detkin is a founder of Intellectual Ventures, a multi-billion dollar fund that invests in invention and currently holds over 40,000 patents. He will remain involved with the company. Prior to founding Intellectual Ventures, Mr. Detkin was a Vice President at Intel Corporation, where he oversaw Intel’s patent, licensing and litigation departments. Before that, he was a partner at the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. Mr. Detkin was recently named the second most influential “IP market maker” in the world by Intellectual Asset Management magazine. Mr. Detkin’s knowledge and deal experience will bolster the firm’s ability to offer business strategy and transaction execution services to its varied roster of clients, which includes Fortune 500 companies, emerging technology companies, investors, and investment banks. “Since 2008, 3LP has been offering advisory services to help Boards and management utilize technology and intellectual property to compete in their chosen markets. We have decided to rebrand ourselves as Sherpa Technology Group to emphasize our role as an experienced guide that enables our clients to reach the peak and achieve their ultimate objectives,” said Ralph Eckardt, Managing Partner of Sherpa Technology Group and former head of The Boston Consulting Group’s IP Strategy Practice. “The image of the “sherpa” resonates with us because it highlights our role as a trusted fellow traveler, and our commitment to helping our clients succeed by offering in-depth knowledge and practical experience that will enable them to reach the summit.” “Sherpa Technology Group’s diverse expertise and collaborative approach separates it from the dozens of other IP consulting shops,” said Peter Detkin. “Its professionals have unmatched credibility, experience and breadth of knowledge to advise senior management and Boards of Directors on critical business issues at the intersection of technology and IP, including both strategy development and technology transactions. Sherpa Technology Group is the premier advisory firm in this space, and I’m excited to add my knowledge and transaction experience to the firm.” “We are pleased to welcome Peter Detkin – a highly-regarded visionary and innovator – to our team,” said Kevin Rivette, Managing Partner of Sherpa Technology Group, former Vice President at IBM Corporation, and former Senior Advisor to The Boston Consulting Group. “Peter and I have known each other and worked together for 30 years and are excited to join forces at the same firm.  I could not have a higher level of respect for him personally and his accomplishments. His entrepreneurial spirit and strong IP and technology expertise make us stronger and add new dimensions to our client offering.” About Sherpa Technology Group  Founded in 2008 as 3LP Advisors, Sherpa Technology Group is a strategy and M&A advisor on technology and intellectual property (“IP”) matters.

Inventor Woes January 9, 2017 4:28 pm https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-evidence-is-in-patent-trolls-do-hurt-innovation IPdude January 9, 2017 5:58 pm Inventor Woes – hedge funds do not produce or manufacture any products. They manipulate markets while producing nothing. In fact, when they short stocks or sectors (as they did in 2008) it can and has exacerbated market slides considerably. I don’t hear the big tech companies calling them trolls – even though they have had a greater impact on the economy than NPEs. Hedge funds have hurt the economy and the average consumer by a much greater margin than NPEs. Not defending NPEs but at least they are buying and monetizing an asset (patents). There are greater evils to address, if that’s what your concerned with. angry dude January 9, 2017 10:42 pm Inventor Woes @2 Dude, You obviously never invented anything of importance in your entire life Cause if you did (like many of the readers of this blog) then you might be thankful to those evil “patent trolls” – at least they used to give some money to original inventors (up until a few years ago – thanks to relentless efforts of SV infingers lobby and VERY receptive obama/congress/scotus/you name it branch of US government) I am very serious – you should be thankful to those patent trolls for some of the things you use every day angry dude January 9, 2017 11:03 pm IPdude @3 I don’t get your apologetic tone What’s wrong with IP valuation/trading/enforcement ecosystem (provided IP is a real one and not a fake like those zillions of worthless junk patents issued to googles and apples of this world on rectangular phones and pinch to zoom alike patent garbage) ??? They have trading in futures and futures on futures or whatever financial scams they invented, but trading in real IP assets is wrong ??? If Edison or Tesla lived today they would already jump off the bridge Sad, very sad… IPdude January 10, 2017 11:44 am angry dude – not apologetic. Pointing out that hedge funds and big tech are the infringers and hedge funds do more harm than good, they both heavily lobby to get away with what they do and often harm small business. Pointing out the hypocrisy. Inventor Woes January 10, 2017 10:36 pm I agree that hedge funds don’t do anything and are just promoting rent-seeking behavior. However, the “there are much worse things” argument isn’t really an argument. It’s a red herring. Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

Many of the important advancements are really continuations of previous ideas, some of which had lost prominence but now are surging back to the front thanks to new devices. In other words, what’s old is new again, but that doesn’t dampen the way it will change the computing world in 2017. VR marches forward, with or without the mainstream Anyone could finally buy virtual reality in 2016, but it didn’t go mainstream. VR headsets are still a niche product and the most capable sets – the Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive – are priced outside most people’s reach. Neither company has publicly shared its sales. Patrick Moorhead, President of Moor Insights & Strategy, told us VR is “on a very slow ramp. Until the visual quality improves, more solutions are wireless, costs decline, and setup is simplified, VR won’t be mainstream.” Please enable Javascript to watch this video That hasn’t dampened anyone’s enthusiasm. Virtual reality’s presence at CES 2017 was serious, taking up significantly more space than the previous year. And there were plenty of announcements. HTC took the veil off its new Tracker system, which lets third-party companies build peripherals to use with Vive experiences. That of course opened the floodgates for the announcement of peripherals, ranging from toy guns, to gloves, to baseball bats. We also saw a kit from TPCast that turns the Vive into a wireless headset. It was announced prior to the show, but CES 2017 was our first chance to try it out – an important milestone, because wireless VR often has problems. To our surprise, TPCast worked well, without any noticeable lag. The biggest restriction is battery life. You can play wirelessly for up to 90 minutes. The money is staying around, and VR will keep improving so long as that’s true. No one knows how quickly virtual reality will catch on with consumers, but that doesn’t seem to be hampering VR’s prospects. Even Moorhead agrees with this, saying that, despite its issues, “VR, AR and MR investment will rise this year, especially on the content side, which is sorely lacking.” That’s important. In the past, VR fads have fizzed out as companies headed for more profitable shores. This time, the money is staying around, and VR will keep improving so long as that’s true. Big data needs big pipes The most important problem facing the PC this year is a classic; memory, and how to deal with it. Time and time again we heard different companies, in their own ways, outline their plans to deal with the coming data crunch. AMD, which plans two new chip architectures this year, is implementing aggressive new data management schemes in both. Ryzen, the company’s new processor, will have a massive cache paired with a prediction algorithm that can learn what data software is likely to need and call it up before it’s required. And AMD’s new GPU architecture, Vega, is designed around a high-bandwidth cache controller. While built to work initially with High Bandwidth Memory 2, the company says Vega can support many memory solutions. It can even be hooked up directly to long-term memory, if the storage solution is fast enough. Please enable Javascript to watch this video Intel, meanwhile, is positioning itself to lead a revolution in long-term memory with Optane. This new technology, first teased in 2015, will come to PCs sometime in 2017. Its speed supposedly exceeds that of any solid state drive, even those connected over the most modern NVMe interface. Initially, it will be sold as a super-fast cache drive, but the plan is to ramp it up to become main storage. That, if it works, would change a fundamental pillar of PC architecture. Home computers have, since their existence, paired fast low-capacity RAM with slow, long-term storage. Technology like Optane might make that unnecessary by accelerating long-term storage. RAM’s days might be numbered. More: Intel spills the beans on 3D Xpoint, the tech behind its Optane drives Even if that proves untrue, it’s clear fast storage is a priority for everyone. Seagate, the well-known hard drive brand, told us it expects demand for capacity to hit 2,900 exabytes (one exabyte is one million terabytes) by 2020. That’s a massive amount of data, and it’ll be impossible to handle without faster ways to access it. HDR comes to monitors High Dynamic Range was arguably the television technology of 2016, even more so than 4K resolution. Our Senior Editor of Home Theater and Audio, Caleb Denison, raves about it at every chance. Now, that same technology is coming to monitors. If you haven’t heard of it, here’s the deal brief. High Dynamic Range aims to increase contrast by allowing a greater range of brightness. In doing so, it makes images brighter and more lifelike. The blinding light of a sunny day looks dampened on a “normal” display, but with HDR, it can truly shine. More: What is HDR, and why should you care? HDR’s arrival on monitors could mean another leap forward in quality. However, all the monitors we saw at CES, or which we know will be available later this year, are missing HDR’s dance partner; OLED. The pair works best together because it’s hard for a traditional, backlit LCD to hit the brightness peaks HDR can achieve without blowing our black levels. Unfortunately, CES 2017 didn’t give us hope that OLED will be available in desktop monitors soon. Still, it’s good to see monitors focusing on quality more than they did in the past. Johnson Jia, Lenovo’s Senior Vice President, PC & Smart Device Business Group, told us “Our culture is becoming increasingly visual in the way we consume content. In fact, our customer surveys show that display is the number one experience customers care most about.” Frankly, we think consumers have cared about display quality for awhile, but at least companies are now listening. Samsung and Google partner to challenge Windows and Intel Chances are great that if you’re reading this on a computer, it’s a PC running Windows on an Intel processor. This partnership, sometimes called “Wintel,” is nothing official, but it’s been the norm for two decades. Google’s Chrome OS, released in 2011, was the first potential threat. And it in fact did catch on, in a way – Chromebooks often trend on Amazon’s best-selling notebooks list. They’re simple, they work, and they cost less than $500 even with sweet hardware. That’s enough for most people. Unfortunately, though, app support remains an issue. Chrome OS just doesn’t have many apps, and that often leaves it off shopping lists. Brad Bourque/Digital Trends Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Pro have an answer for that, as they offer full support for Google’s Play Store. Yes, that means you can run Android apps. And unlike previous Chromebooks that tacked on this support after the fact, the Plus and Pro have all the features needed to make the apps work as they should. That could be a boon for Chromebooks, says Moorhead. “One of the biggest drawbacks to Chrome being a full-fledged rich operating system was the lack of apps,” he told us. “Adding Android apps to chrome will increase its popularity. Android games tend to scale better on a large screen, and the Microsoft Office android apps on Chrome look promising.” Chrome OS users will be able to tap into a selection of apps that includes millions of titles. However, as Moorehead went on to point out, “developers will need to do a lot of improvement to the apps as most Android apps are designed for 4” displays. Running a 4-inch app on a 13-inch display is a suboptimal experience.” While the potential of Google Play is intriguing, Wintel isn’t on its deathbed yet.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 12:22pm   Comments Share: Related NVDA In Honor Of Friday The 13th, Here Are Some Of The Unluckiest Trades Of 2016 If Lendingtree Continues To Deliver, A Major Short Squeeze Could Be On The Horizon Financial Mortal Combat (Seeking Alpha) At a meeting with CFO Colette Kress and the IR team from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) at CES 2017, Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer noted that management’s tone was positive, with a “steady as she goes” outlook, as the company continued to execute on various growth drivers, such as gaming, automotive and AI. Following the sitdown, Schafer maintained a Perform rating on the best performing S&P 500 stock of 2016.  CES Takeaways “CEO Jen-Hsun Huang kicked off CES with his annual keynote, announcing GeForce Now, which delivers NVDA GPU technology to users via the cloud, an upgraded Shield incorporating AI and personal assistant capabilities to its streaming device,” the analyst mentioned. Management also provided fresh details regarding plans to roll out autonomous driving vehicles, in collaboration with Audi, by 2020. “While these greenfield initiatives will take time to root, we believe they represent a broader strategic trend by NVIDIA to leverage its industry-leading GPU technology, and its inherent technological strength in AI, to more pervasive applications,” Schafer stated. What To Expect In gaming, NVIDIA expects the momentum that led to 33 percent growth in 2016 to persist, driven by upgrades to its Pascal, ASP [average selling price] increase due to user demand for higher performance SKUs [stock keeping units], as well as next-gen Volta GPU, expected later in 2017. “Auto growth is expected to moderate as infotainment matures and Drive PX for autonomous driving applications begins its nascent ramp. DC [direct-to-consumer], however, should continue its momentum as NVDA continues to dominate the AI training market driving growth in Tesla and GRID,” the analyst added. Schafer believes that the stock now faces increasing difficult comps and would prefer to wait for a more attractive entry point.

The side panel is an LCD screen which is backlit by the case’s interior lighting, allowing it to function as a transparent display. The LCD screen is a 19-inch display with a resolution of 1,280 x 1,024. The panel connects to a single PCI expansion slot inside the case, which then routes to a video input on the back of the chassis. iBuypower first showed off its Project Snowblind side panel last year, but has now officially announced its pricing and release date. According to PCWorld, the Snowblind panel will cost $250 and will be available from February 2017.

Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent 11 January 2017 • 1:42pm "Glorious, stirring sight!" murmured Toad. "The poetry of motion! The only way to travel! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my!" OK, so maybe Kenneth Graham's The Wind in the Willows character Mr Toad's first reaction to a motor car isn't shared by every commuter in the car park that constitutes Monday morning on the M25. The automotive freedom we're discussing here, however, while far from that of Toad's, is important. What do self-driving cars, this year's hot automotive technology, mean for people who don't have a self-driving car? Will these new vehicles, be they a bumbling Google driverless taxi, or a sleek Mercedes chauffeur-less limo, threaten your freedom to drive whenever and wherever you please? Tech trends | An acceleration in driverless cars The benefits of autonomous cars are widely trumpeted as the electronics and automotive industries plunge headfirst into what one independent forecaster describes as a "gold rush". A 2016 McKinsey report suggested that by 2030, global new car sales could comprise up to 15 per cent autonomous models, up to 50 per cent electric vehicles and up to 10 per cent shared-mobility vehicles. Clearly in the way we get around, there is change afoot, but there was scant discussion of a concomitant erosion of freedoms in the vapid bubble of technology utopianism at this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.  In fact the tech industry is in trouble; it's meteoric and profitable and influential growth is slowing. A decade on from the 2007 first Apple iPhone units aren't shifting as they did and tech share values have teetered. There are no clear new trends to replace smartphones, particularly the lacklustre so-called internet of things or connected wearables, which have also been identified as a convenient backdoors for hackers and cyber terrorists. As one cynic observed, at least autonomous cars provide way for the tech industry to shift more units and get a choke hold on car makers. Concept-i Toyota pics But does the public really want autonomous cars? One survey, released just before Christmas, showed the public don't believe fully autonomous cars will be available anytime soon and they're not sure they want them compared with simpler tech to help find their parked car, avoid an accident or prevent it being stolen. Nevertheless, the motor industry is forging ahead, staking claims to establish standards, technology platforms and the high-definition maps essential for the top level of autonomous driving; levels four and five defined in a five-point hierarchy from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). BMW, for example, announced a new alliance with chip-maker Intel and tech company MobilEye, aiming at building autonomous cars in 2021. Nissan's even teamed up with Nasa to provide a kind of autonomous car help desk for the car to call when it meets something it's never seen before and doesn't know how to proceed. So are self driving cars safe? Some models are already equipped with limited level two self driving capabilities. Last year we commented on the abrupt way in which such systems (on Mercedes-Benz's new E-class and BMW's new 5-series) simply switch off with no more warning than an extinguished lamp when they can't 'see' the road markings. BMW is in the driving seat of European driverless car technology Gill Pratt, Toyota's American research boss, is concerned about this 'hand-off' and whether drivers remain aware enough to safely take back control in such circumstances.  "Level two hand-off can happen at any time with no warning," he says, "and the driver needs to supervise the autonomy. Indications are that drivers tend to under or over trust the system... Is level two autonomy a bad idea? Some companies think it is and are skipping this level. We are not sure." Volkswagen's Christian Senger, vice president of e-mobility, thinks car makers not producing levels one to three autonomous driving cars are missing out. "The hunger from people for better functions is there, it's unstoppable and we need to provide it," he says. "We might, however, have to provide level-three vehicles, but sell them as a pretty good level twos." Senger suggests that autonomous driving might even require abandoning the traditional model of car manufacturing and adopting one similar to that of Tesla. This is where customers are part of the development fleet and manufacturers automatically flash updates and download data to develop and refine software. "If we try to stay with our [old] model, that would kill our future," he says. "Imagine trying to develop level-three autonomous driving with 100 million test kilometres, how long would that take? But with a few hundred thousand [customer's] cars doing 100km a day, that's a way to rapidly improve software problems." ces 2017 weirdest gadgets With companies such as Nokia's former map maker, HERE now owned by Audi, BMW and Mercedes, customers will be part of the development process, even if they don't own an autonomous driving car. High definition maps (along with vehicle-to-vehicle communication, high-tech cameras and laser range finding) are must-haves for self driving cars and your car's sensors will be press ganged into providing data to develop maps and software. And then there's the cost. As well as the sensors, just processing the data they produce will be expensive. Mercedes-Benz is developing advanced camera systems and software for its autonomous cars. "It is a neural data analysis system," says Marius Cordts, a Mercedes engineer working on image recognition "with thousands of images and millions of parameters teamed with an intelligent learning algorithm. At its peak we need to process up to 7 terabytes per hour." Watch | How do driverless cars work? 01:33 "Each car could be producing as much as 4,000 gigabytes of data a day, so there's likely to be a significant increase in the need to process it," says Bridget Karlin, MD of the internet of Things at Intel. "We'll also need high-speed, low-latency and ultra-reliable throughput, and robust data processing."   "The reality is that the tech exists today," says Kevin Clark chief executive of Delphi, a tier-one supplier which introduced its own autonomous concept at CES.  "The biggest problem for the manufacturers is the cost, legal and liability responsibilities." Assuaging those costs, which VW's Senger suggests could add up to a total of about €20,000 (£17,152) a car, is one reason for the current flurry of activity, mergers and buy outs. Ford, for example, is committed to introduce autonomous vehicles for ride sharing schemes by 2021 and has invested $75 million in Velodyne Lidar, along with matched funding from Baidu, the Chinese internet search provider, to reduce the cost of this notoriously expensive technology. Panasonic pics CES The potential benefits of self-driving cars could be huge, although exactly how much and to whom they accrue is a moot point. One estimate suggests that America could free up some 5.7 million square metres of parking space saving up to $190 billion (though where the autonomous cars will go when not in use remains a mystery). If crashes were reduced by what is assumed to be up to 90 percent, there's also a potential saving of up to $180 billion in US emergency healthcare. Again, what happens to your insurance for your 'risky' manually driven car is unclear, as is the question of whether car makers or motorists will have to underwrite an autonomous car's liabilities in law? The safety benefit is interesting and, according to Tom Gebhardt, Panasonic's president of automotive systems in America its one of the key benefits of autonomous driving which he says "is not that far away". This comes just weeks after Uber suspended controversial trials of its driverless taxis in San Francisco after cars were seen running red lights and the state of California threatened legal action. According to the World Health Organisation, in 2013 there were over 1.25 million road deaths worldwide. Awful as this figure is, it important to understand that these deaths are disproportionately concentrated in developing nations (Africa, India and China represented over three quarters of a million), where roads aren't always well maintained, and lanes and road-edge markings not as well defined as required by most self-driving systems, plus observance and enforcement of road rules aren't as stringent as in more developed nations. Some parts of the world have less stringent road regulations than others Credit: ANTONY NJUGUNA/Reuters Most car makers agree that making autonomous driving work in such conditions will be tough  "Adoption will be a steeply stepped process," says Mercedes's Källenius. "Autonomous cars won't be appearing simultaneously in New York City and the rain forests of Borneo. Initially it will be on certain roads and in certain cities, but it will grow." "An automated car in India? That's a long way off," says Delphi's Clark. But just what level of safety is acceptable in a world of autonomous cars?  "Historically humans have zero tolerance of death by machine," said Toyota's Pratt, "but we don't yet know the answer, or whether it will be local or the same across the world." Panasonic is working with the Colorado Department of Transportation on an experimental smart road out of Denver and 90 miles into the mountains, on which autonomous cars can be tested. Shailen P Bhatt, executive director for Colorado's DoT spoke at the Panasonic press conference pointing out that "there were 35,092 road deaths in North America in 2016, which is the equivalent of a 747 airliner crash every week." Again you need to drill down into the numbers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2011, over 3,331 people were killed and over 387,000 injured in motor vehicle accidents connected to distracted driving and that's a low figure. The US National Safety Council reckons the figure for vehicle crashes caused by cell phone use is nearer to 28 per cent of the total. So isn't autonomous driving just a technical salve for a problem partly created by technology in the first place? "You could say that autonomous driving is technology recovering a problem created by technology," observes VW's Senger. Autonomous cars: who is winning the race? The Apple Corporation was recently the recipient of a civil lawsuit in connection with a 2014 accident in Dallas where a five-year old girl died after the car in which she was travelling was rear ended by an SUV driven by a man allegedly chatting on Apple's Facetime app. The lawsuit alleges that Apple failed to adopt its own safer version of Facetime, which disabled the app when being used in a moving vehicle. It's the sort of nonsensical case which sends shivers through the Silicon tech industry, which has been generally notable for its buccaneering attitudes to safety, product liability, corporation tax and corporate responsibility. Uber's taxi research in San Francisco raises further questions. Up to now, the industry has assumed that autonomous cars would defer to everything, but as Glen De Vos, Delphi's vice president of engineering, electronics and safety says: "if the car is too conservative, it'll never go anywhere. It needs to be sufficiently aggressive and assertive to make its way and that's where machine learning comes into play." But if autonomous cars are pushy and rude, at least you'll be able to get past them, won't you? Not necessarily. Since much of the technology depends on vehicle-to-vehicle communications, which also allow platoons of cars to be electronically linked together just inches apart to improve aerodynamics. Such platooning, also described in the Satre roadtrain EU project, might well require a motorway lane of their own. Also greedy for road (and toad) space is a proposal in front of the UK's Highways Agency for dynamic wireless charging highways for battery cars. This is a suggestion from research body, the TRL, which is projected to cost around £3.9 million a mile. While not all autonomous cars will be battery electric, most pundits think the twin technologies will come together, which means another lane of road closed to ordinary motorists. Ask about the freedoms that might have to be sacrificed and you get a variety of answers. "Freedom will not necessarily be lost," says Mercedes's Källenius. "There are over 30 billion cars on the road, so replacement will take time and the two will have to coexist." "Any car company that is not adapting their futures right now is in the red zone," says VW Senger. "The technology, the legal framework, and the acceptance of the public are all important discussions about the future of autonomous cars. We need to talk about it..." We do indeed.

"Targeted propaganda and cyberattacks from abroad will pose a great threat to the electoral campaign in Germany," Oppermann told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.

This is a policy worked out by anti-Russian globalist think tanks and it's the reason they went after Breitbart over Dortmund when the exact same story was reported in dozens of newspapers in precisely the same way. The point is that the strategists have singled out Breit because it's going to open a German platform and they're terrified Trump will use it via Steve Bannon to take down Merkel. We all know exactly what happened in Dortmund. Playing nice doesn't work by obfuscating the facts to get that warm PC glow of self congratulation. There's no appeasing the EU-NATO Axis. Truth first.

The reason is not Russian hacking but that they are nowadays (since Gerhard Schröder with HartzIV-laws) only a neoliberal party without any difference to the merkel party. I never will elect the spd again in my life. Reply Zoanthropy 15:50 09.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete The propaganda will come from the Frau Merkel group, evil bunch.

Mr. Detkin is a founder of Intellectual Ventures, a multi-billion dollar fund that invests in invention and currently holds over 40,000 patents. He will remain involved with the company. Prior to founding Intellectual Ventures, Mr. Detkin was a Vice President at Intel Corporation, where he oversaw Intel's patent, licensing and litigation departments. Before that, he was a partner at the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.

"The image of the 'sherpa' resonates with us because it highlights our role as a trusted fellow traveler, and our commitment to helping our clients succeed by offering in-depth knowledge and practical experience that will enable them to reach the summit." "Sherpa Technology Group's diverse expertise and collaborative approach separates it from the dozens of other IP consulting shops," said Peter Detkin. "Its professionals have unmatched credibility, experience and breadth of knowledge to advise senior management and Boards of Directors on critical business issues at the intersection of technology and IP, including both strategy development and technology transactions. Sherpa Technology Group is the premier advisory firm in this space, and I'm excited to add my knowledge and transaction experience to the firm." "We are pleased to welcome Peter Detkin – a highly-regarded visionary and innovator – to our team," said Kevin Rivette, Managing Partner of Sherpa Technology Group, former Vice President at IBM Corporation, and former Senior Advisor to The Boston Consulting Group. "Peter and I have known each other and worked together for 30 years and are excited to join forces at the same firm.  I could not have a higher level of respect for him personally and his accomplishments. His entrepreneurial spirit and strong IP and technology expertise make us stronger and add new dimensions to our client offering."

Is Apple ripe to be disrupted? Image: Apple 10 years ago, Apple rewrote the history of computing with the unveiling of the iPhone. But Apple should remember that no disrupter is safe from displacement, warns John Kennedy. The richest, most poignant and absolutely beautiful irony of the tech industry is that no disrupter is safe from being disrupted or displaced by a newer, more nimble and relevant newcomer. It’s called continuum and it will go on forever. The fact that Apple wasn’t even a newcomer when it came along in 2007 and disrupted – or more likely destroyed – the cosy order of things dominated by Nokia, BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft made the victory all the sweeter for the tech giant. ‘The tech world in 2017 is a strange, beguiling and confusing landscape that is ripe for disruption… or leadership’ That sweet victory, celebrated with pomp, circumstance and deserved pride, could be short-lived if Apple fails to take on board the savage and contradictory realities of its own existence. 9 January 2007 is being marked as the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. I watched the “and one more thing” moment from my desk via a live video feed after Steve Jobs ran through his customary Mac and OS X product line-up at Macworld in San Francisco. He removed a shiny device from his pocket, demonstrating how easy it was to send a text message using the iPhone, and a new era in computing was born. The device wasn’t even any more sophisticated than others on the market, but it did something different – it made phones easy to use. Smart became simple. The device did not come to market for almost nine months after that, but what followed was a revolution in operating system technology and it upended the entire software business model with the subsequent arrival of the App Store. The core message was that ‘smart’ phones should really be simple and easy to use phones. Comparing an iPhone from 2007 with an iPhone from 2017 under the hood would be like comparing a Ford Fiesta with a Porsche 911, but from a usability perspective, the changes since then are subtle. It’s still pretty much the same phone, albeit with faster processors, bigger screens, better radios and more powerful cameras. Some will say that this moment in 2007 was the moment that the modern Apple was born. Wrong. Back to the core: When Apple was really reborn Then and now. The iPhone in 2007 and the iPhone in 2017. Image: Apple The modern Apple was born almost 10 years earlier. I remember sitting at a computer at the Harvard library close to MIT during an idyllic summer holiday in Boston, scouring the web for news, when the unthinkable happened and I nearly fell out of my seat. Apple’s nemesis, Microsoft, bailed out a near-bankrupt Apple with a $150m investment that saw the return of Steve Jobs to the fold. This, in my mind, is what kick-started a new chapter in computing industry history. 6 August 1997 will be forever engraved in my mind as the real moment Apple was reborn. It also epitomises to me the constant struggle Apple has had to define itself. In a sense, this is why Apple has such a tight connection with artists, musicians and other creators. That sense of necessary, constant reinvention reaches a pinnacle of achievement every time. Since the late 1970s, Apple was seen as the real disrupter in personal computing but got caught in a dogfight with Microsoft and IBM. Its machines were considered the best but just too expensive. A ‘Wintel’ pact between Microsoft and Intel pretty much sealed the matter, resulting in cheaper machines for the masses. Microsoft was in the ascendancy by the late 1990s when Apple was close to the wall. Jobs’s vision of a pure end-to-end computing experience from hardware to software was denied by his dramatic departure from Apple, and what followed was a slow and steady demise as a succession of CEOs – including John Sculley and Gil Amelio – fought without success to steady the ship. The darkest hours saw Apple almost succumb to licensing its OS for other OEM manufacturers to build Macs. The return of Steve Jobs, albeit at first for a $1 salary and the use of a corporate jet, ignited a design culture that saw overlooked designers like Jony Ive and operations supremos like Tim Cook find their feet and flex their muscle. The NeXT operating system developed by Jobs during his exile sowed the seeds of what we knew as OS X, or today as Mac OS. Apple in the late 1990s must have been like Florence during the Renaissance The first flourish of innovation – or swagger – from this reborn Apple came in 1998 with the iMac G3. Until that time, all computers were either black or beige (mostly beige). With its 15in screen and multicolour luminescent shell, Apple redesigned the personal computer. The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2015, comparing it with the original Macintosh 128K (1984). A higher res version can be found here. Image: iMac/Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 4.0)  It was a sign of things to come and the real feeling that computing could be an extension of your personality in terms of colour and appearance. Apple once again set the standard for breaking with convention. This design ethos and sense of tearing up the rulebooks had caught hold. The iPod wasn’t the world’s first MP3 player when it launched in 2001. Indeed in 1999, in an office on Harcourt Street in Dublin, the two founders of Movidius – David Moloney and Sean Mitchell – demonstrated to me what was later to become the guts of the iPod Shuffle in 2005. Moloney and Mitchell last year sold their company Movidius to Intel for a rumoured $300m. With the iPod and the subsequent arrival of iTunes, Apple showed how it could reinvent itself and transform and, in doing so, became a music industry mogul but also one of the world’s biggest e-commerce repositories. Software, movies and books followed. But what was coming with the iPhone would be the company’s biggest transformation yet. The end of the phoney war: Why the mid-2000s were an awful time for phones Before the iPhone came along, smartphones were in their infancy. But they were terrible to use. The idea of a device that could surf the internet, send and receive email, or send data via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi wasn’t new in 2007. I first hefted a Nokia Communicator machine in 1997 (a destroyer of the lining of many a jacket) and it could do most of these things. While Nokia was in its heyday at the start of the 2000s, producing popular devices with seemingly never-ending battery lives, BlackBerry had the swagger of a disrupter. At first, BlackBerry started with handy email/paging machines around 1999, but by 2005, devices like the BlackBerry Pearl were seen as state-of-the-art, as were some devices from Palm. The problem by 2007 was that the machines – and the electronics inside them – were constantly evolving but the operating systems were not. Nokia’s N-series devices could do all kinds of amazing things, from multimedia audio and video playback to photos, video and mapping – but they were horrible to use. To give you a sense of how bad things were getting, Microsoft had been championing its own version of Windows for mobile devices. This began with Windows CE before culminating with Windows Mobile 6.5, and was pretty much the same as putting an entire desktop version of Windows on a phone. No one understood that for smartphones to be smart, they needed to be simple and elegant to use. But Apple itself made some frightening mistakes. The old ‘design by committee’ tradition that nearly destroyed the company in the 1990s hadn’t entirely been eradicated and one of the spoiled fruits to emerge was the Motorola Rokr E1 in 2005, a candy bar device that came with iTunes and could – at best – store around 100 songs. To me, the Rokr signalled the end of a glorious mobile phone design era at Motorola that was epitomised by the immortal and much-loved Razr. Purple reign But just as Motorola entered its own dark ages, a secret effort called Project Purple began at Apple in 2004. Project Purple, which included Jobs and Ive, initially intended to produce a tablet computer that would ultimately become the iPad in 2010. However, a collaboration with AT&T’s (then mobile arm Cingular) steered this in the direction of a smartphone. Before 9 January 2007, the notion of Apple producing its own smartphone was appealing and exotic but almost sinful in the spirit of Catholic guilt. No one could forget past failures like the Newton PDA, and while many suggested Apple could simply put a cellular radio into the iPod, it just seemed too fantastic. Rumours of an Apple phone that were abound then were echoed in 2012, when Apple television rumours circulated wildly, and this hype continues now, with talk of Apple cars. But until that moment when Steve Jobs said “one more thing”, it was believed by many to be an impossible dream. At first Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft mocked the new phone. Then Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer sneered that “it has only one button” while the leadership of BlackBerry, or RIM as it was known then, decided to firmly place their heads in the sand. Nokia tested its swagger with the N96 and N97, BlackBerry destroyed its loyal base with the mediocre BlackBerry Storm and Microsoft acquired Nokia’s phone business – with disastrous consequences. The core lesson of the iPhone in 2007 was that even though it didn’t have the same technical firepower or specifications as other rival devices, Steve Jobs correctly guessed that people just wanted a phone that would be easy to use. The iOS operating system structure is pretty much the same today as it was 10 years ago. That was the gap in the market. And now the iPhone is responsible for around two-thirds of Apple’s revenues. Products like the iPod and iPad aren’t selling as well as they used to and are rarely mentioned in the companies’ earnings. But can the iPhone remain Apple’s primary cash cow for the next 10 years? Who will disrupt the Apple cart? Various iterations of the iPhone since 2007. Image: Apple For the first time in almost a decade, 2016 saw Apple’s revenues from iPhone sales drop. Even though the iPhone continued to deliver for Apple in the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates, the illusion or mask of immortality has begun to slip. And rivals scent blood. Apple has an Achilles heel, but no one has found it yet, or is big enough to exploit the chinks in the armour. Apple’s sheer scale has created many enemies, including the European Commission, which wants to exact a €13.9bn pound of flesh from the tech giant by alleging a sweetheart tax arrangement with Ireland. Apple can either circle the wagons or innovate. This is because the only weapon Apple has now is momentum. Until it comes up with a new disruption – be it a car, a TV or a new phone – it is precisely in the besieged place that its rivals like Nokia, Microsoft and BlackBerry were in the short years after 9 January 2009. The problem with the momentum that Apple needs is that smartphone sales are saturating. The smartphones that Apple sells are comparatively expensive in the market and this is happening in a world that no one but the rich are getting richer, and confidence of ordinary people to spend will be eroded by the spectre of a Trump presidency. Apple has incredible loyalty to its technology and has an instinctive grasp of its users’ preferences, as demonstrated with the iPhone SE last year, which had all the technology of an iPhone 6s crammed into the diminutive body of an iPhone 5s. This was clever and intuitive on Apple’s part, but how many ace cards does Apple still have up its sleeve? The tech world order in 2017 is in a strange array. Opportunities are possibly abound in areas like smart homes, smart cars and smart cites, all aided and abetted by the internet of things and cloud. But right now, could Amazon’s Alexa voice-based assistant really be the shape of things to come? I mean, really? Microsoft, through Satya Nadella’s leadership, has found an alluring sense of zen. It is relaxed in its dominance of cloud and it is even cooperating with Apple in terms of iOS apps, actually accruing a new generation of loyal followers by imitating Apple’s hardware model with its Surface Book personal computer. The VR revolution currently led by players like Oculus, Samsung, Sony and HTC is a slow burner, and as the AR potential – as espoused through Microsoft’s HoloLens – offers some opportunity to shake things up, Apple has yet to pounce on VR or AR. The tech world in 2017 is a strange, beguiling and confusing landscape that is ripe for disruption… or leadership. Could Apple mark 10 years of the iPhone with a game-changing device like a new smartphone? Could it simplify the confusing and troubled start to the VR age as only Apple can? Will it really create an Apple car? Hints for me lie in the AirPod wireless earphone products, in terms of how Apple has created an invisible, intuitive interface that sets the standards for wearables through gestures and responsive hardware. But as usual, only Apple knows. My instinct is that if the company really wants to survive, thrive and remain disruptive for the next 10 years, it needs to reach back to a point in time before 9 January 2007, when its back was to the wall and it was vulnerable. Technology changes but spirit and heart don’t. It needs to reach back to that spirit of innovation that was born anew in 1997. For that, it needs humility, a sense of vulnerability and the naïve quality of artistry that made computing simple and beautiful for the masses.

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. “What’s going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs – and the music is still playing,” said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. “Everyone is changing partners.” Several suppliers – notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive – are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player,” said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. “The technological challenges are immense,” Shashua told Reuters. “I would compare it to sending a man to the moon.” Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems – the building blocks for self-driving cars – to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi’s chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW’s senior vice president for automated driving. “We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021,” Frickenstein said. “That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption.” Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW’s joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG’s Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. “We’re not looking to develop a proprietary system,” said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch’s board of management who oversees autonomous driving. “We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping.” While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. “There’s not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution – no one who knows everything, every part of what’s needed to make an autonomous car,” said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi’s head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems – cybersecurity, for instance – should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. “There will be a mix because it’s quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on,” Devauchelle said. “Those are big blocks.” Reuters Tags: automotive, BMW, driverless cars, Ford, General Motors, General Motors Co, Nvidia, Self Driving cars, self-driving, Tesla Also read Uber defies order from California DMV to cease operations, says its self-driving cars will remain on road CES 2017: BMW and Mobileye plan to deploy 40 self-driving cars for tests in US and Europe X Recommended For You Tesla Motors is rolling out software update enabling fully autonomous vehicles Uber self driving car program in San Francisco comes to a halt as DMV revokes registration of cars Hyperloop could very well be the future of transportation Uber defies order from California DMV to cease operations, says its self-driving cars will remain on road Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

They hit 7026MHz specifically, with a CPU multiplier of 70, and an FSB of 100.   The new Core i7-7700K has a base clock of 4.2GHz and boost of 4.5GHz, with most people able to hit 5GHz without a problem. The CPU retails for $305 in the US, and obviously changes throughout the world - so for me in Australia, it'll cost $1500 or something ridiculous (jokes, jokes - probably $1200).

Although the domestic semiconductor industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, China has a smaller market share than the top five foreign suppliers combined, including U.S.-based Qualcomm and Intel, said Chen Feng, vice president of Chinese fabless semiconductor maker Rockchip. Chen is currently in Las Vegas at the CES 2017, where Samsung unveiled its latest Chromebook, reportedly powered by a Rockchip chipsets. "U.S. semiconductor companies still have an advantageous position, so claiming that Chinese firms pose a threat to U.S. national security is nonsense," he told the Global Times on Sunday. On Friday (U.S. time), the U.S. government released a report on ensuring long-term leadership in semiconductors from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). According to the report, the U.S. semiconductor sector faces challenges in innovation, competitiveness and integrity. The report also noted "that Chinese policies are distorting markets in ways that undermine innovation, subtract from U.S. market share, and put U.S. national security at risk." The U.S. government has concerns over the development of Chinese semiconductors, which may reshape the industry's outlook and affect profits at U.S. firms, Xu Xiaohai, senior analyst in the semiconductor industry research division at CCID Consulting, told the Global Times Sunday. U.S. authorities intervened in the potential merger and acquisition (M&A) of Chinese semiconductor Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund and German firm Aixtron by telling German authorities that the purchase would be used for military purposes, Reuters reported in October 2016, citing the Handelsblatt newspaper. The potential 2 million-deal has been put on ice since then. In its report, PCAST argued that Chinese subsidies for strengthening domestic production encourage foreign firms to relocate to the country. Further, higher market concentration in China, "can increase national-security risks for the U.S. and other countries." "The development of the domestic semiconductor industry comes from upgrading China's overall electronic information industry. The downstream industry, China's end-terminal device [computers or smartphones] assembly industry is mature, but its technical content and profit level is low. Yet the upstream integrated circuit industry has more technology and much higher profit level," Xu said. Foreign companies still hold a large share of the global semiconductor market, according to IC Insights. The five top chip suppliers - Intel, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom and SK Hynix - held 41 percent of the market in 2016, according to a research bulletin published on December 6, 2016. While China's electronics market grows, the demand for finished semiconductors is also increasing rapidly, said a report presented by the Semiconductor Industry Association to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2016. China accounts for 20 percent of global personal computer consumption, 29 percent of global smartphone consumption and 17 percent of tablet computer consumption, while the country's demand for semiconductors totals nearly 27 percent of the global demand, according to the report. The PCAST report suggests that the U.S. government could enforce trade and investment rules as one response to challenges posed by Chinese semiconductors. "In the Internet era, there are more and more open platforms for developers, such as Google's open developer platform, and companies need more communication to push the whole industry ahead," Chen said, noting that blocking access to the market is not a smart option. Facing challenges China's semiconductor companies should continue to improve the competitiveness of their core technology, not only by attracting and training high-level talent, but more importantly, through innovations to merge into the global technology and industry development. There is still a big technology gap between the top Chinese semiconductor company and the leading international firms, according to Xu. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp which has the most advanced manufacturing technology in the Chinese mainland, released their 28-nanometer technology for mass production in 2016, while Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co have already release 14/16 nm technology, a two-generation gap. In addition, when it comes to M&As, Chinese companies should pay more attention to international practices and rules, instead of just offering a higher price, which may spark concerns about "hostile takeovers," Xu noted. "Stepping up efforts to respect others intellectual property rights (IPRs) and protect their own IPRs is equally important," he said.

Frohlich and Evan Comen January 10, 2017 4:43 pm EST Print Email Tweet After a decline in 2015, U.S. patenting activity rose to a record high in 2016. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted 304,126 patents last year, up from 298,407 in 2015. The increase was largely driven by West Coast technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Boeing, IBM, Intel, Google, and Microsoft. According to a 24/7 Wall St. analysis of data provided by Information for Industry (IFI) Claims Patent Services, Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics was granted the most patents in 2016. Including its major subsidiaries, Samsung was awarded more than 8,500 patents, slightly higher than IBM’s 8,088 awarded patents. Tech companies and others spend hundreds of millions, and often billions, of dollars to discover the next big thing and gain an advantage over competitors. Based on the number of patents awarded in 2016, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the most innovative companies. Click here to see the most innovative companies. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St. Larry Cady, senior analyst with IFI Claims, explained that patenting activity tends to increase at companies based in countries with strong economies. Because the U.S. economy is doing well, patent activity at U.S. companies increased last year. By contrast, with Japan’s economy flagging in recent years, patents awarded to a number of Japanese companies, including Canon, Honda, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, and Toyota, decreased in 2016. Last year, about half of all patents were granted to U.S.-based companies, with the remainder awarded primarily to Asia-based corporations as well as companies operating in European nations such as Germany and Scandinavian countries such as Sweden. The fact that foreign companies are seeking U.S. patent grants underscores the extraordinary demand for access to the U.S. market — the largest in the world. Most Japanese companies perform their work in Japan but still file U.S. patents. Source: IFI Claims Patent Services (click image to enlarge) Many years often pass before companies gain value from research investments, even when the research results in a patent grant. As Cady noted, “Not all those developments are going to be earth shattering.” Allocating resources to research and development is for this reason a highly strategic decision, and companies leverage patent portfolios in a variety of ways. In addition to searching for breakthrough technologies, for example, companies will develop a large patent portfolio as defense against litigation. For this reason, “one of the drivers of patenting is litigation,” Cady said. The most frequently patented technologies are in the categories of computers, transmission of digital information, wireless communication networks, and pictorial communication. According to Cady, the high patenting activity in these areas is due to their novelty. “Any kind of new and emerging technology that has a lot of potential value in the future is going to see a lot of patenting.” While it is reasonable to expect less patenting activity in more mature industries, this is certainly not always the case. For instance, although cars have not changed considerably in the past several decades, patents granted to companies in the auto manufacturing sector rose substantially last year. While a patent in a newer high tech field like artificial intelligence may represent a major scientific breakthrough, recent patents in the more staid automobile industry reflect relatively small improvements. Cady acknowledged the growing interest in self-driving cars, but noted these developments have not yet moved the needle in patent grants. To identify the 25 most innovative companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the companies with the 1,000 highest total number of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office grants in 2015 from IFI Claims Patent Services. IFI produces these data based on the entity listed as holding the patent. In order to arrive at a figure that more closely reflects a company’s total, 24/7 Wall St. combined the grants awarded to a company and its subsidiaries. It is important to note that while IFI Claims Patent Services provided the data on USPTO grants, 24/7 Wall St. aggregated the grants of multiple entities under the same parent corporation. This number is an estimate only as it excludes any patent-holding subsidiaries of a company that do not share the company’s name, and it does not include companies outside of the top 1,000 patent grantees. These are the 25 most innovative companies.

(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON — Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said Tuesday that the panel will conduct an independent review of the intelligence community's report that charged the Russian government with interfering in the U.S. presidential election to try to help President-elect Donald Trump. While emphasizing that he "has no reason to doubt the findings" contained in the report, the North Carolina Republican said "we owe it to our colleagues and the American people to do an independent review of the report and its conclusions." The report, released Friday, concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the hacking of Democratic emails during the election to try to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton. Burr said he will direct a small, select group of committee staff to analyze the report, including the classified sources that the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency used to form their conclusions. Those sources have not been publicly revealed because doing so would jeopardize their lives, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the committee during a hearing Tuesday. Clapper testified before the panel along with FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and Adm. Michael Rogers, the NSA's director. It was the first time they have testified before Congress since the report's release on Friday afternoon. Read more: USA TODAY Intel chiefs: We're certain that Russia tried to influence U.S. election USA TODAY Putin ordered hacking to help Trump, intelligence report says Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee's senior Democrat, said the panel's review of the intelligence report must look at whether there was any contact between the Russians and the political campaigns of Trump or Clinton. "In my view, our committee investigation should focus on three broad areas: the Russian hacking and release of stolen information; Russia's use of state-owned media and other means to amplify real and fake news to further their goal; and contact between the Russian government and its agents and associates of any campaign and candidate." Comey declined to answer questions from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about whether the FBI is investigating possible contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the presidential campaign. "I think the American people have a right to know this," Wyden said. "And if there is a delay in declassifying this information and releasing it to the American people, and it doesn’t happen before Jan. 20 (Inauguration Day), I’m not sure it’s going to happen." Comey said, "I would never comment on investigations, whether we have one or not, in an open forum like this." "So I really can’t answer it one way or another," Comey said. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he found that ironic. Comey was heavily criticized, at different times, by both the Trump and Clinton campaigns for making public statements about the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of State. "The irony of your making that statement here, I cannot avoid, but I’ll move on," King told Comey. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr speaks with Sen. Marco Rubio during the Jan. 10, 2017, hearing on Russian hacking and the 2016 election.  (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Clapper reiterated the report's findings that there is no evidence that the Russians succeeded in affecting the vote tallies in the presidential election. Although voter registration databases in some states were hacked by the Russians, no actual voting machines or results were affected, Clapper said. Clapper also said there is no evidence that the Russians altered or manipulated the emails and other information they stole during their hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Comey said the Russians also tried to hack the Republican National Committee but succeeded only in gaining access to an older server that did not contain current data. Still, the Russians have managed to turn Americans against one another, said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination before being re-elected to the Senate in November. He noted that during the campaign, Trump charged that there was widespread voter fraud, and that after the election, Democrats questioned the results. Now, Trump is questioning the conclusions reached by the intelligence community, Rubio said. "It sounds like they (the Russians) achieved what they wanted — to get us to fight among each other over whether the election was legitimate," Rubio said. Rubio, along with Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Ben Cardin of Maryland, is sponsoring legislation to impose tougher sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election. Read more: USA TODAY Sen. Lindsey Graham clarifies comment on Russian hack USA TODAY McCain, Graham call for greater sanctions against Russia The proposed sanctions would prohibit the U.S. from issuing visas to anyone who undermines the cybersecurity of democratic institutions. It also would freeze any assets they have in the United States. The legislation, introduced Tuesday, also would provide $100 million for the State Department and other federal agencies to combat Russian propaganda. Clapper said Tuesday that the Russian hacking of Democratic and Republican party groups was just part of a multi-faceted effort that also included paying "trolls" to weigh in against Clinton on social media and create fake news stories designed to undermine her campaign. Russia has denied any attempt to influence the campaign. Clapper said Russia initially believed that Clinton was poised to win the White House and was making efforts to try to undermine her presidency if she won. They thought Trump "was a fringe candidate," Clapper said. Once they realized that Trump could win, the Russians favored him over Clinton because they "just came to the conclusion that because the president-elect is a businessman, that he would be easier to deal with than Secretary Clinton." 5495 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jrRR5N NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

"Our Mobile Share Advantage plans and our AT&T Unlimited Plan provide several benefits that our legacy unlimited plan doesn’t," AT&T said in a statement to DSLReports.com confirming the move. "If you have a legacy unlimited data plan, you can keep it; however, beginning in March 2017, it will increase by $5 per month," AT&T said. Related Stories AT&T 5G: Testing Begins With Intel In Austin, Texas The Launch of DirecTV Now Went Pretty Poorly AT&T has revealed that starting in March 2017, it will begin charging $5 more per month for its grandfathered unlimited data plans. This means AT&T’s plan will cost $40 per month. This is the second time AT&T has increased the price of its grandfathered unlimited data plans. AT&T first raised its prices for its unlimited data plans back in February 2016, increasing data plans from $30 to $35. AT&T’s data plan costs are in addition to voice and text plan costs, putting the minimum price on an unlimited data plan with text and voice of $90. In the last few years, AT&T has increased the prices in attempt to get its grandfathered unlimited customers to switch to new plans. However, the FTC launched a federal court complaint against AT&T which led the company to scale the prices back. AT&T reintroduced the $100 unlimited data plans but only limited them to users who subscribe to AT&T DirecTV or AT&T U-Verse plan.

Kyle Orland - Jan 10, 2017 9:33 pm UTC The cost of an entry-level VR system like this has come down quite a bit. reader comments 73 Share this story Back when Oculus first launched the Rift VR headset almost a year ago, buying the headset and a minimum-specced computer that could actually power it would run you at least $1,500. Now, the "entry-level" price for PC-tethered virtual reality is already down to $1,100 as part of a new bundle deal. As Radeon recently announced, CyberPowerPC's "Gamer Ultra VR" tower is now available in a Best Buy bundle with an Oculus Rift headset for just under $1,100 (or $500 for the PC and $600 for the Rift itself). Even without the bundle deal, the tower itself is selling for only $650, the cheapest price we've seen for a pre-built PC that's officially marked as "Oculus Ready." Part of that price reduction since early 2016 is the normal march of technology making CPUs and GPUs cheaper as they get older. But a bigger part of the change is Oculus' "asynchronous spacewarp" technology, which the company announced in October as a way to calculate a spatial transformation that can fill in missing frames on lower-end hardware. The result, the company says, is that systems capable of running modern VR games at just 45 frames per second can now display a VR-acceptable 90 frames per second on the Rift headset itself. That means the official lower limit for an "Oculus Ready" system is now an Intel i3-6100 (or AMD FX4350) and an Nvidia GTX 960 (or Radeon RX 470), down from the Intel i5-4590 and Nvidia GTX 970 that Oculus initially recommended back in 2015. In October, Oculus promised that a $499 PC would be able to meet those reduced specs, and the CyberPowerPC tower being sold at Best Buy starting this week fulfills that promise. It's a pretty good deal for that level of computing power, too—building a similarly specced system from individual parts would cost close to $550, according to PC Price Picker. While we have yet to see the Rift itself offered for less than its $600 MSRP, we have seen a few other deals on the VR hardware. Best Buy offered a $100 gift card and a copy of Eve: Valkyrie with the headset over the holidays, and it offered a $150 gift card separately earlier this month. Those kinds of deals can go a long way toward paying for the $200 Oculus Touch hand-tracking controllers that are really required to get the most out of the Rift. The "all-in," entry-level price for VR gaming on the Rift is still pretty high compared to that of the PlayStation VR headset, which you can get along with the needed PlayStation 4 for less than $800. But as Moore's Law continues to bring hardware prices down, and as software optimization perhaps continues to smooth out VR's rough edges, the price to experience VR on a PC will continue to become more and more competitive.

You may have noticed a certain lack of post-CES floor reports on the site over the last couple days. I have several CES-related articles I need to finish up, but I came down with the flu on the way back from the show and I've been completely out of commission since. The UPS man awoke me from my feverish slumber this morning and left a nice surprise, though: Intel's Core i3-7350K. Core i3-7350K on the left If you're not already up to speed with it, the Core i3-7350K is Intel's unlocked "budget overclocking" chip for the Kaby Lake family. Those scare quotes are there because the i3-7350K commands a $168-$179 suggested price from Intel. A true Pentium G3258 successor this ain't. Still, that money buys two cores and four threads with a 4.2 GHz base clock—identical to the Core i7-7700K's—and a potentially more overclocking-friendly 60W TDP. Because of its pricing, we're having a little bit of an internal debate about what chips to test the i3-7350K against in our review. If you have ideas about what our test suite should look like, let us know in the comments.   Tags: CPUs User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme CES 2017 delivered a clear vision of the car of the future CES 2017 delivered a clear vision of the car of the future By Ben Algaze on January 10, 2017 at 1:59 pm Comment LAS VEGAS — If CES 2016 was about automakers setting lofty goals for automated driving and displaying futuristic prototypes, CES 2017 saw those automakers take steps to further define how that future might actually look and feel. In the same way that cars are more similar than different today, the future visions are similar too — but automakers and suppliers are trying to carve out differentiation. In many ways, automakers are trying to ensure the car is as connected to your life as your smartphone is. A large part of the smartphone’s power is the connection to the cloud to enable new services and experiences across different devices. As CES demonstrates every year, those devices are far more than the computer, smartphone, tablet, and TVs; they now include wearables, cameras, lights, appliances, and countless others. The power of the cloud also adds intelligence and analytics to facilitate a wealth of new services, capabilities, and automation to activities that previously required much more human interaction. To a large extent, the automobile visions at CES were about bringing the same level of connectedness to the automobile, to enable it to participate in as an integral part of those new services. Automated driving, when it truly becomes mainstream over the next decade or more, will enable human attention to focus on other activities that don’t involve piloting a car to a destination. To that end, automakers — and industry suppliers — are beginning to flesh out their visions of what the “mobility experience” looks like in the future. At CES 2017, the industry ticked off their goals and themes. Some were common across all of them, like a goal of ultimately reducing auto accident fatalities to zero by increasing safety via smarter cars with more sophisticated systems that can compensate for human driving errors. The other common theme was the desire to imbue the car with the same intelligence that make your smartphone such an integral part of your life. Beyond these, there are ways in which automakers are looking to differentiate their offerings. Chrysler Portal Concept Interior Fiat Chrysler (FCA) kicked off CES by showing its Portal concept car (pictured at top). FCA had been viewed by some as “behind” in the race to automated driving and new designs, and this concept was touted as “designed by millennials for millennials.” The design attempts to make the auto a more flexible device, accommodating millennial transportation needs as their families grow. Some innovative features include recognizing owners from afar by smartphone, personalizing the in-car experience with facial recognition and biometrics, and providing a community display screen, where multiple occupants can view and share content in the car. Some other technologies, which are starting to be seen in other new cars, include smart home integrations (controlled via an interface from the car), natural language recognition, and in vehicle mobile commerce, where the car becomes an extension of services like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. BMW’s elaborate displays at CES continued in 2017 with a separate booth outside the convention center floor and a fleet of cars that included prototype self driving models of its current models, like the 2017 5 Series. BMW partnered with Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, and others to articulate their vision of the connected experience. BMW’s story at CES attempted to paint real world scenarios of how the vehicle connects to your daily life. Using the previously announced Open Mobility Cloud, BMW looks to weave the car as an integral smart device by tapping into information in other services you currently use. By accessing your calendar, it can derive schedule and locations you need to be at during your day, and feed that directly into the car. In the CES scenario, an incoming request for a lunch date gets fed directly to the car with a time and location, and cloud services tell you when you need to leave. BMW also showed how they want to bring natural voice services into the car, by demoing Microsoft’s Cortana assistant accessible from the vehicle’s iDrive interface. There’s nothing revolutionary there, other than the message being that the company wants to focus on an open approach to bring best-of-breed connected services into the car rather than developing its own. BMW’s current connected app for smartphones brings (model-dependent) features like remote lock/unlock, start, and monitoring features, as well as integration with popular infotainment services like Pandora, Spotify, and others. The experience at CES was billed as a future extension of these capabilities. Taking attendees on a drive that included a no-hands, fully automated stretch on the interstate that runs through Las Vegas, they showed how some current (and coming) features – like gesture and voice control of car infotainment, more detailed information about locations as you drive past them, traffic light information, and personalization of the environment in the car — can be better enjoyed and exploited when the car takes care of driving duties and navigating to a destination with no input. Hyundai continued to expand on its self-driving vision, with some similar messages around a hyper connected car that will better integrate into your daily life. To bolster its themes around automated driving, smart traffic, intelligent remote monitoring services, and the “mobility hub,” Hyundai announced a major partnership with Cisco to bring the company’s network, IoT, and security expertise to the connected car space. But the company also showed a different vision of mobility. The Hyundai Waist Exoskeleton is a robotic device that can help paraplegics to walk and move on their own. Another version of this “wearable robot” allows workers in a warehouse or factory floor to lift large weighty objects safely by augmenting their capabilities. Also in Hyundai’s vision of mobility was a the foldable Ioniq electric scooter, a lightweight “last mile” device which could be stored in the door of its Ioniq electric car. Hyundai also talked up its vision of driver safety with a suite of future capabilities for monitoring driver health and state of mind in the car, dubbed the “Health and Mobility Cockpit.” Sensors and cameras will monitor such things as driver breathing rate and depth, posture, heart rate, facial features, and eye tracking to detect a driver’s mood, attention, and state. If the system detects potential problems with focus and attention, “mood bursts” can be activated using a variety of sensory experiences. For example, if posture is sagging, the seat can be adjusted to promote a better position. Similarly, releasing scents such as peppermint or cedar, as well as adjustments to lights, sounds, and temperature can alter the driver mood and bring proper attention on a commute or diffuse tension. Maybe this is a benign Big Brother in the cockpit? Besides these innovations, Hyundai also stressed a couple of other themes. One of them was about “democratizing” advanced driving features – including full automation – to bring them within the reach of average consumers. This would seem a natural fit with their current brand image. The other was about efficiency, associating it heavily with the Ioniq sub brand. This part reflects some technology challenges as the move to fully electric powertrains continues and heavy doses of computing power and other electronics continue to be put into cars. Managing energy efficiently to maintain range and performance and powering a new array of digital activities in vehicles will become increasingly important. Toyota showcased some of the work from their new Silicon Valley machine learning lab in the Concept-I prototype. Using terms like “kinetic warmth” for the design and introducing Yui artificial intelligence assistant, Toyota aimed to make future car capabilities friendly and approachable. The company also echoed a theme of safety, where they want to reduce traffic related fatalities to nil using advanced artificial intelligence for self-driving, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Interestingly, Toyota seemed to position self-driving capabilities as an option to the experience, where the driver can allow the car to take over duties based on mood and what he may want to do on the journey. Among the futuristic interfaces in the prototype was a full-color 3D head-up display where information pops up as needed, avoiding a huge central screen with an overload of information. The automobile business is undergoing rapid change. Some in the industry say the delta may be as much as in the early days of the industry a century ago. Information technology and the move to electric power from internal combustion are changing the fundamental car platform and the driving – or the “mobility” – experience. It’s going to be an interesting ride.

One way to make smart technology a little smarter is by crowdsourcing. According to Bloomberg, that’s the mission of the Seattle-based startup Mighty AI, and anyone can elect to lend a hand. Formerly Spare5, Mighty AI is rebranding itself after raising $14 million in funds and announcing partnerships with Intel and Accenture. Their business premise is simple: After signing up, users can get to work completing simple tasks for small amounts of cash. Assignments may include captioning an image, describing a movie scene, or rating pictures of puppies. Each micro task is something an AI program can do; after gathering as much human data as possible, clients can use it to program their tech to be more authentic and accurate. Mighty AI has worked with several big names in the past, including Microsoft, Expedia, Pinterest, and GoPro. Getty has used their data to categorize photos, and IBM used Mighty AI’s collective golf knowledge to create a Watson platform full of trivia about the sport. Anyone can earn money through Mighty AI using their common sense, but workers that specialize in certain areas will have more opportunities to rise through the ranks. Radiologists, for example, can analyze tumor scans to help build better medical AI. As users improve their performances, they will have the chance to earn more money and accept more tasks from the site. You can sign up to lend your knowledge here.

This is the real meaning of the “Russia hacking” story which, as yet, has not produced any hard evidence of Russian complicity. Last week’s 25-page report, that was released by the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, illustrates to what extent intelligence is being “fixed around the policy”. Just as the CIA generated false information related to Weapons of Mass Destruction to soften public resistance to war with Iraq, so too, the spurious allegations in the DNI’s politically-motivated report are designed to depict Russia as a growing threat to US national security. The timing of the report has less to do with the election of Donald Trump as President than it does with critical developments in Syria where the Russian military has defeated US-proxies in Syria’s industrial hub, Aleppo, rolling back Washington’s 15-year War of Terror and derailing the imperialist plan to control vital resources and pipeline corridors across the Middle East and Central Asia. Russia has become the main obstacle to Washington achieving its strategic vision of pivoting to Asia and maintaining its dominant role into the next century. The Intelligence Community has been coerced into compromising its credibility to incite fear of Russia and to advance the geopolitical ambitions of deep state powerbrokers. The “Russia hacking” flap shows how far the Intel agencies have veered from their original mandate, which is to impartially gather and analyze information that may be vital to US national security. As we have seen in the last two weeks, the leaders of these organizations feel free to offer opinions on issues that clearly conflict with those of the new President-elect. Trump has stated repeatedly that he wants to reduce tensions and reset relations with Russia, but that policy is being sabotaged by members of the intelligence community, particularly CIA Director John Brennan who appeared just last week on PBS Newshour with Judy Woodruff. Here’s an excerpt from the interview: “We see that there are still a lot of actions that Russia is undertaking that undermine the principles of democracy in so many countries. What has happened in our recent election is not new. The Russians have engaged in trying to manipulate elections in Europe for a number of years… the Russians tried to interfere in our electoral process recently, and were actively involved in that. And that is something that we can’t countenance.” (“Interview with CIA Director John Brennan”, PBS Newshour) Brennan, of course, provided no evidence for his claims nor did he mention the hundreds of CIA interventions around the world. But Brennan’s accusations are less important than the fact that his appearance on a nationwide broadcast identifies him as a political advocate for policies that conflict with those of the new president. Do we really want unelected intelligence officials — whose job it is to provide the president with sensitive information related to national security– to assume a partisan role in shaping policy? And why would Brennan –whose is supposed to “serve at the pleasure of the president”– accept an invitation to offer his views on Russia when he knew they would be damaging to the new administration? Powerful people behind the scenes are obviously pushing the heads of these intelligence agencies to stick to their ‘anti-Moscow’ narrative to force Trump to abandon his plan for peaceful relations with Moscow. Brennan isn’t calling the shots and neither are Clapper or Comey. They’re all merely agents serving the interests of establishment plutocrats whose geopolitical agenda doesn’t jibe with that of the incoming administration. If that wasn’t the case, then why would the Intelligence Community stake its reputation on such thin gruel as this Russian hacking gibberish? It doesn’t make any sense. The people who launched this campaign are either supremely arrogant or extremely desperate. Which is it? Here’s an excerpt from an article by veteran journalist Robert Parry sums it up like this in an article at Consortium News: “The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information – built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump. But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word “assesses” – as in the U.S. intelligence community “assesses” that Russia is guilty – suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak, “assesses” often means “guesses.” (“US Report Still Lacks Proof on Russia ‘Hack’”, Robert Parry, Consortium News) Bottom line: Brennan and his fellow spooks have nothing. The report is little more than a catalogue of unfounded assumptions, baseless speculation and uncorroborated conjecture. In colloquial parlance, it’s bullshit, 100 percent, unalloyed Russophobic horse-manure. In fact, the authors admit as much in the transcript itself when they say: “Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents.” What kind of kooky admission is that? So the entire report could be BS but we’re supposed to believe that Putin flipped the election? Is that it??? What’s really going on here? Why have the Intelligence agencies savaged their credibility just to convince people that Russia is up to no good? The Russia hacking story has more to do with recent developments in Syria than it does with delegitimizing Donald Trump. Aleppo was a real wake up call for the US foreign policy establishment which is beginning to realize that their plans for the next century have been gravely undermined by Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Aleppo represents the first time that an armed coalition of allied states (Russia, Iran, Syria, Hezbollah) have actively engaged US jihadist-proxies and soundly beat them to a pulp. The stunning triumph in Aleppo has spurred hope among the vassal states that Washington’s bloody military juggernaut can be repelled, rolled back and defeated. And if Washington’s CIA-armed, trained and funded jihadists can be repelled, then the elitist plan to project US power into Central Asia to dominate the world’s most populous and prosperous region, will probably fail. In other words, the outcome in Aleppo has cast doubts on Uncle Sam’s ability to successfully execute its pivot to Asia. That’s why the Intel agencies have been employed to shape public perceptions on Russia. Their job is to prepare the American people for an escalation of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed superpowers. US powerbrokers are determined to intensify the conflict and reverse facts on the ground. (Recent articles by elites at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute reveal that they are as committed to partitioning Syria as ever.) Washington wants to reassert its exceptional role as the uncontested steward of global security and the lone ‘unipolar’ world power. That’s what this whole “hacking” fiasco is about. The big shots who run the country are trying to strong-arm ‘the Donald’ into carrying their water so the depredations can continue and Central Asia can be transformed into a gigantic Washington-dominated corporate free trade zone where the Big Money calls the shots and Capital reigns supreme. That’s their dreamstate, Capitalist Valhalla. They just need Trump to get-with-the-program so the bloodletting can continue apace. _______ plantman About author Mike Whitney lives in Washington state. He is a contributor to Kindle edition.

I was rather surprised to have heard Trump accept the intelligence briefing he got recently, at least, he did not reject it as wrong. And the report “concluded” that not only was russia involved in the hacking, but that Putin ordered it. So, what tipped the scales to make trump change his mind? Or at least to simmer down. This has been a strange year for power and politics. Hillary gets stuffed and then humiliated. I don’t know the equivalent of castration for women, but that’s what happened to hillary. She had this HUGE powerbase of supporters of all kinds, and it’s in shambles. (Wonder what’s actually left of it?) Then the guy who displaced her is about as popular as leprosy. He is having trouble assembling a cabinet because some won’t serve, and then disagreement among those chosen to serve, how to proceed. Then the US gets kicked out of syria after years of dicking around in it to make a mess so it can go in and justify the need to take over. And now the hacking scam after the ukraine invasion. And all the NATO arm-twisting to try to corner russia, to neutralize them. Declare crippling sanctions and pressure the EU to play along, never mind this is bad for the EU economy. The obama deep-state is running nat’l security and intelligence. And for now, it looks corrupt as hell. So is this a part of the swamp that Trump wants to drain? Or consider the plans to build hundreds of new naval ships. This is not some isolated, knee-jerk decision, but certainly must be a part of some global plan for further military domination. To me it sounds ominous. Or maybe it’s a way to deal with global warming, all the bases that will get flooded. And now we will have floating bases.

And no one, outside of one brief claim by donna brazile, is claiming that the Russians planted misinformation, lied, falsified, selectively edited or in any way changed any of the information which was revealed. All they did was reveal information that some of our wannabe leaders wish were not public. When it takes hacking by a presumably hostile foreign government for us to learn even a small portion of the content of speeches made by one of the presidential candidates to a select elite, for us common folk to learn her special "private" positions, then the biggest problem for our so called "democracy" is most certainly NOT Russian interference. It would seem less damaging for the democrats if it were a private leaker The debate should be about why our wannabe leaders feel that we should not have truthful and accurate information about their plans and policies rather than Russian window peeping.

Note that the same group of old Clinton people are hanging onto power even though they created disaster for the Democratic Party, and are provoking GOP toward fascism or are at least accusing them of moving in that direction, when in fact, these same Democratic Party leaders have been on board with the disenfranchisement and oppression of the American people and USA all along. Mike noted: "Brennan isn’t calling the shots and neither are Clapper or Comey. They’re all merely agents serving the interests of establishment plutocrats whose geopolitical agenda doesn’t jibe with that of the incoming administration. If that wasn’t the case, then why would the Intelligence Community stake its reputation on such thin gruel as this Russian hacking gibberish? It doesn’t make any sense. The people who launched this campaign are either supremely arrogant or extremely desperate. Which is it? Not that the intelligence community leaders are walking on the fence, trying to see which power group prevails. The indidator of this is the fact that they have not presented any hard evidence, and are just stopping short of telling us that there is no proof whatsoever of Russian interference. Intelligence leaders want to see which side prevails and keep their jobs. But, this is a powerful political ploy, that the failed globalist Democratic party top level sell outs are bringing to bear on Trump. They are attacking him on all sides, and even attempting to pressure him to continue with the Middle Eastern wars in support of Israel and Saudi Arabia, or else they intend to make life in the white house hell for him. The intelligence people like many others in Washington are waiting to see where the debris and dust from this election settles. One thing that is becoming increasingly clear to observers is that the old DNC leadership is no friend of the American people or USA and they are more loyal to Middle Eastern Allies and Big Global Banking than to USA. Will our defense establishment follow suit or will they resist. FBI resisted at the last minute before the election. How will Intelligence Community react to the real possibility of USA being dragged into big war over issues that mean little to the American people and does little to benefit them? Everything is up in the air in Washington, and we will have to wait and see whether we need to begin digging fallout shelters in our backyards and equipping schools with radiation proof school desks for our children to duck under, all because our allies want some pipelines through countries that do not belong to them.

During a hearing of the Senate Committee on Intelligence, Clapper outlined key findings of a classified intelligence report on Russian election hacking that concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin "ordered" a campaign to influence the U.S. presidential election in an attempt by Russia to "undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process." "We have high confidence that President Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election," Clapper said. "The goals of this campaign were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency. Putin and the Russian government also developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump." "Moscow's influence campaign blended covert intelligence operations with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users," Clapper added. "We are highly confident that the Russian intelligence services conducted cyber-operations against people and organizations associated with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including both major U.S. political parties." Russia's election meddling is not limited to the United States, Clapper said, noting that Russia has targeted a "couple dozen" elections in other countries and that he fears that if Russia's capabilities evolve, it will continue to employ them. Republican committee member Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pointed out that the report made no determination about whether the hacks had any influence on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, saying he believes Trump won "fair and square." Clapper testified alongside other leaders of the intelligence community, including CIA Director John Brennan, NSA and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers, and FBI Director Jim Comey, all of whose agencies contributed to the report. Putin 'Ordered' Campaign to Influence US Presidential Election, Intelligence Community Says Intel Officials Warn About Skepticism From the Top The report was produced after President-elect Donald Trump for months publicly doubted the intelligence community's assessment about the Russia's role in hacking the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 president campaign. Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said this weekend that following a formal briefing by intelligence leaders, Trump had accepted the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was to blame. But in a statement Trump released after his briefing, he chose not to concede to the findings he publicly questioned and instead was critical of the DNC for not properly defending itself against cyber-threats. Comey testified today that the FBI tried to access the DNC's computer servers once it learned they had been compromised, but was denied by and only granted that access from a hired, third-party security firm. Comey said the FBI would have preferred to have access to the original devices. Today's hearing was also Comey's first opportunity to offer public comments on his stunning announcement days before the presidential election that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, but Democrats did not pursue that line of questioning. Instead, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, asked Comey if he knew of any ongoing investigations into "contacts" between Trump campaign officials and Putin's government. Comey said he couldn't confirm or deny any pending investigations, promting Wyden to say he was "troubled" that by answer. "The American people have a right to know," Wyden said. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, also took a swipe at Comey, contrasting Comey's discretion in this instance to his decision to publicly announce just days before the presidential election that he'd reopened the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server and after he had already determined she should not be prosecuted for a crime. "The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid," King said to Comey. Comey eventually closed the Clinton investigation on Nov. 6, just two days before the election, again without recommending any charges. Clinton later blamed him in part for her loss to Donald Trump. Later during the hearing, Comey was asked if the intelligence report on Russia was in any way politicized at the direction of the White House. Comey said it was not, and added, "I hope I've demonstrated by now, I'm tone-deaf when it comes to politics, and that's the way it should be."

Pegatron Electronics will manufacture the device, DigiTimes reported citing Chinese-based publication Economic Daily News. The report adds that the new 2-in-1 will come with an Ultra HD display, a magnetic charging stylus. Other than that, the report remained silent on the other Surface Pro 5 features and specifications. Speculations and rumors, however, give a pretty neat idea on the future of the next-gen tablet cum laptop device. Processor As things stand, Microsoft is highly expected to ship Surface Pro 5 with the recently unveiled Kaby Lake chipset. Intel revealed 40 different chipsets of their Kaby Lake series at the CES 2017 in Las Vegas. Previous reports dished that the arrival of Kaby Lake was what led to delay in the release of the device. The Redmond giant will roll out three different variants of the Surface Pro 5, reports iTechPost. There will be an entry-level Core M (dual-core) processor variant, a mid-range Core i5 (dual core and two threads) and a higher-end variant with a Core i7 (quad-core and eight threads) processor. The Kaby Lake series will have much higher turbo frequencies, faster clock speeds, and an overall better battery life. Microsoft Display The next 2-in1 flagship will incorporate Ultra HD 4K resolution display, possibly with 4320 x 2160 pixels. On other hand, the company is rumored to go with a IPS Touch instead of Super AMOLED screen. It is likely the the next-gen Surface Pro will sport a similar 12.3-inch display like its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4. Surface Pen Furthermore, TechRadar suggests Microsoft will upgrade its Surface Pen stylus accessory. Several patents uncovered earlier this year show a stylus that features a rechargeable battery system. The patent details a magnetic charging dock built in the device itself to give the new Surface Pen its power. In addition, several other upgrades are coming to the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft will bring USB Type-C support as a default to all its newer devices. Microsoft would also introduce higher RAM configuration with 16GB upgrade as well 512GB storage options. The camera setup in the Pro 5 is due for upgrade too and Carl Zeiss sensors will probably headline the device. Price The base model with an Intel i5 is said to start at $899, while the one with an Core i7 starts at $999. The top end device will start for $1,599 with an i7 Extreme processor. Price will also go up with the additional storage space and other sorts of configurations. For more updates and leaks on the same, stay tuned for TheBitBag.com for same.

Richard Burr said during a hearing on Tuesday. © Flickr/ Frederick Dennstedt 'Clueless' US Intel Report on 'Russian Hack' Becomes a 'Laughingstock'WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The US Intelligence Community report claimed that Russia launched an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at undermining public faith in the US democratic process and creating a preference for President-elect Donald Trump. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. "I want to make this clear: our democracy is not at risk," Burr stated. After receiving an intelligence briefing on the US Intelligence Community's report, Trump said the election outcome had not been affected. US House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan also suggested that the assessment should not be used by partisans to delegitimize Trump's presidency. ...

This means IBM has kept its streak going, filing the most US-based patents in a year for the 24th time in a row, beating out companies like Samsung and Canon. In 2016, Samsung came in second place with 5,518 patents, followed by Canon in third place with 3,665. Qualcomm, Google, Intel, LG, Microsoft, Sony and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co make up the rest of the top ten. Image Credit: SZ0931 With such a large total, IBM essentially managed to obtain 22 new patents every day, covering areas ranging from cloud computing and cyber security to artificial intelligence and cognitive computing. “Leading the world in innovation for 24 years in a row is a result of IBM’s unmatched commitment to innovation and R&D–reflected in this year’s new U.S. patent record, breaking the 8,000 barrier for the first time,” said IBM Chairman, Ginni Rometty. “We are deeply proud of our inventors’ unique contributions to discovery, science and technology that are driving progress across business and society and opening the new era of cognitive business.” Aside from the massive amount of patents, IBM also boasted about its contribution to the US economy in 2016, spending half of its $5.4 billion research and development budget within the country. KitGuru Says: IBM has been on a patent filing streak for well over 20 years at this point, so perhaps seeing it top everyone else again isn’t too surprising. I was a little surprised to see that Apple didn’t break the top ten though, given the amount of time the company spends in court battling out patent disputes.

However, the first portion of 2017 has offered everything but a break from the tumultuous wreckage seen in the past year. This past week the U.S. intelligence community released its first public assessment of Russian interference in the US elections. The results of this assessment leave the United States and Western nations with a choice on how they will respond to Russian actions designed to disrupt and undermine the integrity of democratic political systems. ADVERTISEMENT As the report confirms, not only were the actions taken by Russia during the U.S. presidential election provocative, they also evolved over a long period — with extensive cross-government coordination and planning.   This report substantiates Russia’s use of fake news and propaganda to help support far right political movements achieve similar political results in different locales. Whether it is aimed at the U.S., NATO or the European Union, Russian policy seems determined at undermining and delegitimating the leadership and coherence of Western countries it sees as opponents. The actions and strategies implemented by Russian government agencies (the SVR and the GRU) to try and influence the results of the U.S. election — are not rogue operations without central authorship. 5 key findings from the intelligence report on Russiahttps://t.co/OIixRLvQon pic.twitter.com/DDrqbidp4G— The Hill (@thehill) January 7, 2017 This is Russia’s approach to its Western neighbors — Vladimir Putin’s preferred approach. Political developments in Germany and France confront the same long shadow. Cyber actions are, and have been, a means to that end. The Hack & The Report The cyber component of Russia’s influence operation encompassed intrusions at state voter registration databases, exfiltration of emails from major political parties, and the sharing of their contents with third parties, cue WikiLeaks. Interestingly, there is also evidence of the synchronized transfer and release of information designed to disrupt and denigrate the candidacy of one US person involved in the 2016 presidential election. Weaponized leaks of private information were used to great effect and fake news also provided leverage for the victorious Republican presidential campaign. These are the conclusions of the Jan. 6 Intelligence Community Assessment. While avoiding comment on the “impact” of Russian actions, the message is clear. That this influence operation persisted for months reinforces the inference that these activities were centrally directed, supervised and re-authorized as the U.S. election process continued. By any estimation this Russian operation was successful — perhaps beyond the wildest expectations of its authors. House Intel chairman: Russia report "looks like a political rollout" just before inauguration https://t.co/OJ8h8OLjD2 pic.twitter.com/HnqY8nCBwu— The Hill (@thehill) January 8, 2017 Most discussions of the DNC (Democratic National Committee) hack, and the preceding email server controversy, focus on the technical minutiae of these cyber intrusions, paying less attention to the strategic intentions and perspectives of the authors than they do to the techniques used. As the Jan. 6 report concludes, the Russian principals directing these attacks had a preferred candidate, Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to continue using @realDonaldTrump account as president Trump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ MORE. Whether one attributes that success to Russia’s influence campaign, or to U.S. elective politics, the fact remains that the outcome appears to show the effectiveness of Russian behavior in shaping the political conditions in another country. What appeared to work in the United States may also work in France and Germany. How all three countries, and the political military coalitions they hold in common — the European Union and NATO — set to respond? Collective Defense or Unilateralism? From economic development to collective military defense, NATO and the European Union have stabilized and aligned political and social progress for decades. Something that the intelligence community’s report doesn’t say is that Russia’s intrusions have played a definitive role in calling the political underpinnings of these organizations into question, as democratic political consensus in their most important members appear increasingly bruised and shattered. One view is that fears of migrants, negative impacts from globalization, the return of ethnic nationalisms in many but not all Western countries have reinforced a sense of lost coherence and vision of a shared future. In deciding how to respond, the United States should base its actions in the durable common values of the Western democratic community of nations. This, at least, is one view. Hackers tried to breach DNC after Obama’s Russia sanctions: reporthttps://t.co/rZZ6c9lbzL pic.twitter.com/6SReYXeyxq— The Hill (@thehill) January 7, 2017 A second view holds that the West’s hypocrisy in its own international actions — wars, economic predation, and selective support for authoritarian regimes — robs it of any standing when it comes to charges of Russian aggression in its own “near abroad”.   Taken further, the West’s decadence leaves it indicted as corrupt and unworthy as the unchallenged arbiter defining the future of the international system. For the United States, the choice — collective self-defense against the exploitation of political fissures at home by a hostile external actor, or a retreat from a Western consensus in national self-recrimination, is especially stark. The outcome of the election has caused many on the losing side to doubt the legitimacy of the President-elect, Donald J. Trump. For the winners, many have chosen to support their candidate while ignoring facts uncovered that pose disturbing questions regarding conflicts and fitness for office. The disruption of political comity (to the extent there was any) could hardly be more complete. What comes next? An apparently successful Russian influence operation in the United States presents encouragement to its authors and a potential incentive to imitate its methods to lesser powers. Absent focused and coordinated retaliation against Russia that imposes costs for its actions, why should it change its behavior? Its methods appear successful, and the winner of the U.S. election appears unlikely to continue President Obama’s late-stage sanctions response. Acknowledgement of the co-incidence of Russia’s influence operation and the election outcome is a required first step to coping with the emerging situation. It is precisely here that the U.S. may be unable to act. And for smaller Western countries confronting the same influence campaign, what are they to make of a situation where the leader of the Western alliance is seemingly unable to defend itself against intrusion into its most sacred political moment? Are NATO or the EU ready to protect them, or are they unable to deliver durable predictable support because of an erosion in political consensus in Western capitals? It is difficult to find much optimism in these outcomes. Political systems and their corresponding processes are under assault, democratic unity is under stress, and methods used by an external power seem positioned to take advantage of very favorable conditions. The choice confronting the West is whether and how it will choose to respond to these challenges. Whether that choice will be recognized remains an open question.

Justin Loiseau (TMFJLo) Jan 10, 2017 at 11:07AM Driverless-car stocks are revving up for a record-breaking year. If you're on the hunt for a pure play on the trend, though, you're out of luck. There are essentially no publicly traded companies dealing exclusively in driverless cars. But at The Motley Fool, we're always on the lookout for creative investment angles. Here are three driverless-car stocks that let you invest in the technology, the car, and the data for the driverless-car revolution. 1. MobilEye -- The technology MobilEye Co-Founder and CTO Amnon Shashua. Image source: BMW. Jerusalem-based MobilEye (NYSE:MBLY) is as pure a play as they come for driverless-car stocks. It manufactures the cameras for advanced driver assistance systems in approximately 220 car models. In July, MobilEye announced a partnership with BMW and Intel to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform by 2021. Just a month later, it went even further when it announced a partnership with auto supplier Delphi Automotive to develop a "plug-and-play" self-driving platform available for any automaker to adopt by 2017.  MobilEye seems to be poised for profit -- it just announced a 34% year-over-year quarterly revenue increase and prides itself on an asset-light business model. For investors, this signals both a buying opportunity and a valuation warning. Its stock jumped 27% after the recent news and has wavered back and forth over the past few years alongside industry-level bullishness and stock-specific announcements. Investors in MobilEye should be bullish on the commoditization of driverless technology and have a long-term perspective to weather the ups and downs that will probably continue. MBLY data by YCharts. 2. Tesla Motors -- The car   Image source: Tesla Motors. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not a driverless-car stock, but it is vehement in its belief that automation is the automotive future. All its vehicles come equipped with Autopilot, a technology that Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk says will allow Teslas to drive themselves across the country by (hopefully) 2018. As a first major adopter of semi-autonomous driving, Tesla has experienced setbacks, most notably a driver fatality last May.  A Tesla Motors stock investment allows investors to get behind the wheel of an already-scaling semi-driverless carl, something that no other company can offer. But Tesla is also much more than a driverless-car stock. The company is, first and foremost, a (driver-filled) car company. Its recent $2 billion merger with SolarCity also makes it a solar company, an industry with substantial regulatory unknowns of its own. The company is betting on significant synergies by packaging solar rooftops with car sales, but these major moves have kept many investors on the fence about its future. For Tesla to make the driverless-car stock list, investors need to be sure they're bullish on its entire business. 3. Alphabet -- The data Video source: Waymo via Youtube.  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has been making major moves in the driverless-car space. The company has spent more than $60 million to bump humans out of the driver's seat, and last October, it announced that it had clocked a whopping 2 million road miles on its autonomous vehicles. Last month, Alphabet went a step further by redefining its automation efforts as a full-fledged spinoff business dubbed Waymo, rather than one of its prototype "moonshot" projects. Alphabet and Waymo have made clear that they're not interested in car manufacturing, a hat tip to others such as BMW that are already well entrenched in this space. Instead, it will focus on taking what it's learned from its cute "panda car" prototypes and transferring it to commercial cars, such as the 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans that are set to join Waymo's fleet in early 2017. Waymo has a strong technological advantage over many competitors, but where it truly shines is its access to and refinement of data. Self-driving cars risk being aimless wanderers without enough information about their surroundings, and Alphabet has more information about the world than anyone else, and is continuing to learn how best to use it in the quest for an autonomous vehicle. With an Alphabet investment, investors need to understand that driverless cars are not one slice of this company's pie -- they're a crumb. With Alphabet's $550 billion market cap, Waymo's minuscule $60 million fleet of pandas and minivans is not what this company's counting on to drive profits in the years to come. But Waymo is yet another example of how Alphabet is capitalizing on its core competitive advantage in ways that were not previously expected -- and if that's what you're interested in investing in, then Alphabet may be the driverless-car stock for you. Pedal to the metal? With driverless-car technology still in its infancy, it can be tempting to take a backseat to investing in this industry. But for risk-tolerant investors with a long-term perspective, getting in on the ground floor of a driverless-car stock might be the best way to snag major returns in the years to come, whether it's by investing in the technology, the car, or the data.

Credit: Michael DeAgonia More like this The MacBook Pro Thunderbolt 3 adapter guide Hands on: 15-in. MacBook Pro delivers on speed and design – for a price First look: The 13-in MacBook Pro's Touch Bar wows Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell What should you take away from the long, long wait for Apple's new 13-in. and 15-in. MacBook Pros and the fact that they're relatively pedestrian? For one thing, they might not be as pedestrian as they seem. Let's get this over with: Macs just aren't the coolest thing Apple does anymore. They don't bring in huge profits. People don't lust after them the way they do a new iPhone. They're not the second or third or even fourth thing that CEO Tim Cook and Design chief Jonny Ives are thinking about. [To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page.] So Apple let the new MacBook Pro release slip and then it let it slip some more. Before you knew it, the company was releasing sixth-generation Skylake laptops into the rollout of Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors. Apple needed something new and different and -- poof! -- the Touch Bar was born. Touch Bar is a red herring, a pink unicorn, eye candy designed to cast a "these aren't the droids you're looking for" spell on anyone who looks too closely at the new line up of MacBook Pros. What's more, even if Touch Bar might someday be useful, that won't be for another couple of years when mainstream software supports it. The list of supporting apps consists mostly of niche players with the exception of Microsoft Office. And Microsoft's support? Has anyone heard a timeline on that? By the time the Touch Bar gets real, Apple might be on to a full-size touchscreen. Adam Patrick Murray There's more to the new MacBook Pro than the Touch Bar. I bought my daughter a space gray MacBook Pro 13 for Christmas. (And you thought I was a hater.) The form factor changes have a greater effect in the 13 than they do in the 15. I'm not talking about the specifications; I'm talking about what it feels like to use these laptops in the real world. The 13 has something the 15 (and the previous generation 13) doesn't have: total portability. If you're not sure what I'm driving at, maybe boxing is a good analogy. The heft and size changes Apple made to the 13 put it into a lighter weight class. The differences between the old 15 and the new one are measurable, but they don't change the overall usage pattern. Given that the MacBook Pro 15 Retina I use is an early 2013 model, making it four years old, I'll need to upgrade soon. I'm certain to buy the latest MacBook Pro 15 because I've never been able to stand the 13-in. screen size. What tends to draw me to a new Mac isn't the slightly faster CPU, video or SSD performance. It's the little conveniences that get me: being able to plug in the power cord on either side because of the Thunderbolt 3 ports, the Touch ID login, a noticeably brighter LED display and a big beautiful trackpad. The Touch ID login is more useful than you might think. The new MacBook Pro is designed to sleep first. In fact, you really have to work to shut it down from the hardware. By default, when you press the physical off/Touch ID button the MacBook Pro goes to sleep. In my tests of the latest models, the MacBook Pro can go a long time in that sleep state. The next time you start the Mac you're waking it up -- not powering it on. Touch ID works beautifully when waking up, making apparent boot times much faster. The success of this sleep state should make Touch ID useful more often. (Apple requires password entry when the machine is started up from an unpowered state.) I'm not going to run down the new MacBook Pro's specs. If you're interested, you've likely read about them in four zillion stories that cover those details in minutia. There is only one aspect of the MacBook Pro that is revolutionary. It didn't come out of Ives' design studio either. Apple's decision to dump all pre-existing ports except (ironically for iPhone 7 users) the headphone jack is bold and smart. It replaced all of those ports quite nicely with the addition of four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C Gen 2 ports. Since each Thunderbolt 3 port has a theoretical throughput of 40Gbps, Apple endowed the late 2016 MacBook Pros with 120Gbps of I/O, which is very impressive. Two years ago the three USB ports on your computer combined for a grand total of 15Gbps. Susie Ochs Thunderbolt 3 ports all have dual personalities. They can alternatively function as one of two flavors of USB 3.1, the specification behind the latest version of USB. USB 3.1 has a new form factor: USB-C. It also has two variations, Gen 1 and Gen 2. The second generation doubles performance to 10Gbps. Apple opted for the more powerful USB-C Gen 2 implementation. So how can Apple get away with abandoning all those ports? No power port. No ports for DisplayPort, HDMI, Thunderbolt 2? I started using Thunderbolt 3 in late 2015 when I bought a Dell computer that sported a single Thunderbolt 3 port/USB-C Gen 2 port. USB, Thunderbolt and DisplayPort are peas in a pod. They were designed to be highly interoperable. The Thunderbolt 3 port (in combination with specific cables or adapters) can handle power both coming into and being shared out of your Thunderbolt 3 device, HDMI, DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort, USB 2, USB 3, VGA,Thunderbolt 2, gigabit Ethernet and it can daisy chain USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. With the proper adapters, you can drive two 4K monitors or one 5K monitor at 60Hz. And that's just with one Thunderbolt 3 port. Thunderbolt 3 also makes an excellent basis for a docking port since it connects to just about every type of device used with a computer. Thunderbolt 3 is the new universal port for data connection and power. After six months with a 4K Dell XPS 15 9550 and its lone Thunderbolt 3 port, I knew we were looking at the greatest port killer of all time. USB-C's small form factor and ability to accept the USB-C plug in either orientation could eventually put Apple's Lightning cable out of business. The combination with Thunderbolt 3's throughput makes it unstoppable. We're beginning to see a glimmer of that at CES 2017, where a growing list of Windows PCs are adding at least one Thunderbolt 3 port. HP's just-announced 15" Spectre X360 offers two Thunderbolt 3 ports, as does Asus' Zenbook 3 Deluxe. You've got to love the fact that Apple bypassed the hedging-their-bets phase and just went whole hog with four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The maker of the Macintosh may be more focused on iPhones these days, but it still knows how to lead with innovation. Late 2016 MacBook Pro buyers needn't worry about getting connected with all the right cables. A slew of companies just announced Thunderbolt 3 docking stations, all of which do the adapting for you. (For more information about recent announcements, read Computerworld and check the Thunderbolt industry site. Touch Bar? Ho-hum. Apple examines the obvious and jumps in with both feet. It may seem a little worrisome now to lose the ports that we've had for so long, but it won't be long before the flexibility this gives the MacBook Pro becomes apparent to the industry. Along with the size and weight reductions, the very large trackpad, Touch ID, wonderful LED display, excellent portability of the 13, fast SSDs and yes, OK, the Touch Bar, Thunderbolt 3 makes this new line of MacBook Pros the leader.

Desktops by Dan Ackerman January 10, 2017 7:26 AM PST @danackerman Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Enlarge Image The new CyberpowerPC Gamer Ultra VR Desktop PC. Photo by CyberpowerPC The idea of an expensive VR headset can induce sticker shock in prospective virtual-reality gamers, with headsets running from $599 to $799 for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. But that's not as bad as the high-end gaming PCs needed to run VR hardware. In CNET's extensive hands-on testing, $2,000 has been the sweet spot for price and performance, although some VR-ready desktops have dropped down to half that with a bundle discount. PC builder CyberpowerPC and chipmaker AMD have teamed up to announce a new $499 desktop that hits the latest (and recently lowered) minimum-required specs for Oculus Rift. It does this by using AMD components, rather than the typically more expensive Intel and Nvidia parts. Note that, for now, the $499 system is only available as part of a bundle with the full-priced Oculus Rift headset, bringing the total cost to $1,099. Purchased without the bundle, the desktop costs $649. The CyberpowerPC Gamer Ultra VR Desktop PC includes a 4.2GHz AMD FX 4350 CPU, a Radeon RX 470 graphics card, 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. That's not especially high end, but this PC is half the price of the previous least-expensive Oculus-ready desktop. The Gamer Ultra VR Desktop PC is available now from Best Buy and Amazon, again as part of a bundle that includes the Oculus Rift headset. 12 Nvidia GeForce 1080 gaming desktop roundup (pictures) New products from CES 2017: Check them out here.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tablets Asus Transformer 3 Pro Review: Doesn't quite stand out in the crowd 2-in-1 tablets are highly popular and Asus takes a dig at it with Transformer 3 Pro. Sami Khan   January 10, 2017 21:36 IST IBTimes India/Sami Khan Asus doesn't quite like to be left behind when it comes to competition. If it's not about winning, but participation, then Asus has done fairly well in a relatively new space. Asus Transformer 3 Pro is a strong player in the 2-in-1 laptop space, which is dominated by the likes of Microsoft Surface series. So, we couldn't help but compare the Transformer 3 Pro to the highly-capable Surface Pro 4 during our review. Asus has an edge over the Surface Pro 4 with its pricing by saving more than Rs 50,000. The tablet-cum-PC by Asus is available in India for Rs 1,44,990 and the company generously includes a backlit keyboard and a stylus in the box. The Transformer 3 Pro was launched at Computex 2016, but it has recently made its debut in India. For those who are looking for high-end portable PC options, Transformer 3 Pro stands to offer a suitable alternative to Surfaces and iPads. But is it there yet? Let's find out. Design We were a little disappointed with the design of the Transformer 3 Pro. The feel of the tablet is premium, but it looks so much like the Surface Pro 4. But there is obviously little room to experiment with the 2-in-1 devices, so it is better to be safe. But our disappointment was because Asus has always stood out with its exceptional designing, and we failed to see that in the Transformer 3 Pro. IBTimes India/Sami Khan When it comes to convenience, there is little to debate. The Transformer 3 Pro is light, compact and easy to carry around even if you do not have a laptop bag. It has a full size USB, HDMI and a USB Type-C (for charging) ports alongside physical buttons for volume and power. IBTimes India/Sami Khan There's a standard 3.5mm headphone jack for audio on the left. At the bottom, you will find magnetic connectors for the keyboard and the kickback stand lets you adjust the Transformer 3 Pro to a suitable position for you to work on. IBTimes India/Sami Khan Asus Transformer 3 Pro justifies the 2-in-1 label, but lacks innovation. Display Asus Transformer 3 Pro features a 12.6-inch LED touch screen with 2880 x 1920 pixels. The size, the resolution, touch response and the clarity hits the sweet spot. If you are a movie buff, you are going to love what the Transformer 3 Pro has the offer. The colours are vivid and well balanced. The Transformer 3 Pro is also best suited for professionals who work on designing. The stylus included in the package lets you work with precision and the touch is so accurate you cannot go wrong with it. IBTimes India/Sami Khan The display is the strongest features of the Transformer 3 Pro. Performance Although Asus Transformer 3 Pro packs top-of-the-line specs, it fails to deliver its best. Most of your daily tasks like writing, editing, video and photo editing and working with online for us, will go on smoothly most of the time. But at one point, the laptop just froze and we had to hard shut down to get it work again.  IBTimes India/Sami Khan This is coming from a laptop that is powered by an Intel core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, Intel Graphics 520 and 512GB SSD. We had high expectations from Transformer 3 Pro. But if you are looking for convenience over performance, then Transformer 3 Pro can satisfy you. IBTimes India/Sami Khan The Windows 10 certainly makes it a lot easier to work with the Transformer 3 Pro. And the tablet with its keyboard setup will certainly give you a laptop feel. You will easily get accustomed to the tiny keyboard layout as you keep working on it. Camera We had minimum expectations with the camera, but as it turns out Asus has really offered its best. The 13MP rear camera and 2MP front camera is great for video conferencing and also worked well for shooting some outdoor photos during the day. Although it seemed really odd to hold out a 12.6-inch tablet to capture photos, it can really be helpful during conferences and events when you have to work on the laptop. No more hustles of shooting on your smartphone or DSLR and transferring to the laptop. IBTimes India/Sami Khan Battery Just as favourite as display was for us in the Transformer 3 Pro, we did not grow fond of the tablet's battery performance. It would last us up to 6 hours of use with constant working on the internet and some music playback in the background. If you are buying a 2-in-1 laptop, you expect it to last long as the whole point of it is portability. With Transformer 3 Pro, you can easily work out during your domestic flights, buy we would recommend you carry a power bank to charge the laptop mid-way on an international flight. Verdict For Rs 1,44,990, we would question ourselves to buy the Transformer 3 Pro since there are so many devices in the market. In the end, how often do you use a laptop while travelling? And if the answer is a lot, then Transformer 3 Pro is a good device, but we would also consider a Surface Pro 4 in this category. As long as you have a MacBook Air, or the MacBook, which cost lesser than the Transformer 3 Pro, you are all set for the journey. The Transformer 3 Pro is a good tablet option, but not as great for its laptop counterpart.

However, according to the expert, those mechanisms are unlikely to be resumed in the near future. © AP Photo/ Seth Perlman US Report Lacks ‘Shred’ of Evidence Proving Russia Meddled in ElectionUnited States intelligence published a joint report on "Russian activities and intentions" in the recent United States presidential elections. According to the document, Moscow engaged various tools, including cyberattacks and media activities, to influence the results of the election. As for the recent presidential campaign, the authors of the report concluded that the campaign was aimed to "undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency." The document also read the "influence campaign" was ordered personally by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the US intelligence, President Putin and his entourage were interested in boosting Republican candidate Donald Trump’s chances to win the election. In turn, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov commented on the report, saying that it contains unjustified accusations made at an emotional and amateur level. According to Peskov, the whole situation around Russia’s alleged interference with the US election looks like a "witch hunt." © AP Photo/ Carolyn Kaster US Intel Report: 'Russia Did It!' Approach and Aftermath for Washington-Moscow TiesThe report put certain US officials in a "trap of their own promises" because initially they promised to provide evidence to the allegations, in order to convince the establishment and public, according to Oleg Demidov, a cybersecurity specialist and expert at the PIR-Center think-tank. "This goal was not achieved. Without the data from the classified version, the report is clueless. Of course, it quickly became a laughingstock. The gauntlet of criticism was run on this document," Demidov told RIA Novosti. For example, Republican Congressman Rod Blum made a joke about the Democratic Party and the allegations about "Russian hackers." "Walked to work past DNC HQ this afternoon. Nobody there – I guess they couldn't 'hack' this cold weather!" he wrote in a post on his Facebook page. Commenting on the new US sanctions against Russia over "interference with the election" and "pressure on American diplomats," Demidov underscored that this mechanism was actually based on an executive order from April 2015, which was designed to deal with China. However, later, in September 2015, Washington and Beijing reached a cybersecurity cooperation agreement. "Trump can overturn this executive order. But it is not guaranteed, taking into account the fact that he admitted some of the conclusions by US intelligence. Moreover, as president he may use this executive order in a different situation, for example during a new crisis with Russia," the expert suggested. © Flickr/ Yuri Samoilov Russia Among Top Five Countries With Highest Cybersecurity CapabilitiesHe also noted that Moscow and Washington has an agreement on cybersecurity. In 2013, Russia and the US signed an agreement to establish confidence measures related to cybersecurity. Those measures were in effect until mid-2014. They included emergency communications channels during crises in cyberspace. They also presumed establishing a working group and a presidential commission on developing cooperation in cyber activities. "We have instruments for cooperation. The deal has not been revoked. But it should be resumed to prevent situations like the current crisis. Unfortunately, so far I can’t see the possibility for this," Demidov concluded. ...

TECHNOLOGY Why Your Best Millennial Employees Might Quit What's the No. 1 thing preventing you from attracting and retaining top millennial candidates? Surprisingly, it's not flexibility. By Elizabeth Dukes Elizabeth Dukes is an entrepreneur, author and speaker. She is the co-founder and EVP of iOFFICE. Elizabeth champions iOFFICE’s mission to utilize technology to empower the workforce and the workplace to reach their full potential. @iOfficeCorp Co-founder and EVP, iOFFICE@iOfficeCorp WRITE A COMMENT Keep workplace technology updated CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement If you're looking to attract top millennial talent this year, listen up. That one update you've been dropping to the bottom of your priority list might be causing top candidates to pass you up for your competitors -- and could drive existing young employees out the door. We're talking about updating your workplace technology. Today's most sought-after organizations also happen to be among the "smartest" -- equipped with technology that provides better communication, offer flexibility and encourage collaboration. And if you're still unsure whether this really matters to the millennials in your company, the answer is it's highly likely. According to the 2016 Future Workforce Study by Dell and Intel, 42 percent of American millennials say they'd likely quit a job if workplace technology didn't meet their standards. That's nearly four times as many as baby boomers. Smart Offices vs. Flexibility While flexibility has been touted as one of the most important workplace factors for millennials, the report suggests working in a digital workplace equipped with modern technology could be ranked even higher -- 81 percent of millennials surveyed say the technology available influences their decision to take a new position; 72 percent also believe they'll be working in a "smart" office in the next five years, compared with only 52 percent of Gen-Xers and 35 percent of baby boomers. Enhancing Flexibility Through Technology Why do so many millennials rate technology over flexibility? It's likely because a smart office naturally fosters a more flexible environment. Workplace flexibility is one of the most important factors for millennials when evaluating a job opportunity: 29 percent said they do their best work outside of the office and 60 percent said they would be more productive at home versus in an office. But what should be more worrisome for employers is the finding that 34 percent of millennials have left a job because it did not provide enough flexibility. Smart offices value flexibility in a variety of forms, including from where employees work, what hours they work and the technology they use to get work done. Providing flexible work arrangements and the technology to make it possible (like portable devices and cloud-based communication tools) will keep employees satisfied and retained. Enhanced Workplace Communication More than 60 percent of millennials say remote teams and better communication technology will make face-to-face communication obsolete. When it comes to communication, millennials expect their offices to be equipped with technology to make communication seamless and easy. This goes beyond having accessible office space for collaborative meetings. The smartest companies have also adopted video, chat and cloud-based project management platforms to allow workers to communicate however and whenever they need to. This is critical to improve workplace collaboration, especially when remote teams are involved. Using smart technology to allow employees to connect beyond face-to-face meetings is key to attracting millennial talent, and also allows employers to source top talent from across the country -- or even around the world -- instead of just in areas where they have an office location. It's important for HR and business leaders to consider these insights as they design their workplaces and recruiting programs. With more and more millennials dominating the workplace, ensuring you have technology that aligns with Gen Y expectations is becoming critical to both attracting and retaining the young rock stars in your industry.

LEAD 1 Key Trait All Great Leaders Share Leadership Expert and CEO Nigel Green shares the singular, defining approach that separates good leaders from great ones. By John Nemo John Nemo is the author of the Amazon bestseller LinkedIn Riches: How to Leverage the World’s Largest Professional Network to Enhance Your Brand, Generate Leads, and Increase Revenue! @JohnNemoPR Founder and CEO, LinkedIn Riches@JohnNemoPR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Whether you're an a solo business owner or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, leadership is something you can't live without. If you want to move your career or company forward, you have to know how to lead yourself and those around you. I recently had the chance to sit down with Nigel Green, who has spent the past few decades studying (and implementing) the key principles of leadership. (Related: Listen to the full interview with Nigel Green) Green, a business growth advisor and consultant, is the former CEO of StoryBrand, where he helped clients like Pantene, Intel and Berkshire Hathaway clarify their marketing messages to improve customer engagement. Prior to StoryBrand, Green also helped lead a healthcare sales company from $94 million to $350 million of revenue in just 36 months. Leading The Way We all want the "right stuff" to have the formula for business growth. But what defines a leader isn't what you might assume. "Leaders aren't necessarily charismatic. They aren't necessarily quiet," Green told me. "There's not a personality trait that will give you a better chance at leading. "They're not intuitively extroverted, they're not intuitively introverted. On all of the types of characteristics and traits spectrums, there's not one that sticks out." This is great news for all of us, because it means that leadership can be learned. 1 Key Trait All Great Leaders Share Green suggests that there is however, one a clear distinction in all great leaders: their habits and routines. "Every leader that you go to study could very quickly dissect and present to you in a very succinct way their rituals and their habits. They are creatures of predictability," Green says. "One of my favorite all time influencers is Tony Robbins. He says, 'You are what you consistently do.' And I think that's true. Leaders are consistent, they're predictable." Your daily habits, routines, and schedules matter. Whether you are someone who gets up early or burns the midnight oil, your consistency matters - especially when it comes to making a habit of being proactive about your business. (Related: How to grow your business using LinkedIn) "Leaders put a priority on time outside of their business. They don't just spend their entire day responding and reacting to the problems that are thrown at them," Green says. "They are proactive. They sit down and think about, 'How do I get better? How do I put myself out of business?'" Success is a Habit In his own life, Green has prioritized 5 keys areas: Faith, Family, Faculty, Fitness and Finances. He makes it a habit to practice his growth in each of those areas daily, then ends the week by having a meeting with himself to review his progress. "So on Friday I have a meeting with myself ... my own personal review," he says. "On Friday I tell my next week how much time I need to spend on each of those five F's. I go in and schedule that next week out and I color code it on my calendar. Then, when I sit down at that following Friday meeting with myself, I just look and I say, 'Did I get it done? Did I spend enough time with my family? Did I exercise as many times as I said I was gonna exercise? Did I do my bible study? Did I go to church? Did I spend any time, you know, on the big projects at work?' I do an assessment. That's a habit for me that has served me really well." Love it or loathe it, Green is right - healthy habits and routines are the stuff of success both professionally and personally! Like this column?

Fedora Switching Away From Intel X.Org DDX Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Fedora on 10 January 2017 at 09:43 AM EST. 39 Comments Fedora is the latest Linux distribution abandoning the xf86-video-intel driver in favor of the generic xf86-video-modesetting DDX driver. With Fedora Rawhide as of today and obviously then beginning with Fedora 26, the switch is happening from xf86-video-intel to xf86-video-modesetting. Fedora already has been using xf86-video-modesetting for Skylake graphics while now the change-over is happening for all other Intel IGPs. This move follows Debian and Ubuntu switching away from Intel's DDX in favor of the generic modesetting driver that works with any KMS/DRM adapter. Confirmation of this switch can be found here. Using the generic -modesetting DDX uses the GLAMOR 2D acceleration over OpenGL, is much less of a maintenance burden, and works rather well on X.Org Server 1.18~1.19. Meanwhile, Intel hasn't issued a stable driver update in three years and their last development snapshot of xf86-video-intel 3.0 is two years old. We've been waiting for some official communication concerning plans for the Intel DDX and if xf86-video-intel 3.0 will ever happen, but it's not looking that way with barely anything going into it these days and more distributions just switching away from using it. 39 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

Yet that hasn’t stopped CyberPowerPC from revealing just one more new product as an encore performance: A new VR-ready desktop fine-tuned for the Oculus Rift headset. The price for the desktop is a mere $499, which is great considering that the full Oculus Rift setup costs a hefty $800 on its own. But here’s the catch: Customers can’t purchase this PC by itself. Instead, the company is only serving up a $1,100 bundle through Best Buy, as seen here. For that price, customers get the VR-ready PC, a gaming keyboard, a gaming mouse, the Oculus Rift headset, one sensor, the Oculus remote, an Xbox One controller, cables, and the VR game Lucky’s Tale. The new Oculus Touch controllers and second sensor are not included. Neither CyberPowerPC or Best Buy provide a detailed list of hardware, but merely a short list: Processor: AMD FX-4350 (quad-core) Memory: 8GB DDR3 Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 470 (4GB GDDR5) Storage: 1TB 7,200RPM hard drive DVD burner Ports: 1x Gigabit Ethernet 1x HDMI 3x USB 3.0 7x USB 2.0 That’s all we have for now. In the meantime, for those not familiar with the CPU and graphics chip used in CyberPowerPC’s new VR-ready PC, here are a few additional details: Processor Package: AM3+ Unlocked: Yes Total L2 cache: 4MB Number of cores: 4 Number of threads: 4 Base clock speed: 4.2GHz Maximum clock speed: 4.3MHz Maximum power draw (TDP): 125 watts Price: $80 RX 470 Graphics Steam processors: 2,048 Compute Units: 32 Base clock speed: 926MHz Boost clock speed: 1,206MHz Memory clock speed: 1,650MHz Memory bandwidth: 211GB per second Memory interface: 256-bit Memory amount/type: 4GB GDDR5 Maximum power draw: 120 watts Base price: $170 The new VR-ready desktop is based on CyberPowerPC’s X-Nova chassis that’s used with its “Essential” line of PCs. Currently, the company provides three customizable Essential configurations: the 1000 model with a starting price of $1,035, the 2000 model with a starting price of $1,125, and the 3000 model with a starting price of $1,339. All three are based on Intel processors, so the similarities between the new VR-ready PC and the Essential-branded desktops stops there. More: CyberPowerPC and Syber Gaming out new desktops that are literally super-cool Compared to CyberPowerPC’s heaping of Intel-based gaming desktops, the company only offers nine systems based on the AMD FX processor, none of which sport the FX-4350 CPU by default. The list includes the Gamer Dragon, the Mega Special I, the Pro Gamer FTW Ultra 3000, the Gamer Scorpius 9000, the Gamer Ultra 7500, and a few others. “The system offered in the bundle has been extensively tested by both CyberPowerPC and Oculus to ensure that it is perfectly compatible with the Oculus Rift headset,” the company said on Monday. “This PC is among one of the first from CyberPowerPC that has been certified as Oculus Ready.” The thing to keep in mind is that AMD’s FX-4350 desktop processor was released in April 2013. It’s based on AMD’s “Piledriver” CPU design and only supports DDR3 system memory clocked at 1,866MHz.  It’s not the freshest stallion out of the AMD stable, but it’s backed by one of AMD’s latest graphics cards based on its “Polaris” design. The RX 470 arrived in the summer of 2016 as an affordable means in upgrading mainstream PCs with VR capabilities. Also keep in mind that, if purchasing the CyberPowerPC bundle on Best Buy, customers will need to buy the $200 Oculus Touch controller kit for the complete full-motion experience. A third stand-alone sensor can be purchased for better full-room coverage by heading here.

This year may finally be different. Virtual Reality Apps by Ian Sherr January 10, 2017 5:00 AM PST @iansherr Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Not all virtual reality is made the same. Some of it, like videos produced by the likes of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and even CNET, invite you to pop a phone into a pair of goggles, strap them on and then watch as you're transported to a refugee camp, a ballet or a tech confab. Game companies, filmmakers and all manner of other industries are trying their hand at it -- particularly after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent $2 billion to acquire industry leader Oculus and said VR could revolutionize the way we use computers. But live VR is something else. Whereas most videos offer a window into other people's worlds, live-streams are usually a blurry, glitchy mess. Last year, when I tried this technology at CES, I was transported from a hotel party room at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas to a courtside seat at the United Center in Chicago to watch a basketball game between the Boston Celtics and the Chicago Bulls. But that's where the fun stopped -- I couldn't make out the scoreboard or player's jerseys. Other streams, such as one of a presidential debate, were similarly bad. This year, the video was far better. I was joined by 259 people in watching a college basketball game between Butler and Villanova from a ballroom at Mandalay Bay in Vegas. We were using technology from Intel called Voke VR, and the improvement over last year was noticeable. Enlarge Image Intel had barf bags just in case it got a little hairy.Photo by James Martin/CNET Not only were scoreboards and players much easier to make out, but Intel had also replicated key details, such as the score and standings between various teams as extra information I could look at. There were even different camera angles I could watch. I had the same reaction to a demonstration from NextVR, which showed me a replay of its live-stream technology the next day. David Cole, co-founder of NextVR, said he expects images to get even better over the next year. One technological leap he's excited about is the ability to look around objects, like if a referee stands in front of the camera. "If you have any interest in live broadcast, if it's music, live sports or current events -- that's one where you say I won't go back and watch this on television," he said. NextVR is planning to begin offering "hundreds" of shows by the end of this year. "I wouldn't be surprised if by the end of 2017 there's something live on every day on our air," he said. NextVR is already working with Fox Sports, and more will likely come soon. New products from CES 2017: The CNET team shows you the latest gear from the Las Vegas tech show. Check it out right here.

A number of journalists and military experts have drawn the comparison in recent days, including respected writer Glenn Greenwald who slammed a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). It claimed Russia was responsible for the hack, with the intention of influencing the result of the recent US presidential election. A Congressman who is most definitely not a Trump loyalist writes a great letter on Russia, seeking evidence... https://t.co/w8KPnXhsfh— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) January 9, 2017 Speaking on CNN’s ‘Intel Report’, Greenwald said the public should not “blindly and uncritically” accept the report without sufficient evidence “and we have absolutely not seen that in this case.” On intel report, @ggreenwald tells @brianstelter that "we have not seen" convincing evidence that "claims are true" https://t.co/oOSsgfkFqV— CNN (@CNN) January 8, 2017 “In 2002...a group of bipartisan senators assured the nation that the intelligence community convinced them that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and was in alliance with Al-Qaeda,” Greenwald said, referencing the similarities between the recent allegations from US intelligence and the events that led to the invasion of Iraq. US intelligence has meddled in elections worldwide and manufactured the lie of WMDs in #Iraq.

We all remember the WMD fiasco,” Taibbi wrote, adding that “nothing quite adds up.” The fact that people are being called disloyal or agents of Russia for critically eyeing Intel reports is insane.

Speaking to RT, former MI5 Intelligence Officer Annie Machon warned the ODNI’s report carried a great deal of danger, comparing it to the “flawed intelligence case” that led to the UK involvement in the Iraq war. READ MORE: ‘Insider leaks, not Russian hacking’: CIA & MI5 veterans discuss ODNI report on RT The report was described as a “farce” by former CIA analyst Larry C Johnson who told RT, “I don’t think they’re hiding anything because they don’t have anything.” “These are ‘or and how’ intelligence estimates as opposed to an intelligence analysis based on fact. There’s no fact underlying this. There are analytical assumptions,” Johnson said. @wikileaks Anyone that believes Russia affected our election is a Moron!

STOP IT— Deplorable Melissa (@sweetatertot2) January 7, 2017 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange heavily criticized the report in a press conference on Monday, describing it as more like a press release than an intelligence report.

When cars drive themselves, they currently rely on several. But while self-driving cars may be able to see more of the road than humans, the trick is teaching them to interpret all of that data as well as — and eventually, better than — humans can. At CES, the annual consumer technology show in Las Vegas last week, there were a handful of companies attempting to bring us closer to this reality. Some are the makers of sensors and chips that underpin many of the devices we use each day, and others are not yet household names. There are companies such as Velodyne and Quanergy, which have been developing LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors that use lasers to measure the distance, shape, and size of objects near and far. Others, such as Mobileye, make cameras that have traditionally been used for rear and side-view camera systems, but are increasingly used for object detection and 3D mapping as well. (Its sensors are perhaps most well known as the eyes behind electric auto maker Tesla's Autopilot hands-free driving feature.) The MobileEye booth at CES, the annual consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. The company makes sensors commonly used for rear-view camera systems, but has also lent its expertise to Intel and BMW's still in-development self-driving car. (Matthew Braga/CBC News) And then there are the chip companies — Intel, NVIDIA, and even BlackBerry — that are partnering with more traditional car companies to provide the processing power and next-generation internet connectivity required to make self-driving cars a reality. James Kuffner, the chief technology officer of Toyota's artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicle research institute, said in an interview at CES that there's room for current sensors to improve in accuracy, range and cost. "And I think we're going to see a dramatic shift in the next ten years as this technology starts to mature." Cameras, maps, and semantic cues In the near term, both Mobileye and Toyota have plans to leverage data from existing car cameras in an attempt to build more up-to-date 3D maps of the world. By harvesting images from cars that are already on the road, or soon to be on the road, the two companies hope that they can more cheaply and regularly crowdsource the data required for self-driving vehicles to safely navigate ever-changing urban areas. University of Waterloo team trains autonomous car to drive in winter weather Automakers take differing routes to self-driving future ​Erez Dagan, Mobileye's senior vice president of advanced development and strategy, says the company's discussions are in "very advanced stages with multiple car manufacturers" to not only harvest data from their cars' cameras, but share that data with other automakers globally. But longer term, cameras could be used for more nuanced types of sensing. Another area that still requires work is the understanding of semantic cues — all of the human behaviours that are easily recognizable to drivers, but that computers don't fully understand. A sensor made by LIDAR company Velodyne is being used in Ford's fleet of self-driving test vehicles. (Matthew Braga/CBC News) Today, the posture of a pedestrian, a cyclist's gaze, or the direction a parked car's wheels are difficult for self-driving cars to discern and understand the way humans do. "Car sensor systems are not yet sensitive enough to be able to interpret body language. But we do," explained Melissa Cefkin, Nissan's in-house design anthropologist and principal researcher. "We can tell that somebody standing like this" — here Cefkin mimes a pedestrian looking down at her phone — "is not about to run across the street." "So part of what we would like to do is continue to bring these insights," she added. "[But] we're kind of ahead of what the technology is capable of in terms of what we would try to teach it." Long-range lasers While camera sensors are good for some tasks, most opt for LIDAR when it comes to detecting things like size, shape, depth and speed — everything from a car's proximity to nearby cyclists to the velocity of a wayward soccer ball.  What companies want is "additional range, they want additional resolution, they want additional quality within the data," said Michael Jellen, president and chief operating officer of Velodyne, perhaps the most well-known LIDAR company. Its sensors have been used by companies ranging from Google to Ford. "A human can see all the things some of the time, or some of the things all the time, but it's never going to see all the things, all the time. And that's what our perception is going to enable you to do," said Jellen. Inside the trunk of a self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid, which is packed full with computer equipment and high-end graphics chips from NVIDIA. (Matthew Braga/CBC News) Quanergy uses a type of LIDAR sensor that the company says can be re-focused on-the-fly to identify objects with greater accuracy and detail. "You can say, 'Okay, this is floating like a plastic bag, so I'm going to drive through it,'" explained Louay Eldada, the company's co-founder and CEO, or "'This is a moose, and I'm not going to mess with that.'" The company says that it is working with Mercedes, Hyundai-Kia and Renault-Nissan, in addition to other manufacturers it declined to name. But one perennial challenge is weather. "When we think about what sensors and software it would take to drive in snow, or heavy rain, we're not there yet. And no one really is," says Kuffner of Toyota. "But I think there's a lot of sensing modalities you can explore that might be able to enable that." Driving data Another important piece of the self-driving puzzle is what to do with all of the data these sensors produce.  Chipmaker Intel's current focus is on building next-generation computer systems that can ingest an "enormous amounts of data from a variety of sensors," explained Bridget Karlin, managing director of the company's Internet of Things Group. "And not just vision sensors, not just cameras. We are looking at motion, we're looking at temperature, LIDAR, radar." Intel, in partnership with BMW and Mobileye, says it plans to have 40 autonomous vehicles on the road — with a human watching behind the wheel — in the second half of 2017, and a fully driverless car on the road by 2021. Hyundai unveiled a version of its IONIQ vehicle at CES with less-expensive self driving technology aimed at consumers, but no release data. (Matthew Braga/CBC News) Competing chipmaker NVIDIA announced a similar platform at the show, and a partnership with Audi to have "advanced AI cars on the road starting in 2020," according to a press release. And BlackBerry, once one of the world's most well-known smartphone makers, has been trying to re-position itself into a similar role with its automotive operating system, QNX, which the company says can be found in more than 60 million vehicles worldwide. "When you think of the sensors, they're like your eyes and ears. Software will be the brains, powered by very high performance computer platforms," said Grant Courville, a senior director at QNX. "We want to provide the software platform, not only for those autonomous driving safety systems, but in fact, for the whole car."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 10 January 2017 | MYT 3:42 PM 5G technology to spark ‘invention revolution’: Qualcomm chief by mike freeman Unlocking the future: By 2035, when 5G is forecast to be fully rolled out globally, it could support 22 million jobs and US$3.5tril (RM15.66tril) in revenue – transforming retail, education, transportation, entertainment and other industries, said Mollenkopf. — Reuters New technology to create faster, more flexible 5G wireless networks is on the horizon, and it potentially could usher in an economic dawn akin to the introduction of electricity or the automobile.  Is that over-hyping 5G? Maybe. But Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf made a case for how much these fifth generation wireless networks could change the way we live and work.  "The world around us – our homes, cars, cities, manufacturing and healthcare – will become more intelligent, automated and interconnected," said Mollenkopf during a keynote speech at CES 2017. "Entire industries will change and emerge as data speeds go up and data costs come down."  5G networks are still a few years away. But research and development work from wireless heavyweights including Ericsson, Verizon, AT&T, Huawei, Qualcomm, SK Telecom and others is starting to bear fruit.  Both Qualcomm and Intel have announced plans for delivering 5G modem chips to link mobile devices to fifth generation wireless networks.  Both company say they'll launch trial deployments of their 5G modems late this year. The testing could pave the way for 5G demonstration networks at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo.  Performance targets for 5G remain unclear. But peak network data rates of up to 10 gigabits per second are being talked about. That is 10 times faster than the best 4G LTE technology today.  Qualcomm said its first iteration 5G modem, the X50, expects to deliver peak download speeds of 5 gigabits per second – enough to stream a 4K ultra high-definition movie with ease.  More efficient network architecture aims to reduce the cost of delivering 5G bandwidth, so streaming video doesn't burn up data plans. Fifty-five percent of mobile data traffic in 2015 was video, said Mollenkopf. It's forecast to reach 75% by 2020.  Another key goal of 5G is to reduce cellular transmission delays – or latency – to near imperceptible levels. That will allow these networks to power time-sensitive services such as self-driving cars, drones and wireless health monitoring.  To gain speeds and capacity, 5G networks are looking to tap higher-frequency airwave bands that aren't used for 4G wireless today.  These bands are prone to interference from buildings or other objects, and they're hard to transmit over long distances. Technologies including tiny, advanced antennas and dense deployments of small cells are among the techniques wireless companies plan to use to take advantage of these millimetre wave frequencies.  5G faces a paradox, however. While it aims to provide a fast communications pipe for ultra-high definition video streaming and telemedicine, it also wants to bring onto the network billions of sensors, connected thermostats and other Internet of Things gadgets that don't need a fat data pipe.  Mollenkopf said Qualcomm has the wireless expertise to help build this kind of flexibility into 5G networks. Every 3G and 4G smartphone and device contains Qualcomm technology.  "It is more like competing in a decathlon than a single event," said Mollenkopf of the skills required for 5G development. "Qualcomm has been driving the evolution of this technology for more than 30 years, above and beyond smartphones. Over a billion Internet of Things products have already shipped with our technology built in."  The San Diego wireless giant commissioned an independent opinion study of 3,800 business leaders to better understand what people expect from 5G.  Among the study's findings: By 2035, when 5G is forecast to be fully rolled out globally, it could support 22 million jobs and US$3.5tril (RM15.66tril) in revenue – transforming retail, education, transportation, entertainment and other industries, said Mollenkopf.  To put that jobs number in context, that's larger than the population of Beijing, he said. "5G isn't an incremental improvement in connectivity, or even just a new generation of mobile," said Mollenkopf.  "5G will be a new kind of network, supporting a vast diversity of devices with unprecedented scale, speed and complexity. And that new network will change the way we live, the way we work, and even the way we relate to each other."  5G will pave the way for more intelligent devices that anticipate what owners need based on past behavior. It will allow people to work remotely, with business software running as smoothly on mobile devices as it does in the office. It will power more life like virtual reality, connected cars, smart cities and flocks of drones. It will allow doctors to consult with patients from anywhere.  "We are used to getting cloud-based data and applications from anywhere. But get ready, because that experience is about to get a whole lot better," said Mollenkopf. — The San Diego Union-Tribune/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Men found to crave social media attention more than women: Kaspersky Internet radio titan Pandora to cut workforce Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Turkish Airlines cargo jet crash kills 16 in Kyrgyzstan Petaling Street traders expect slower sales for CNY Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Mercedes wants to use robots for making goods deliveries Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED Create your own website PCs on the rise Sci-fi tech set for 2017 Could your gadgets send you to jail?

January 9, 2017January 9, 2017 by Ken Silverstein Corporate America has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for shareholders. So how does a carbon tax fit into this scheme? Alex Russell for the Bozeman Daily in Montana writes that a multitude of multinationals have saved millions in utility expenses by incentivizing low-carbon strategies. He points specifically to Walmart, Intel, AMD, HP, eBay, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelez and Unilver as primary examples of companies on the cutting edge — and ones that support the Paris climate accord. “Their position on curbing emissions makes financial sense or they would not even be wading in on a subject that inexplicably still makes the mainstream media nervous.” The low-hanging fruit is to change out to energy-efficient lightbulbs. But the column posits that governments need to consider placing a fee on fossil fuels at their source and then to return the monies to consumers. That revenue would be used to stimulate the economy, as well as get invested in new technologies. That’s a carbon tax. Does it work? He points to oft-cited British Columbia, which instituted such a tax in 2008. It has cut its carbon emissions by 15% per capita since then, the author says, while the province has economically outperformed others in Canada. Exxon Mobil Corp. is saying ‘yes’ to a potential carbon tax. If the issue moves at all in Washington, it will be the major oil companies that get on board to push it. To that end, Exxon says that it will support a carbon tax that is revenue neutral, or one where the revenues from the tax are plowed back into economy in the form of clean energy investments or used to reduce other corporate taxes. Under a carbon tax, government would tax industrial facilities such as oil companies and electric utilities according to their carbon footprints that can be readily measured. A joint report issued by the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute says that pricing carbon is the most efficient way of reducing carbon dioxide releases that are tied to global warming. A $16 tax per ton would raise $1.1 trillion in the first 10 years.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Russia comes fifth after the United States, China, the United Kingdom and South Korea, the research, obtained by the Kommersant newspaper, indicated. © AP Photo/ Kirsty Wigglesworth US Intel Report on Alleged Russia's Hacking 'Political Attack Cannon Against Trump' - Assange Zecurion used its estimates of so-called "cyber troops" used by each country, as well as the financing allocated to the relevant departments. The United States was first by far in terms of financing, spending some $7 billion each year on its cybersecurity capabilities. China spends just $1.5 billion, but employed an army of 20,000 computer experts. The United Kingdom and South Korea spend $450 million and $400 million respectively, while Russia spends $300 million and employs 1,000 cybersecurity specialists. Zecurion said the cyber troops are engaged in spying, cyber attacks and information wars and aim to exert influence on the population of target countries. © AFP 2016/ JEFF KOWALSKY Donald Trump Accepts Russia’s Role in DNC Hacking - AideThe research was based on military budget data, cybersecurity strategies, official documents, information provided by international organizations, official remarks and information obtained from insider sources. The research comes amid the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hacking scandal in the United States. US intelligence has accused Russia of hacking DNC servers and leaking information compromising former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to WikiLeaks prior to US presidental elections in an effort to boost her opponent Donald Trump's chances of victory. On Friday, US Intelligence released a public version of a comprehensive intelligence report assessing Russian activities and intentions related to the 2016 US presidential election. The report accused Russia of trying to influence the election. After being briefed on the report, Trump said the DNC hack did not have an impact on the election outcome. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues.

This is the real meaning of the “Russia hacking” story which, as yet, has not produced any hard evidence of Russian complicity. Last week’s 25-page report, that was released by the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, illustrates to what extent intelligence is being “fixed around the policy”.  Just as the CIA generated false information related to Weapons of Mass Destruction to soften public resistance to war with Iraq, so too, the spurious allegations in the DNI’s politically-motivated report are designed to depict Russia as a growing threat to US national security. The timing of the report has less to do with the election of Donald Trump as President than it does with critical developments in Syria where the Russian military has defeated US-proxies in Syria’s industrial hub, Aleppo, rolling back Washington’s 15-year War of Terror and derailing the imperialist plan to control vital resources and pipeline corridors across the Middle East and Central Asia. Russia has become the main obstacle to Washington achieving its strategic vision of pivoting to Asia and maintaining its dominant role into the next century. The Intelligence Community has been coerced into compromising its credibility to incite fear of Russia and to advance the geopolitical ambitions of deep state powerbrokers. The “Russia hacking” flap shows how far the Intel agencies have veered from their original mandate, which is to impartially gather and analyze information that may be vital to US national security. As we have seen in the last two weeks, the leaders of these organizations feel free to offer opinions on  issues that clearly conflict with those of the new President-elect. Trump has stated repeatedly that he wants to reduce tensions and reset relations with Russia, but that policy is being sabotaged by members of the intelligence community, particularly CIA Director John Brennan who appeared just last week on PBS Newshour with Judy Woodruff. Here’s an excerpt from the interview: “We see that there are still a lot of actions that Russia is undertaking that undermine the principles of democracy in so many countries. What has happened in our recent election is not new. The Russians have engaged in trying to manipulate elections in Europe for a number of years… the Russians tried to interfere in our electoral process recently, and were actively involved in that. And that is something that we can’t countenance.” (“Interview with CIA Director John Brennan”,  PBS Newshour) Brennan, of course, provided no evidence for his claims nor did he mention the hundreds of CIA interventions around the world. But Brennan’s accusations are less important than the fact that his appearance on a nationwide broadcast identifies him as a political advocate for policies that conflict with those of the new president. Do we really want unelected intelligence officials — whose job it is to provide the president with sensitive information related to national security– to assume a partisan role in shaping policy? And why would Brennan –whose is supposed to “serve at the pleasure of the president”– accept an invitation to offer his views on Russia when he knew they would be damaging to the new administration? Powerful people behind the scenes are obviously pushing the heads of these intelligence agencies to stick to their ‘anti-Moscow’ narrative to force Trump to abandon his plan for peaceful relations with Moscow.  Brennan isn’t calling the shots and neither are Clapper or Comey. They’re all merely agents serving the interests of establishment plutocrats whose geopolitical agenda doesn’t jibe with that of the incoming administration. If that wasn’t the case, then why would the Intelligence Community stake its reputation on such thin gruel as this Russian hacking gibberish? It doesn’t make any sense. The people who launched this campaign are either supremely arrogant or extremely desperate. Which is it?  Here’s an excerpt from an article by veteran journalist Robert Parry sums it up like this in an article at Consortium News: “The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information – built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump. But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word “assesses” – as in the U.S. intelligence community “assesses” that Russia is guilty – suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak, “assesses” often means “guesses.” (“US Report Still Lacks Proof on Russia ‘Hack’”, Robert Parry, Consortium News) Bottom line: Brennan and his fellow spooks have nothing. The report is little more than a catalogue of unfounded assumptions, baseless speculation and uncorroborated conjecture. In colloquial parlance, it’s bullshit, 100 percent, unalloyed Russophobic horse-manure. In fact, the authors admit as much in the transcript itself when they say:  “Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents.” What kind of kooky admission is that?  So the entire report could be BS but we’re supposed to believe that Putin flipped the election? Is that it??? What’s really going on here?  Why have the Intelligence agencies savaged their credibility just to convince people that Russia is up to no good? The Russia hacking story has more to do with recent developments in Syria than it does with delegitimizing Donald Trump. Aleppo was a real wake up call for the US foreign policy establishment which is beginning to realize that their plans for the next century have been gravely undermined by Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Aleppo represents the first time that an armed coalition of allied states (Russia, Iran, Syria, Hezbollah) have actively engaged US jihadist-proxies and soundly beat them to a pulp. The stunning triumph in Aleppo has spurred hope among the vassal states that Washington’s bloody military juggernaut can be repelled, rolled back and defeated. And if Washington’s CIA-armed, trained and funded jihadists can be repelled, then the elitist plan to project US power into Central Asia to dominate the world’s most populous and prosperous region, will probably fail. In other words, the outcome in Aleppo has cast doubts on Uncle Sam’s ability to successfully execute its pivot to Asia. That’s why the Intel agencies have been employed to shape public perceptions on Russia.  Their job is to prepare the American people for an escalation of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed superpowers. US powerbrokers are determined to intensify the conflict and reverse facts on the ground. (Recent articles by elites at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute reveal that they are as committed to partitioning Syria as ever.)  Washington wants to  reassert its exceptional role as the uncontested steward of global security and the lone ‘unipolar’ world power. That’s what this whole “hacking” fiasco is about. The big shots who run the country are trying to strong-arm ‘the Donald’ into carrying their water so the depredations can continue and Central Asia can be transformed into a gigantic Washington-dominated corporate free trade zone where the Big Money calls the shots and Capital reigns supreme. That’s their dreamstate, Capitalist Valhalla. They just need Trump to get-with-the-program so the bloodletting can continue apace. Join the debate on Facebook MIKE WHITNEY lives in Washington state.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Chinese tariffs worry Californians print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Chinese tariffs worry Californians By David Pierson / Los Angeles Times Published Jan 10, 2017 at 12:02AM LOS ANGELES — With each provocative tweet aimed at China from the president-elect, David Vered worries about a trade war that would hurt profits at his Los Angeles jeans company. All the denim Vered buys for his brand, YMI Jeans, comes from Chinese factories, which have come to dominate the industry because of China’s abundance of affordable labor, capital and lax environmental laws. Those same conditions help make China the world’s top producer of all manner of manufactured goods such as cellphones, furniture, rubber boots and even Christmas lights. It’s difficult for foreign companies to source supplies from anywhere else and stay competitive. “It would be disastrous,” Vered, who remains a Donald Trump supporter, said of a trade war. “China is the whole production line. It would be very, very difficult for us.” Across California, companies reliant on Chinese factories and suppliers are mulling over what it means if the incoming Trump administration makes good on threats to slap new tariffs on Chinese goods. The president-elect and his surrogates have floated the idea of import taxes as high as 45 percent and as low as 5 percent to punish China for undervaluing its currency — a charge many economists say is outdated. Should the trade relationship with China sour, no state would feel the disruption more than California. About $143.6 billion in goods from China were shipped to the Golden State in 2015, according to the latest full-year census data. That’s three-and-half times more than second-place Texas. Meanwhile, the threat of retaliation from China looms large for state exporters. California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 — second only to Washington state’s $19.4 billion. The high trade volume helps keep more than 30,000 workers employed at the Port of Los Angeles, where 6 of every 10 containers arrive from China. And the raw materials and finished products that pour in ensure California companies such as Apple and Intel remain among the most profitable brands in the world. “California has more to lose because we are the gateway to the U.S.” for Asian exporters, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. “This is where the infrastructure, connections and merchants are.” The state also boasts the nation’s largest manufacturing base, employing about 10 percent of all U.S. factory workers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Most of those jobs are in high-value sectors like computers, chemicals and aerospace — industries that can more easily absorb California’s higher wages, expensive real estate and stricter regulations than producers of, say, garments or toys. Still, many companies that choose to manufacture in California rely on components and raw materials from China. All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington once Trump assumes the White House. Trump, who nearly threw the “one China” policy into disarray last month, during the presidential campaign ran as a champion of displaced working-class Americans who believe they’ve been marginalized by globalization and Chinese mercantilist policies. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. and slash America’s trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. One of Trump’s long-stated solutions for lost jobs and China has been to impose tariffs, much like President Reagan did with Japanese cars (a move that helped U.S. automakers but raised prices for American consumers). “I’m totally open to a tariff if they don’t treat us fairly,” Trump said during a GOP primary debate last year. “Their whole trade thing is tariff. You can’t deal in China without tariff. They do it to us, we don’t do it. It’s not fair trade.” Trump has kept the pressure on since being elected, mostly over Twitter, where he’s fired hundreds of barbs at China over the years. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump tweeted last week. The next day, Trump picked Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. trade representative. The lawyer and former trade official during the Reagan presidency has spent years arguing for tariffs on foreign goods. He joins a host of aides and appointees to the incoming administration, such as University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, who favor a decidedly confrontational approach to Beijing. California “gets an advantage by simply facilitating the flow of illegally subsidized goods into the country,” Navarro, who was tapped to head the newly created National Trade Council and wrote a book called “Death By China,” told the Los Angeles Times last year. “We are unique in that we are the gateway for the disease, and people make money off of that.” It remains unclear how much blame to assign China for the loss of American factory jobs, which peaked at 19 million in 1979 before falling to about 12 million today. A study by Ball State University’s Center for Business and Economic Research in 2015 found that 88 percent of lost manufacturing jobs were due to efficiencies such as automation and robots. It’s also debatable what, exactly, a trade deficit says about a nation’s economy. Some economists note that the U.S. economy thrives when it runs a trade imbalance. “The challenge isn’t about how to get jobs back, but how to prepare jobs for the future,” said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management. “The story of the U.S. economy has always been about creative destruction,” he said, referring to the capitalistic theory that new production methods always replace old ones. “The question is how to facilitate that in a way that’s humane and productive.” Moreover, many economists say the merits of using tariffs are overstated. They say a tax on imports could blunt some Chinese exports, but would also make consumer goods in the U.S. more expensive — a shift that would disproportionately hurt the working class. In 2009, President Barack Obama slapped a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. The move saved up to 1,200 U.S. jobs, but it also resulted in Americans paying an additional $1.1 billion on more expensive tires, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It’s also no guarantee that tariffs on Chinese goods would result in more U.S. manufacturing activity — not when developing nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico have spent years building a case as viable alternatives to China for production. “Tariffs on imports from China will not serve as a magic wand that brings back lost jobs,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who formerly headed the International Monetary Fund’s China division. “Rather, such tariffs could end up inflicting collateral damage on U.S. businesses and hurting job growth in companies that have built international supply chains.” Among the biggest sectors to have done this is the tech industry, which relies on countries across Asia to build its hardware. Apple can afford to build its high-end desktop computers in the U.S. because they are an expensive, niche product. But the equation changes when it comes to the iPhone, which accounts for about 60 percent of the company’s sales. Making the device in the U.S. requires access to tens of thousands of vocation school-trained workers at a single plant. In addition to higher labor expenses, Apple would have to pay for the added costs of importing parts across the Pacific such as processors from South Korea, cameras from Japan and rare-earth minerals from China. Building that supply chain from scratch could take years. The same problem applies to smaller companies and products that aren’t as high-tech. Bruce Gifford, chief executive of the Santa Monica, California- and New York-based 360 Sweater, said it would be impossible to produce in the U.S. the sweaters he sells at stores including Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. “We don’t have the knitting equipment here,” said Gifford, who employs about 40 people. “For the most part, there’s no sweater production left in the U.S. anymore because there’s no sweater machines or ancillary products like the right washing machines, driers, presses or yarn suppliers.” The company would have little recourse other than to pass the higher costs onto consumers if Chinese imports were slapped with a new tariff. Almost all the world’s cashmere comes from China’s arid northern and western frontier provinces where cashmere wool goats thrive. Ultimately, Gifford hopes Trump’s tough talk on China is nothing more than residual campaign rhetoric. “I just can’t imagine the tariffs are anything more than a threat,” he said. “It’s to put China on notice.” 16123678 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Try to connect with organisations in the same or similar vertical/niche. As a small business, you have created roles within your organisation. You should define and understand the work required of each role. This will enable you to select the most appropriate ecosystem for optimal employee productivity. Knowing how employees will use their PCs determines whether performance, mobility, battery life or display quality is most important. A desk-bound engineer designing a next generation product will require more computing power than a traveling salesperson. Based on role-specific priorities, you will choose from a wide variety of devices, including notebooks, desktops, 2-in-1s or tablets. The same process applies when choosing a processor – PCs containing entry-level processors will perform just fine for general office duties such as responding to emails, drafting documents and generating presentations. As the performance demands increase, so does the need for a higher end PC containing more advanced components. Employees who use complex software programs such as graphic design, video editing and other compute-intensive applications will require higher end processors and graphics cards to ensure smooth performance. Upgrading to PCs containing sixth Gen Intel® Core™ processors will enable faster performance, lower energy consumption, 4k video editing and immersive graphics. Keep docks and monitors in mind Because modularity is becoming a crucial factor in the evolution of the workplace, you should consider the need for versatile and powerful docking systems. This can be especially important within small businesses, where resources are tight and IT equipment might be slim. The flexibility of docking systems allows employees to adapt to ever changing working scenarios by being mobile one day and desk-centric the next. A notebook combined with a dock that instantly connects to a monitor, keyboard and mouse will enhance productivity. Provide options for user types based on device Today, thin and light notebooks and 2-in-1s make being mobile and getting work done even easier. To realise the business benefits of a mobility strategy, small businesses should understand the work different employees are doing, where they are doing it and identify the best combination of devices to meet their needs. Needs vary based on the type of business, but most organisations prioritise PCs and smartphones as the two most critical tools for empowering a productive workforce. Take advantage of all that Windows 10 has to offer PCs based on Windows 10 provide significant feature advancements and enable small businesses to easily manage and secure devices and data in a mobile-first, cloud-connected world. Windows 10 runs on all device types, works beautifully with Office 365 and automatically stores files in the cloud so co-workers can collaborate on documents wherever and whenever. Windows 10 fosters a cohesive ecosystem that allows employees to use just one sign-in across Windows and Office, so when they log in to any Windows 10 Pro device (tablet, phone, or laptop), they will have access to all of their current files, data, apps and personal settings. The latest generation of Windows 10-enabled PCs offer a slew of new features including touch, pen, fingerprint security and advanced 2-in-1 capabilities that allow the device to seamlessly transition from a notebook to a tablet and back again. The addition of Windows 10 universal apps allows software programs to run on any device to enable greater portability and more productivity at work. Universal apps reduce the cost of developing individual line of business (LOB) apps because they can be deployed across PCs, tablets, phones and IoT devices. Prioritise security As a small business, security is a crucial element of your IT ecosystem. Windows 10 Pro delivers enterprise-grade security for organisations of all sizes and offers compelling tools to take advantage of the latest hardware innovation to combat cyber threats. If a Windows 10 Pro device or USB drive is lost or stolen, BitLocker and BitLocker-to-Go put everything on lockdown so no one else can access systems or data. You can enable additional protection to do multiple tasks, such as remotely delete business data from lost, stolen, or former employees’ personal devices without touching their personal information. For another layer of security, strategic partners such as Dell offer data protection packages that encrypt each individual file so all information is protected no matter where it goes. In a small business, top-notch security can go a long way in saving unwanted costs and compliance fees down the line. Understand the importance of manageability Your business may be small today, but if growth is on the horizon, you may find yourself managing 50, 100 or even 1000 employees. Manually updating a few PCs may seem like a manageable task while your business is small, but will be a headache if it comes to manually updating hundreds of disparate devices. By choosing a Windows infrastructure for your business, you will enjoy the simplicity of keeping your devices up to date thanks to new Windows as a Service automatic updates and the ability to manage all devices remotely. Keeping manageability in mind early on will help you scale with ease. Recognise the benefits of good service As a small business, you may not have the luxury of your own IT department. This creates convenience, logistical, and potentially critical challenges due to lack of immediate in-person support. The importance of having reliable external service is crucial when it comes to deploying, managing and tending to workplace technology. When building a PC infrastructure, consider the service capabilities offered by their IT provider – alongside cost, offerings, reliability and reputation. Choose a reliable partner Choosing a reliable technology partner is a critical moment for a small business. Try to connect with organisations in the same or similar vertical/niche. This will allow you to learn from what they have found to be successful and enable you to make smarter PC provider decisions. Seeing how relevant companies deal with IT concerns, budget issues, and everyday challenges can drive your own decision-making and, ultimately, your success. Unlock productivity through both hardware and software You can maximise employee productivity through enhancements to the user experience, such as the addition of backlit keyboards, touch screens or 10 finger touch panels. These product features enable new, immersive ways for workers to interact with technology and can help them create and present in imaginative ways. When it comes to software, Windows 10 is designed to support productivity with new Microsoft apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote optimised for the new OS. In addition to Microsoft-developed applications, there is a broad range of apps on the Windows Store designed to improve productivity inside and outside the office, including Evernote, RemindMe, Trello, Splashtop Business and Poki to name a few.

They are not doing a paper launch, successor already discussed. (Photo : RedGamingTech/YouTube) AMD expects to return to its former glory with power users in the universe called the processor industry. They plan to do it with the release of its latest cutting edge tech, the AMD Ryzen processor, and it will be out by March. AMD says that Ryzen is the fruit of hard work in the past four years of development. This also happens to be the same time period AMD expects its upcoming Ryzen processor to become relevant. The processor developers expect something big of the AMD brand after four years starting from the launch of the AMD Ryzen in March. What is AMD's four-year plan like? This is proven at PCWorld's chat with Mark Papermaster, chief technology officer for AMD. Papermaster says that AMD was targeting for a four-year lifespan out of the AMD Ryzen. What AMD essentially wants is to release processors that will have huge impact on performance as compared to the last generation, as reported here. This is a different approach as what Intel is currently doing. Papermaster describes that their rival is doing a "tick-tock" release rhythm. Where "tick" is a mediocre release - using similar architecture from the previous one. "Tock" produces a big gap from the previous models such as a completely different architecture. AMD, on the other hand, plans to do a "tock, tock, tock" starting with the AMD Ryzen release. With concrete examples, a "tick" in Intel's pace can be represented by a 14nm Broadwell architecture since it is just a version of a 22nm Haswell. It became a "tock" when Skylake came along, bringing with it a new architecture built on the same 14nm process node. Simply put, the gap between Haswell and Skylake is much greater compared to the gap between Broadwell and Haswell. AMD Will Not be Doing a Paper Launch It is important to note also that Papermaster is not planning to release AMD Ryzen CPUs and make users wait for another 4 years to upgrade. AMD will most likely release newer CPUs annually but the plan is to have its improvements greater, not just minor improvements, ergo "tock, tock, tock". To realize the great plan, AMD Ryzen needs to live up to the hype to begin with. Jim Anderson, senior VP and general manager for AMD's Computing and Graphics division, says that they are not going to do a paper launch. Anderson also says that, they are not messing with it as they've done it before. AMD Ryzen Successor(s) Already in the Works? AMD Ryzen release date is scheduled for March 2017 and for enthusiasts, it is expected to have a motherboard ready for it when it comes out.

And the news that the Barbados Investment and Development Corporation (BIDC) will be divesting itself of some of its inventory of factory space helps to confirm this change. Related articles Call to help start-ups The new levy and enterprise EDITORIAL: Celebrate both ‘seasons’... Long gone are the big manufacturing companies that each employed hundreds on each shift. International brand names such as Intel, Tansitor and Playtex have all virtually disappeared from the minds of Barbadians, as have home-grown brands such as Barbados Children’s Wear, Tiny Tots and Cooper. We have come a long way since the late 1970s, ’80s and ’90s when at the end of each shift, hundreds of young Barbadian workers literally poured out of industrial estates at the Harbour, Wildey, Grazettes, Newton and Six Roads; when their presence provided sustenance for a large variety of small businesses that offered everything from food to transportation services. These estates are a shadow of their former selves. The Grazettes Industrial Estate looks so rundown, it could easily find a place in what Americans now refer to as their “rust belt”, while the complex at Newton too often resembles a ghost town. For the record, we don’t wish to appear to be minimising the important economic role played by businesses that still operate from these locations, especially since a number of them still generate a substantial amount of business. Their contribution is certainly valued, but the reality of today’s industrial estate versus that of the past can’t be denied. However, it is clear that revival of the Barbados economy and the hopes of many of our citizens have to be tied to a national approach that is far more encouraging of entrepreneurship and facilitating of business start-ups. And outside of Government and banking policies, as a people we need to be far more tolerant of individuals whose business attempts fail. According to Fortune Magazine, in the United States nine out of every ten start-up businesses fail; while the US Bureau of Labour Statistics states that only 50 per cent of all new businesses survive five years, and only about a third are still existing after ten. Yet in the US, the encouragement and facilitation of entrepreneurship remain strong – failure is not seen as an excuse for not trying again. The city of Tel Aviv in Israel is recognised worldwide as having created perhaps the best environment for start-up businesses anywhere. The “passport” it offers to persons contemplating a start-up business there states: “The city’s entrepreneurial spirit is the result of its audacious attitude, which encourages experimentation and easily forgives mistakes.” And that’s what we need to aim for in Barbados. If we are to find meaningful employment for the hoards of school-leavers each year, we cannot hope for a return to the Tansitors and Intels of the past. We have to be prepared to establish the kinds of regimes that encourage home-grown start-ups. Since the 1960s we have invested billions in our youth through our education system and the results have been astounding. We spend too much to produce so many bright, creative Barbadians to then leave them to a system that stifles their spirit. Our Ministry of Industry, International Business, Commerce and Small Business Development ought to be reconstituted to give new impetus to a new entrepreneurship path for the country. In fact, a recognition of the potential of entrepreneurship in a future Barbados might lead a forward-thinking Government to create a Ministry of Small Business that is properly staffed and financed for the role, with all the various facilitation units and finance windows rationalised and housed under a single umbrella. Fresh thinking in this area could make a major economic difference for Barbados, post recession. Print JOIN THE DISCUSSION Dos and Donts Welcome to our discussion forum here on nationnews.com.

Should Update the MacBook Pro Lineup in the Spring The Mac Maker should consider a mid-cycle update of its MacBook Pro computers to Intel's latest processors so as to avoid appearing to be at a competitive disadvantage to competing notebook computer vendors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 9, 2017 at 9:51PM In October, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally rolled out long-awaited and much-anticipated updates to its MacBook Pro family of notebook computers. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch variants saw significant overhauls, including new track pads, faster processors, brighter and more colorful displays, and even the inclusion of a new touch bar on higher end 13-inch and all 15-inch models. Image source: Apple.  The machines represented nice steps forward for the MacBook Pro lineup, which hadn't seen substantial updates for quite some time. Nevertheless, I believe that Apple would be wise to update the lineup to include new processors as soon as possible, perhaps in a refresh in the March/April time frame. Here's why. An easy update to the current lineup The current MacBook Pro systems use Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. Those chips first made their debut in the third quarter of 2015, but it took Apple a full year to adopt them in its systems. The new chips, which you can read more about here, essentially deliver greater speed and improved video playback capabilities. Those chips are also what is known as "pin compatible" with the prior generation sixth-generation Core processors, which means Apple wouldn't need to go and completely redesign its logic boards and systems to accommodate the new chips. How much of an upgrade would these chips be? The chips used in the current 13-inch MacBook Pro computers are the following, based on how much a customer is willing to pay: Core i5-6267U (2.9GHz base/3.3GHz single core turbo/3.1GHz dual core turbo) Core i5-6287U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.3GHz dual core turbo) Core i7-6567U (3.3GHz base/3.6GHz single core turbo/3.4GHz dual core turbo) The direct replacements for these chips from the seventh-generation Core processors are the following: Core i5-7267U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.5GHz dual core turbo) Core i5-7287U (3.3GHz base/3.7GHz single core turbo/3.7GHz dual core turbo) Core i7-7567U (3.5GHz base/4GHz single core turbo/3.9GHz dual core turbo) The performance gains generation-over-generation here are significant, ranging from 12% to 15% in dual-core turbo speeds. That's on top of whatever gains in graphics and media capabilities that come with these chips. Image source: Intel.  Why Apple should update the systems ASAP Although Apple does have the benefit of being the sole vendor of macOS-based computers, meaning that customers who want to buy computers that run macOS have no choice but to buy Apple's computers, there's little reason for the company to put itself at a competitive disadvantage relative to its Windows-based competitors. Apple's Macs are generally competitive, well-built devices, boasting best-in-class components in areas such as track-pads, displays, keyboards, wireless connectivity, and industrial design. However, I believe that Apple's MacBook product lines would be stronger if the company were quicker to adopt Intel's latest processors. Doing so might mean Apple pays a little bit more for processors (though I can't imagine the premium is significant), but a modest bill-of-materials increase is probably worth it, as the latest processors give Apple an additional marketing point and its competitors one less potential advantage.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the companies explained that the BMW 7 Series will employ Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials starting in the US and Europe. This news follows the partnership that was announced between the companies in July last year. The companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other carmakers to create differentiated brands. “We are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform,” says Klaus Fröhlich, member of the board of BMW for development. The vehicles have been tested in real traffic conditions and will form part of the next key step in the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be BMW’s first fully autonomous vehicle. As part of this partnership, the BMW Group will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety including setting up a high performance simulation engine, overall component integration, production of prototypes and eventually scaling the platform via deployment partners. Intel brings to the partnership high performance computing elements that span from the vehicle to the data centre. Within the car, the Intel GO solution offers a scalable platform for critical functions including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modeling, path planning and decision making. Mobileye contributes its EyeQ 5 high-performance computer vision processor offering automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The EyeQ 5 is responsible for processing and interpretation of input from the 360-degree surround view vision sensors as well as localisation. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop the sensor fusion solution, creating a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar, and lidar sensors. To propel the development of the autonomous platform, the partnership plans to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years. The BMW iNEXT model, which will be introduced in 2021, will be the foundation for BMW Group’s autonomous driving strategy.

In an interview with ABC News broadcast on January 8, Obama said he did not think he had underestimated Russian President Vladimir Putin. "But I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking, and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating," he added. "And so part of the reason that I ordered this report was not simply to relitigate what happened over the last several months, but rather to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies." The comments come after a U.S. intelligence report concluded that Putin "ordered" a campaign of hacking and media manipulation aimed at influencing the November 8 election. The report released on January 6 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the effort sought to help President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, by discrediting his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Russia's Embassy in London called the report a "a pathetic attempt at tainting Americans' vote by innuendo couched in Intel new-speak." The report's findings reinforced earlier assessments that hackers backed by Russia's government had intruded on computer servers of U.S. political parties. The report's release followed a briefing that Trump, who takes office on January 20, received from top intelligence officials on January 6. After the briefing, Trump issued a statement saying he had asked his staff to develop a plan in his first 90 days in office to "aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks." He also said he had "tremendous respect" for the work of the intelligence agencies. Trump has repeatedly dismissed claims that Moscow meddled in the election on his behalf, saying that those charges are the product of his political opponents trying to undermine his election victory. But Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News on January 8 that the president-elect "is not denying that entities in Russia" were behind a hacking campaign that targeted the Democratic National Committee and a top aide to Clinton. Another Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, rejected any notion Russia may have affected the election. "Any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed," she told CNN on January 8. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Trump to punish Russia for trying to interfere in the election. "He's going to be the defender of the free world here pretty soon," Graham, a frequent Trump critic, said in an interview with NBC broadcast on January 8. ''All I'm asking him is to acknowledge that Russia interfered, and push back. It could be Iran next time. It could be China." Trump repeated on January 7 past statements about wanting to work with Moscow. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad!" Trump wrote on Twitter. In the interview with ABC, Obama also said he had talked to his successor about having confidence in the intelligence community. "There are going to be times where the only way you can make a good decision is if you have confidence that the process is working," he said. Obama said he had also advised Trump not to attempt to run the White House "the way you would manage a family business." He said Trump must "respect" U.S. institutions and warned that there was a difference between governing and campaigning. "There are world capitals and financial markets and people all around the world who take really seriously what he says," the president said.

David Kretzmann (TMFPencils) Jan 9, 2017 at 4:17PM Friday was the third and final day of CES 2017 for us at The Motley Fool. We have been on the front lines talking to CEOs, engineers, and other industry experts to gain insights that investors can use to reap rewards over the long-term. We continued those explorations today -- featuring, among other things, a wrap-up keynote from Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) CEO Kevin Plank -- and didn't leave disappointed. The Internet of Things As expected, the Internet of Things (IoT) was on everyone's minds here at CES. Businesses are looking for ways to connect more devices to the internet in an effort to help people automate and enhance various daily tasks. Gartner estimates that the number of connected "things" will grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearly 21 billion by 2020. As investors, the exciting part is identifying which companies are likely to lead the pack in enabling the number of connected devices to more than triple over the next several years. One of the businesses supporting this growing wave of mobile connectivity is Skyworks Solutions. Another company blurring the lines between hardware and software to create a back-end technology platform for IoT is NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). NXP's platform powers the voice activation of a wide array of devices, including the Amazon Echo. Like other semiconductor businesses, NXP is also making inroads into developing the computers and sensors necessary for autonomous vehicles. In October, it was announced that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plans to acquire NXP for the cool sum of $39 billion. Qualcomm set the standards for mobile communication with 3G and 4G data speeds, and acquiring NXP would diversify Qualcomm into other areas like automotive, mobile payments (through NXP's near field communications, or NFC, technology), security, and more. Qualcomm made waves of its own at CES, particularly by sharing its vision for the next stage of mobile communication with 5G -- meaning far faster data speeds and much slower lag times (or latency) -- and what it means for the IoT. As reported by CNET: Think of it this way: If 3G ushered in the picture era and 4G was about video, 5G will be about tying our entire world together. What will we get? Live-streaming VR, autonomous cars that respond to real-time conditions, and connected cities where everything from the houses to the street lamps talk to each other. "5G will have an impact similar to the introduction of electricity or the automobile, affecting entire economies and benefiting entire societies," says Qualcomm CEO Stephen Mollenkopf. This shift toward 5G won't happen overnight -- the infrastructure still needs to be developed and put into place -- but large players like Qualcomm and Intel are both testing the waters with 5G technology starting later this year. In our conversation yesterday with Liam Griffin, CEO of Skyworks Solutions, he says he expects 5G solutions to make up 20% or more of the company's total revenue within the next three to five years. As more devices come online and cars increasingly become computers or robots with four wheels, the behind-the-scenes companies mentioned here are among the ones investors should watch closely to get a sense for how the IoT is taking shape. Bringing education online Innovation can happen in unexpected places, and when it does, we want to be ready as investors. The traditional model of higher education could be one of those spaces slated for some major changes in the coming years. I spoke with Chip Paucek, co-founder and CEO of 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), which partners with top universities to build quality online degree programs. When you think of online college education, says Paucek, most people think of University of Phoenix, not Yale. 2U, however, is working with top universities like UC Berkeley, UNC Chapel Hill, and yes, Yale, to bring their curriculums online. This means that students can still get a quality education from a reputable university without having to uproot their lives. It's an attractive proposition for universities: 2U provides funding to get the program going and the online platform itself, and universities can admit more students online than they would otherwise have in their classes. Paucek says the sleeping giants of higher education are awake, with more and more nonprofit schools coming online. UNC Chapel Hill's MBA program alone has over 1,000 students going through its courses via the web. 2U's model is attractive, because it aligns its success with both the universities and the students. The company signs a 10-year contract to share student tuition with the university, so 2U only succeeds if students successfully complete their online degrees. When students drop out, 2U takes a financial hit. When 2U went public three years ago, it was adding new programs at a pace of about four per year. Today, the company is on pace to add 10 new programs next year. Paucek says 2U investors should pay close attention to the new universities it brings into its portfolio, since that is the main growth catalyst for the company in the coming years. Innovation can happen in hidden places, and 2U is a prime example of a young company bringing an innovative new approach to a long-established industry. Under Armour Kevin Plank, founder and CEO of Under Armour, was greeted on Friday with high expectations for his keynote presentation. It might seem strange for what is supposedly an apparel and shoes company to be giving a keynote at a tech conference, but Plank made the case that Under Armour is -- and always has been -- a technology company. "We are not just a logo slapped on a shirt or shoe," says Plank. Plank is one of the most competitive business leaders in the world today, and he has his eyes set on Under Armour surpassing Nike as the leading athletic brand in the world. That's no small order: Nike generated $33.5 billion in revenue over the past four quarters, compared to $4.7 billion for Under Armour. Plank used a colorful metaphor to distinguish his competitive spirit. To create fire, says Plank, some people rub sticks and others hit rocks to try to create sparks. Plank says he lights a match and dumps 100 gallons of kerosene on it. One way Under Armour is working to change how apparel is designed and manufactured is through its local-to-local manufacturing initiative, where the company aims to manufacture apparel in the respective countries in which it is sold (Brazilian goods will be manufactured in Brazil, U.S. goods in the U.S., and so forth). Up until now, says Plank, apparel and shoes have been manufactured the same way for 80 or 100 years. Plank calls that "criminal". Under Armour's new 70,000 square foot Lighthouse -- an innovation and design lab of sorts based out of its Baltimore HQ -- is one of the company's early steps to shift to the local-to-local model. Under Armour has taken big steps into the connected fitness space over the past several years. The company collectively spent $710 million acquiring three different fitness and nutrition apps (MyFitnessPal, Endomondo, and MapMyFitness). Plank made it clear that Under Armour's platform will remain hardware agnostic, meaning the apps can be used on an Apple Watch, a FitBit, or any other device. Except in certain instances where hardware can be integrated into its apparel and shoes, Plank says Under Armour plans to stay out of the hardware game. What these three apps -- which collectively have more than 194 million registered users with nearly 100,000 new users joining each day -- do very well is collect massive amounts of data. Whether users are logging the meals they eat, runs they take, or other fitness and wellness preferences and habits, Under Armour is gaining direct insights into the behavior and preferences of its customers. Plank showed the crowd an example of "user heat maps" in four major worldwide cities, where Under Armour can segment out different users based on whether they are walking, running, or using a bicycle. More than anything else, Under Armour's push into connected fitness is a way for the company to gather more data and better understand the needs and habits of its users -- and hopefully sell more apparel and shoes as a result. Plank says Under Armour strives to solve problems that people never knew they had. One of these oft-overlooked problems, according to Under Armour, is getting ample time for rest, sleep, and recovery. Plank announced a new line of Under Armour connected fitness sneakers which are equipped with UA Record -- an app that brings together all of Under Armour's connected fitness tools. Not only do these shoes automatically track data for athletes, but coming in February, Under Armour is launching a new feature where athletes can go through tests with the shoes to determine how hard (or not) they can/should push their body for that workout. Olympian swimmer Michael Phelps joined Plank on stage to showcase this new feature and explained how this data is vital for helping athletes both rest and perform better. Plank then dug deeper into explaining the important role that sound sleep plays in maximizing performance, whether as an athlete or throughout life. Like exercise and sleep, explained Plank, sleep also needs a strategy. Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post and author of The Sleep Revolution, joined Plank to expand on an exciting new partnership with Under Armour. The company also connected with John Hopkins medical scientists to study and unlock the science of sleep, leading to a new product line of sleepwear (backed by Under Armour athlete Tom Brady) packed with technology that is supposed to lead to a better night's rest. It remains to be seen whether Under Armour's new PJs are indeed a product we didn't even know we needed or if this is a case of the company pushing its luck with its brand power. This move into sleepwear makes sense to me, because Under Armour is now able to capture a wide array of data on people's sleeping patterns and habits and should be able to see whether certain products help improve the quality of sleep and subsequent performance. In any case, this goes to show the power at Under Armour's fingertips as it looks to do to the connected fitness category what Facebook did for social, Amazon did for online retail, and LinkedIn did for job search. Data is a powerful tool, and Under Armour just might be getting the data it needs to maintain its impressive growth trajectory in the years to come. Foolish bottom line And with that, our time at CES 2017 is a wrap.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 9, 2017 at 5:37PM Earlier this month, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled a set of new microprocessors targeted at the personal-computer market known as the seventh-generation Core processor family. Image source: Intel.  These chips, as would be expected, deliver improved performance and power efficiency relative to the company's sixth-generation Core processor family. What is interesting about these chips is that they represent a third wave of products manufactured in the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, which was first used to build the company's fifth-generation Core processors. What allowed Intel to build better products, though, was that this wasn't the same 14-nanometer manufacturing technology that was used to build the fifth- and sixth-generation Core processors; it is a performance-enhanced version known as 14-nanometer+. At the recent J.P. Morgan Annual Tech Forum, Intel Client Computing Group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy talked about the company's strategy in regard to chip manufacturing technology -- at least as it applies to his business unit. There were some interesting bits of information here that I'd like to go over. Following the 14-nanometer playbook at 10-nanometer The analyst speaking with Shenoy asked the latter if the company had plans to do multiple iterations of its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology -- i.e., 10-nanometer and 10-nanometer+ -- as it did with its 14-nanometer technology. Now, of course, Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr revealed back in August that the company indeed has three variants of its 10-nanometer technology planned -- 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++ -- but Shenoy provided some additional business context around these plans in his answer. Image source: Intel.  "I think we're going to continually look at that," Shenoy said. "There's one thing that we learned in the process of getting 14-nanometer out is there is opportunity for us to continue to optimize the [manufacturing] process, maybe more so than we had historically." He then went on to say that such a strategy makes sense because "the most important thing is that we can deliver a predictable, annual cadence of new products." Shenoy further went on to explain that to deliver an annual cadence of competitive products, with an emphasis on the word "competitive" -- a company "can't just sit on the [manufacturing] process as it existed" and that the company needs to "continue to advance" the manufacturing processes that it uses to build its products. "If we can make optimizations on density or optimizations on performance or power, you're going to see us do that," Shenoy explained. Boasting superiority at 10-nanometers After explaining this strategy, Shenoy went on to say that the company is "very confident" that the company's manufacturing technology "continues to be the best in the world." Shenoy then went on to argue that the 10-nanometer technologies that its competitors Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) have recently put into production are "pretty close to what we had on [Intel's] 14-nanometer which [Intel] has been in production on for two years now." The executive didn't stop there, going on to say that he is confident that Intel's 10-nanometer technology comes out, Intel will have a "clear density advantage, and a clear performance and power advantage versus what others in the industry have." One more thing... It's worth pointing out that based on Shenoy's commentary, it looks increasingly likely that Intel's fourth wave of 14-nanometer products -- recently revealed to be called Coffee Lake -- will use a yet-again enhanced version of the company's 14-nanometer technology. Indeed, he made it quite clear that to build compelling new products, the company needs to make enhancements to the manufacturing technology to support its annual product rollouts. With 14-nanometer+, the company managed to get a 12% performance boost. It'll be interesting to see if the company can wring out another double-digit performance gain with the next iteration of its 14-nanometer technology. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Scott Gilbertson (US) - Jan 9, 2017 7:20 am UTC Enlarge Scott Gilbertson reader comments 123 Share this story Over the course of its four-year lifespan, Dell's extremely popular XPS 13 Developer Edition line has become known for one thing—bringing a "just works" Linux experience to the company's Ultrabooks. Of course, today Dell is just one of many manufacturers producing great Linux machines. System76 makes the Oryx Pro (still my top pick for anyone who needs massive power), and companies like Purism and ZaReason produce solid offerings that also work with Linux out of the box. Even hardware not explicitly made for Linux tends to work out of the box these days. I recently installed Fedora on a Sony Vaio and was shocked that the only problem I encountered was that the default trackpad configuration was terribly slow. Further ReadingSystem76 Oryx Pro review: Linux in a laptop has never been better Admittedly, the Vaio is a few years old, which means there has been time for hardware issues to be addressed. Getting Linux to run on bleeding edge hardware in 2017 remains tricky—or it requires running a bleeding edge distro like Arch. That's where efforts like Dell's Project Sputnik, led by developer Barton George, come in handy. With the XPS 13 Developers Edition, the hardware is already vetted. Drivers are pre-installed and configured for a great out-of-the-box experience. The latest Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, released in late 2016 and tested in the home office last month, is an exceptionally well-built, great-looking piece of hardware. Yet again, if you want your Linux rig to "just work," this is for you. But if you also want a powerful, svelte package that weighs under 3lbs, this is the XPS 13 you've been waiting for. Dell's most recent Linux laptop even features Intel's new Kaby Lake chip, which bumps the clock speed by about 10 percent. The more impressive side of the chipset upgrade is the graphics architecture, which is supposed to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video. Playback, especially 4K video, is incredibly smooth and not nearly as battery-draining as previous models. The specs Outwardly there's nothing new to see here. The 7th generation Dell XPS 13 DE uses the same wonderful InfinityEdge display that manages to pack a 13-inch screen into a body that looks and feels like an 11-inch laptop. The model I tested came with the 3200x1800 IPS touch panel. There's also a version with a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel, but I think the higher res display is worth the extra money. The new XPS 13 has simply the best-looking display I've seen in a laptop. Naturally the HiDPI model suffers a little in battery life compared to the lower res model. I've never used the lower res version, so I can't compare battery life times, but more pixels always takes more power. If battery life is your top priority, don't go with the HiDPI model. That said, I find the brightest setting (400 nit brightness) to be a bit much indoors. It's great for working outside and goes a long way to compensate for the inevitable glare on glossy screens. But I rarely push the brightness past 60 percent when I'm inside, which improves battery life considerably. The model Dell sent me featured an i7-7500U Kaby Lake chip with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid state drive. As configured, the whole enchilada would set you back £1,489. The lowest model—which has the 1920x1080 display, an i5 chip, 256GB SSD, and only 8GB of RAM—can be had for £1,069. For an extra £200, you can step up to the higher res screen. There's also a new option for what Dell calls a "Rose Gold" exterior. The laptop I tested had the same full aluminium exterior as previous models. Underneath it is an aluminium frame, which makes the XPS line feel solid even at its minimal weight. As has been my experience with most Dell machines, the construction is excellent. I used the previous model for over six months, shoving it in and out of my bag several times a day, every day. It doesn't have a scratch on it. I can see no reason to think the latest model would be any different. The ports remain unchanged on this version of the XPS 13 DE... You'll get: 2 x USB 3.0 (one with PowerShare), one Thunderbolt port that supports charging, 3-in-1 Card Reader, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. Sold separately: Ethernet and USB-A via the Dell Adapter. Also unchanged in this release are the ports and layout. There are still two USB 3.0 ports, one with PowerShare for charging your devices (note that USB charging generally requires a trip into the BIOS settings to enable; see Dell's support site for more info). There's also a Thunderbolt port that supports charging, a 3-in-1 card reader, DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. As with any laptop this thin, Ethernet requires an adapter (sold separately). Further ReadingXPS 13 Kaby Lake review: Dell’s Ultrabook hasn’t changed and that’s a problemThe 720p webcam is the same one that has been in the last couple of models, and it's still at the bottom of the lid. Yes, it still sucks that it's down there, although in fairness to Dell, there is nowhere else to put it. The InfinityEdge display comes within 3mm of the edge of the lid. Nevertheless, like fellow Ars reviewer Peter Bright, I find this decision irritating. Why not just move the display panel down by 3mm and put the camera at the top so it's usable? Or, why not stop pretending that the bottom camera is useful and just ditch the camera altogether? The palm rests are made of a carbon fibre composite that I found very comfortable. The keyboard also appears to be the same as previous models. It's a very thin chiclet-style keyboard that works just fine, although coming from the ThinkPad world I still find these keyboards disappointing. What's more disappointing for some Linux fans is the fact Dell still uses the Windows logo on the super key. The touchpad is reportedly the same, although using the testing model next to the previous edition I felt a noticeable difference with the newer model being somewhat "stickier." That doesn't sound good, but I found my movements were actually more precise with the new trackpad. This was particularly noticeable in Darktable, a photo editing app with some of the tiniest imaginable control elements. Usually that can be a real pain to adjust, especially on such a HiDPI screen like the one the XPS 13 uses. The problem I experienced previously, where the trackpad would unaccountably freeze at times, appears to have been related to something in Ubuntu 14.04, because the new XPS, which comes with Ubuntu 16.04, did nothing of the sort. Another common complaint about the XPS 13 is a high-pitched coil whine that plagues some models, according to some Reddit threads. In the three models I've used, I've never encountered this issue. It's possible that the whine comes from something related to Windows drivers (some people report fixing the problem by reinstalling drivers), although I have seen reports of the whine being present on the Ubuntu-based models as well.

Since the Z270 chipset doesn't offer a whole lot other than some extra PCI-E lanes and Intel Optane support, motherboard vendors have had to pull out all the tricks to offer people a reason to upgrade.     The Z270 Gaming M7 departs from MSI's traditional red and black design and gravitates towards a much more color neutral black design, allowing users to customize the onboard RGB LEDs to choose their motherboard's color and set the stage for matching accessories.   The motherboard also adds better fan control, upgrades audio and USB controllers, adds extra M.2 with a shield, and even a USB 3.1 internal header.   Let's take a look at what MSI has to offer with the Z270 Gaming M7.     Specifications     The Z270 GAMING M7 has three M.2 ports, U.2, USB 3.1 at the rear and internally, SATA6Gb/s, and a slew of OC features. MSI has gone ahead and shown us exactly what the differences are between the Z170 and Z270 Gaming M7s.     Pricing   The Z270 GAMING M7 price is $249.99.

Specifically, Ayatollah Hossain Boroujerdi, recently released from prison after a decade behind bars. Boroujerdi “is one of those dissidents who are so beloved by the Iranian people that the murderous regime of Ali Khamenei does not dare to put them to death or even on trial.” He has “repeatedly criticized the fundamentalist doctrines of the Iranian theocratic state, and has dramatically spoken about the most explosive issues in the Muslim world, including anti-Semitism.” Inviting him to the inauguration would “deliver a stunning message to the Islamic world” and “show that we understand that there are freedom-loving Muslims.” Far East expert: Trump Tweets, China Retreats Chinese leaders “have been remarkably quiet” since the election, despite Donald Trump signaling that “his administration will pursue policies fundamentally disadvantageous” to Beijing, notes Gordon Chang at The National Interest. Some suspect they’re “merely lying in wait, but there are signs they have themselves been ambushed and still do not know how to react to Trump.” His two immediate predecessors “pursuing misguided approaches, tried to minimize” China’s initial provocations. But Trump, by publicly taking a call from Taiwan’s president, “turned the tables on Beijing, striking the Chinese even before the swearing-in.” As a result, he’s “unnerving overly confident Chinese officials.” The Chinese “have just met someone impossible for them to intimidate.” From the right: That Intel Report’s Missing Word An important word is missing from the joint intelligence report on Russia’s alleged election-based cyberattacks, notes Andrew McCarthy at National Review: “Podesta.” And the failure to even mention Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief, John Podesta, whose e-mails were hacked, is “significant . . . in light of the intelligence community’s recent history of politicizing its analyses.” Because “influencing elections” usually means disinformation, not publicizing “true but embarrassing information.” And the report “pointedly declines to tell us what specific information gives them such ‘high confidence’ ” Vladimir Putin was behind it. In fact, it “concludes that while Putin appears to have been rooting for Trump,” Moscow “assumed Clinton was going to win” and was “mainly trying to undermine . . . her anticipated presidency, not swing the election to Trump.” Crime expert: Black Lives Matter and the Torture Tape Heather Mac Donald at City Journal disagrees with those “incensed at the suggestion that the Black Lives Matter movement could have influenced the behavior of the four individuals in Chicago who tortured a disabled white man for hours.” In fact, she says, the blame lies with “the reign of racial victimology, inner-city gang culture and black anti-white animus.” Because “we live in Ta-Nehesi Coates’s America, characterized by the assumption that blacks are the eternal targets of lethal white oppression.” And Black Lives Matter is “just a more in-your-face manifestation” of this concept. She says “the establishment typically looks the other way at manifestations of black anti-white animus.” But “the violence in the Chicago torture video does not arise in a vacuum.” Conservative take: Sensible Plea for Immigration Limits People who want less immigration — 38 percent in a recent Gallup Poll, versus 21 percent who want more — traditionally “have been underrepresented in the US Congress,” argyes Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg View. Now Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) appears to be succeeding Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions “as the Senate’s foremost immigration restrictionist.” Yes, he overstates his case, but “he’s probably right” when he says that “low-skilled immigration puts downward pressure on wages at the bottom of the labor market and that reducing it would relieve that pressure.” It would “help low-wage workers and promote assimilation and social cohesion.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under black lives matter ,  china ,  donald trump ,  editorial ,  hacking ,  immigration ,  intelligence ,  iran ,  russia Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Remembering quintessential New Yorker Nat Hentoff Read Next Remembering quintessential New Yorker Nat Hentoff Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure Share Selection Columnists George F.

Here's what I remember from being there that day. Phones by Connie Guglielmo January 9, 2017 9:00 AM PST @techledes Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS We all knew it was coming. Reporters, analysts and industry insiders had been speculating about Apple making a phone for nearly a year by the time Steve Jobs walked onto the Macworld Expo stage that cold January morning in San Francisco. "Thank you for coming," he said, wearing his trademark Levi's and black mock turtleneck. "We're going to make some history together today." Apple's Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone on Jan. 9, 2007, calling it a "revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone."Photo by Apple Despite the months-long buildup, Apple's CEO managed to surprise the world when he finally unveiled the iPhone -- the company's big, risky move into the mobile phone market. "This is a day I've been looking forward to for two-and-a-half years," he told the audience of 4,000 people. "Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything ... One is very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career. Apple's been very fortunate. It's been able to introduce a few of these into the world. Apple's influence Apple's iPhone turns 10. Where does it go from here? 10 ways the iPhone changed everything Does the Mac still matter? "In 1984, we introduced the Macintosh. It didn't just change Apple. It changed the whole computer industry. "In 2001, we introduced the first iPod and it didn't just change the way we listened to music. It changed the entire music industry. Well today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class. "The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls," Jobs said to whoops and cheers while I -- sitting on the floor near one of the rare power outlets in the hall -- furiously sent out Jobs' remarks in 83-character, all cap headlines for Bloomberg News, where I worked as the Apple reporter. "The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device. So three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device. "An iPod, a phone and an Internet communicator. An iPod, a phone -- are you getting it?" he asked the audience. "These are not separate devices. This is one device. And we are calling it iPhone. "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone ... We want to make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super easy to use." Ten years later, we know Jobs was right. Apple did make history on Jan. 9, 2007, when it unveiled one of the most iconic products in consumer electronics history. It's since become the phone of choice for hundreds of millions of people around the world. It redrew mobile phone design and changed the entire phone industry. And it pretty much led to the end of standalone music players, GPS receivers and low-end to midrange digital cameras. 18 The iPhone and the gadgets it laid to rest Master showman People always lined up for days outside San Francisco's Moscone Center to make sure they'd get a seat for the Macworld keynote. And while they camped out on Howard Street, they'd see the press, analysts and other VIPs escorted into Moscone West, where we waited on the top floor of the conference center. Back then, Apple didn't open the doors to the hall until 10 minutes before the event started, guaranteeing a frenzied horde of people scrambling for prime spots. By my guess, it takes just two minutes for 4,000 people to run into a conference hall and grab a seat. Let's just say Jobs already had a pretty receptive audience. And he certainly knew how to play a room. A master showman, Jobs kept the crowd of reporters, analysts, developers and Apple fans in a state of anticipation and wonder throughout the nearly two-hour keynote. He talked first about the move to Intel chips in Macs the year before, saying Mac sales proved the change over to the new architecture was a success. And he welcomed the loads of "switchers," who'd jettisoned Windows-based PCs for Macs. He touted the iPod, introduced more than five years earlier, calling it the world's most popular music player and the world's most popular video player. He got huge laughs from the crowd after cracking a joke about the mediocre launch of Microsoft's rival Zune player two months before. He played the latest iPod TV ad featuring neon-colored silhouettes of dancers rocking out to "Flathead," by indie Glasgow band The Fratellis. Oh, and he officially introduced Apple TV. And all the while I sat on the floor and typed out a steady stream of short, all-cap headlines -- a kind of primeval Twitter story. By the time Jobs reached the crux of his presentation, my headline only needed 19 characters: "Apple unveils phone." He'd been on stage for 20 minutes. The stock chart for Apple looked like a hockey stick just seconds after the news was out. Aha moment Apple's always been a magnet for speculation. Almost a year before Jobs stepped on that stage, rumors started flying that Apple was planning to enter the crowded mobile phone market with a cool new device. Talk turned from "if" to "when" in July 2006, after Peter Oppenheimer, then chief financial officer of Apple, pretty much confirmed the effort during in an earnings call with financial analysts. "We are very confident in our ability to compete in the marketplace, and we are very excited about what we have in the product pipeline," Oppenheimer said when asked how the company planned to compete against Sony and other rivals. "As regards cell phones, we do not think that the phones that are available today make the best music players. We think the iPod is. But over time, that is likely to change, and we are not sitting around doing nothing." That was an aha moment for financial types, especially since Apple doesn't make off-the-cuff comments about anything it's working on. The aha turned into "coming soon" three months later when news broke that Apple had filed a trademark application for iPhone. (Fun fact: Cisco owned the rights to the iPhone name when Apple launched the phone, but let Jobs have the trademark after reaching a legal settlement a few weeks later.) The iPhone: 2007, meet 2017 It was different, it was bold. How is it now? Ten years later, we dug up the original iPhone to give it another spin. by Scott Stein 2:24 Close Drag Bold promises It's hard for many to remember now, but back then few people could imagine how the iPhone's 3.5-inch touchscreen display and sleek design would upend a market that Nokia and BlackBerry ruled. BlackBerry's maker, then known as Research In Motion, later admitted it had underestimated the iPhone -- dissing it for its eight-hour battery life and because the phone ran only on AT&T's older, slower, second-generation wireless network. "By all rights, the product should have failed," David Yach, RIM's chief technology officer, told the Wall Street Journal in May 2015. I remember the iPhone was a big deal because it was such a big risk for Apple. Up until that day, Apple Computer Inc. was known for its Macs and the iPod. Jobs knew he was staking Apple's future on getting an even bigger slice of the consumer electronics market. He reinforced that idea when he announced at the end of his keynote that the company was dropping "Computer" from its name and would just be called Apple Inc. And he promised that the iPhone, which he called a "revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone," would be a success if Apple could capture even 1 percent market share of the mobile market in 2008. That would mean selling 10 million iPhones. The crowd went wild. A financial analyst told me the iPhone, with its widescreen, full Safari web browser, visual voicemail and the music, photo and video features courtesy of the iPod, was a "complete stunner." Another told me the 10 million sales figure for 2008 "sounds low." Apple beat that 10 million goal by September 2008 - three months ahead of schedule. In July 2016, Apple announced it had sold 1 billion phones since the phone's launch. "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started," Apple CEO Tim Cook said Sunday in a message commemorating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. "The best is yet to come." The right touch Here's what else I remember about the presentation that day. • Jobs saying "Boy, have we patented it" when he talked about the iPhone's design and its multitouch technology. He reveled in showing off how easy the phone was to use, calling out the single home button at the bottom of the glass screen. • Jobs making the first public call to Apple's chief designer, Jony Ive, who was sitting in the audience. Jobs asked Ive what he thought of the moment. Ive's reply: "It's not too shabby." • The laughter as Jobs called a local Starbucks, saying "I'd like to order 4,000 lattes to go, please. No, just kidding. Wrong number." • The disappointment when Apple didn't give developers a way to build native apps for the iPhone. (Jobs later changed his mind and decided to open that kind of access to developers, instead of just running web-based apps on the phone. Apple introduced the App Store in July 2008.) In the years since that launch, I've written a lot stories about the new models, about whether Apple can keep churning out designs that make us want to upgrade, and about how the phone changed Apple's partners, including Corning and AT&T. And so I'll share one of my favorite anecdotes, which comes from Marc Andreessen, who pioneered web browsing with Mosaic and Netscape and who is now one of the top venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. "In the fall of 2006, my wife, Laura, and I went out to dinner with Steve and his brilliant and lovely wife, Laurene," Andreessen told me in 2012. "Sitting outside of the restaurant on California Avenue in Palo Alto waiting for a table to open up, on a balmy Silicon Valley evening, Steve pulled his personal prototype iPhone out of his jeans pocket and said, 'Here, let me show you something.' He took me on a tour through all of the features and capabilities of the new device. "After an appropriate amount of oohing and aahing, I ventured a comment. BlackBerry aficionado as I was, I said, 'Boy, Steve, don't you think it's going to be a problem not having a physical keyboard? Are people really going to be OK typing directly on the screen?' "He looked me right in the eye with that piercing gaze and said, 'They'll get used to it.'" And so we all did.

All the denim Vered buys for his brand, YMI Jeans, comes from Chinese factories, which have come to dominate the industry because of China’s abundance of affordable labor, capital and lax environmental laws. Those same conditions help make China the world’s top producer of all manner of manufactured goods such as cellphones, furniture,and rubber boots . It’s difficult for foreign companies to source supplies from anywhere else and stay competitive. “It would be disastrous,” Vered, who remains a Donald Trump supporter, said of a trade war. “China is the whole production line. It would be very, very difficult for us.” Across California, companies reliant on Chinese factories and suppliers are mulling over what it means if the incoming Trump administration makes good on threats to slap new tariffs on Chinese goods. The president-elect and his surrogates have floated the idea of import taxes as high as 45 percent and as low as 5 percent to punish China for undervaluing its currency — a charge many economists say is outdated. Should the trade relationship with China sour, no state would feel the disruption more than California. About $143.6 billion in goods from China were shipped to the Golden State in 2015, according to the latest full-year census data. That’s three-and-half times more than second-place Texas. Meanwhile, the threat of retaliation from China looms large for state exporters. California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 — second only to Washington state’s $19.4 billion. The high trade volume helps keep more than 30,000 workers employed at the Port of Los Angeles, where 6 of every 10 containers arrive from China. And the raw materials and finished products that pour in ensure that California companies such as Apple and Intel remain among the most profitable brands in the world. “California has more to lose because we are the gateway to the U.S.” for Asian exporters, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. “This is where the infrastructure, connections and merchants are.” The state also boasts the nation’s largest manufacturing base, employing about 10 percent of all U.S. factory workers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Most of those jobs are in high-value sectors like computers, chemicals and aerospace — industries that can more easily absorb California’s higher wages, expensive real estate and stricter regulations than producers of, say, garments or toys. Still, many companies that choose to manufacture in California rely on components and raw materials from China. All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington once Trump assumes the White House. Trump, who nearly threw the “one China” policy into disarray last month, during the presidential campaign ran as a champion of displaced working-class Americans who believe they’ve been marginalized by globalization and Chinese mercantilist policies. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. and slash America’s trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. One of Trump’s long-stated solutions for lost jobs and China has been to impose tariffs, much like President Reagan did with Japanese cars (a move that helped U.S. automakers but raised prices for American consumers). “I’m totally open to a tariff if they don’t treat us fairly,” Trump said during a GOP primary debate last year. “Their whole trade thing is tariff. You can’t deal in China without tariff. They do it to us; we don’t do it. It’s not fair trade.” Trump has kept the pressure on since being elected, mostly over Twitter, where he’s fired hundreds of barbs at China over the years. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump tweeted last week. The next day, Trump picked Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. trade representative. The lawyer and former trade official during the Reagan presidency has spent years arguing for tariffs on foreign goods. He joins a host of aides and appointees to the incoming administration, such as University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, who favor a decidedly confrontational approach to Beijing. California “gets an advantage by simply facilitating the flow of illegally subsidized goods into the country,” Navarro, who was tapped to head the newly created National Trade Council and wrote a book called Death by China, told the Los Angeles Times last year. “We are unique in that we are the gateway for the disease, and people make money off of that.” It remains unclear how much blame to assign China for the loss of American factory jobs, which peaked at 19 million in 1979 before falling to about 12 million today. A study by Ball State University’s Center for Business and Economic Research in 2015 found that 88 percent of lost manufacturing jobs were due to efficiencies such as automation and robots. It’s also debatable what, exactly, a trade deficit says about a nation’s economy. Some economists note that the U.S. economy thrives when it runs a trade imbalance. “The challenge isn’t about how to get jobs back, but how to prepare jobs for the future,” said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management. “The story of the U.S. economy has always been about creative destruction,” he said, referring to the capitalistic theory that new production methods always replace old ones. “The question is how to facilitate that in a way that’s humane and productive.” Moreover, many economists say the merits of using tariffs are overstated. They say a tax on imports could blunt some Chinese exports, but would also make consumer goods in the U.S. more expensive — a shift that would disproportionately hurt the working class. In 2009, President Barack Obama slapped a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. The move saved up to 1,200 U.S. jobs, but it also resulted in Americans paying an additional $1.1 billion on more expensive tires, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It’s also no guarantee that tariffs on Chinese goods would result in more U.S. manufacturing activity — not when developing nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico have spent years building a case as viable alternatives to China for production. “Tariffs on imports from China will not serve as a magic wand that brings back lost jobs,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who formerly headed the International Monetary Fund’s China division. “Rather, such tariffs could end up inflicting collateral damage on U.S. businesses and hurting job growth in companies that have built international supply chains.” Among the biggest sectors to have done this is the tech industry, which relies on countries across Asia to build its hardware. Apple can afford to build its high-end desktop computers in the U.S. because they are an expensive, niche product. But the equation changes when it comes to the iPhone, which accounts for about 60 percent of the company’s sales. Making the device in the U.S. requires access to tens of thousands of vocation school-trained workers at a single plant. In addition to higher labor expenses, Apple would have to pay for the added costs of importing parts across the Pacific such as processors from South Korea, cameras from Japan and rare-earth minerals from China. Building that supply chain from scratch could take years. The same problem applies to smaller companies and products that aren’t as high-tech. Bruce Gifford, chief executive of the Santa Monica, Calif.- and New York-based 360 Sweater, said it would be impossible to produce in the U.S. the sweaters he sells at stores including Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. “We don’t have the knitting equipment here,” said Gifford, who employs about 40 people. “For the most part, there’s no sweater production left in the U.S. anymore because there’s no sweater machines or ancillary products like the right washing machines, driers, presses or yarn suppliers.” The company would have little recourse other than to pass the higher costs onto consumers if Chinese imports were slapped with a new tariff. Almost all the world’s cashmere comes from China’s arid northern and western frontier provinces where cashmere wool goats thrive. Ultimately, Gifford hopes Trump’s tough talk on China is nothing more than residual campaign rhetoric. “I just can’t imagine the tariffs are anything more than a threat,” he said. “It’s to put China on notice.” Filed under: China, Export, Import, Tax Print Email Gmail Related U.S., EU Negotiators Propose to Eliminate Most Trade Tariffs As Prices of Raw Materials Drop, China October Imports Fall China’s February Imports Sink in New Sign of Weakness IN DEPTH: How Trump Plans to Punish Firms That Leave U.S. Vietnam Trade Deal Sparks A Running Battle On Shoe Tariffs More in Business Business Briefs – January 16, 2017 Wells Fargo Quarterly Earnings Fall in Wake of Bogus-Accounts Scandal Lockheed CEO Tells Trump Company Will Add 1,800 F-35 Jobs in Fort Worth Tax Filers Claiming Earned Income Tax Credit to Face Refund Delay This Year AUTO REVIEW: 2017 Genesis G90 Flagship Sedan Carves Out a Spot for Modest Luxury OP-ED Obamacare Repeal and Replacement: The Case for Moving Quickly A Last-Minute, Ill-Conceived Gambit A ‘Good Relationship’ With Russia Shouldn’t Be Trump’s Priority Don’t Defund the U.N. — Find Other Ways to Help Israel The Zeal to Repeal When Words Sprout Wings P.M.

And one of the most notable was the HP EliteBook x360: the world's thinnest 13-inch convertible laptop. Now that's particularly relevant, given that Dell also just announced its XPS 13 2-in-1 model. Which, so we thought at first sight, was the convertible king of the show. But HP doesn't half give it a run for its money. It's not quite as small, but it's stunning to look at - something we rarely say of laptops. CES 2017: The greatest laptops of the show HP has been through something of a renaissance of late, focusing on class-leading style. Just look at the new sharp logo (like, literally, it looks like you could prick a finger on that thing). Ok, so it might date badly in the coming years, but right now it's Bladerunner cool in our eyes. Pocket-lint The HP EliteBook x360's sub-15mm slimness obviously defines its style - but without compromising on its power potential. Just like its Dell 2-in-1 rival the latest Intel 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors are on offer, along with hefty amounts of RAM and storage. Specs are, in a sense, by the by though. The reason to give the HP a look is for a variety of other reasons: its obvious good looks (as we've pointed out); that it's designed to pass MIL-STD4 (a US military standard, so it's basically a hard bastard); and, for business types, comes fully equipped with a suite of security software. On the ports front, the EliteBook x360 offers both current and future standards. Given that slender frame we're pleased as punch that it's managed to squeeze in two full-size USB 3.0 ports, plus one smaller Type-C, an HDMI and microSD slot. There's even a SIM slot for 4G LTE use when on the go. Pocket-lint The screen doesn't have bezel quite as trim as its Dell competitor, but with resolution up to 4K Ultra-HD it's not missing a trick here. There's also a rather excellent "Privacy Mode" at the press of a button, which limits view from adjacent angles so neighbouring flight/train/public transport users can't see what you're doing. It's highly effective. It's thin with all the win. As convertible laptops go, this business-personal crossover has everything we could want... well, except for a full-size SD card slot. But we have to find something negative to say. And that's all we can muster.

"State and local autonomy over elections is our greatest asset against malicious cyberattacks and manipulation," the release stated. "Our decentralized, low [internet] connectivity electoral process is inherently designed to withstand such threats." Late on Friday, US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson decreed the state-run election systems as "critical infrastructure." © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite The Enigma of US Intel or How RT "Meddled in US Elections"Monday’s release called the designation "legally and historically unprecedented, raising many questions and concerns for states and localities with authority over the administration of our voting process." Johnson’s decision was apparently prompted by earlier warnings from the Obama administration that Russian hackers could attempt to alter vote tallies to favor President-elect Donald Trump during the November 8 election. Since the election, the US Democratic Party has attempted to blame the unexpected loss by its presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Russian hackers. An intelligence report on Friday blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for orchestrating a cyber campaign to support President-elect Donald Trump — a charge that the Kremlin has consistently denied. © Sputnik/ Pavel Lisitsyn US Intel Says 'Russian Hacking' Retaliation for Panama Papers, Doping ScandalsMonday’s release noted that no credible evidence of hacking, including attempted hacking of voting machines or vote counting by any third party, was ever presented or discovered in any US state. Moreover, state and local autonomy over elections is the greatest asset against malicious cyberattacks and manipulation because voting systems are not connected to the internet, the release explained. Throughout the history of the United States, individual states have been responsible for voting and ballot tallies in national elections. The release’s description of Johnson’s action as unprecedented implied fears that some officials in Washington want to take control of elections away from individual states.

The devices were built in collaboration with Google, but it didn’t receive a lot of fanfare at CES. This is the first Chromebook built from the ground up with Android apps in mind, plus it comes with a stylus. The Chromebook Pro and Plus are identical except for one thing: processor. The Pro is equipped with an Intel Core M3 processor, while the Plus has an ARM chip. They have a 12.5-inch 2400×1600 LED display, 4GB of RAM, two USB Type-C ports, MicroSD card slot, up to 8 hours of battery life, and 32GB of storage. Basically, every spec you could need in a Chromebook. Where this Chromebook really shines is the display and stylus. The display can be rotated 360-degrees, which allows you to take advantage of the touchscreen in tablet mode. A laptop with a touchscreen isn’t exactly unique these days, but Samsung has also included a stylus. It can be used to take screenshots, jot down notes, or even as a faux laser pointer. It looks just like the stylus you would see in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (before it caught on fire). The stylus really comes in handy when you’re using Android apps, which can be downloaded directly from the Play Store. Google even says the stylus is more responsive than the Microsoft Surface Pen. That’s obviously where Samsung and Google are going with these Chromebooks. The Surface Pro has slowly become a big hit, and people love the iPad Pro as well. Portable productivity devices are big right now. With Android tablets all but dead, Chromebooks can fill the void. The Chromebook Plus (ARM processor) will be available next month for $449. No word on release date or pricing for the Pro (Intel) model. We expect it to be somewhere around $550, which is still much cheaper than comparable devices from Apple and Microsoft. Are you interested in the Pro or Plus? Our CES 2017 coverage is brought to you by the Honor 6X (buy it here)! It offers rock solid performance, exceptional battery life with a 3340 mAh battery, and takes amazing pics with cutting-edge dual-lens rear camera, and best of all- it's affordable.

Discogs, the online vinyl and CD marketplace now in its 17th year, is today celebrating a major milestone: the site will log its eight millionth release. The benchmark was achieved with help from more than 326,000 contributors who contributed to compiling a massive database filled with release information, artists, images and more.   "We hit 5 million releases in 2015," said Ronald Rich Jr., the company's marketing director, in a statement. "It's crazy to think we’ve more than halved the distance to hitting 10 million in just 2 years. As the community’s collection grows so does the database." Discog's most popular format is vinyl, which accounts for more than 80 percent of its sales even while cassettes this year have had a marked resurgence, growing 42 percent to more than 60,000 units. According to the most recent music sales figures for the larger market in the first half of 2016, vinyl sales jumped 11.4 percent to 6.2 million. Discogs was founded by then-Intel programmer Kevin Lewandowski in 2000, who started it as a hobby to catalog his collection of electronic albums for which he cross-linked artists, releases and labels on a Pentium II server in his closet. The site slowly became a user-generated, wiki-like database. The platform experimented with ad revenue, paid subscription and membership models before 2007 when the site added a marketplace feature where users could buy and sell vinyl and and which led to something of a windfall. Today Discogs has a staff of 50 and offices in Beaverton, Ore. and Amsterdam and expects its 2016 revenue to break the $100 million sales threshold. Its business model is similar to eBay or Amazon with the site taking 8 percent of sales which would mean $8 million in revenues last year. With a database many independent retailers find indispensable, Discog's now claims 3 million users (although not all are active) and nearly 15,000 new users per week. The site gets some nearly 400,000 orders a month which would put it on pace for 4.8 million orders for 2016. In October the growing concern acquired the Crate Diggers franchise, a live event where Discogs users and others can interface in real time and revel to various DJs and performers while purchasing vinyl. "It’s really thanks to the passion of our users that we have been able to catalog the world’s music," says Rich. "The real thanks belongs to all the contributors out there that help give people access to music across the planet.” Read more on the Discogs news here.

All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington after Donald Trump assumes the White House. He has promised to bring jobs back the U.S. and slash America's trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. (The Associated Press) Print Email Los Angeles Times By Los Angeles Times The Oregonian on January 09, 2017 at 7:37 AM, updated January 09, 2017 at 7:53 AM comments California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 -- second only to Washington state's $19.4 billion. LOS ANGELES -- With each provocative tweet aimed at China from the president-elect, David Vered worries about a trade war that would hurt profits at his Los Angeles jeans company. All the denim Vered buys for his brand, YMI Jeans, comes from Chinese factories, which have come to dominate the industry because of China's abundance of affordable labor, capital and lax environmental laws. Those same conditions help make China the world's top producer of all manner of manufactured goods such as cellphones, furniture, rubber boots and even Christmas lights. It's difficult for foreign companies to source supplies from anywhere else and stay competitive. "It would be disastrous," Vered, who remains a Donald Trump supporter, said of a trade war. "China is the whole production line. It would be very, very difficult for us." Across California, companies reliant on Chinese factories and suppliers are mulling over what it means if the incoming Trump administration makes good on threats to slap new tariffs on Chinese goods. The president-elect and his surrogates have floated the idea of import taxes as high as 45 percent and as low as 5 percent to punish China for undervaluing its currency -- a charge many economists say is outdated. Should the trade relationship with China sour, no state would feel the disruption more than California. About $143.6 billion in goods from China were shipped to the Golden State in 2015, according to the latest full-year census data. That's three-and-half times more than second-place Texas. Meanwhile, the threat of retaliation from China looms large for state exporters. California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 -- second only to Washington state's $19.4 billion. The high trade volume helps keep more than 30,000 workers employed at the Port of Los Angeles, where 6 of every 10 containers arrive from China. And the raw materials and finished products that pour in ensure California companies such as Apple and Intel remain among the most profitable brands in the world. "California has more to lose because we are the gateway to the U.S." for Asian exporters, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. "This is where the infrastructure, connections and merchants are." The state also boasts the nation's largest manufacturing base, employing about 10 percent of all U.S. factory workers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Most of those jobs are in high-value sectors like computers, chemicals and aerospace -- industries that can more easily absorb California's higher wages, expensive real estate and stricter regulations than producers of, say, garments or toys. Still, many companies that choose to manufacture in California rely on components and raw materials from China. What Donald Trump's trade policies could mean for Oregon All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington once Trump assumes the White House. Trump, who nearly threw the "one China" policy into disarray last month, during the presidential campaign ran as a champion of displaced working-class Americans who believe they've been marginalized by globalization and Chinese mercantilist policies. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. and slash America's trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. One of Trump's long-stated solutions for lost jobs and China has been to impose tariffs, much like President Reagan did with Japanese cars (a move that helped U.S. automakers but raised prices for American consumers). "I'm totally open to a tariff if they don't treat us fairly," Trump said during a GOP primary debate last year. "Their whole trade thing is tariff. You can't deal in China without tariff. They do it to us, we don't do it. It's not fair trade." Trump has kept the pressure on since being elected, mostly over Twitter, where he's fired hundreds of barbs at China over the years. "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" Trump tweeted last week. The next day, Trump picked Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. trade representative. The lawyer and former trade official during the Reagan presidency has spent years arguing for tariffs on foreign goods. He joins a host of aides and appointees to the incoming administration, such as University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, who favor a decidedly confrontational approach to Beijing. California "gets an advantage by simply facilitating the flow of illegally subsidized goods into the country," Navarro, who was tapped to head the newly created National Trade Council and wrote a book called "Death By China," told the Los Angeles Times last year. "We are unique in that we are the gateway for the disease, and people make money off of that." It remains unclear how much blame to assign China for the loss of American factory jobs, which peaked at 19 million in 1979 before falling to about 12 million today. A study by Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research in 2015 found that 88 percent of lost manufacturing jobs were due to efficiencies such as automation and robots. It's also debatable what, exactly, a trade deficit says about a nation's economy. Some economists note that the U.S. economy thrives when it runs a trade imbalance. "The challenge isn't about how to get jobs back, but how to prepare jobs for the future," said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management. "The story of the U.S. economy has always been about creative destruction," he said, referring to the capitalistic theory that new production methods always replace old ones. "The question is how to facilitate that in a way that's humane and productive." Moreover, many economists say the merits of using tariffs are overstated. They say a tax on imports could blunt some Chinese exports, but would also make consumer goods in the U.S. more expensive -- a shift that would disproportionately hurt the working class. In 2009, President Barack Obama slapped a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. The move saved up to 1,200 U.S. jobs, but it also resulted in Americans paying an additional $1.1 billion on more expensive tires, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It's also no guarantee that tariffs on Chinese goods would result in more U.S. manufacturing activity -- not when developing nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico have spent years building a case as viable alternatives to China for production. "Tariffs on imports from China will not serve as a magic wand that brings back lost jobs," said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who formerly headed the International Monetary Fund's China division. "Rather, such tariffs could end up inflicting collateral damage on U.S. businesses and hurting job growth in companies that have built international supply chains." Among the biggest sectors to have done this is the tech industry, which relies on countries across Asia to build its hardware. Apple can afford to build its high-end desktop computers in the U.S. because they are an expensive, niche product. But the equation changes when it comes to the iPhone, which accounts for about 60 percent of the company's sales. Making the device in the U.S. requires access to tens of thousands of vocation school-trained workers at a single plant. In addition to higher labor expenses, Apple would have to pay for the added costs of importing parts across the Pacific such as processors from South Korea, cameras from Japan and rare-earth minerals from China. Building that supply chain from scratch could take years. The same problem applies to smaller companies and products that aren't as high-tech. Bruce Gifford, chief executive of the Santa Monica, Calif.- and New York-based 360 Sweater, said it would be impossible to produce in the U.S. the sweaters he sells at stores including Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. "We don't have the knitting equipment here," said Gifford, who employs about 40 people. "For the most part, there's no sweater production left in the U.S. anymore because there's no sweater machines or ancillary products like the right washing machines, driers, presses or yarn suppliers." The company would have little recourse other than to pass the higher costs onto consumers if Chinese imports were slapped with a new tariff. Almost all the world's cashmere comes from China's arid northern and western frontier provinces where cashmere wool goats thrive. Ultimately, Gifford hopes Trump's tough talk on China is nothing more than residual campaign rhetoric. "I just can't imagine the tariffs are anything more than a threat," he said. "It's to put China on notice." -Los Angeles Times Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

We don't know if you were busy last week, but things were pretty crazy here at TR HQ. We doubled down on CES coverage and did our best to take a good look at all the hardware news that poured out from the show. The biggest individual bit of news was probably the launch of Intel's 7th-generation Core processors, codenamed Kaby Lake. We did an in-depth review of the Core i7-7700K, so if you're curious about it go ahead and click that link. A new CPU release tends to produce a deluge of product line refreshes, and this CES was no exception in that regard. Both AMD and Nvidia had some big announcements to make, too. The red team had some meaty info about its Vega graphics architecture, showed off Ryzen-ready chipsets and motherboards, and FreeSync 2. Meanwhile, on the green corner, Nvidia G-Sync HDR is coming to some sweet high-end displays, and GPU-destitute gamers everywhere have access to GeForce Now game streaming. Let's dig deep into the news, shall we?
