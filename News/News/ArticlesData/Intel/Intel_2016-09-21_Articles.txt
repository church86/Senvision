Luckily, we can recreate that in a video game. Facebook and Intel took home 1st place prizes today (Sept. 22) in VizDoom 2016, a competition to see who can create the best “Doom”-playing AI. The 1993 video game, in which a player fights the scourge of hell, has become a touchstone for AI research for its simple 3D maps and potential for different styles of play. Facebook, which competed under the team name F1, took home the (figurative) gold medal in the competition’s first challenge, where AIs are armed with rocket launchers on a map they’ve seen before. The goal was simple: kill each other. They could heal themselves with Medikits, and gather more ammunition. The Facebook team won 10 of 12 matches. Intel won the more complex second challenge, where the AI was dropped into a map it had never seen before. Alternate weapons were scattered across the map, so the bots didn’t only have to contend with unfamiliar terrain, but the decision of how different weapons would affect the potential outcomes of the match. Intel also won 10 of the 12 games, but by a much larger margin than the Facebook win. Pretty much every modern video game claims to have AI, which is used as a blanket term for characters programmed into the game that seemingly act autonomously. However, they’re programmed to have certain behaviors, act within certain limits, and don’t learn. The AI in the VizDoom competition don’t work that way. They play the same way any human would: by looking at the screen, processing what’s happening, figuring out the best strategy to win, and then actually controlling the character to achieve that goal. Each competitor’s bot is built on the VizDoom platform, software that standardizes how the AI can interact with the game. The teams tinker with specific approaches on how to learn, but mostly rely on variations of reinforcement learning, where they set the bot loose to play the game and fail, each time learning slightly more about how to win. But even the bots that didn’t win brought interesting ideas to the table. Clyde, created by University of Essex PhD candidate Dino Ratcliffe, preferred spawn-camping, according to a feature on the competition by Engadget. Spawn-camping is the act of shooting players just as they re-appear after dying in the game. Unfortunately, Ratcliffe’s computer broke a day before the competition, and a severely under-trained version of Clyde had to compete. The underprepared bot, who only finished 40% of training, took 3rd place. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The Open-Source Intel Vulkan Linux Driver's Anatomy Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 22 September 2016 at 05:44 PM EDT. 8 Comments Intel Open-Source Technology Center developer Jason Ekstrand presented earlier today at XDC2016 with a presentation entitled "The Anatomy of a Vulkan Driver" where he covers how he and fellow Intel developers brought up the first open-source Vulkan driver and had it ready for launch-day when Khronos formally unveiled the specification earlier this year. The early part of the presentation will be boring to anyone who frequently reads Phoronix with the dozens of articles I've written since February concerning progress on the Intel Vulkan driver, Vulkan itself, etc. The early part of the presentation just provides a basic overview of what is Vulkan, the need for Vulkan, etc etc... But the latter half of the presentation is what's interesting when he talks more about the design decisions, how he and basically three Intel developers brought up this driver (along with the support of many other Intel developers), and other commentary surrounding the Intel Linux Vulkan driver's design. Ekstrand also commented for the skeptics on how Gallium3D isn't fitting for layering Vulkan atop, why their Vulkan driver is in Mesa / the code they are able to share between their drivers, Vulkan support not coming to Sandy Bridge (it would be possible to run a sub-set of Vulkan on Sandy Bridge, but with the hardware lacking compute shaders it wouldn't work out and really isn't worthwhile without the compute shader capabilities), etc. Unfortunately the PDF slides haven't been uploaded for this Vulkan anatomy driver presentation, but the video recording is now available without having to deal with the stream's 2-hour limitation when live. To see the presentation, it's the first presentation of the XDC2016 Day 2 stream embedded below; it's certainly worthwhile for anyone into Vulkan and has an hour to spare, or at least 30+ minutes for the more interesting parts after the introductory coverage. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

View Latest Posts >>> Extinction Level Threat – Mind-control: the Missing Link By Preston James, Ph.D on September 22, 2016 All terrorism is synthetically engineered, directly or indirectly, and the root cause is always the secret deployment of sophisticated mind-control systems comprised of esoteric Psi-power, Dispensed “News”, “shaped education”, cultural programming, and the SSG deployment of ultra high-tech psychotronics. by  Preston James Any serious effort by any investigative journalist who tries to report in the Mainstream Media that mind-control is the missing link in all world terrorism and mass-shootings (which just happen to occur in gun-free zones) is quickly neutralized. The Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) run by six medias moguls who report to a major investment house on the vanguard of investment technology will either ignore such disclosures or will attempt to discredit that journalist. Any official USG and Alphabet spokesmen will quickly deny any such issues have legs and will usually call the journalist by the CIA-created term “conspiracy theorist”, a label which works well discrediting that journalist. Despite all these denials and attributed labeling as a “conspiracy theorist” one will receive when they identify sophisticated mind-control techniques as a root cause of lone-wolf terrorist acts, such a declaration is true. Sophisticated high-tech Mind-control has allowed the Top Chieftains of the Khazarian Mafia to take control over the American People. The development and deployment of this Mind-control technology has become extensive and invasive after being combined with Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) algorithms and quantum (inter-dimensional computers). This has allowed a small group of Khazarian Mafia (KM) Chieftains who sit at the top of the Establishment Hierarchy (EH) and who run most of the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) to gain control over all of the USG, the Alphabets and all American Law Enforcement. And it is important to realize that this now ultra-high-tech Mind-Kontrol is also partly based on thousands of years of esoteric knowledge passed down within the Ruling Class (Twelve Kenite Bloodlines). But the recently discovered technology necessary to remotely hack the human brain and entrain its thoughts, belief and attitudes is by far the most effective means of Mind-control. And unless it is stopped or neutralized does pose the greatest threat to the very survival of the human race itself. Psychotronic Mind-Kontrol is now an extinction level threat. The reason this new psychotronic mass-Mind-Kontrol is actually an extinction level threat. Why? Because those who have been deploying it are unimaginably evil, soulless psychopaths. And they (themselves) have become possessed by esoteric spiritual entities which have deluded them to become deeply committed to attaining a Globalist NWO Agenda that is designed to destroy 90% of all humans in the first round and then the last 10% in stages. As many psychologists and behavioral scientists realize attitudes can become precursors for deviant actions, especially when they are mind-kontrolled and adequately triggered. Thus it is reasonable to view attitudes as “potential actions”. So naturally it has been a high priority for the KM Top Chieftains to secretly finance and promote the most sophisticated means possible to mass mind-kontrol the American People. They have done this through infiltrating, consolidating and hijacking the Major Mass Media, mainstream broadcast radio networks and TV. TV has been their best means for mass-mind programming of the masses until ultra high tech psychotronics were developed and deployed the last 25 years. It is now known for certain that the newest techniques of Psychotronic Mind-Kontrol have been deployed against certain individuals. Some randomly selected, some whistleblowers targeted for harassment and cognitive deconstruction. But all such deployments are tests and are used to hone and perfect these psychotronic remote conductive entrainment systems, usually complex A.I.-driven quantum computer-based algorithms. _________ “Mass Psychology of Submission” … Personalities who are more frightened of rebellion than of the consequences of their subjugation. If one’s attitudes are culturally conditioned to have anti-human attitudes, a suitable trigger is entrained or provided by a handler to coerce a mind-kontrolled individual to act in a certain deviant manner as the handler and trainer desires. It is now clear beyond any shadow of a doubt that such mind-control is real and triggers can be deployed through hand signals, voiced instructions, tone and display of certain symbols, as well as remotely induced and entrained directly into the skull by high-tech electronic warfare methods which are referred to as psychotronics. Some very high level Intel insiders (best described as Intel Cowboys) are well aware that certain major defense contractors now market top secret psychotronic induction devices for entrainment and triggering. _________ Nano and Sonic Technologies against Americans on Mainland US Now for those doubters who read this and think, “Oh this is just another attempt to lead away from the deviant criminals who infiltrated and hijacked the USG in 1913”, here is my answer. Scientists used soft materials to create a brain implant one-tenth the width of a human hair that can wirelessly control neurons with lights and drugs, and control the actions of mice with the press of a button. (Photo: Jeong lab, Univ. of Colorado Boulder) You are right in your assumption where this take-down of the US Republic started, but you are wrong about your assumption that this discussion of deployed Mind-control is an attempt to lead astray. One of the first tests occurred in a major sporting goods chain that had numerous well-balanced and mentally healthy staff crack with a major mental snap on the job. It was done through pulsed beam transmitters, which were installed in the stores. Then the next arena for even more sophisticated tests was certain large public schools; at first special UN-approved high-efficiency lights were installed that provided inductive entrainment of students, and then high powered Wi-Fi was installed, which produced numerous mental snaps in students and teachers and staff. In some of these initial test schools, they were first visited by Bush2, and any teachers who were completely standup had their desks sprayed with certain enzymes by Intel ops sheep-dipped as janitors, which gave them a variety of lethal diseases. Some were murdered by induction of strange, fast-growing cancers by psychotronics. Others were fired for bogus reasons, like the school’s computer department placing child pornography ads on their computers. New teachers who were too moral or standup had their contracts unexpectedly non-renewed. This was all under control of the Mossad, the CIA and the NSA in a joint operation. _________ Voice of God Successful in 1991 War Operation Bury ’em Alive – 1991 Iraq Highway of Death. During Desert Storm on Feb. 24-25, 1991, US troops using tanks and earthmovers that had been specially fitted with plows buried thousands of Iraqi soldiers alive. This assault had been planned and rehearsed. According to US participants, about 2,000 Iraqis surrendered and were not buried. Most of the rest, about 8,000, were buried beneath tons of sand — many trying to surrender. The Republican Guard threw down their weapons and allowed themselves to be bulldozed to death by US Forces in the first Gulf War in Iraq. Let’s consider one major piece of evidence that cannot be denied by anyone who reasonably examines the evidence. It’s the top secret deployment of the “Voice of God” remote entrainment system within the Iraqi Republican Guard during the 1st Gulf War which manipulated these crack soldiers into throwing down their arms and allowing themselves to be bulldozed alive into mass graves by the US Military. Some insiders have claimed within Intel circles of peers that this technology was deployed by use of special C-130’s electronic warfare aircraft in combination with certain satellites and certain ELF ground transmitters. I don’t know all parts of the system that was deployed, but I do know for certain that this “Voice to Skull” technology was deployed during that battle and actually was able to destroy a large part of the Republican Guard without a shot. And it is known for certain that this deployment produced an amazingly deadly result for the US Military and their puppet-masters the Israeli Likudists and stateside NeoCon Israeli-American “Israeli-first” Dual Citizen Traitors within the US State Department, the Administration, Congress and all the think tanks, NGOs and private foundations (like the traitorous and Seditious CFR and the various US Defense Policy Boards). _________ For those who want to research themselves in detail here are some key terms and references to search out: One example is LRAD, which can broadcast speech for up to 300 meters 1- Voice to Skull technology deployed by certain large DOD contractors, some Deep-Black and Beyond-Black. 2- Jesse Ventura’s episode “Brain Invaders” on his Conspiracy Theory network show which was later censored for the FEMA Camp episode and then later cancelled. This is periodically scrubbed from the Internet and often is then put up again for a while before it is taken down. 3- Dr. Robert Duncan, excerpt from Brain Invaders by Jesse Ventura on his now cancelled and censored Conspiracy Theory network show. He has a number of informative interviews on www.youtube.com. 4- Patrick Flanagan, Ph.D., one of the most impressive geniuses and inventors of our time, a man who was seriously persecuted by the SSG and discovered Voice to Skull and patented it only to have his patent initially seized under national security by the USG. This genius inventor is worth researching. He has drifted into the esoteric and this actually reduces his information to zero threat status to the KM. 5- Voice of God, as deployed in the 1st Gulf war. 6- Use of poppers (small approximately 2-5 foot diameter sphere and dome transmitters on buildings and a small number of tanks and armored vehicles during and after the 2nd Gulf War and invasion of Iraq which caused GIs and civilians a lot of headaches and disturbed sleep but failed to be even marginally effective in “pacifying” everyone. This is now generally regarded as a scam to extract large defense appropriations from taxpayers. 7- 1992 Com 12 Psyops Briefing Paper for USN Intel trainees, part of the secret war being waged between the USN and the USAF. 8- The CIA’s Satanic/pedophile mind-Kontrol program for very young hijacked, bought, commissioned from parents, or kidnapped children called the “Finders”. 9- Two examples of over 100 key mind-kontrol patents still in the public arena (over 200 have been classified and are not available to the public). Check out US Patent 3,951,134 “Apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves” (1974); or US Patent 6,011,991 “Communication system and method including brain wave analysis and/or use of brain activity” (1998). (source Elias Alias, youtube.com) 10-The book Excalibur Briefing by Lt. Colonel Thomas Bearden. 11-The underground book on scalar transmission edited by “Commander X”, the Guide to Incredible Conspiracies, What They Don’t Want You To Know. Do premier scientific labs have ethics, or will many researchers do anything for money? … “er, We know the answer to that; now we are just trying to determine their price.” _________ Conclusion Obviously, any article that specifically described the current deployment of psychotronics (electronic warfare) against the American People would be as thick as a phone book. I have given a brief overview here. An atom’s quantum information written onto a photon polarization state Some of this new Psi-power quantum based technology is just too sensitive right now to disclose specifically, but many VT readers can connect the dots from previous articles and draw realistic conclusions. Suffice to say that it is associated with: the secret societies, pedophilia, child and adult torture and sacrifice; mass-murder through wars and induced crime in synthetically engineered urban jungles; the invocation and negative energy “feeding” of the Third Force; and attempted applications to triple-helix gene-splicing technology to create the synthetic soul and use of inter-dimensional quantum computers and psychotronics. Current psychotronic and Mind-Kontrol technologies using remote induction/entrainment make it quite easy for the Secret Shadow Government’s Defense Contractors to create synthetic terror: including lone wolves willing to “sacrifice themselves”; manipulated patsies; radical mercenary groups like ISIS; and KM Cutouts and Doofuses who become willing to give up their souls to serve the KM’s “Order of the Snake” for the vast rewards they can and usually gain. The Russian Federation has developed significant and effective means to neutralize these devices in all forms, and it is believed that others such as Dr. Keshe have such neutralizing technology. It is no exaggeration to conclude the KM which has infiltrated and hijacked the USG and its Defense contractors is now deploying massive electronic warfare against We The People and many Americans, especially certain specific groups, which are now “deer in the headlights”, setting themselves up for slaughter watching TV and believing the CMMM, like lemmings heading for the cliff. This bevy of psychotronic weapons includes: ground based ELF and EMF (some handheld or stationed in neighboring homes and apartments run by Intel operatives); Wi-Fi systems in home, schools and businesses; cell phone and cell tower systems; remote home phone systems; chemtrails and ingested smart dust which migrates into the CNS which can be flashed; Doppler Radar; and satellite based scalar transmissions and various unmentionable Psi-chotronic weapons, which are actually inter-dimensional quantum based Psi-power weapons. Does Psi-power allow the individual to interact with a plane of all Possible Worlds with Different Start Conditions? If you want more research, you can research these provided leads and you will eventually gain a decent brief overview of what We The People now face. The hardest part to uncover is the beyond-black esoteric Psi-power weapons which are not covered in this article, weapons being developed now to use quantum technologies to strip the human soul out, hive the victim and reduce them to a slave, such as has been done with numerous synthetically engineered ISIS recruits. ISIS is basically a huge test for mass mind-kontrol based on psychotronically induced hiving. I have explicated some of these means in numerous prior VT articles and who is behind them. The concept of an Aerially discharged Electromagnetic Pulse Bomb (EMP) is often discussed as the ultimate weapon. Actually there is a sinister new EMP-derivate called the “E-Bomb” that can provide scalar emissions to suddenly reprogram the brain of millions at once, or in a different form that will neutralize the CNS of millions at once with no damage to electronics and buildings. Some Intel insiders believe that the Russian Federation has this weapon now and perhaps in operational form. It is rumored to operate as an inter-dimensional quantum emission device which allegedly prevents any shielding and can allegedly easily penetrate DUMBs, too. All future Electromagnetic weapons systems are likely to be based on the new quantum physics and the previously censored/removed Maxwell laws that explained such matters. Right now the Russian Federation is the world leader in these weapons by quite a long shot, according to informed Intel insiders. Suffice to say that We The People can deploy some of these same means (especially mass-consciousness and mass-focus as raw unbridled Psi-power) against our common enemy that the Khazarian Mafia and its Top Chieftains and their Establishment Hierarchy have deployed against us. When based and combined with Truth we can attain immense mass-power not previously thought to be available. Prayer, living by God’s rule to treat others as we want to be treated, a commitment to personal honesty and integrity and a willingness to declare the truth to all who will listen is actually a very powerful application that elicits strong Psi-power by and for We the People. The whole KM system is a system of mass lies, deception and Mind-Kontrol. If their system of abject lies is destroyed, it will collapse like a house of cards at every level. And many believe this happening right now, that the KM system of lies is being eroded more and more each month, thanks to the Internet and word of mouth one to another. Intel Cowboys – From 2nd L, Mike Harris, Jim Dean, Gordon Duff, Col. Jim Hanke, Dr. Barakat on far right – Damascus Counter Terrorism conference, Dec. 02, 2014 As many VT readers know, the Four Intel Cowboys at VT who attended the Conference in Damascus in December of 2104 for Combatting Terrorism and Religious Extremism were actually able to provide the information exposing the Khazarian Mafia (KM) which served as a catalyst that stopped WW3 at the time. These men overcame at least two serious interception events, one immediately neutralized by “Iron Mike” Harris who provided security for the team. Each of these four men should have received the US Congressional Medal of Honor for their bold and heroic service to America and for their successful efforts. This process of checkmating the KM through the promotion of truth that exposes their massive system of lies and deception now becomes the responsibility of all of us, the American Masses, We The People to expose and stop. Fortunately we have had a new weapon at our disposal, the worldwide Internet, the New Gutenberg Press. Soon a serious attempt is likely to be made to take this away from us. It may very well be that far too much truth has already been dispensed. The big game of the KM for many years since 1913 has been to use their hijacked Major Mass Media and all the mechanism and branches of the USG, corporations and hijacked institutions to make their criminal acts which should have been public private. Much to their horror and intense anxiety, the Internet has reversed this process by making secret acts of criminality, child-sacrifice, murder, war-making and mass-murder public. You would be correct if you came to the conclusion that We the People are now involved in a war for our very survival: it’s the Truth versus the KM lies and their massively deployed psychotronics; and it’s their cultural Mind-Kontrol versus the Psi-power of decent Americans and others who live by the Golden Rule of treating others the way you want to be treated, aka “love your neighbor as yourself”. _________ Joe Bonamassa was a great fan of late late, great Gary Moore and said his music was like a storm descending on your head.

Log in to Reply CoJonesGrandes  September 26, 2016 at 5:50 am Yes, prayers are very important. Different futures lie ahead of us and the one we get is the one we create. Have a look at Chet Snow’s ‘Mass dreams of the Future’ which has been mentioned in Talbot’s ‘Holographic Universe’. Shakuntala Modi’s research shows that there is great destruction in the future but “with the help of God through prayers, together we have the power to prevent the massive destruction. The choice is ours and God and the heavenly beings cannot interfere with our free will.” If people do not wake up and consciously choose a good reality, they will sleepwalk into a bleak and dismal future. Visualize a peaceful world where people live in harmony. Do not put your energy into what you do NOT want (like saying you do not want a nuclear holocaust). We cannot save you from yourselves.

Not choosing is itself a choice. In my dream, I was told “Just do the work. Do not be attached to any outcome. Let the chips fall where they will. It is what it is. Let the people decide what they want. It’s their planet. Free them of the mind control. Tell them what is going on and let them decide” CoJonesGrandes  September 26, 2016 at 2:21 pm The E.L.E. is coming soon. The way out is to choose the spiritual path. You choose by your thoughts, your deeds and your actions. Walk away from the distractions they throw at you. Look to what you want to happen in this world. Be kind, be caring, be loving, be joyful. Make your sphere of influence as positive as you can. Spend more time in nature. The future you get will match your vibration. Visualise a wonderful, peaceful, harmonious world. It all boils down to the individual and his choice. We have done what we can and you will be left with what you choose. Karol Hudson  September 24, 2016 at 3:56 pm “FLUORIDE” used in every large city in the USA ??? How do we eliminate it in thewater we drink ??? Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  September 24, 2016 at 8:52 pm One can eliminate almost all (if not all) fluoride by use of multilevel water filters such as Berkey (sold all over the Internet and in outdoor stores, very highly respected and lab verified) or Zero (sold at Target stores and other stores–comes with an electronic water quality meter, NSF Certified). Some anti-fluoride “purists” use reverse osmosis first and then use additional specialized filters to pull out the fluoride such as the highly respect “Zero” brand sold retail. Reverse osmosis can get a lot of it but not all and that where additional filtering like Zero is useful. And there are some other manufacturers that make filters with this capability. Most others beside Zero sold in dept store are not designed to and cannot take out fluoride because they accept the big lie that fluoride is necessary to form strong teeth and bones (is isn’t and has the opposite effect and slows development in children and lowers their IQs up to 8-12 points as verified in respected recent medical research). The problem is that fluoride is a very small compound molecularly and can easily get through most water filters. tech9494  September 30, 2016 at 10:27 am Unfortunately the shift to chloramine(from chlorine) by many municipal water supplies ruins reverse osmosis filters in a short amount of time. Refer to the salt water aquarium blogs about their efforts to eliminate chloramine. However, chloramine can be neutralized using small amounts of acorbic acid(Vit C). Flouride can be neutralized with small amounts of borax. Berkey filter after that and hope. Google is, on this occaision. your friend. Garrett Derner  October 2, 2016 at 11:47 am About a year ago, I was considering RO filters, but decided distillation is simpler and more reliable. I have not regretted it. I got a US-made distiller from Steam Pure, that seems built to last. The only gotcha is it uses charcoal after-filters (in case there are VOCs) sold only by them. The distilled water tastes quite good after I remineralize it with a pinch of salt. I like to also magnesium chloride (cheap when sold as nigari for tofu making), borax and maybe a few fennel seeds, soaked for a few minutes then strained out. You might also find a spring near you (search at FindASpring.com).

I would just remind people that everything that they can do with their technology you can do with your own mind. You very simply have to stop letting them dictate reality to you. There is no reality. It’s the first thing Mr. Duff told me and I have learned just how right, as usual, he was.

They know this and it is driving them crazy.. For the rest…there are outside and inside sources that can be utilized to prevent attacks. One has to make a concerted effort to put up barriers because this is the biggest story we should be talking about and thank you for reporting on it here! Morgellons is one of many side effects of the nano-technology they have rolled out in the chemtrails. These microscopic hairlike fibers with diodes on the end are inhaled or burrow through the skin and the immune system tries to force them back out. People can feel them just under the skin..

I believe the first mainstream articles about it came out in 2005, and were about supposed Pentagon research in 1994 into spraying pheromones on Iraqi troops. Personally, I think that electronic methods would work better, and that they have been used for some time by contractors. Tesla said every organ and gland in your body could be tickled with its own individual frequency, so we have had many years to develop his ideas.I believe these weapons have been used on “targeted individuals” along with the usual old-fashioned methods, to make them lust after the nearest available person or creature. I wonder how many young, bright politicians have been targeted this way, perhaps even just once, with video, and then blackmailed for the rest of their lives? Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  September 23, 2016 at 4:27 pm Good point JS. They sprayed these hormone soups in certain large cities and then monitored the urine samples at the local labs. The program started in the early 1960’s and has continued even today, although the main thrust now is by manipulating TV and the popular culture to confuse sex roles. Numerous researchers have suspected that the massive use of endocrine disrupters in plastic containers (now present in water in most cities in levels that disrupt normal sex hormone levels in men and women) was not a coincidence and that plastics compounds were developed that would serve this agenda.

I know that the technology mentioned is this article is well-verified. In light of the recent Satanic sacrifice of a young Swedish woman at Cern, the opening of measurable EM portals at Cern, Cern’s connection with WWII Nazis and blatantly occult attributes, that the presence of undetectable interdimensional entities may be as significant as those mentioned in this article. In any case, I believe prayer and universal love are our best defense against dark forces. Thank you, Dr. James. Log in to Reply Raven Knight  September 23, 2016 at 1:37 am I really appreciate you continuing to bring this forward. Back in 2001, I found out about this from a friend who told me he knew about the technology being used, and it was similar in the Vietnam war. In Vietnam, I guess from what he said, the enemy drugged you and put in a transistor tooth which served as a microphone and programmer to the subject repeating interrogation type communication. Now technology is so much smaller. Cell phone and “blue tooth technology” are kind of off shoots which are now even dust sized according to many tech articles. The key to this being, how can the foreign objects be identified and extracted? It seems improbable that some implants could ever be extracted. Neutralizing them would be fine. Obviously they have wanted to make it impossible to remove them by both the thought about the implantee as being crazy, and there being little ability then to legitimately identify then then extract or neutralize them. It is criminal and a violation of a person, similar to rape. Please keep us posted on when something is available to neutralize implants. Everyone should own this type of device to neutralize them, especially when they are nano-sized. You can use a degausser according to the “medical ”patents online. However, it is challenging to find a strong enough degausser to neutralize the implants. They are very expensive and hard to obtain.

What Does 50,000 Volts From a Taser Do to Your Brain? BY TIM STELLOH “They were divided into four groups, and five second shocks of 50,000 volts were administered to two of them. The researchers found “statistically significant reductions” in verbal learning and memory; some participants also had trouble concentrating, and they felt overwhelmed and anxious. “Being shocked had a traumatic effect on some participants,” Kane said, according to the statement. “Some were emotionally debilitated by the experience.” The researchers suggest that police departments require officers to wait one hour before issuing someone their Miranda rights after they’ve been tased.” I think there are serious questions about the approval and use of taser guns and all the various possible consequences for different victims. Just because an event is unlikely does not mean it can’t happen. Unlikely events happen every day. But of course the police love these weapons and prosecutors are eager to use likely lies to get them out of charges of murder or more.

They show police in South Boston using a taser multiple times on a man in May 2013. Less than two hours later, 46- year-old Linwood Lambert Jr. was dead. Jeff Pegues reports on how the victim’s family is responding to the videos. More” “Smalls, who said she met with Martin for nearly four hours Monday, said the decision is “heartbreaking.” “It took three years to get exactly where we began on May 4, 2013,” Smalls said. “These officers can walk around the streets after what they did to my brother.” Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring, who helped Martin with the investigation, was also present at the meeting, Smalls said. Herring also didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Monday.” Of course lying lawyers can always cook up excuses to let the police off the hook.

Jacobs that came out already in 1956, that describes a severe case of mind control. Any one familiar with it? The title is «La Marque Jaune» in the original French edition, or «The Yellow M» in the English edition. I am mentioning this, because 1956 is quite early, showing that these ideas are not new. In «The Yellow M» the villain is a former Russian colonel named «Olrik», a fascinating character. The book includes a series of excellent drawings, well suited as illustrations of the phenomenon, I should think. The heroes are the British investigators «Blake and Mortimer».

Credit: Oakley More like this Google Glass strikes back 12 new or soon-to-be-released fitness devices worth a look Finally: Smart glasses that don't look dumb Video 10 tablets for under $500 For wearables to succeed, many people believe technology should be inconspicuous, not popping out and making a fashion statement of its own. Google Glass may have gotten it wrong, and Oakley and Intel may have done it right with the new Radar Pace. At first glance, Oakley's Radar Pace sunglasses look undeniably cool. But hidden inside is technology that turns the sunglasses into a voice-activated coach that answers questions and provides fitness training recommendations. It's like having Siri in your sunglasses. The sunglasses are expensive. At US$449, they have a hefty markup, but Oakley sunglasses and cool technology won't come cheap. The glasses will be handy for hard-core athletes, but Oakley is also targeting casual athletes. The smart glasses will start shipping on Oct. 1 in the U.S. and other countries. [ Also on CIO.com: Wearables in the enterprise? Yes, really! ] Radar Pace has sensors that can track heart rate, distance, cadence, speed, and other vital workout information. The data is synced with a smartphone connected to Radar Pace via Bluetooth, where an app called Radar Pace App monitors the workout, answers questions, and provides voice recommendations. Users hear the information through earphones in the sunglasses. A cool feature is the ability to ask questions through a microphone, with users getting answers back. The questions are passed on to the smartphone app, which formulates and sends back an answer to Radar Pace. The voice-activated system can convey daily workout plans, or answer questions that will provide real-time information on speed, race, metrics, and heart rate to people wearing Radar Pace. The smartphone app can analyze workout data in real time. For example, the glasses can advise a runner to increase the pace, slow down, or end a workout. The mobile app interprets and answers queries through a natural-language processing engine developed by Intel called Real Speech. For example, a runner can ask questions like, "what's my heart rate?" or "what's my pace?" Voicing "time" or "distance" will prompt the app to convey the answers. The smart glasses are a result of a two-year alliance between Luxottica, which owns Oakley, and Intel, which developed the core technology and architecture. Intel has pushed for technology to be invisible in wearables, and that design philosophy was the main focus when designing Radar Pace. Many smart sunglasses for fitness are hitting the market. A notable competitor is Solos, which is a kind of Google Glass for athletes. Solos has a tiny heads-up display that shows metrics like heart rate, pace, distance, and cadence so athletes can see data in real time. It was used by U.S. cyclists in the recent Rio Olympics. But unlike Google Glass and Solos, the Radar Pace doesn't have a screen. A voice-activated system works better because information on a screen can be distracting when cycling or running, Oakley officials said. Also, the added-on tech hasn't looked cool in some smart glasses. The technology protruding out of Google Glass was so visible that it upset people who thought they were being spied on. Oakley and Intel came up with a design where the technology is as hidden as possible, though the headsets are clearly visible on the side. The smartphone app that works with Radar Pace also can pull data from other fitness apps and devices to formulate workouts. That's handy, especially when people like using Fitbit and other devices to track fitness data. The sunglasses weigh 56 grams and run for about four to six hours on a single battery charge. They have an accelerometer, gyroscope, and sensors to measure pressure, humidity, and proximity. The glasses have some cool add-on features. They can play your favorite music on the smartphone. You can take phone calls via Radar Pace, and the app works with Android and iOS devices. For Intel, the Radar Pace is a breakthrough in wearables. The chipmaker has a handful of wearable products on the market, but Radar Pace is the most important for the company. Unfortunately for Intel, the glasses don't use an x86 chip, but an embedded processor based on another architecture that Intel wouldn't specify. That also highlights a  problem -- Intel's chips aren't used in many wearables partly because the company doesn't have the right processors in its portfolio. Intel is committed to developing chips for wearables, a representative said. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

The report forecast the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 33.24% during the period 2016-2020. One of the key trends for market growth will be rise in investments in emerging memory technology. The 3D NAND flash memory market is a new market where manufacturers are investing a lot of capital. Some companies such as Samsung, Micron, and Intel have already invested to extend their product portfolios. Toshiba, in collaboration with SanDisk, is investing huge funds to develop 3D NAND. Samsung, SanDisk, and Toshiba, and Intel and Micron are likely to invest more than $18 billion in the manufacturing of 3D NAND during the forecast period. Intel has plans to invest up to $5.5 billion to manufacture flash memory in its China-based memory chip plant during the forecast period. Hence, increasing investments in 3D NAND technology will boost the global PCIe SSD market during the forecast period. According to the report, need for managed service data centers will be a key driver for market growth. It is advantageous for an enterprise to operate a colocation facility rather than to build a data center. Data center colocation allows enterprises to rent computing storage, servers, and network. It enables minimal utilization of power and bandwidth and enhances the security of enterprise IT equipment. Further, the report states that the lack of availability of constant low latency is a major challenge. Write latency can be masked with write-back caching. However, read latency cannot be hidden. SSD latencies are usually for a couple of hundred microseconds. In certain cases, when access is interrupted by the device's internal tasks, SSD's latency can exceed tens of milliseconds or even to a few seconds. The situation is further complicated by the lack of coordination across an array of devices. This results in unpredictable performance of I/Os due to uncoordinated internal tasks.

Likely to Adopt ARM Architecture for Future Smartphone Processors An Intel exec strongly hints at this in a recently published interview. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 22, 2016 at 1:30PM Image source: Intel.  A little while back, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) made public that it had cancelled its SoFIA family of processors for low-end and mid-range smartphones and Broxton for high-end smartphones. When this news broke, it seemed to me that the chip giant had all but canned its plans to compete in the smartphone applications processor market. However, at a recent investor conference, Intel exec Brice Hill hinted that the company may try its hand at the mobile applications processor market. Then, in a recent interview with IDG News Service, Intel's Murthy Renduchintala flat-out said the cancellation of the SoFIA/Broxton projects doesn't imply that Intel is "no longer doing mobile platforms." He even went on to say that, going forward, Intel's goal with respect to mobile platforms is to "talk less and do more." So, it's quite clear that Intel plans to reenter the market for mobile applications processors. However, buried in the interview, Murthy strongly hinted that any future smartphone processors from Intel would be based on ARM processors, rather than Intel's own Atom processors. ARM is the established architecture in mobile During the interview, IDG News Service asked Murthy if the company would be "open to the idea of taking an ARM CPU license." Murthy's response was "yes." He further went on to explain that "there are many areas in the ARM ecosystem where Intel can pragmatically play in for its own benefit," and that he is a "big believer in paying respect to established ecosystems." Remember that in the mobile processor market, the ARM architecture is the established standard with overwhelmingly dominant market share. Intel tried to capture some share with processors based on its Atom processor cores (these cores implement Intel's own X86 instruction set architecture), but those efforts clearly failed. Although I don't blame the X86 architecture for that failure, I do believe Intel's Atom processor designs were not competitive with what ARM's processor designs (which can be licensed by mobile chip manufacturers) had to offer in terms of performance/power/area. I get the sense that Murthy recognizes that the easiest and safest way to reenter the mobile processor market (and actually succeed in it) is to rely on as many third-party technologies as possible. An interesting longer-term opportunity It is by no means guaranteed that just because Intel reenters the smartphone processor market, it will actually be successful. Intel's execution over the last several years in the mobile processor market was nothing less than atrocious, and the venture ultimately wound up costing shareholders a lot of money. However, if Intel can manage to become a credible player in this market, then the revenue and potential unit volume opportunity here could be quite attractive. Each year, more than a billion smartphones are sold, and if Intel can, over time, capture a low double-digit percentage of that market, then that could ultimately mean several billion dollars in incremental revenue and a positive contribution to operating profit. I look forward to seeing how this "mobile reset" ultimately plays out for the chip maker, though I would urge both current and potential investors to not make any investment decisions with respect to Intel stock based on such efforts at this time.

In addition, about 5,000 employees volunteered more than 161,000 hours at schools and other community organizations. Through those volunteer efforts, the company’s Intel Involved Matching Grant Program (IIMGP) contributed an additional $1.2 million in direct funds to those very schools and nonprofits where the company’s volunteers served. “The Intel Involved Matching Grant Program is truly unique. Not only do students, teachers and nonprofit staff benefit from the mentorship and technical expertise of our employees but those organizations also get a direct financial benefit. The Intel Foundation pays $10 for every volunteer hour to these community programs,” explained Intel Arizona’s Director of Public Affairs, Carlos Contreras. With Intel generously donating millions in volunteerism and hard dollars to its communities, here’s a look at the key initiatives that drive the company’s philanthropy in Arizona. Education, Mentoring Opportunities Many large corporations have strong giving programs, but what separates Intel from the pack is the company’s belief in that critical facetime its employees enjoy with K-12 students. Every day in Arizona, Intel volunteers are in the community assisting, overseeing and directly instructing STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math)-related workshops, classes and projects in schools and nonprofit agencies. These critical mentoring opportunities allow students to see how the science and technology skills they learn in school directly translate to real world jobs and products. And more importantly, provide a human voice and role model for what sometimes can be viewed as an “abstract” career. It’s a critical connection that could drive future STEM career pursuits for today’s youth. A few powerful local mentorship examples include: PC Pals: Intel volunteers engage via email with Fourth through 12th graders at select schools in the Kyrene School District. These email pen-pal situations allow students to gain access to the knowledge of actual engineers working on tomorrow’s big discoveries. The twice weekly email exchanges cover topics determined by the teacher and augment classroom activities. Video Mentorship: In partnership with the Maricopa County Education Service Agency (MCESA), Intel employees use live streaming video to engage with classroom students, help with projects, support instruction and even guest speak about real-life problem-solving, technology and applications seen in the STEM world today. Project Lead the Way: Thanks to a $140,000 Intel Foundation Grant, STEM curriculum is now offered from grades K through 12 in several feeder schools at Chandler Unified School District (CUSD). The district has had Project Lead The Way (PLTW) curriculum in place for grades six through 12 for the past five years, but was looking for a financial partner to help bring the instruction down to the elementary school levels as well. Intel employees will also serve as mentors in classes during instruction times. “These are just a few examples of what we’re doing. Our youth is the next generation of innovators, so it’s very important for them to meet and learn from today’s innovators,” added Intel Public Affairs Manager, Patricia Oliverio-Lauderdale. Diversity and Inclusion In 2015 Intel set an ambitious hiring goal to be the first technology company to reach full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in its workforce by 2020. Intel also recognizes that in order to achieve this goal, it’s critical to invest in education and outreach to help better prepare these groups for the knowledge economy. A few examples include: Girls Who Code: A fall program run by Intel at the downtown Chandler Public Library location, Girls Who Code is a project-based program targeting sixth through eighth grade girls to expose them to the fundamentals of computer programming and coding. Participants start by learning how to create basic games, then a more advanced final project of their own over the course of nearly six months of weekly instruction. Hermanas: Hermanas is an annual conference held in February by the Maricopa Community Colleges to support access to STEM careers for Latinas. Intel is an active player in the annual event and also facilitated the formation of the Latina Outreach Working Group within Intel’s Latino Network employee group structure. Si Se Puede Foundation: Intel volunteers are encouraged to get involved and offer expertise to this community organization that offers recreational, educational and access to STEM opportunities for low-income populations, minorities and disadvantaged women. Intel volunteers often serve as instructors and mentors for its unique robotics program. Addressing Specific Community Needs Diversity and mentorship are a natural part of the Intel culture, and programs like Girls Who Code and PLTW are instrumental for those with ambitions to work in engineering or technology. But while these efforts address national issues and concerns, they also reflect Intel’s drive to learn about the communities it serves to pinpoint specific needs. “It’s our policy to reach out and listen. Listen closely to stakeholders and the public, keep those communication lines open, and really learn what the specific needs of that community are before implementing programs. That way what we offer is truly what that community needs,” Contreras added. For more information about Intel Involved, click here.

Along with Intel's 6th Generation Core lineup comes the Intel Xeon E3-1200 v5 family of processors, which are just Xeon variants of their Core counterparts. The benefit to using a Xeon, over the fact that they should last longer, is that they offer ECC and vPro support. These reasons make the Xeon more preferable in critical workstation and business scenarios, where memory errors cause problems and secure remote access is important.     The X150M-PRO ECC is one of GIGABYTE's C232 chipset-based motherboards. It does carry the desert camouflage theme, which shouldn't matter much, considering workstation users might not care much about aesthetics. The motherboard does bring the basic feature-set that comes with the C232 chipset and offers full Xeon and ECC memory support.   Let's take a look at this little workstation motherboard.     Specifications     The GIGABYTE X150M-Pro ECC supports E3-1200 v5 series processors, four DIMMs of ECC memory, 1Gbit Intel NIC, 2-Way CrossFireX technology, M.2, SATA Express, 6x SATA 6Gb/s, and 6x USB 3.0 ports just to name a few of the features.     Pricing   The X150M-PRO ECC is available from many large retailers for roughly $139.99.

Wait a couple of years for second-gen Small fry Scale offers single-node HCI boxen for the ROBO crowd Data management services have to get proactive – Acronis You might have noticed that El Reg has suggested Intel and Micron’s non-volatile XPoint memory claims are a tad overblown – for example here and here. Now Charlie Demerjian is giving Intel a good kicking in SemiAccurate, alleging the original claims were inaccurate and that “Intel’s Xpoint is pretty much broken”. For example, his text says that the original promises stated XPoint would be “1000x faster than NAND, 1000x the endurance of NAND, and 10x denser than conventional memory.” What’s now clear to him, he says, is that after IDF2015 and IDF2016 “the claimed 1000x faster is now ummm, 10x faster, a mere 100x difference.” As he quips: "What is two orders of magnitude between friends? “ As for the original 100x endurance advantage, Intel is now saying 3x, a 33.33x reduction. Concerning density he writes: “They claimed 10x the density of DRAM, it is now 4x or a 2.5x decrease.” Demerjian adds: “Wait until you hear what they are telling people behind closed doors. SemiAccurate has talked to multiple sources over the past few months, all of which heard the same story from Intel. And yes it gets worse.” Of course, Demerjian is looking for subscriptions and further analysis is only available to subscribers at $1,000/year. Screeching about how Moby XPoint, the great white non-volatile memory whale, is broken and sticking one of his harpoons into it is a good way to get a few more of them. Intel viewpoint An Intel spokesperson said: "Intel is fully committed to bringing Intel Optane technology products to market, and those products continue to move through the development process towards availability later this year and in early 2017. Intel Optane products are healthy and on track to unleash vast system performance potential in a range of products, with Intel SSDs first to come to market." "Intel Optane technology is a new class of memory that is a unique combination of Intel’s advanced system memory controller, interface hardware and software IP with 3D XPoint memory media." "We stand by the performance figures we have shared publicly to date for both Intel Optane SSDs, pre-production and prototype versions, as well as 3D XPoint memory media. System level performance is determined by the full collection of components, with media being only one of these components. We are seeing great improvements over NAND-based SSDs – up to 10x throughput and 4x latency reductions – in prototype SSD hardware. Intel Optane technology-based SSDs will be Intel’s highest performance and endurance SSDs when they come to market. We will disclose final product performance and specifications at the products’ launch in coming months.” El Reg notes this sentence in particular: "System level performance is determined by the full collection of components, with media being only one of these components." We might say that the original XPoint claims referred to raw media comparisons and not system-level performance, a point not made clear in the original XPoint performance, density and endurance claims. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 14 Comments More from The Register WD flashes first SanDisk drives: Blue and Green Applies disk-drive style branding to SanDy-driven SSDs 8 Comments WD gives My Passport spinning rust drives a lick of paint Colourless My Passport for Mac and My Book drives are boring black only 25 Comments WD: Resistance is not futile Analysis SanDisk ReRAM becomes WD's XPoint competitor 7 Comments Samsung NAND flashes its hot measurements: 64L 4G 3D 2C by EY Silicon enhanced, too WD gets flash boom bang from SanDisk swallow +Comment Storage stalwart flashes past lumbering Seagate 2 Comments Midi-archive box from WD stops at 19PB On-premises S3-accessed object store 6 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Intel's FastUIDraw Is Very Promising For Fast, GPU-Accelerated Drawing Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 22 September 2016 at 09:30 AM EDT. 25 Comments Intel Open-Source Technology Center developer Kevin Rogovin just finished presenting at this year's XDC2016 conference in Helsinki. Rogovin presented on the promising 01.org project FastUIDraw. We previously talked about FastUIDraw earlier this month on Phoronix, in case you missed it: Intel Has Been Working On A Fast 2D GPU Renderer Focused On Web Content. Early numbers on FastUIDraw put it much faster than Cairo CPU/OpenGL/Xlib renderers, Qt with its different back-ends, and even the Skia OpenGL layer. The numbers are super promising, but it remains to be seen how far the FastUIDraw adoption will go by open-source projects, with right now it not being really committed to adoption by any major upstream projects wanting super-fast 2D on the Linux desktop. Unfortunately the slides for this FastUIDraw presentation have yet to be uploaded, but you can find the presentation summary via the X.Org Wiki. You can watch the presentation via the X.Org YouTube stream. Hopefully we'll continue hearing more about FastUIDraw in the months ahead. 25 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Lenovo N21 Chromebook Now Has Mainline Coreboot Support Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 22 September 2016 at 07:05 AM EDT. 3 Comments The Lenovo N21 Chromebook is now supported by mainline Coreboot. But then again that's not a huge surprise considering Google's focus on Chromebook/Chromebox support in Coreboot. The Lenovo N21 support is now in mainline Coreboot where as previously this Intel-powered Chromebook code was just found in the Chromium Git tree. The Lenovo N21 is powered by a Celeron N2840 dual-core CPU, 11.6-inch HD display, 2GB or 4GB memory options, 16GB SSD, and up to a 9.5 hour battery life. With this being a modern Intel system, alas there are binary blobs to deal with for Coreboot support. Blobbed up for the N21 Chromebook are the VGA BIOS, firmware descriptor, Intel ME firmware, MRC, and external reference code binaries. Details via this commit with the 2,000+ lines of code for adding support for this Chromebook to mainline Coreboot. If the blobs don't scare you off and do want to play with a system having Coreboot support, the Lenovo N21 Chromebook retails for $185 USD. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Global rail industry news Home News Jobs Tenders Events Publications InnoTrans Business, Freight, InnoTrans, N America, Technology, Traction & Rolling Stock Trains with brains 22 Sep 2016 GE Transportation and Intel Corp have announced a partnership at InnoTrans 2016. INNOTRANS: GE Transportation and Intel Corp have announced a partnership to offer GoLINC, a modular onboard computer package which acts as a 'superbrain' by integrating, storing and communicating the data produced by the hundreds of GE and third-party sensors now found on a locomotive. The system is about ‘leveraging data from the locomotives’, GE Transportation President & CEO Jamie Miller told Railway Gazette. GoLINC integrates with GE's Predix system which identifies trends and enables operators to act before a failure occurs. The aim is to create a smart ecosystem for railways, helping operators meet current market challenges. The GoLINC mobile data centre ‘saves time and lowers costs by reducing the amount of data transferred over cellular connections’, said Val Stoyanov, Intel’s General Manager, Global Transportation. GE needs ‘deep partners’, said Miller, and ‘Intel is an incredible partner’. GE benefitted from early access to the sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor, and has developed a fan-free cooling system for the rugged onboard computers. Miller said she was also ‘very excited’ about a partnership with DB, which is testing GE's predictive maintenance systems with non-GE locos. The pilot is going extremely well, and DB has held ‘great discussions’ during InnoTrans. Across the rail sector, GE was ‘working with customers everywhere’. In South Africa there is a strong commitment to skills development and localisation, where GE is producing ‘the most African locomotive’ in the market with 55% local content. Chinese suppliers have been winning orders in Africa, but Miller said GE was a strong company which ‘has the most advanced technology’, ensuring its products offer high performance, reliability and maintainability, at a highly-competitive total cost of ownership. Miller said GE's primary focus ‘has been and will continue to be’ on freight, and the company has no plans to enter the high speed sector.

Harden Windows 10 for maximum security Lockdown! Harden Windows 10 for maximum security To make the most of Windows 10's security improvements, you must target the right edition and hardware for your needs Fahmida Y. Rashid (InfoWorld) 22 September, 2016 20:00 - - - - print email Comments You may have heard that Microsoft has made Windows 10 more secure than any of its predecessors, packing it with security goodies. What you might not know is that some of these vaunted security features aren’t available out of the box or they require additional hardware -- you may not be getting the level of security you bargained for. Features such as Credential Guard are available for only certain editions of Windows 10, while the advanced biometrics promised by Windows Hello require a hefty investment in third-party hardware. Windows 10 may be the most secure Windows operating system to date, but the security-savvy organization -- and individual user -- needs to keep the following hardware and Windows 10 edition requirements in mind in order to unlock the necessary features to achieve optimum security. [ The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter. ] Note: Presently, there are four desktop editions of Windows 10 -- Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education -- along with multiple versions of each, offering varying levels of beta and preview software. InfoWorld’s Woody Leonard breaks down which version of Windows 10 to use. The following Windows 10 security guide focuses on standard Windows 10 installations -- not Insider Previews or Long Term Servicing Branch -- and includes Anniversary Update where relevant. The right hardware Windows 10 casts a wide net, with minimum hardware requirements that are undemanding. As long as you have the following, you’re good to upgrade from Win7/8.1 to Win10: 1GHz or faster processor, 2GB of memory (for Anniversary Update), 16GB (for 32-bit OS) or 20GB (64-bit OS) disk space, a DirectX 9 graphic card or later with WDDM 1.0 driver, and an 800-by-600-resolution (7-inch or larger screens) display. That describes pretty much any computer from the past decade. But don’t expect your baseline machine to be fully secure, as the above minimum requirements won’t support many of the cryptography-based capabilities in Windows 10. Win10’s cryptography features require Trusted Platform Module 2.0, which provides a secure storage area for cryptographic keys and is used to encrypt passwords, authenticate smartcards, secure media playback to prevent piracy, protect VMs, and secure hardware and software updates against tampering, among other functions. Modern AMD and Intel processors (Intel Management Engine, Intel Converged Security Engine, AMD Security Processor) already support TPM 2.0, so most machines bought in the past few years have the necessary chip. Intel’s vPro remote management service, for example, uses TPM to authorize remote PC repairs. But it’s worth verifying whether TPM 2.0 exists on any system you upgrade, especially given that Anniversary Update requires TPM 2.0 support in the firmware or as a separate physical chip. A new PC, or systems installing Windows 10 from scratch, must have TPM 2.0 from the get-go, which means having an endorsement key (EK) certificate preprovisioned by the hardware vendor as it is shipped. Alternatively, the device can be configured to retrieve the certificate and store it in TPM the first time it boots up. Older systems that don’t support TPM 2.0 -- either because they don’t have the chip installed or are old enough that they have only TPM 1.2 -- will need to get a TPM 2.0-enabled chip installed. Otherwise, they will not be able to upgrade to Anniversary Update at all. While some of the security features work with TPM 1.2, it’s better to get TPM 2.0 whenever possible. TPM 1.2 allows only for RSA and SHA-1 hashing algorithm, and considering the SHA-1 to SHA-2 migration is well under way, sticking with TPM 1.2 is problematic. TPM 2.0 is much more flexible, as it supports SHA-256 and elliptical curve cryptography. Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS is the next piece of must-have hardware for achieving the most secure Windows 10 experience. The device needs to be shipped with UEFI BIOS enabled to allow Secure Boot, which ensures that only operating system software, kernels, and kernel modules signed with a known key can be executed during boot time. Secure Boot blocks rootkits and BIOS-malware from executing malicious code. Secure Boot requires firmware that supports UEFI v2.3.1 Errata B and has the Microsoft Windows Certification Authority in the UEFI signature database. While a boon from a security perspective, Microsoft designating Secure Boot mandatory for Windows 10 has run into controversy, as it makes it harder to run unsigned Linux distributions (such as Linux Mint) on Windows 10-capable hardware. Anniversary Update won’t install unless your device is UEFI 2.31-compliant or later. A short list of Windows 10 features and hardware requirements Windows 10 feature TPM Input/output memory management unit Virtualization extensions SLAT UEFI 2.3.1 For x64 architecture only Credential Guard Recommended Not used Required Required Required Required Device Guard Not used Required Required Required Required Required BitLocker Recommended Not required Not required Not required Not required Not required Configurable code integrity Not required Not required Not required Not required Recommended Recommended Microsoft Hello Recommended Not required Not required Not required Not required Not required VBS Not required Required Required Required Not required Required UEFI Secure Boot Recommended Not required Not required Not required Required Not required Device health attestation through Measured Boot Requires TPM 2.0 Not required Not required Not required Required Required Beefing up authentication, identity Password security has been a significant issue in the past few years, and Windows Hello moves us closer to a password-free world as it integrates and extends biometric logins and two-factor authentication to "recognize" users without passwords. Windows Hello also manages to be simultaneously the most accessible and inaccessible security feature of Windows 10. Yes, it is available across all Win10 editions, but it requires significant hardware investment to get the most of what it has to offer. To protect credentials and keys, Hello requires TPM 1.2 or later. But for devices where TPM is not installed or configured, Hello can use software-based protection to secure credentials and keys instead, so Windows Hello is accessible to pretty much any Windows 10 device. But the best way to use Hello is to store biometric data and other authentication information in the on-board TPM chip, as the hardware protection makes it more difficult for attackers to steal them. Further, to take full advantage of biometric authentication, additional hardware -- such as a specialized illuminated infrared camera or a dedicated iris or fingerprint reader -- is necessary. Most business-class laptops and several lines of consumer laptops ship with fingerprint scanners, enabling businesses to get started with Hello under any edition of Windows 10. But the marketplace is still limited when it comes to depth-sensing 3D cameras for facial recognition and retina scanners for iris-scanning, so Windows Hello’s more advanced biometrics is a future possibility for most, rather than a daily reality. Available for all Windows 10 editions, Windows Hello Companion Devices is a framework for allowing users to use an external device -- such as a phone, access card, or wearable -- as one or more authenticating factors for Hello. Users interested in working with Windows Hello Companion Device to roam with their Windows Hello credentials between multiple Windows 10 systems must have Pro or Enterprise installed on each one. Windows 10 formerly had Microsoft Passport, which enabled users to log in to trusted applications via Hello credentials. With Anniversary Update, Passport no longer exists as a separate feature but is incorporated into Hello. Third-party applications that use the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) specification will be able to support single sign-on by way of Hello. For example, the Dropbox app can be authenticated directly via Hello, and Microsoft’s Edge browser enables integration with Hello to extend to the web. It’s possible to turn on the feature in a third-party mobile device management platform, as well. The password-less future is coming, but not quite yet. Keeping malware out Windows 10 also introduces Device Guard, technology that flips traditional antivirus on its head. Device Guard locks down Windows 10 devices, relying on whitelists to let only trusted applications be installed. Programs aren’t allowed to run unless they are determined safe by checking the file’s cryptographic signature, which ensures all unsigned applications and malware cannot execute. Device Guard relies on Microsoft’s own Hyper-V virtualization technology to store its whitelists in a shielded virtual machine that system administrators can’t access or tamper with. To take advantage of Device Guard, machines must run Windows 10 Enterprise or Education and support TPM, hardware CPU virtualization, and I/O virtualization. Device Guard relies on Windows hardening such as Secure Boot. AppLocker, available only for Enterprise and Education, can be used with Device Guard to set up code integrity policies. For example, administrators can decide to limit which universal applications from the Windows Store can be installed on a device.  Configurable code integrity is another Windows component which verifies that the code running is trusted and sage. Kernel mode code integrity (KMCI) prevents the kernel from executing unsigned drivers. Administrators can manage the policies at the certificate authority or publisher level as well as the individual hash values for each binary executable. Since much of commodity malware tends to be unsigned, deploying code integrity policies lets organizations immediately protect against unsigned malware. Windows Defender, first released as standalone software for Windows XP, became Microsoft’s default malware protection suite, with antispyware and antivirus, in Windows 8. Defender is automatically disabled when a third-party antimalware suite is installed. If there is no competing antivirus or security product installed, make sure that Windows Defender, available across all editions and with no specific hardware requirements, is turned on. For Windows 10 Enterprise users, there is the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, which offers real-time behavioral threat analysis to detect online attacks. Securing data BitLocker, which secures files in an encrypted container, has been around since Windows Vista and is better than ever in Windows 10. With Anniversary Update, the encryption tool is available for Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. Much like Windows Hello, BitLocker works best if TPM is used to protect the encryption keys, but it can also use software-based key protection if TPM does not exist or is not configured. Protecting BitLocker with a password provides the most basic defense, but a better method is to use a smartcard or the Encrypting File System to create a file encryption certificate to protect associated files and folders. When BitLocker is enabled on the system drive and brute-force protection is enabled, Windows 10 can restart the PC and lock access to the hard drive after a specified number of incorrect password attempts. Users would have to type the 48-character BitLocker recovery key to start the device and access the disk. To enable this feature, the system would need to have UEFI firmware version 2.3.1 or later. Windows Information Protection, formerly Enterprise Data Protection (EDP), is available only for Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions. It provides persistent file-level encryption and basic rights management, while also integrating with Azure Active Directory and Rights Management services. Information Protection requires some kind of mobile device management -- Microsoft Intune or a third-party platform such as VMware’s AirWatch -- or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to manage the settings. An admin can define a list of Windows Store or desktop applications that can access work data, or block them entirely. Windows Information Protection helps control who can access data to prevent accidental information leakage. Active Directory helps ease management but is not required to use Information Protection, according to Microsoft. Virtualizing security defenses Credential Guard, available only for Windows 10 Enterprise and Education, can isolate “secrets” using virtualization-based security (VBS) and restrict access to privileged system software. It helps block pass-the-hash attacks, although security researchers have recently found ways to bypass the protections. Even so, having Credential Guard is still better than not having it at all. It runs only on x64 systems and requires UEFI 2.3.1 or greater. Virtualization extensions such as Intel VT-x, AMD-V, and SLAT must be enabled, as well as IOMMU such as Intel VT-d, AMD-Vi, and BIOS Lockdown. TPM 2.0 is recommended in order to enable Device Health Attestation for Credential Guard, but if TPM is not available, software-based protections can be used instead. Another Windows 10 Enterprise and Education feature is Virtual Secure Mode, which is a Hyper-V container that protects domain credentials saved on Windows. Other security goodies Windows 10 supports mobile device management across all editions, but needs to be integrated with a separate MDM platform, such as Microsoft Intune or a third-party platform such as VMware’s AirWatch. If MDM is on the list, the best scenario would be to avoid Windows 10 Home, as not all capabilities are available in that edition. MDM and SCCM platforms can also use the Windows Device Health Attestation Service, available across all editions, to manage conditional access scenarios. Group Policy is a powerful tool for Windows administrators, but it is available with only Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. Domain join and Azure Active Directory Domain join, which enable single sign-on for cloud-hosted applications, are also powerful administrator tools available for Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. Azure Directory Domain join requires a separate Azure Active Directory. Though not strictly a security feature, Assigned Access lets administrators lock down the interface on Windows 10 devices so that users are limited to specific tasks. Available only with an Enterprise E3 subscription (or Education), Assigned Access can restrict access to services; block access to Shut Down, Restart, Sleep, and Hibernate commands; and prevent changes to the Start menu, the taskbar, or the Start screen. Organizations that have deployed DirectAccess infrastructure for remote access will need Windows 10 Enterprise or Education to connect. Picking what you need While Windows 10 Home may be the most limited of the desktop editions when it comes to security, that doesn’t mean users have to shell out for Enterprise to get any of the new features. Regardless of edition, Windows 10 is Microsoft’s most secure operating system to date, and a constant release of security patches, feature updates, and version upgrades will keep it that way. Everyone’s security needs are different. Make sure to buy the edition and establish the configuration that gives you the optimal security you are looking for.

Within the space of the last thirty days we've seen: Intel announce some next-generation CPUs that aren’t very much faster than the last generation of CPUs; Intel delay, again, the release of some of its 10nm process CPUs; and Apple’s new A10 chip, powering iPhone 7, is as one of the fastest CPUs ever. Intel hasn’t lost the plot. In fact, most of the problems in Moore’s Law have come from Intel’s slavish devotion to a single storyline: more transistors and smaller transistors are what everyone needs. That push toward ‘general purpose computing’ gave us thirty years of Wintel, but that no longer looks to be the main game. The CPU is all grown up. Meanwhile, in the five years between iPhone 4S and iPhone 7, Apple has written its obsessive-compulsive desire for complete control into silicon. Every twelve months another A-series System-on-a-Chip makes its way into the Apple product line, and every time performance increases enormously. You might think that’s to be expected - after all, those kinds of performance improvements are what Moore’s Law guarantees. But the bulk of the speed gains in the A-series (about a factor of twelve over the last five years) don’t come from making more, smaller transistors. Instead, they come from Apple’s focus on using only those transistors needed for their smartphones and tablets. Although the new A10 hosts an ARM four-core big.LITTLE CPU, every aspect of Apple’s chip is highly tuned to both workload and iOS kernel-level task management. It’s getting hard to tell where Apple’s silicon ends and its software begins. And that’s exactly the point. The cheap and easy gains of the last fifty years of Moore’s Law gave birth to a global technology industry. The next little while - somewhere between twenty and fifty years out - will be dominated by a transition from software into hardware, a confusion of the two so complete it will literally become impossible to know where the boundary between the two lies. Apple isn’t alone; NVIDIA has been driving its GPUs through the same semiconductor manufacturing process nodes that Intel pioneers, growing more, smaller transistors to draw pretty pictures on displays, while simultaneously adding custom bits to move some of the work previously done in software - such as rendering stereo pairs for virtual reality displays - into the hardware. A process that used to cost 2x the compute for every display frame now comes essentially for free. Longtime watchers of the technology sector will note this migration from software into hardware has been a feature of computing for the last fifty years. But for all that time the cheap gains of ever-faster CPUs versus the hard work of designing and debugging silicon circuitry meant only the most important or time-critical tasks migrated into silicon. Now that Moore’s Law has given up the ghost, we’re seeing a migration away from software and into hardware, wringing every last bit of capacity out of the transistor. This transition is already well underway. Last month The Register revealed that Microsoft had designed a custom processor for its HoloLens virtual reality goggles. This surprisingly sophisticated 24-core DSP handles all of the data flowing in from the HoloLens’ many spatial sensors, taking a huge processing burden away from its rather wimpy Atom CPU - and does the job two hundred times faster. It took a specialised team of silicon designers to create the Hololens DSP, because designing chips is hard work, fraught with trial and error and poor support tools. It’s an elite field requiring highly specialist skills. Pretty much where software was thirty years ago. Now that the drive into hardware is well and truly on, we can expect a new generation of tools - many backed by machine learning and artificial intelligence capacities - to make chip design significantly easier. Whether it ever becomes as easy as writing code is an open question - but between FPGAs today and nanoscale 3D printing tomorrow there’s every reason to suspect the ‘build’ phase in the late 2020s will be precisely that - building a chip. It’s just this that makes the Mystorm project so very interesting. Sitting somewhere between the friendly hackability of Arduino and the deep power of the Raspberry Pi, Mystorm wants to make FPGA design accessible and cheap, because it’s designed to sit on the Raspberry Pi’s 40-pin connector, and they’re aiming for a stripped-bare retail cost of around $30 - same as Raspberry Pi. But hardware is only half the battle here. If we want 11 year-olds designing custom hardware (and we very much do want that) we’ll need to give them the kinds of tools and support and endless YouTube videos they already have whenever they do an Arduino or Raspberry Pi project -- resources also useful for a generation of programmers in their 20s who will spend much of the rest of their careers cozying up to the silicon. Then Moore’s Law will live on, long after we’ve reached its physical constraints, as we explore the limits of creativity and imagination. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 74 Comments More from The Register White House to bring us up to speed on artificial intelligence hype latest Will AI kill or cure? 11 Comments New York outlaws ticket-hoarding buybots Big Apple puts the kibosh on scalper scripts 26 Comments New York decides not to tinker with vendor lock-down for now 'Fair Repair Act' returned in its original packaging 19 Comments TWC celebrates $79bn Charter merger by blacking out in New York Start spreading the news.

First announced in December at the Node.js Interactive conference, the toolkit is a graphic programming environment for IoT devices. It provides a browser-based HTML5 IDE, covering the workflows of the device's internal logic, with HTML5 for the end user interface. Node.js-based distributed middleware hosts and executes the IoT application, there's an Orchestration Center handling the workflow execution, and Web servers to host both the IDE and user interface. Service Hubs in the middleware manage both the devices and the cloud services. Presenting the first version last year, Intel's Jonathan Ding said in the long term, Chipzilla expects IoT app stores will develop, and developers will need to be able to move fast, churning out new applications connecting IoT things to the services they need. It's also designed to be neutral to the various competing IoT protocols various vendor collaborations are pushing. The IoT Services Orchestration Layer follows the familiar model in which devices connect to a gateway (the Service Hub in Intel-speak). However, the Service Hub does more than just pass communications back and forth: it's also responsible for discovering and adapting to new devices and the protocols they use. Next layer up in the model, either in the cloud or on a local server, the workflow engine and orchestration layer handles business logic. The code is here, and Ding's presentation is below. ® https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htGdoQTliOQ Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Intel's new chip targets industrial IoT The E3900 family doubles performance 20 Comments Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 28 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

This primer will help you make sense of CPU jargon. By Erik Eckel | September 21, 2016, 12:59 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus 12-inch MacBook (left) and 13-inch MacBook Air (right) Image: Sarah Tew/CNET When shopping for a new Mac, here's how to make sense of common processor terms—such as dual-core performance and Turbo Boost—and better decide whether an upgrade over Apple's default configuration might prove warranted. SEE: Research: Apple's Growing Role in the Enterprise (Tech Pro Research) The CPU's role A computer's central processing unit (the CPU) is a critical component. Think of the processor as the engine that drives the computer. Faster processors typically equate to quicker execution of commands. What does that mean for Mac users? A faster processor is capable of completing Photoshop edits, for example, more quickly than a slower processor. What's Hot at TechRepublic The antique computers that just won't quit Windows 10: The Sirius A is a full desktop PC that fits in your pocket If there's a tech skills shortage, why are so many computer graduates unemployed? Subscribe to TechRepublic's Tech News You Can Use newsletter Don't confuse a faster processor with more memory, however. While a faster processor helps a computer execute commands more quickly, memory is responsible for temporarily storing data for processes and executions the CPU is executing. Thankfully, Apple professionals need not fully appreciate the complexities connecting CPU and memory performance; Mac users can trust that Apple's engineers have specified optimal computer configurations, while providing customization options. The purpose of this discussion is to help ensure Mac users understand basic CPU terms and make the best choices when selecting from the customization options Apple offers, especially as CPUs (for all practical purposes) can't be upgraded once a Mac is purchased. Processor jargon explained Likely the first thing most customers notice about a Mac's CPU when considering which model to buy is the processor's speed, measured in gigahertz, commonly abbreviated as GHz. The higher the number, the faster the performance. Thus, a 3.1Ghz typically performs remarkably faster than a 1.6GHz CPU. Here's where it gets tricky. Modern Mac CPUs possess multiple cores. These multiple cores are two or more independent processing units capable of operating simultaneously. Most Macs possess multi-core processors now. Default MacBook CPU configurations possess dual-core Intel chips. Default MacBook Air CPU configurations, for both 11" and 13" models, possess dual-core Intel chips. Default 13" MacBook Pro CPU configurations possess dual-core Intel chips, while the 15" models boast quad-core Intel processors. Default 21.5" iMac CPU configurations provide a choice of either dual-core or quad-core chips, while 27" iMac models pack quad-core processors. Default Mac Pro CPU configurations provide a choice of either quad-core or six-core higher-end Intel CPUs. Default Mac mini CPU configurations possess dual-core chips. If you're unfamiliar with processor specs, the Mac mini's 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 chip may not appear that much slower than the Mac Pro's 3.5GHz Intel Xeon processor, but a tremendous performance gap separates the two chips. While the Mac mini's Intel Core i5 chip boasts two cores, the Mac Pro's Intel Xeon chip packs six cores. And, before hardcore technicians begin weighing in on clock speed, motherboard performance, memory configuration, hard disk specifications, capacity requirements, multi-threading advantages, and L3 cache dependencies, the purpose of this piece is to help laymen better understand basic CPU terminology. That said, the Intel Xeon chip also boasts significant capacity improvements that place the CPU in a wholly different category designed to better power intense computer processing tasks and applications. SEE: The new MacBook Pro: Will it solve the Apple laptop shopper's dilemma? (CNET) Most Mac users will find the system they're considering purchasing—whether it's a MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, or Mac mini—possesses either Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processors intended for common computing or, in some cases, mobile operation. In the case of mobile processors, typically noted by an "m" in the name (such as the MacBook's Intel Core m3 chip), Intel tweaks processor performance to better manage mobile computing needs and better accommodate battery life requirements, among other elements. But the Mac Pro packs the Intel Xeon chip, an enterprise-grade CPU capable of accommodating intensive audio and video production tasks, fulfilling demanding scientific and engineering calculations, and rendering 3D graphics, as is required by manufacturers, architects, and others. Most laymen only need to remember that a quad-core processor running at 2.8GHz is exponentially faster than an older single-core CPU that may have run at 4.4GHz, by virtue of additional cores being available to essentially each run at the same speed and therefore complete more calculations simultaneously. Then there's Turbo Boost, a concept that confuses some Mac users. Apple professionals shopping for a new Mac will note that Apple lists the Turbo Boost speed for the system's processor. For example, the standard MacBook Air includes a 1.6GHz Intel Core i5 CPU that possesses Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz. That's quite a GHz leap. Mac users can rest assured there's nothing they need to do to receive the benefit of the faster 2.7GHz processing technology. Turbo Boost is just a fancy method Intel uses to describe the chip's ability to automatically run at faster speeds when demand requires and when power, temperature, and thermal design limits are all within an accepted range. SEE: How to navigate Apple's repair and support programs using these quick tips Should you opt for a CPU upgrade? So, how do you make sense of these specifications and determine whether you should accept a CPU upgrade Apple offers for the Mac you're considering purchasing? Ask yourself whether you intend to use the Mac according to how it was designed. If you're buying a MacBook Air, which prioritizes mobile operation and portability, and you intend to edit video or perform demanding scientific calculations (tasks better managed by a MacBook Pro or a Mac Pro), you should definitely consider accepting Apple's CPU upgrade option. On the other hand, if you're purchasing an iMac (or any other Mac, for that matter) and intend to use it only as a client workstation for powering common Office applications such as Word and Excel, processing email, and surfing the internet, the standard configuration will work well. If CAD drawing, architecture, three-dimensional rendering, and similar demanding video tasks are common requirements, opt for a CPU upgrade. If audio and video creation, editing, and publishing are planned, opt for the CPU upgrade. In such cases, I also recommend buyers consider purchasing the memory upgrade, too. Based on my experiences As a technology consultant supporting hundreds of businesses over more than a decade, clients have almost never, if ever, complained of performance issues when they've accepted my recommendation to purchase the fastest CPU and most memory they can afford. The two meld together in an elegant, complex dance that speed performance and accelerate the everyday routine of starting and shutting down a system, opening and closing applications, and completing common edits and processes.

This year is no exception. The Apple device teardown revealed a number of interesting details and confirmed a rumor we’d heard before — Intel did indeed win at least some of the iPhone 7’s modem business (Intel builds the modem inside the AT&T and T-Mobile devices, denoted as the A1778 and A1784). The Verizon and Sprint products (A1660 and A1661) use a Qualcomm modem. Chipworks, which performed the teardown and analysis, doesn’t dive into the implications of a dual-sourced modem between Intel and Qualcomm, but this may have practical repercussions depending on how you intend to use the device. Because Intel’s modems don’t support CDMA, you won’t be able to take AT&T or T-Mobile devices to non-GSM networks. The Qualcomm modems, in contrast, support both GSM and CDMA, meaning they should be compatible on any carrier network across the country. Still, this is a huge feather in Intel’s cap. The company hasn’t had great luck pushing its XMM modems into high-profile device wins — at least, none it has prominently discussed. Apple’s sheer volume should drive materially higher profits for Chipzilla’s networking division. Unlike the iPhone 6s, which featured dual-sourcing between Samsung and TSMC, the iPhone 7 may be a TSMC-only design. Die size on the new chip is 125mm sq, a 20% size increase over the A9’s 104.5mm sq (at TSMC, the Samsung variant was smaller). According to Chipworks, the A10 is considerably more dense than the A9 thanks to better packing on Apple’s part — a straight scale-out of the A9 would’ve left Apple with a chip nearly 150mm sq, as compared to a relatively svelte 125mm sq. The chip is built on TSMC’s 16FFC process. The “C” stands for compact, and the new node is intended for use in mainstream and low-power markets. Compared with 16nm FF+ (second-generation FinFET), FFC reduces SRAM area, leakage, and supports ultra-low power voltage modes (down to 0.6v). The diagram above shows Chipworks estimate on where specific features are located, after Anandtech helped them narrow down potential feature locations on the “little” CPU cores. The battery is a 1960mAh unit, compared with the 1810mAh pack used in the iPhone 6s. The batteries that failed on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, in contrast, are nearly twice this size. Overall, the iPhone 7 is a significant manufacturing step forward for Apple, a solid debut for TSMC’s 16FFC process node, and a major win for Intel, which can claim a significant design win for its own modem technology.

This is sensationalist, untrue and distracts from a genuine problem. The background is straightforward. Intel platforms allow the storage to be configured in two different ways - "standard" (normal AHCI on SATA systems, normal NVMe on NVMe systems) or "RAID". "RAID" mode is typically just changing the PCI IDs so that the normal drivers won't bind, ensuring that drivers that support the software RAID mode are used. Intel have not submitted any patches to Linux to support the "RAID" mode. In this specific case, Lenovo's firmware defaults to "RAID" mode and doesn't allow you to change that. Since Linux has no support for the hardware when configured this way, you can't install Linux (distribution installers will boot, but won't find any storage device to install the OS to). Why would Lenovo do this? I don't know for sure, but it's potentially related to something I've written about before - recent Intel hardware needs special setup for good power management. The storage driver that Microsoft ship doesn't do that setup. The Intel-provided driver does. "RAID" mode prevents the Microsoft driver from binding and forces the user to use the Intel driver, which means they get the correct power management configuration, battery life is better and the machine doesn't melt. (Why not offer the option to disable it? A user who does would end up with a machine that doesn't boot, and if they managed to figure that out they'd have worse power management. That increases support costs. For a consumer device, why would you want to? The number of people buying these laptops to run anything other than Windows is miniscule) Things are somewhat obfuscated due to a statement from a Lenovo rep:This system has a Signature Edition of Windows 10 Home installed. It is locked per our agreement with Microsoft. It's unclear what this is meant to mean. Microsoft could be insisting that Signature Edition systems ship in "RAID" mode in order to ensure that users get a good power management experience. Or it could be a misunderstanding regarding UEFI Secure Boot - Microsoft do require that Secure Boot be enabled on all Windows 10 systems, but (a) the user must be able to manage the key database and (b) there are several free operating systems that support UEFI Secure Boot and have appropriate signatures. Neither interpretation indicates that there's a deliberate attempt to prevent users from installing their choice of operating system. The real problem here is that Intel do very little to ensure that free operating systems work well on their consumer hardware - we still have no information from Intel on how to configure systems to ensure good power management, we have no support for storage devices in "RAID" mode and we have no indication that this is going to get better in future. If Intel had provided that support, this issue would never have occurred. Rather than be angry at Lenovo, let's put pressure on Intel to provide support for their hardware.

It did not boot properly though. Since these are notebook systems with a single disk anyway, is that what they are treating the system as? (i.e. RAID 0 with a single disk) Is there any way to update GRUB to boot off of such a thing? All that said, I think Intel absolutely should be held responsible, they certainly push themselves as a Linux friendly company, and disk controllers should be a basic device I should always be able to access.

Linux boots fine. > Even if the device would get worse battery life (which we don't know that it would, and nobody who booted up Linux on the ISK model or Live on the ISK2 reported their laptop "melting"), it should be up to the user. Why should it be up to the user? Should the user be able to program every memory timing option, even if by doing so they introduce occasional crashes? Should they be able to set every thermal threshold, even if by doing so they're reducing their hardware life expectancy? All hardware vendors restrict the options available to users. > You say that if your guess is right, it's a cheap hack to work around crappy power management in Windows.

The requirements for ARM were the exact opposite (they say that the user must *not* be able to change the key), though since barely anyone's doing Windows-on-ARM any more that's becoming increasingly less relevant. The UEFI specification (where Secure Boot is actually defined) doesn't prescribe anything about how it should be set up out of the box in any particular firmware implementation (whether any keys should be pre-loaded, whose they should be if so, whether there should be an interface for changing them, etc.) Link Reply Thread from start Parent Thread Expand Hide 1 comment Show 1 comment Re: Microsoft's Secure Boot requirementsFrom: (Anonymous) - Date: 2016-09-23 04:33 am (UTC) - Expand Dell XPS 15 InfinityEdgeDate: 2016-09-21 10:29 pm (UTC) From: xnox [launchpad.net] I have skylake Dell XPS 15 Infinity Edge. It came with NVMe hard drive configured in a RAID setting which was not recognised by the Ubuntu installer. In the BIOS settings I was able to change that to something normal instead (it was listed as AHCI or some such), after that NVMe based installation worked with Ubuntu, but Windows 10 failed to boot. To resolve that, I had to reboot Windows 10 in safety mode, switch from raid to AHCI, boot into safety mode again, which I guess regenerated the "kernel modules included in the Windows boot process" or some such. After that, both Ubuntu and Windows 10 boot happily ever after. This is unfortunately well documented https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Host_Controller_Interface#Boot_issues I wish windows would always include AHCI driver and/or the OEMs/Vendors did. Are we sure that it's not just the standard Intel Matrix Raid configuration which is supported by MDADM? Ubuntu Desktop installer doesn't support Intel Matrix RAID configuration out of the box at the time.

As you point out, that's not a laptop thing. The issue is that Intel have not told anybody how to properly-manage power in their hardware; instead, they have released a binary-blob driver for Windows that just does it right. However, for the driver to do things right, Microsoft's driver mustn't bind to the hardware first. The easiest way for Lenovo to achieve this is to put the hardware into RAID mode, and not to let it come out. That means the MS driver examines the hardware, decides it can't deal with it, and ignores it, leaving the Intel driver to come along and claim it. Presumably the Intel driver is perfectly happy to run in single-disc JBOD mode, but it does it with the right power management. The end result, according to Matthew, is "correct power management configuration, battery life is better and the machine doesn't melt". I'm not saying it's a good thing, and I don't think Matthew is either. It's just the easiest way for Lenovo to deal with Intel's stupid secret-sauce power management, in a Windows context.

Such patches are unnecessary, as mdadm already supports Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST - http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/architecture-and-technology/rapid-storage-technology.html ) for simple RAID (e.g. levels 0, 1, 10) arrays, allowing them to be assembled as md or dmraid devices under Linux. However, it would appear that the version of mdadm in shipping versions of Ubuntu (at least - maybe other distros too) doesn't support the Smart Response Technology (SRT - http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/smart-response-technology.html ) feature that's a part of RST and is used by Lenovo to build a hybrid one-stripe RAID0 device from the HDD with a cache on the SSD (I'm sure Lenovo have a good reason for not using a SSHD). Dan Williams of Intel submitted a series of patches to mdadm to support SRT back in April 2014: https://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&r=1&b=201404&w=2 . Perhaps now there's shipping hardware that requires them, there'll be the impetus for distro vendors to get them integrated into mdadm, and their auto-detection in their installers to use the functionality provided sanely.

BTW, I don't know if mdadm would detect the RAID controller/disk immediately upon installation, or it would require a reboot. In the latter case you may wish to use a USB key with enough spare room to save the system status and reboot. I'd use UNetBootin to prepare such a USB key. The main issue here is, a user who doesn't even see a disk, probably wouldn't know to go as far as installing mdadm. IMHO, given the broadening diffusion of NVMe and RAID devices, Debian, Canonical, REDHAT, Fedora etc. might wish to make mdadm part of their live images by default (and eventually strip it from the installed system if it's unnecessary).

Why we have a standard like AHCI then? The real problem here is that AHCI firmwares are crap, and RAID will not solve problems with overheating, neither make better power consumption counters. RAID is doing the right thing in this specific case, because a lot of companies create AHCI firmware with no optimizations at all, so forcing a "default sane" for power consumption makes the sensation that RAID mode is a better standard. Until proven wrong, this is still a move to let Linux out of the market, and if Lenovo is not the one to blame, is the one guilty of colluding with Intel to delay Linux support on this equipment.

Link Reply no subjectDate: 2016-09-23 05:23 am (UTC) From: (Anonymous) Someone on Reddit suggested that since Linux doesn't use BIOS calls for anything and addresses the hardware in native mode, and the hardware still supports AHCI native mode, that someone should "teach GRUB read-only RAID support" and then have the kernel set to switch the hardware out of RAID and into AHCI native mode as soon as it is loaded. Is this an option? Sorry if this is obviously not an answer. As for the power management thing, Dell lets you turn off the same "RAID" mode and boot Linux. What kind of runtime loss are we talking here? Can't be that bad or someone would have said something. SSDs use like 2 watts? Even if it never goes into power saving mode, it's about like turning your backlight up 5%, right? Link Reply Thread Hide 6 comments Show 6 comments no subjectDate: 2016-09-23 05:26 am (UTC) From: mjg59 If you wanted to try that, the best place to do it would be the UEFI setup code in the kernel under arch/x86/boot/compressed/eboot.c - that way you can do it independent of bootloader. Grub's able to read files anyway since it's using the firmware calls to do that. The power management thing isn't about the SSD itself, it's about ensuring that the controller is programmed correctly so that the entire CPU package can enter deep sleep states. Modern systems should idle at around 4W at most, so small amounts make abig difference here.

While this looks like an attention seeking headline, it's true. The first laptop I installed Linux on was about 15 odd years ago - while I had some trouble I got it going eventually. Most follow up laptops where from a variety of suppliers (dell, toshiba, acer etc) and I never had a problem to get any of the hardware working. The last two laptops are two rather new laptops, both with UEFI/LEGACY, both with AHCI, both with INTEL hardware and all INTEL hardware known to work. One is a Lenovo Yoga, the other one is a Dell XPS 12. It took me about 1 hour to get it to go on the Dell, I did that in a number of steps. I first made some space at the end of the drive creating a 30GB space, then tried Fedora 23 without UEFI in Legacy mode - it worked first go. I then wiped that partition again, changed back to full UEFI, installed Fedora 23 with full UEFI enabled. Grub has taken over and I can easily switch between Linux and Windows 10, all hardware working albeit the touch pad being touchy - but that's the case too in Win10. Not so the Lenovo - I tried everything for a week. I did RTFM, I read so many articles on the web, I followed every trick of the trade I have learned with myriads of kernel switches, debugging - you name it. I tried. I have given up, my first failure to ever get a computer to work with Linux. Luckily there is VmWare and Kali Linux. Sorry, Lenovo sucks.

Go out and buy LAST YEAR'S model of the damn machine, which should be able to install whatever it is you want on it. Then when sales of this "most recent" PC go way down?...then maybe they'll pull it from store shelves and online retailers, realizing that now more than ever? the one thing people want most? isn't flash, isn't bling, isn't cute names or matching headphones, the one thing that today's millennial consumer wants? Is choice. and along with choice comes freedom, why do you think it is that Microsoft has hitched itself to Linux with their "Microsoft Loves Linux" campaign? it's to make sure they stay in the public eye and relevant, because more and more people are CHOOSING to buy a Windows PC and install LINUX on it!

Last year's machine had a significantly slower graphics chip. The HD 520 isn't really good for much more than displaying a spreadsheet. Especially not at the high resolutions the screen is capable of. The Iris 540 graphics chip...I've seen benchmarks that suggest it's about 60% faster. So you could run the older model on Linux, if you never wanted to run anything more complicated than a web browser.

Taking his numbers (which might not be for Skylake) the change in 'idle time' for a 66Wh battery (like in the Yoga 900) between 5W and 8.5W is 13.2 hours and 7.7 hours. Going to go out on a limb here and say that Skylake is probably more efficient. Any activity on the machine will of course make it use more power. I've had mine running all week with Ubuntu and off the charger for several days... so sleep works obviously. I'm not noticing any thermal issues which would worry me more. I'm about to start compiling kernels on it so we'll see how that goes... if anything is going to push the thermal management it's that. I guess what annoys me about all of this is that Lenovo could have just stated this up front; made the patched BIOS available and with the disclaimer it might negatively affect battery performance and cause more thermal throttling. I would be perfectly happy with that... I don't do many eight hour solid sessions on a laptop away from power. YMMV. What's more annoying is that if you go and read the Intel forums they say go and talk to the Linux kernel developers... and then the kernel developers say Intel doesn't provide the details. Intel have been doing some great work with Linux lately but obviously this isn't one of those areas...

By using the word "support", confusion is introduced. We need to know how to program the hardware we buy. No organization wants to sign up for support. The word is toxic. The business folks will never understand so long as this word is used. Please don't use it. Please ask, "How do I program the hardware you want me to buy?". "I'm not telling" means I keep shopping. It has nothing to do with support organizations or special intellectual property. If I can't program it, I don't own it, so why would I pay for it?

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Shuttle XPC nano NC02U machines pack Skylake SoCs by Zak Killian  11:00 AM on September 21, 2016 Shuttle, the company that can be named responsible for the original explosion of small-form-factor desktop computing, is bringing out a new series of XPC SFF PCs. However, unlike the XPCs you might be familiar with from the days of yore, these little computers are more akin to the Intel NUC than something like those Syber Cs from yesterday. Shuttle describes its XPC nano NC02U series as "palm-sized 4K portable" PCs. These machines come in four separate bare-bones configurations, all revolving around Intel Skylake SoCs. The base NC02U model uses the Celeron 3855U, a dual-core unit clocked at 1.6GHz. Things get a little more interesting going up the range. The NC02U3 packs a Core i3-6100U with two cores and four threads clocked at 2.3GHz, while the NC02U5 goes with a Core i5-6200U that's roughly similar to the previous model but can hit Turbo speeds up to 2.8GHz. Finally, the high-end NC02U7 contains a Core i7-6500U SoC, a dual-core, four-thread unit with 4MB of cache, 2.5GHz base clocks and Turbo clocks up to 3.1GHz. Aside from the SoC used, all four configurations are equivalent. Graphics are handled by the Intel SoC, and the little barebones machines support up to 32GB of DDR3L-1600 via a pair of SODIMM slots. An Intel I211 adapter handles Gigabit Ethernet duties, while Realtek supplies the chips for the audio section and the M.2 802.11n Wi-Fi card. Users can store data on M.2 SSDs (residing on a slot separate from the Wi-Fi adapter), or use a 2.5" SATA disk. Unusually, the NC02U offers support for 15-mm-tall 2.5" devices, too. While the modern Intel SoCs on offer can certainly pull HTPC duty in the living room, the inclusion of a decidedly old-school DB9 serial port on one side marks the NC02U series as potentially ready for commercial and industrial markets. Shuttle says that these little PCs are well-suited for signage, kiosks, and point-of-sale systems. Besides the retro serial port, the NC02Us include four USB 2.0 ports as well as USB 3.0 Type-A and Type-C connectors. Video output comes by way of HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, although Shuttle doesn't specify version numbers for those. A regular old 3.5mm audio jack rounds out the external connectivity. Shuttle says the XPC nano NC02U mini-PCs are available now.

After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. “Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.” iPhone 7 in Jet Black   Same shape. No 3.5mm audio jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device’s haptic engine, which provides the “click” feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. “Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill — not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine,” Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7’s storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) – which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone. From a cost perspective, the shift from 16GB/64GB/128GB iPhones to 32GB/128GB/256GB is a big jump. “Despite significant cost erosion in NAND flash over the last year, this increase in the overall memory cost definitely puts pressure on the bill of materials costs — and therefore margins — from Apple’s perspective,” Rassweiler said. Intel returns The Intel design win, and six years of absence that Intel had from the iPhone, is important to note. Even so, Intel still shares the processor business with Qualcomm. “Whereas Apple strives to have ‘one iPhone model for all carriers and markets,’ there are a number of different hardware permutations supporting various countries and carriers,” Rassweiler said. “Apple will likely look for ways to simplify the design moving forward, which means one supplier – whether Intel or Qualcomm – will likely dominate, as part of supplier and SKU streamlining.” According to Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics, IHS Markit, “Largely left behind in the 4G LTE market, Intel has finally worked itself back into the iPhone, which is a huge win, but not one that is going to be financially significant in the near term for Intel.” RF paths Apple has also eliminated segmented antenna bands, which means the company is pushing all radio-frequency (RF) paths to the very ends of the phone – both on the top and bottom. The aluminum uni-body construction and design forces all RF paths into those two locations. Whereas other smartphones use a glass back and RF components with antennas mounted on the ample back spaces, Apple is restricted to just two physical antennas. “This design limitation may force Apple to go back to an all-glass design again so that they can fit in 4x4MIMO LTE antennas and more features like wireless charging in the next iPhone iteration,” Lam said. Modem moved The baseband thin modem has been moved next to the A10 processor. Prior to the iPhone 7, the thin modem was always on the other side of the SIM card receptacle. “This is a subtle change but likely shows us where Apple wants to take this,” Lam said, “eventually putting the thin modem right on the apps processor package or even integrating it into the A-series processor.” Officially water resistant iPhone 7 is now officially rated as water resistant. “We also saw evidence of this water proofing design evolution in the earlier iPhone 6S, which included additional gasketing around critical connectors, as well as the use of WiFi antenna at the end of the primary speaker box,”Lam said. “Doing so pushes the antennas near the only other opening, for better reception and transmission.” Jet-black polished case Jet black polish is a new option on 128GB and 256GB models. “This is a new feature that produces a whole new look for the iPhone,” Lam said. “It is a lower yielding, time-intensive manufacturing step that adds cost, as well as considerable value, pushing the retail price higher for those requesting this option.” Antenna speaker design The antenna speaker design on the iPhone 7 came from the WiFi antenna packed into the speakers of Apple’s MacBook. “Apple likes to reuse these unique designs throughout their product lines,” Lam said. In a first for the iPhone series, the headset speaker now doubles as a stereo speaker. Upgraded camera While not as groundbreaking as the two optical paths in the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera has now been upgraded to optical image stabilization (OIS), for better low light performance. Improved battery life The battery has been increased to 1960mAhr capacity from 1715mAh in the previous iPhone 6s. This change is consistent with Apple’s claims of improved battery life.

We have Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus units and they pick up fingerprints like crazy (but, the finish is worth the extra effort to keep them clean). The weirdness of washing them under a running faucet and simply drying them off is exceeded only by the joy of being able to do so and the sparkling results such simple cleaning delivers!

Maybe it is generational, but I see a cell phone as a necessary pain in the ass and an iPad as a compromise only marginally better than a real computer. I will take a Mac any day over any touchscreen phone or tablet. I never hardly use either at home or at work.

After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. “Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.” iPhone 7 in Jet Black   Same shape. No 3.5mm audio jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device’s haptic engine, which provides the “click” feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. “Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill — not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine,” Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7’s storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) – which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone.

They have become powerful enough to be the primary computing platform for many households. However, consumers looking for UCFF PCs for specialized applications and industrial usage have been contending with high prices and lack of suitable options. GIGABYTE's BRIX family has emerged over the last several years as a compelling alternative to the Intel NUCs. With Skylake-U, GIGABYTE's BRIX family has expanded with multiple options catering to various market segments. This review will take a look at the GB-BSi7HAL-6500, a Skylake-U UCFF PC with two gigabit LAN ports. Introduction The Skylake-U platform for mini-PCs has turned out to be an interesting one. Numerous challenges were faced by the first one in the market - the Intel Skylake NUC. Eventual BIOS fixes made the platform realize its full potential. All these aspects made Intel's partners take it a bit slow when it came to promoting their Skylake-U mini-PCs. GIGABYTE's Skylake-U BRIX series first came into the news late last year for being one of the first OEM PCs to sport the Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller. The product took a long time to appear in the market after the announcement. GIGABYTE, in the meanwhile, worked upon slightly tweaking various aspects of the platform to create new SKUs that could cater to a wider market. A look at the GIGABYTE BRIX listings shows more than 20 different Skylake-U units (models starting with GB-BS). Readers might find it useful to narrow down the offerings with the following guide to parsing the model numbers. Each barebones Skylake BRIX SKU has a model number fitting the following format: GB-BS<CoreSeriesIdentifier-01>(H)(T|A)(L|C)-<CoreSeriesIdentifier-02> The CPU in the SKU can be determined using the CoreSeriesIdentifier. For example, our review sample, the GB-BS<i7>HAL-<6500> has the Intel Core i7-6500U. The other parts of the model number are optional. For example, we have the GB-BSi7-6500, which is essentially a Skylake-U NUC clone with no bells and whistles, but, just sporting a CPU option that the Intel NUC lineup doesn't provide. The optional components indicate the presence of the following features: H = 2.5" drive support T = Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2 using the Alpine Ridge chipset A = Dual USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports (1x Type-A and 1x Type-C) using the ASMedia 1142 USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller L = Dual RJ-45 gigabit LAN ports C = COM (RS-232) port (RJ-45 slot similar to the L SKU, and a RJ-45 to COM cable bundled) GIGABYTE sampled us the barebones version of the GB-BSi7HAL-6500. We completed the configuration using a Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD and 2x16 GB Crucial Ballistix Sport LT DDR SODIMMs. Though the SODIMMs are capable of operating at 2400 MHz, the BRIX set it to operate at 2133 MHz. The specifications of our review configuration are summarized below. GIGABYTE GB-BSi7HAL-6500 Specifications Processor Intel Core i7-6500U Skylake, 2C/4T, 2.5 GHz (Turbo to 3.1 GHz), 14nm, 4MB L2, 15W TDP Memory Crucial Ballistix Sport LT BLS16G4S240FSD.16FAD DDR4 15-15-15-35 @ 2133 MHz 2x16 GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 520 Disk Drive(s) Toshiba OCZ RD400 (512 GB; M.2 Type 2280 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe; Toshiba 15nm; MLC) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 (1x1 802.11ac - 433 Mbps) Intel Gigabit Ethernet Connection I210 Intel Gigabit Ethernet Connection I219-LM Audio 3.5mm Headphone / Microphone Combo Jack (Realtek ALC555) Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Display 1x mini-DP 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) 1x HDMI 1.4b (4096x2160 @ 24Hz) Miscellaneous I/O Ports 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C 2x USB 3.0 Type-A Operating System Retail unit is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing (As configured) $591 ($1030) Full Specifications GB-BSi7HAL-6500 Specifications Buy GIGABYTE GB-BSi7HAL-6500 Dual LAN mini-PC on Amazon.com The GB-BSi7HAL-6500 come with a CD and a read-only USB key containing Windows drivers. In any case, we ended up installing the latest drivers downloaded off GIGABYTE's product support page. In addition to the main unit, the other components of the package include a 65 W (19V @ 3.42A) adapter with a US power connector, a VESA mount (along with the necessary screws), a driver CD and USB key, and a quick-start guide. The unit also supports a 2.5" drive. The appropriate SATA cable (data and power together in the typical notebook form factor) is pre-installed inside the main unit (as can be seen in the gallery below). Gallery: GIGABYTE GB-BSi7HAL-6500 Chassis Design & Internals The metal frame on the inside of the bottom lid (which holds the 2.5" drive in place) also has a thermal pad positioned to aid in the dissipation of heat from any M.2 SSD used in the system. Platform Analysis The GB-BSi7HAL-6500 is based on the standard Skylake-U platform with the Sunrise Point-LP PCH integrated in the same package as the CPU. There are a maximum of 16 possible high-speed I/O lanes in a Skylake-U system, and they can be configured in a flexible manner. The PCIe lanes in our configuration of the GB-BSi7HAL-6500 are distributed as follows: PCI-E 3.0 x2 port #1      In Use @ x2 (ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #3      In Use @ x1 (Intel I210 Gigabit Network Connection) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #6      In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 AC HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 3.0 x4 port #9      In Use @ x4 (Toshiba OCZ RD400 M.2 NVMe Drive) In the table below, we have an overview of the various systems that we are comparing the GIGABYTE GB-BSi7HAL-6500 against. Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the GB-BSi7HAL-6500 when we come to those sections.

POST A COMMENT 25 Comments View All Comments cknobman - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link The price on these platforms is downright ridiculous. I know small has its price but at this point it just seems like Intel is profiteering. Reply powerarmour - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link That price is an utter joke. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link More like mockery. Reply nagi603 - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link Yeah, for the same price, (well, actually quite less, but with "only" 16GB ram and a 256GB SSD) I put together a mini-ITX box with a proper desktop-class i7.... And thanks to the bigger size, it is quite silent. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link You know, I actually got rather excited when I saw it'd be a dual LAN mini PC on Skylake, as this would work out very well for a pfSense router-box. >$591. >$1030 as configured. No thanks... Might be better to stick with one of those cheap chinese dual lan mini-PCs instead... Reply barleyguy - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link The Zotac ZBox EN760 has GTX 960 graphics as well as the dual lan ports, and could easily be configured comparably to this. That probably falls in your "cheap Chinese mini PCs" category, though I think Zotac is Tawainese. It's possibly on a lower quality tier than the Intel NUC or Gigabyte Brix. That said, I have the older version of it (EN860) and it works great as an HTPC box. I have actually considered the Intel NUC for use with Thunderbolt pro audio. If you're pairing it up with thousands of dollars of studio gear the price seems less egregious. But if the Thunderbolt port is going to go unused, there's really no reason to choose that direction. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link The discrete graphics adds additional heat and cost that isn't useful for a pfSense box. It essentially acts as a server/router, using one LAN port as a WAN directly from a modem, then routes packets out accordingly from the other LAN port(s). Many Chinese fanless versions exist, but they use anemic celerons and atom CPUs. When you start using many extra features of pfSense, like squid (as a webproxy) the router's maximum throughput drops. Now this isn't an issue unless you have some kind of insane symmetrical 1gpbs up/down connection, where processor would fail to saturate the entire pipe. I'd prefer to not have to worry, so I'd be all in for a fanless Mini-STX case and socketing in my own 6300T or something, but there are no fanless Mini-STX cases, and no Mini-STX motherboards with dual LAN. There are fanless thin Mini-ITX cases from Akasa, but I wasn't able to source a cheapish i3 + thin Mini-ITX mobo with dual LAN. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link $1030 using an iGPU. Pass. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link Had to post a second comment, comparing this to the Skull Canyon, which has a better GPU/CPU, better wi-fi, and a better SSD really hurts the Brix. $3 less for nearly every component being better except 16 GB of RAM vs 32 GB. What use case does this box have where 32 GB of RAM becomes a factor? Are people running dozens of VMs off a box like this? I don't know about profiteering, but I don't see them selling many of these. Reply kmmatney - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link I can't see running too many VMs. The i7-6500U performs worse than an i3-6100 (uses a lot less power, but still...). I know going into these reviews that the prices will shock me, yet I'm still shocked when I see them.

After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. “Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.” Same shape. No jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device’s haptic engine, which provides the “click” feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. “Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill -- not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine,” Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7’s storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) – which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone. From a cost perspective, the shift from 16GB/64GB/128GB iPhones to 32GB/128GB/256GB is a big jump. “Despite significant cost erosion in NAND flash over the last year, this increase in the overall memory cost definitely puts pressure on the bill of materials costs -- and therefore margins -- from Apple’s perspective,” Rassweiler said. Intel returns The Intel design win, and six years of absence that Intel had from the iPhone, is important to note. Even so, Intel still shares the processor business with Qualcomm. “Whereas Apple strives to have ‘one iPhone model for all carriers and markets,’ there are a number of different hardware permutations supporting various countries and carriers,” Rassweiler said. “Apple will likely look for ways to simplify the design moving forward, which means one supplier – whether Intel or Qualcomm – will likely dominate, as part of supplier and SKU streamlining.” According to Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics, IHS Markit, “Largely left behind in the 4G LTE market, Intel has finally worked itself back into the iPhone, which is a huge win, but not one that is going to be financially significant in the near term for Intel.” RF paths Apple has also eliminated segmented antenna bands, which means the company is pushing all radio-frequency (RF) paths to the very ends of the phone – both on the top and bottom. The aluminum uni-body construction and design forces all RF paths into those two locations. Whereas other smartphones use a glass back and RF components with antennas mounted on the ample back spaces, Apple is restricted to just two physical antennas. “This design limitation may force Apple to go back to an all-glass design again so that they can fit in 4x4MIMO LTE antennas and more features like wireless charging in the next iPhone iteration,” Lam said. Modem moved The baseband thin modem has been moved next to the A10 processor. Prior to the iPhone 7, the thin modem was always on the other side of the SIM card receptacle. “This is a subtle change but likely shows us where Apple wants to take this,” Lam said, “eventually putting the thin modem right on the apps processor package or even integrating it into the A-series processor.” Officially water resistant iPhone 7 is now officially rated as water resistant. “We also saw evidence of this water proofing design evolution in the earlier iPhone 6S, which included additional gasketing around critical connectors, as well as the use of WiFi antenna at the end of the primary speaker box,”Lam said. “Doing so pushes the antennas near the only other opening, for better reception and transmission.” Jet-black polished case Jet black polish is a new option on 128GB and 256GB models. “This is a new feature that produces a whole new look for the iPhone,” Lam said. “It is a lower yielding, time-intensive manufacturing step that adds cost, as well as considerable value, pushing the retail price higher for those requesting this option.” Antenna speaker design The antenna speaker design on the iPhone 7 came from the WiFi antenna packed into the speakers of Apple’s MacBook. “Apple likes to reuse these unique designs throughout their product lines,” Lam said. In a first for the iPhone series, the headset speaker now doubles as a stereo speaker. Upgraded camera While not as groundbreaking as the two optical paths in the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera has now been upgraded to optical image stabilization (OIS), for better low light performance. Improved battery life The battery has been increased to 1960mAhr capacity from 1715mAh in the previous iPhone 6s. This change is consistent with Apple’s claims of improved battery life.

(Mark Graves/The Oregonian) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 19, 2016 at 1:45 PM, updated September 22, 2016 at 6:52 AM comments Bob Swan.  Intel has again gone outside the company for a top executive, hiring former eBay chief financial officer Bob Swan as the chipmaker's new CFO. Intel announced in May that longtime CFO Stacy Smith would leave that job for a newly created post overseeing two disparate parts of the company – its manufacturing and sales operations. That move came amid a broad shakeup that included the exit of two top vice presidents, the hiring of a new corporate president, and the elimination of 12,000 jobs in a major restructuring to prepare Intel for long-term decline in PC sales. The new CFO, Swan, was most recently a partner at the private equity firm General Atlantic. Before that he was eBay's CFO for nine years, CFO of Electronic Data Systems, and chief executive of the short-lived online grocery service Webvan. Swan, 56, will receive an annual salary of $850,000 plus a bonus with a target payout of $1.1 million and a $5.5 million hiring bonus, paid out over two years. Additionally, Intel management will recommend to the board he receive a restricted new-hire stock grant worth $9.5 million, vesting over three years, plus annual stock grants forecast to be worth $6.5 million in the first year. Since Intel promoted Brian Krzanich to CEO in 2013, the company has reversed its longstanding practice of promoting from within and increasingly looked outside the company for new leadership. Soon after he got the CEO job Krzanich said the company was too "insular" and in the years since has repeatedly touted his penchant for finding leadership outside Intel. Prominent external hires include: Steven Fund, a former Procter & Gamble executive, hired in 2014 as Intel's chief marketing officer. Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, hired last November from Qualcomm to be president of Intel's PC and wireless groups. Paula Tolliver, chief information officer, hired last month from Dow Chemical. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

The update bottleneck for future Mac notebooks is primarily related to the performance of Intel's integrated graphics, and it appears that an emphasis on processing cores over graphics by Intel may force Apple to make some changes to its graphics strategy down the road. The MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro run exclusively on integrated graphics bundled with Intel's chips, while since late 2013 the 15-inch MacBook Pro has come in two versions, a lower-end configuration with only integrated graphics and a higher-end configuration that adds a dedicated graphics chip for higher performance. 15-inch MacBook Pro models equipped with both types of graphics can automatically switch between the two depending on whether better performance or better battery life is required. Given the importance of integrated graphics for Apple's notebooks, Apple has typically used chips including Intel's "GT3" or "GT3e" tier for graphics performance, with the "e" suffix on GT3e denoting embedded DRAM on the chip for improved performance compared to the GT3 tier. These tiers are powerful enough to provide reasonably strong graphics performance for a notebook. Looking at Intel's roadmap for chips beyond Skylake, the 15-inch MacBook Pro runs into a problem as Intel appears to have no plans for any quad-core chips with integrated graphics higher than the "GT2" tier, which typically has about half the raw power of the GT3 tier, to be launched in the next-generation "Kaby Lake" processor family. As a result, the currently available Skylake "H-series" chips appropriate for the 15-inch MacBook Pro that we're expecting to see in an update as soon as next month may remain Intel's lead offerings for these types of high-performance mobile chips until the introduction of new "Coffee Lake" chips in the second quarter of 2018. Even then, initial Coffee Lake chips will include only GT2-level graphics that may not be powerful enough for Apple's needs. The situation is a bit better for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air, which use 28-watt and 15-watt versions of the "U-series" processors respectively. The leaked roadmap indicates that Kaby Lake versions of these chips with GT3e graphics are scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2017, making them available for updated notebooks perhaps in the middle of next year following Skylake updates within the next month or two. Rounding out the Mac notebook lineup is the MacBook, which was updated in April with Skylake processors. Kaby Lake versions of those "Y-series" chips have already been launched, so they are ready to be used in next-generation MacBooks whenever Apple decides to release them. Those Kaby Lake Y-series chips will be part of Intel's lineup until late 2017 when new Cannon Lake chips based on a smaller 10 nm process are scheduled to debut. So what exactly is this Coffee Lake family coming in early 2018? As outlined by The Motley Fool, it appears to be based on the Cannon Lake architecture that has been under development for some time, but manufactured on the current 14 nm process rather than the next-generation 10 nm process of Cannon Lake. What Intel seems to be doing here with respect to Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake (aka 14-nanometer Cannon Lake) appears to be the result of good planning and an honest internal assessment of the health of the company's upcoming 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. As I have written before, I believe that the reason that Intel is keeping its high performance notebook and desktop processors on its 14-nanometer technology is cost. By late 2017/early 2018 (when Coffee Lake is expected to launch), Intel's 14-nanometer technology should be quite mature, while the company's 10-nanometer technology will have barely just begun production.As a result, Coffee Lake would be Intel's fourth processor family to come from its 14 nm process, following Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake. It's not entirely clear how Apple will deal with the apparent high-end integrated graphics stagnation at Intel when it comes to future MacBook Pro updates, but there are a few possibilities including a return to dedicated graphics chips across the 15-inch MacBook Pro lineup or perhaps significant enough improvements in Intel's GT2 tier to make it a viable primary option for low-end configurations. It's possible Intel will also be able to release some additional "refresh" Skylake chips with faster CPU speeds to extend the lifecycle of that family, but there's only so much that can be squeezed out of the current design. With the MacBook Pro set to receive a redesign at its next update as soon as next month, Apple could also be planning larger changes to the machine's internals than the largely drop-in chip upgrades we've seen in recent years, a shakeup that could make predicting Apple's plans from Intel's roadmaps a bit more difficult.

Because if we've learned one thing over the years, it's that complaining on MacRumors is how we get Apple to change things. It's a forum, people express their opinions. Complaints and praise are both valid opinions to hold and express. Sometimes it's ok to just say what you think to vent a little, without expecting Tim Cook to be reading and have an epiphany. ;):D Hopefully Apple will come up with solutions to this to suit everyone, but it seems clear their entire computer range is in need of updating, and it would be nice to think they'd been busy working on something special rather than just ignoring their existing line-up.

Rating: 26 Votes Good User Name 8 weeks ago So it seems that Apple really should just go for dedicated graphics chips then. Rating: 20 Votes asiga 8 weeks ago Apple is quite anti-GPU these days. If an Intel CPU doesn't have adequate integrated graphics, it will be skipped, because Apple won't reverse the path taken against discrete GPUs. I'd really wish that some major Apple customer would request a multimillion dollar shipment of Macs equipped with cutting-edge NVIDIA GPUs, but that kind of customers already moved to Linux.

(CSCO) Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Can’t Count on a Save From Santa Claus Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and United States Steel Corporation (X) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are headed higher once again this morning, as Wall Street seems relieved that the Federal Reserve didn’t raise interest rates at this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen did indicate that a hike is likely before the end of the year. On the economic front today, weekly jobless claims, the August Chicago Fed national activity index, August existing home sales and August leading indicators are all slated for release later this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.44%, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.44% and Nasdaq-100 futures have risen 0.5%. Wednesday’s options activity was brisk, as traders reacted to the Fed’s decision to hold pat on interest rates for the time being. Overall, an above-average 17.8 million calls and 17.5 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average rebounded to 0.65. 9 Dividend Stocks for a Full Calendar of Safe Income Analyst action provided the fuel for Wednesday’s options volume, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) upgraded again on prospects for iPhone 7 unit sales, while Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) was downgraded amid its latest fraud firestorm. Finally, Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) options traders continued to pile into COTY after the stock was downgraded. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple received yet another upgrade in the wake of positive preorders reports for the iPhone 7. This time UBS lifted its price target on AAPL stock to $127 from $115; the consensus target is $124.91 according to Thomson/First Call. While UBS said it doesn’t see demand for the iPhone 7 coming in better than the iPhone 6, the brokerage cited “encouraging Evidence Lab analysis of search volumes” for the target hike. Additionally, UBS said that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) isn’t seeing the same preorder demand as its competitors, lending a bit of caution to the research report. Options traders are also expressing a bit of caution on AAPL stock. Yesterday’s volume was strong, with 930,000 contracts changing hands. And while the fact that calls made up 63% of Wednesday’s activity would be a bullish indicator for most other stocks, for AAPL, it’s only par for the course. Emphasizing the point, Apple’s September/October put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.90, which is high for AAPL and indicates that puts and calls are in near parity among options set to expire within the next two months. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) Wells Fargo has really stepped in it this time, with reports of account fraud drawing severe scrutiny from federal regulators and Senate hearings. With pressure mounting on the company, analysts are reevaluating their positions, and J.P. Morgan decided to lower its stance on the banking giant. Citing the rising maelstrom around Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan cut its price target to $48 from $53.50 — a move that runs counter to upgrades from Morgan Stanley and R.W. Baird in the past two sessions. The weight of the situation is even beginning to drag sentiment in the options pits lower. On Wednesday, WFC saw volume rise to nearly 428,000 contracts, with puts snapping up 58% of the day’s take. Short-term speculators have loaded up on out-of-the-money puts, with more than 12,000 of these bearish contracts accumulating at the $44 strike — a target that WFC could realistically hit before the close on Friday if the situation continues to escalate. Coty Inc. (COTY) Cosmetics company Coty has been a hotbed of speculation this week for options traders. The shares have plunged more than 19% since mid-August, but recently, COTY appears to be putting in a bottom near $24. Support in the $24 region was put to the test on Wednesday after Zacks downgraded the stock to “hold” from “strong buy.” Even Jim Cramer got in on the act, advising followers to sell COTY stock in favor of Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is in Tip-Top Shape Options traders appeared slightly hopeful for COTY on Wednesday, however. Total volume came in at nearly 219,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 53% of the day’s take. Looking out to October, call OI for COTY is focused on the $25 strike, where 2,500 contracts currently reside. By comparison, 3,800 puts are open at the October $24 strike for the same series. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The results show that almost half of employees in these regions believe their current employer is not effectively making use of the latest technology advances. ©dotshock via 123RFThe study, conducted by research firm PSB, polled nearly 4,000 full-time employees from small, medium and large businesses in 10 countries. Of those polled in the UK, Germany, France and South Africa, many do not believe that they will be working in a smart office within the next five years and perceived their current workplace technology as lagging behind personal devices on innovation. With the research showing that the influx of new technology is having a significant impact on what workers expect from their employer, workplaces which don’t enact these new advances may be left behind. Technology has already had a huge impact on how we interact in the workplace, with, many employees - most notably a staggering 67% of millennials in South Africa - believing that face-to-face meetings will become obsolete. Innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality (VR), could also become vital to the workplace of the near future, affecting how we collaborate and work more efficiently. "Today’s workforce has a growing expectation that their employers integrate the latest technologies seamlessly and securely into their working lives," said Chris Buchanan, client solutions director, Dell South Africa. "Employees have seen first-hand the ways new technologies can help them do their jobs better, and are hungry to use the latest advancements to be more productive. While this may seem daunting to many employers, it’s a business-critical opportunity for companies to be at the forefront of the future workplace and enable the future workforce." Study highlights: • Regional results show that employees, especially in South Africa (67%) and the UK (47%), feel their office technology is not smart enough (compared to 44% of employees worldwide). While workers are ready for businesses to implement the latest technologies to make their offices smarter, with data used to control office temperature, lighting, etc., expectations are mixed on whether it will happen within the next five years. Advertisement • Despite the attraction of new technologies, people still prefer in-person workspace communications, though they fear this will soon be a thing of the past. 61% of South Africans agree that the growing popularity of remote working, together with improved technology, will lead to face-to-face interactions becoming obsolete. • Remote working is increasingly viewed as providing both quality of life and productivity benefits, and technology is seen as an essential enabler. 66% of South Africans who work remotely compared to 50% who work in offices say their job is a core part of their identity. Technology has allowed people to change their lifestyles and, in turn, this has affected their work styles and preferences. With these changes, employers should think about offering more flexible work arrangements to keep up with this evolution to cater to the mobile worker. Employees are also aware that the advances that allow these new working arrangements to exist will require new security and infrastructure; European and South African respondents list advanced security as the single most important technology to be implemented in their workplace. • Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) innovations could impact the workplace sooner than we think as 61% of employees in South Africa would be willing to use VR/AR in their professional lives. The most frequently cited user cases for the new technologies include training on new skills in realistic virtual environments (25%), problem solving or coming up with new ideas through 3D visualisation (18%) and presenting to clients using immersive technologies (15%). Additionally, over half of employees in South Africa (52%) believe that the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) will make their jobs easier. • When it comes to acquiring and retaining talent, technology matters, especially for millennials in South Africa with 1 in 3 willing to quit their jobs if the technology provided by their employer is substandard. Millennials in South Africa (up to 39% in South Africa) also say that a new job’s available technology would affect their decision on whether to take or decline the position. • South Africans recognise and are attracted to the entrepreneurial spirit of the sharing economy. 76% of South Africans will participate in the sharing economy by next year. How is work today? The Future Workforce Study from Dell Incentive to modernise "The Dell and Intel Future Workforce Study highlights how much the new generations of workers consider technology a key factor in career selection and satisfaction. As much as in the past the work environment was considered key to employee happiness and a factor in productivity, so today technology and work flexibility using such technology are now critical considerations," said Steven Ambrose, CEO of Strategy Worx. "The quality and sophistication of consumer-focused technology are at such an advanced state and have become so ubiquitous for most users, companies now have no choice but to offer the same or better options to their workforce as a matter of course. Companies that understand this trend and respond to it will hire, retain talent, and succeed, where those that don’t will fade and fail." "The massive changes that are occurring in the workplace are like a tale of two cities; those companies that are modernising, especially with mobility, will attract and retain top talent, those who don’t will create employee frustration, lower productivity and employee unhappiness," said Bob Egan, chief analyst, founder, Sepharim Research Group. "The Future Workforce Study discovered that millennials are driving massive changes in how and where work gets done, use multiple devices, and prefer to work away from a traditional office. The result is an important mandate for CIOs to modernise the infrastructure, redefine their security perimeter and device provision strategies." About the study: Dell and Intel commissioned PSB to conduct the Future Workforce Study with 3,801 full-time employees (work over 35 hours a week) of small, medium and large-sized organizations - distributed across 10 countries (US, UK, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, China, India, Canada and South Africa) and seven target industries (education, government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media & entertainment and retail). The quantitative survey was conducted between 5 April and 3 May 2016. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Scythe Byakko slices into compact dimensions by Wayne Manion  2:40 PM on September 21, 2016 Japanese PC cooling specialist Scythe has announced a new compact tower-style CPU cooler called Byakko, a word that translates to White Tiger. The Byakko HSF packs a trio of 6-mm heatpipes and a 92mm fan into an overall height of merely 130mm (5.12" for Americans). The base of the heatsink assembly is constructed from nickel-plated copper, and the heatpipes are curved assymetrically to allow additional clearance for installed DIMMs. The Byakko is equipped with a single Scythe Slip Stream 92mm sleeve bearing fan, which has an operating range of 300 to 2300 RPM and can generate airflow of 46.6 CFM and 18.9 Pa of static pressure. The heatsink has grooves for fan mounting on either side, so users requiring a push-pull fan configuration simply need to acquire a second fan and mounting clip. On the Intel side, Scythe's product page lists compatibility with desktop sockets from LGA775 up to LGA1151. The old LGA1366 socket is also supported, but owners with newer Intel high-end desktop platforms must look elsewhere, as Intel's giant LGA2011 socket is not present on the support list. The Byakko uses the same pushpin-based mounting as the Intel stock coolers. All AMD AM2, AM3, and FM socket variants are supported. AMD's new unified AM4 socket is rumored to retain compatibility with existing CPU coolers, so AM4 may be added to the support list at a later date. Mounting to AMD-based motherboards is achieved via the familiar clip mechanism. The Scythe Byakko is available immediately in Europe for 20.5€ + VAT, which works out to roughly $23.

Shares of Intel saw a spike in bullish mentions on Twitter in the past week as the company announced better-than-expected third-quarter sales guidance Friday. Social Market Analytics, which scans posts on social networks to form predictive trading signals, found that the chip giant had among the five-biggest increases in bullish sentiment among major U.S. stocks in the last five trading days. Intel shares rallied on the increase in its guidance and are now up 3 percent for the month versus the S&P 500's negative 1 percent return as of midday trading Wednesday. The company said it was "seeing some signs of improving PC demand" in the news release. It raised its third-quarter sales guidance to $15.6 billion at the midpoint from $14.9 billion previously. Below are the other four stocks seeing the biggest one-week jump in bullish sentiment on Twitter, according to SMA.

OpenGL ES 3.2 Officially Enabled For Intel Mesa Driver, Limited To Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 21 September 2016 at 02:18 PM EDT. 12 Comments Intel's Mesa driver has supported all of the extensions required by the OpenGL ES 3.2 specification, but only today is the support being officially advertised. Today's commit by Kenneth Graunke of Intel explains, "It's already advertised because the version.c extension checks are fulfilled, but we didn't actually claim support, so trying to create a ES 3.2 context would fail. It's all done, and the CTS results look good, so let's turn it on." In part due to needing ASTC texture compression, OpenGL ES 3.2 is only turned on for "Gen 9" Skylake graphics hardware and newer. 12 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

They are also willing to quit their jobs if they view the technology provided by their employer as substandard Dell and Intel’s Future Workforce Study, has shown results that almost half of employees in Europe and South African regions believe their current employer is not effectively making use of the latest technology advances. Dell unveiled the European and South African findings of the 2016 Future Workforce Study, conducted by research firm PSB, polled nearly 4,000 full-time employees from small, medium and large businesses in 10 countries. Of those polled in the UK, Germany, France and South Africa, many do not believe that they will be working in a smart office within the next five years and perceived their current workplace technology as lagging behind personal devices on innovation. With the research showing that the influx of new technology is having a significant impact on what workers expect from their employer, workplaces which don’t enact these new advances may be left behind. Technology has already had a huge impact on how we interact in the workplace, with, many employees – most notably a staggering 67% of millennials in South Africa – believing that face-to-face meetings will become obsolete. Innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality (VR), could also become vital to the workplace of the near future, affecting how we collaborate and work more efficiently. “Today’s workforce has a growing expectation that their employers integrate the latest technologies seamlessly and securely into their working lives,” said Chris Buchanan, Client Solutions Director, Dell South Africa. “Employees have seen first-hand the ways new technologies can help them do their jobs better, and are hungry to use the latest advancements to be more productive. While this may seem daunting to many employers, it’s a business-critical opportunity for companies to be at the forefront of the future workplace and enable the future workforce.” Study highlights: · Regional results show that employees, especially in South Africa (67%) and the UK (47%), feel their office technology is not smart enough (compared to 44% of employees worldwide). While workers are ready for businesses to implement the latest technologies to make their offices smarter, with data used to control office temperature, lighting, etc., expectations are mixed on whether it will happen within the next five years. · Despite the attraction of new technologies, people still prefer in-person workspace communications, though they fear this will soon be a thing of the past. 61% of South Africans agree that the growing popularity of remote working, together with improved technology, will lead to face-to-face interactions becoming obsolete. · Remote working is increasingly viewed as providing both quality of life and productivity benefits, and technology is seen as an essential enabler.66% of South Africans who work remotely compared to 50% who work in offices say their job is a core part of their identity. Technology has allowed people to change their lifestyles and, in turn, this has affected their work styles and preferences. With these changes, employers should think about offering more flexible work arrangements to keep up with this evolution to cater to the mobile worker. Employees are also aware that the advances that allow these new working arrangements to exist will require new security and infrastructure; European and South African respondents list advanced security protection as the single most important technology to be implemented in their workplace. · Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) innovations could impact the workplace sooner than we think as 61% of employees in South Africa would be willing to use VR/AR in their professional lives. The most frequently cited user cases for the new technologies include training on new skills in realistic virtual environments (25%), problem solving or coming up with new ideas through 3D visualisation (18%) and presenting to clients using immersive technologies (15%). Additionally, over half of employees in South Africa (52%) believe that the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) will make their jobs easier. · When it comes to acquiring and retaining talent, technology matters, especially for millennials in South Africa with 1 in 3 willing to quit their jobs if the technology provided by their employer is substandard. Millennials in South Africa (up to 39% in South Africa) also say that a new job’s available technology would affect their decision on whether to take or decline the position. · South Africans recognise and are attracted to the entrepreneurial spirit of the sharing economy. 76% of South Africans will participate in the sharing economy by next year.   Staff Writer 2016 Future Workforce Studydellintel Comments are closed. « Google Allo takes chat to the next level Lagos real estate startup closes $1.2 million funding deal » Search Tags Africa Airtel apple BlackBerry Broadband cloud computing Egypt facebook Gadgets and Gaming Ghana Google Huawei ict ict news internet IT News IT News Africa IT Security kenya Microsoft Mobile Mobile and Telecoms MTN news Nigeria Nokia Opinion Safaricom samsung SAP Security Software South Africa tech news technology technology news Telecom telecom news telecoms Telkom Uganda vodacom west africa Zain zimbabwe News Alerts Sign up for our FREE News Alerts       Like us In the news Forex Rates Latest Headlines South Africa: Vega offers a new degree course in gaming November 17, 2016 Dell Rose Gold with Intel 7th GEN processor now in SA November 17, 2016 What Microsoft’s HoloLens means for the future of Augmented Reality November 17, 2016 #datafalls as Vox crashes cost of its Fat Pipe DSL packages November 17, 2016 Huawei wins 2 awards at AfricaCom 2016 November 17, 2016 Wipro launches Open Banking API platform November 17, 2016   UPCOMING EVENTS   Principles of IT Leadership | 23 & 24 November 2016, Jhb     Selling to the CIO | 15 & 16 February 2017, Jhb Company Press Offices Press Offices Alcatel Lucent Condyn ContinuitySA Eset Fujitsu Huawei Interactive Intelligence MCI MTN OutSystems Resolve SAP Tom TomUSAASA Veeam MOST POPULAR TWITTER Twitter Tweets by @ITNewsAfrica Photos on flickr SAP Africa announces new appointments November 10, 2016 Microsoft appoints new GM for WECA region November 9, 2016 Future-proof your business – or risk becoming irrelevant November 8, 2016 Bytes Managed Solutions appoints new Operations Executive October 28, 2016 Yahsat appoints Farhad Khan as new CCO October 26, 2016 Ugandan appointed DG of International Telecommunications Satellite Organization October 18, 2016 GetBucks snaps up former Barclays digital chief September 21, 2016 Deloitte Digital appoints new Digital Transformation Practice Leader September 19, 2016 GBI appoints two Vice Presidents – Sales August 30, 2016 Nikki Popoola joins WIOCC as Sales Director August 30, 2016 Newsletter Would you like to receive the latest African technology news and analysis delivered to your e-mail inbox every morning?

Call options volume was three times higher than the put options volume on Tuesday and there was a one large trade that caught Nathan's attention. When the stock was trading at $37.15, a trader bought 50,000 contracts of the November 41 calls for $0.16. The trade breaks even at $41.16 or 10.82 percent higher from the current stock price. Nathan explained that the November 41 call is far out of the money, with a delta of 11. He thinks the trader is probably looking at Intel's Q3 earnings results and he or she may be levering up an existing long position.

Price $6899 AUD > Pricing info Specs Quad-core 2.8GHz Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5 • 32GB RAM • Intel HD P530/Nvidia Quadro M1000M graphics • 512GB NVMe SSD • 15.6in 3,840 x 2,160 IPS display • 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO antenna) • Bluetooth 4 • 720p webcam • 3 x USB 3 • 2 x Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C • HDMI 1.4 • SD slot • 64Whr Li-ion battery • Windows 10 Pro • 3yr RTB warranty • 375 x 255 x 18mm (WDH) • 2.1kg Tweet Email this Print this Feedback The iron fist of a workstation clad in a velvet glove of stylish design. T his is a 15in laptop with serious poke. Just take a look at the specs and try not to whimper with excitement: a 2.8GHz quad-core mobile Xeon processor with Hyper-Threading, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB PCI Express-based NVMe SSD, and Nvidia Quadro M1000M graphics driving a 15.6in, 3,840 x 2,160 HP DreamColor display.  Given such a specification, you might forgive HP for neglecting design. Thankfully, the ZBook is as tempting in the flesh as its specs are in black and white. From its dimpled, aluminium-clad lid to its glass-topped touchpad and gleaming chamfered edges, this laptop is a joy to behold. It’s comfortable to use, too. The keyboard is flanked by Bang & Olufsen stereo speakers, and has a key action that’s light to the touch and has just the right amount of travel and feedback. The smooth, frosted-finish touchpad is large and responsive, and while I’m not generally a fan of integrated buttons, these ones work well with a solid, positive click.  The most impressive design achievement, however, is how much power HP squeezes into so little space. The HP ZBook Studio G3 is closer in weight and slenderness to an Ultrabook than to your average lumpen workstation. You still won’t want to lug it around all day – it weighs 2.1kg – but compared with most laptops in its class, it’s positively limber. Moreover, at 21mm thick it’s surprisingly slender. It doesn’t quite match the 17mm Dell XPS 15, but it’s not far away. Despite its compact size, you’ll find plenty of ports and sockets arranged around the edges. On the left sit a Gigabit Ethernet connector, two USB 3 ports and an SD card slot. On the right are two Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C ports, plus an HDMI output, another USB 3 port and a 3.5mm audio jack. Wireless connectivity, meanwhile, stretches to 2x2 stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4. Power on The exterior is all very lovely then, but the true appeal of the ZBook lies beneath its aluminium shell. The beating heart of this beast is its mobile Xeon processor – this is the first time we’ve seen one in the wild. Before you get too excited, it’s important to realise that this isn’t a true Xeon to match the ones you’ll find in desktop workstations. Instead, it’s a beefed-up version of Intel’s consumer-grade Skylake chips. In our review sample we have a 14nm quad-core, Hyper-Threaded 2.8GHz Xeon E3-1505M v5 that will Turbo Boost up to a maximum frequency of 3.7GHz. HP has also packed in a dual graphics setup encompassing Intel’s integrated HD Graphics P530 and Nvidia’s Quadro M1000M for heavy-duty CAD/CAM and industrial design work. Performance-wise, this is quite the package. In our laptop benchmarks, which run a series of heavy-duty image-conversion, 4K video-encoding and multitasking tests, the ZBook achieved a score of 120, meaning it steals the title of “fastest laptop we’ve ever seen” from the Dell XPS 15 with its score of 111. Even more importantly for a machine that’s likely to be dealing with heavy-duty apps and big files, the storage subsystem is super-quick. HP has endowed the ZBook with one of its Z Turbo drives – a PCI Express-based NVMe drive with a 512GB capacity and speeds fast enough to embarrass many a desktop drive. Tested with CrystalDiskMark, it hit sequential read and write speeds in excess of 2GB/sec and 1.5GB/sec respectively, which is nothing short of astonishing. Whether you’re launching apps, loading large video files into your timeline or rendering big video projects straight to disk, this laptop will keep up – and then some. With such high-end hardware on board, you might expect battery life to suffer; and so it does, but perhaps not as badly you might think. In our looping video-playback test, in which we calibrate the screen to a brightness of 170cd/m2 and put the laptop in flight mode, the ZBook Studio G3 lasted 5hrs 25mins. That should be enough to deliver around half a day of light duties. Bear in mind, though, that as soon as you start pushing the processor, the battery life will drop significantly. And with this much power on offer, it’s quite easy to get carried away. Sound and vision HP hasn’t ignored the screen. It’s a wide-gamut, non-touchscreen, high-DPI display with a matte finish. At first glance it looks sharp, colourful and punchy in all the right ways. Under the beady eye of our X-Rite colorimeter, the contrast ratio hit a high 1,212:1, which ensures punchy images and an inky black level. I was also suitably pleased by the panel’s sRGB coverage of 99.2%. However, colour accuracy isn’t up to same level, with an average Delta E figure of 2.96 seeing it fall behind its main rival, the Dell XPS 15’s (1.48), by quite a long way. Meanwhile, maximum brightness reaches only 259cd/m2, which is some way short of the Dell XPS 15’s 363cd/m2. As long as you don’t venture outdoors with it, though, that shouldn’t prove too much of a problem. I was considerably less taken with the speakers. Although Bang & Olufsen-branded, they’re nothing special. They’re clear and deliver music with plenty of atmosphere, but there isn’t much warmth or body to the sound, and precious little bass. High price... but worth it The HP ZBook Studio G3 is a beast of a 15in laptop, and has a price to match. Our review sample costs an eye-watering $6,899. While it’s possible to cut down the price, this is still a top dollar machine, which is reflected in the specifications. For that you’re getting a hugely impressive machine that’s ISV-certified and ready for serious work. The monstrous specification of our test system delivers faster performance than any other laptop we’ve put through our benchmarks, and it’s all squeezed into a chassis that’s slimmer and lighter than you have any right to expect. Is it worth the money? If you need a portable ISV-certified notebook, then certainly. No workstation laptop we’ve tested combines a chassis this slim and light with performance this fast. It stands at the pinnacle of workstation laptop design, with only the Dell Precision M3800 for (distant) company, a 3.2kg workstation laptop that can currently only be specified with a Haswell Intel Core i7. I know which I’d choose.  Related Reviews Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 delivers quality over battery Review: Dell's XPS 15 is on the best Windows 10 laptops we've seen Review: HP EliteBook Folio G1 - great looks, terrible battery life Review: Dell Latitude 13 7370 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  dell xps  |  hp zbook studio g3  |  laptop  |  review  |  workstation  |  xeon processor   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     How should we teach our kids to use digital media?     Report identifies path from online gaming to cyber-criminality     How inkjet cartridges are made     New screens and art from Dark Souls 3   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

Although it utilizes the most optimized version of the Frostbite game engine to date, you’ll still need a reasonably stout machine to play Battlefield 1 as the developers intended. Minimum hardware specifications are as follows: OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Processor (AMD): AMD FX-6350 Processor (Intel): Core i5 6600K Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon™ HD 7850 2GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): nVidia GeForce® GTX 660 2GB DirectX: 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB The recommended hardware, naturally, will need to be a bit more powerful: OS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later Processor (AMD): AMD FX 8350 Wraith Processor (Intel): Intel Core i7 4790 or equivalent Memory: 16GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon™ RX 480 4GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 1060 3GB DirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Available Disk Space: 50GB In a blog post accompanying the specs reveal, the game’s lead world designer, Daniel Berlin, outlined some of the adjustments and changes being made based on feedback from beta participants. Of note is a change to the Conquest game mode ticket system, balancing of various weapons and vehicles, multiple tweaks to the Rush game mode and more tools to deal with vehicles earlier. Battlefield 1 launches on October 21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC with pricing ranging from $59.99 for the standard edition all the way up to $209.99 for an exclusive Amazon collector’s edition.

Toby Gee of MinterEllisonRuddWatts explores the subject. Edited by Divina Paredes (CIO New Zealand) 23 September, 2016 07:00 - - - - print email Comments Augmented reality technology is another test for the law’s age-old struggle to keep up with innovation. Toby Gee, MinterEllisonRuddWatts Augmented reality (AR), the technology behind Pokémon Go, creates a virtual world that overlaps with the physical, so users can interact with a combination of both worlds in real time. AR has been flagged as a technology poised to profoundly affect the way we interact with computers. Pokémon Go is the recent success story of AR games, catapulting AR technology into the mainstream. However, it is not the first, nor is it the only example of AR. The technology has been around since the 1960s; other games for smartphones have preceded Pokémon Go (including a New Zealand AR children’s game); and tech heavyweights like Google and Intel have headworn AR devices available or in development. The chief executive of Niantic (the company that created Pokémon Go) has said he wants one day to be able to play Pokémon Go with contact lenses. But what happens when this real-virtual hybrid world causes interference with people’s lives in the real world? Can the producers of the technology be blamed for it? How can the law keep up with what might seem (at least to some lawyers) like science fiction? Virtual objects and real-world property Pokémon Go requires users to move around in the physical world to complete tasks in the virtual world – such as catching virtual creatures known as ‘Pokémon’. So the virtual world of Pokémon Go influences where users go in the real world. Given the large numbers of people playing Pokémon Go, this can have negative consequences. At least three separate class action lawsuits have been filed by dissatisfied homeowners in Canada and the United States, suing Niantic for the disruption caused by players trespassing or requesting access to their properties to look for virtual creatures on their mobile devices. Some churches in the UK are unimpressed with disruptions caused by Pokémon Go users, and Cologne Cathedral in Germany is reportedly taking legal action after Niantic refused to remove it from the game. Other complaints have been raised in relation to the location of Pokémon and Pokémon Go landmarks, for example ‘Pokémon stops’ – where the virtual creatures can be found – in places like war memorials. German authorities want Pokémon stops located past airport security controls deleted, Iran has banned the game entirely, and Israel has banned its military from using it. So what is the extent of Niantic’s liability for where it puts its virtual objects? The game warns users to respect private property, and Niantic has a complaints process (although it has rejected some complaints). Do these steps absolve its liability? Should there be a positive duty to place stops only in locations where large numbers of people playing Pokémon Go would not be harmful, or perhaps only on public property? The homeowners’ lawsuits are in the early stages, and with limited information it is difficult to see what legal traction they may have. Read more ​These 5 personal technologies will break away from the hype and disrupt your business: Gartner AR can influence real-world property rights by affecting people’s actions. There could be other property implications, however, particularly if the technology becomes more prevalent in our day-to-day lives, such that it becomes common to view the world through a device that overlays a virtual world over the real. The appearance of any real-world object might then be affected by the appearance of a virtual object; for example, virtual graffiti could be daubed on buildings. If a billboard is overlaid by different virtual advertising, will the billboard’s owner have legal recourse? Toby Gee of MinterEllisonRuddWatts What happens when this real-virtual hybrid world causes interference with people’s lives in the real world? Can the producers of the technology be blamed for it? Personal injury Read more State of the CIO 2016 (part 2): Emerging tools, evolving roles for the digital era Pokémon Go is played by users holding their smartphone out in front of them, and also, of course, requires users to move around. This combination of activities has proven harmful, with several reports of personal injury from distracted users. Police in various countries have warned against driving while playing Pokémon Go – for good cause, as a woman was killed in Japan by a driver playing the game. Other concerns exist as to players’ ability to place “lures”, which attract Pokémon (and therefore users). This has obvious risks if used maliciously: there have been reports of robberies initiated by such a tactic, and concerns about potential dangers to children. The state of New York has banned registered sex offenders from using the app, requesting Niantic to remove Pokémon Go users who are on the public register (which may or may not prove an effective policy). Niantic is undoubtedly aware of some of these risks: Pokémon Go’s terms and conditions include an extensive indemnity clause whereby users agree to indemnify Niantic, and the app warns users to pay attention to their surroundings. The question is whether these steps are enough. Undoubtedly, with AR technology, users are individually responsible for the consequences of their actions. But conceivably the producer could also be responsible for the foreseeable activity of its players, either individually or collectively. Parties affected by users of a game might find the producer a better avenue for recovering damages than individuals. Such a suit could be extremely expensive: it will involve novel liability issues; there may scope for a class actions; and many jurisdictions might be affected. The scale of users (an estimated 30 million) and the associated profits for Niantic are such that, in some jurisdictions at least, more class actions seem likely. AR technology is another test for the law’s age-old struggle to keep up with innovation. Of course, the law has already engaged with legal problems from the virtual world, in situations such as cyber bullying, spam emails and digital file sharing (with mixed success). AR throws up a variety of legal issues, not only those discussed here, but issues relating to privacy, cybersecurity, intellectual property and property rights in virtual objects. Time, as well as the way AR technology develops, will tell how the law will address the potential negative consequences of the AR technology so that its positive features can be exercised without undue adverse effects – or at least with legal recourse where they occur.

(Photo: Mark Vergari/The Journal News) 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo has prided himself on efforts to improve the upstate economy. Now, some of his major initiatives are caught in a criminal corruption case that has ensnared some of his closest allies. The arrests Thursday of 10 developers and state officials put a dark cloud over Cuomo's upstate initiatives and led to calls that the projects should not be derailed by the criminal proceedings. Former Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy, who heads the Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce, said plans for a $600 million photonics center through the SUNY Polytechnic Institute should not be impacted by Thursday's events. "I expect it to move forward based upon the strength of its economic development potential and its many public and private partners," Duffy said in a statement. ►SUNY Poly’s influence imperiled by scandal ►Ten charged in sweeping NY corruption case ►Ziti, The Sopranos and more: Highlights from the Albany corruption complaint SUNY Poly president Alain Kaloyeros was charged with federal and state felonies for allegedly steering contracts to private developers in Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. Under Kaloyeros, SUNY Poly's influence grew across upstate as it built strong ties with the leading companies in the nanotechnology industry, including IBM, Intel and GlobalFoundries. He was hailed as the key driver and visionary for the nanocenter in Albany: The state owned the facilities that the private companies used for research and development. The model was replicated across upstate, including plans for the Rochester facility and a massive plant in Utica. But critics said Kaloyeros wanted too much power: He battled local officials in Rochester over where to place the photonics center. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-Fairport, Monroe County, said she's pleased Kaloyeros is off the project. He was put on unpaid leave. "I have never before met anyone so insistent on being in total control than Dr. Kaloyeros," Slaughter said, saying local officials had to "tangle with his ego." Cuomo had praised Kaloyeros, even after he was put under the federal microscope last year. And Cuomo has said previously that whatever the outcome of the federal probe, upstate projects would not be slowed. But there have been some issues: In a few cases, payments for SUNY Poly projects were delayed. On Thursday, he said, any misdeeds would not be tolerated. "SUNY has rightly relieved Alain Kaloyeros from his duties and has suspended him without pay, effective immediately," Cuomo said in a statement. Some upstate leaders implored the state to not be distracted by the scandal. SUNY officials said it put executive vice chancellor Alexander Cartwright in charge of SUNY Poly on an interim basis. Adam Cohen, the FBI's special agent in Buffalo, said the corruption charges hurt the opportunity to rebuild the region. Cuomo has pledged $1 billion to revive Buffalo, and the main developer on the project, LPCiminelli, was accused of bid rigging and corruption Thursday. "The people arrested today personally tarnished an historic opportunity that they had no right to tamper with," Cohen said. "They compromised the integrity of government and impeded the promise of liberty." 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/2d0BUjJ TOP VIDEOS 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 Vatican says keep your loved one's ashes off the mantel 0:24 Baby uses hearing aids for the first time 0:25 Girl Scout cookie cereal is a real thing and happening soon 1:10 More Stories As deer season opens, a timeless battle begins Nov. 18, 2016, 11:50 a.m. Travel agent stole $13K from anniversary couple, DA says Nov. 18, 2016, 11:29 a.m. Metro population shrinks, gets smarter and more diverse Nov. 18, 2016, 11:23 a.m.

(OTC PINK: DYNE), a leading provider of professional technology services, today announced results for its fourth fiscal quarter and for fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The 2016 audited financial statements and notes thereto are available on the OTC website under our symbol, DYNE. DynTek has restated its 2014 and 2015 financial statements to correct historical income tax accounting of non-cash interest items. Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016 DynTek reported revenues of $176,932,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $26,972,000 or 18.0%, from $149,960,000 in the prior year ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit of $28,704,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased $4,026,000 or 16.3% as compared to $24,678,000 in the prior year ended June 30, 2015. This year over year revenue and gross profit increase is primarily attributable to several multi-million dollar deals with government customers in the New York district. Total operating expenses were $23,059,000 in the year ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $2,753,000 or 13.6%, as compared to $20,306,000 in the prior year ended June 30, 2015. This increase over prior year is primarily due to increased selling expense in relation to increased revenue and earnings. DynTek reported EBITDA of $6,561,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $1,503,000 or 29.7%, as compared to $5,058,000 in the prior year. Net income was $2,915,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, or $1.27 per diluted share, a decrease of $2,360,000, or 44.7%, and $1.05 per diluted share, over the restated net income of $5,275,000 and $2.32 per diluted share in the year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to an income tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 related to the elimination of a prior uncertain tax position. "This fiscal year featured so many key highlights for our organization including record revenue and profit, the successful delivery of several large and complex customer engagements, and winning Intel Security's Partner of the Year, Americas," said Ron Ben-Yishay, DynTek's chief executive officer. "We are extremely proud of our team's ability to continue to grow and develop the business. We have a keen focus on architecting and implementing technology solutions that satisfy our client's biggest needs and challenges in area such as cybersecurity, data center optimization and cloud computing." Fourth Fiscal Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 DynTek reported revenues of $50,511,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $13,930,000 or 38.1%, from $36,581,000 in the prior fourth quarter ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit was $9,262,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $2,585,000 or 38.7%, from $6,677,000 in the prior year fourth quarter ended June 30, 2015. This quarter over prior year quarter increase is attributable to a significant multi-million dollar deal in the New York district that impacted revenue by $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses were $7,175,000 in the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $1,412,000 or 24.5%, as compared to $5,763,000 in the prior year fourth quarter ended June 30, 2015. This increase quarter over prior year quarter is primarily due to higher selling and general and administrative expenses associated with higher gross profit and earnings. DynTek reported EBITDA of $2,704,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $1,366,000 or 102.1%, as compared to $1,338,000 in the prior year fourth quarter. Net income was $1,341,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, or $0.58 per diluted share, a decrease of $2,413,000 or 64.3% and $1.06 per diluted share, over the restated net income of $3,754,000 and $1.64 per diluted share in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, primarily due to an income tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 related to the elimination of the prior uncertain tax position. Dividend On September 21, 2016, based on continued strong performance, DynTek's Board of Directors declared another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock to be paid on October 13, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 3, 2016. The dividend represents a 33% increase over last quarter's dividend. The Company had 2,264,390 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of September 21, 2016. EBITDA The Company defines EBITDA as net income from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently. Although EBITDA is a widely used financial indicator of a company's ability to service debt, it is not a recognized measure for financial statement presentation under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as superior or as an alternative to net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. Nonetheless, the Company believes that EBITDA provides useful supplemental information for investors and others to measure operating performance, especially in situations where a company has significant non-cash operating expenses that are not indicative of core business operating results. EBITDA is widely used in the IT services industry to analyze comparable company performance, and management of the Company also uses EBITDA, in addition to GAAP information, as a measure of operating performance for assessing its business units.

That's how Rivet Networks has chosen to market its latest Gigabit Ethernet Controller, the Killer E2500. Introduced as a successor to the well-received E2400, the new addition to the Killer range uses a familiar combination of hardware and software to identify and prioritise network data, resulting in a smoother overall web experience. Going by what's on the tin, it's a product that makes sense for just about anyone who plays online games, streams multimedia content or uses the Internet for any number of bandwidth-intensive tasks. To put the new chip through its paces, we've been sent an MSI Z170A Gaming M6 for evaluation. Heading to stores in the next few weeks at a yet-to-be-confirmed price, MSI's feature-packed Z170 motherboard is a stylish choice with reinforced PCIe slots, support for SLI and CrossFire, Nahimic-powered audio, USB 3.1 Type-C, and the popular Click BIOS 5. It also happens to be one of the first to feature the Killer E2500 controller, with Gigabyte and other vendors expected to follow before year's end. Winning over OEMs doesn't appear to be a problem, however Rivet Networks does seem to have its work cut out in convincing consumers. Driver problems on much older hardware still linger in the minds of enthusiasts, and if changing perception isn't a big enough challenge, there's arguably an even larger hurdle: rival network interface controllers (NICs) from the likes of Intel and Realtek tend to work just fine, so why should anyone consider a change? The Killer Proposition Hardware optimised for maximum throughput and minimum latency is part of the Killer appeal, yet while the E2500 is said to have been improved with better packet handling, the biggest changes take place in software. A new Killer Control Center promises full control of your system's network performance, while the NIC's ability to detect and prioritise certain types of traffic continues to play a crucial role. The magic trick is Killer's ability to detect, identify and prioritise latency-sensitive data and other critical network traffic. Marketed as Advanced Stream Detect, the software picks out any programs utilising the network and automatically assigns a priority rating of 1-6 in order of importance. A modernised 'overview' page now highlights identified apps, with a speed gauge showing how much bandwidth is currently being used. By default, games are typically identified and tagged as priority 1 or 2, audio and video slots in at or around level 3, most general traffic sits at 4 or 5, while large time-insensitive transfers (think torrents or Windows updates) fetch a lowly 6. Knowing Your Priorities App priorities are by default governed by a regularly updated master list, and there are meaningful improvements being introduced with the new software. One such example is Advanced Stream Detect's newfound ability to detect over 500 of the top global websites. Priority is automatically handed to browser tabs that need it, and the software can now detect websites on all tabs, irrespective or which browser is used. Sliders and toggle switches on the Apps page make it easy for power users to limit bandwidth or block network access entirely, and frequently used programs can be pinned to the top for quick access. Enthusiasts may spend a short while tinkering with the available options, but if you're of the opinion a NIC ought to just work, the E2500 will happily do its thing without any user intervention. Going by the assumption that too much information can be off putting, Rivet Networks has streamlined the software to ensure there are fewer tabs, less options and no complicated check boxes to consider. Advanced Stream Detect is enabled by default, and the only recommended tweak is found in the settings tab, where a user can define his/her broadband speed in order to assist the software in managing bandwidth. If you're unsure of how fast your line actually is, a built-in speed test can be used to populate said fields. Though not applicable to this review, the Control Centre also presents a WiFi Analyzer that's handy for keeping tabs on channel congestion on either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands. Should your hardware happen to feature both a Killer NIC and Killer WiFi, you'll be granted access to DoubleShot Pro, through which both connections are utilised and latency-sensitive traffic is automatically routed to the most reliable link. We're of the opinion it makes implicit sense for certain types of network traffic to be given priority. There's no reason for a video call to run at a lower resolution because of a torrent that's downloading in the background, and an online game shouldn't stutter because a large Windows Update has started to come down the pipe. In our experience, a Killer NIC can minimise such risks, so let's put the E2500 into perspective with some real-world benchmarks.

Who is going to rule it? 22 Sep 2016 at 13:25, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp, Dell Recent Articles Kaminario's K2 mountain is about to be uplifted NooBaa wraps AWS S3 wool around Microsoft Azure Blob storage Leaner, meaner screamer from Infinidat dreamer Comment A new phase of disruption is hitting the performance data storage array market, giving new, old, startup and struggling all-flash array vendors a shot at making it big by using NVMe flash drives and NVMe Fabric-class connectivity to provide direct-attached SSD performance from external arrays. The charge is being led by Dell-EMC’s DSSD unit and startups such as Mangstor and Apeiron, shipping product that offers shared array data access at speeds hitherto unbelievably unattainable except from server-attached PCIe-flash drives. A G2M NVM Express (NVMe) Ecosystem Market Sizing Report shows the state of the market now and just how fast it has been developing. Soon all external arrays with ambitions for storing tier 1 fast access performance data, will likely have to use NVMe flash drives (or faster media drives; think XPoint-class) and NVMe over Fabrics (or accelerated Ethernet) network access or else face being replaced by arrays that do. Our feeling is that we are looking at a mass transition in the 2017-20-18 period with installed base migration from 2017 to 2020 and beyond. This could provide a great fillip for on-premises array vendors as performance data storage in the cloud cannot provide equivalent performance unless the apps run in the cloud and similar storage hardware/software is used. G2m NVMe ecosystem chart Shaun Walsh, president and managing partner at G2M Inc., says: “We expect the NVMe market to be more than $57bn by 2020 with a 95 percent compounded annual growth rate.” Yes, a 95 per cent CAGR. The G2M report predicts: The NVMe market will be more than $57 billion by 2020 More than 50 per cent of enterprise servers will have NVMe bays by 2020 60 per cent of enterprise storage appliances will have NVMe bays by 2020 Nearly 40 per cent of AFAs will be NVMe-based by 2020 Worldwide shipments of NVMe SSDs will grow to more than 25 million units by 2020 Worldwide shipments of M.2 NVMe SSDs will grow to more than five million units by 2020 NVMe-oF adapter shipments will climb to 740,000 units by 2020 Ethernet adapters with RDMA capabilities will be more than 75 per cent of the NVMe-oF market The G2M report suggests NVMe “will become a major component of new models for compute, fabrics, analytics, application acceleration, systems management and more. There are more than 70 companies that have announced products for the NVMe market and G2M Research has grouped these product offerings into nine categories, including servers and storage appliances with NVMe bays, NVMe all-flash arrays (AFAs), NVMe-oF adapters, three classes of NVMe storage devices, NVMe I/O blocks and NVMe accelerator adapters.” It has identified moire than 70 supplier companies involved in an NVMe eco-system, suggesting major players include: Broadcom; Cavium; Dell Technologies; IBM; Intel; Lenovo; Marvell; Mellanox; Micron; Microsemi; Oracle; Samsung; SK Hynix; and Toshiba; and emerging startups such as Envemio, Kalray, Kazan Networks, Mangstor, NVLX, and Teledyne-LeCroy.

They can be grouped into five classes: Established incumbents: Dell (EMC); HDS; HPE; IBM; and NetApp Arriving incumbent: Pure Storage NVMeF-style startups: Apeiron; E8; Excelero; Mangstor; and Pavilion Data Systems All-flash array modified hybrideers: Nimble; Tegile; and Tintri All-flash array startup era survivors: Kaminario and Violin Memory Oracle should also be classed as an established incumbent and, we suggest, will not be left behind in performance data access by NVMe arrays. It may focus on NMVe fabric access over InfiniBand. We should also note Chinese system/storage vendors in the wings, meaning Huawei and Lenovo. Then there are other startup, niche and minor array vendors to consider such as DataDirect Networks, Fujitsu, Infinidat, Nexsan, Panasas, and Seagate with ClusterStore. For all the vendors, NVMe over fabrics technology gives them a shot at building and taking sales from no-NVMeF incumbents. It gives a fresh lease of life to ailing and struggling players, equalising the playing field to some extent. And it also converges the performance external array technology space with different style arrays, disk, all-flash, and hybrid, evolving towards a consistent all-flash, NVMe drive, NVMeF-class access future. It could be possible that HPC storage access will start using NVMe drives and fabric as well, which is why DDN, Panasas and Seagate are in the list above. NVMe and HCI Tegile CMO Narayan Venkat thinks that NVMe fabrics will be the great equaliser between hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) systems such as those from Nutanix and SimpliVity, and external arrays. With storage admin being subsumed into system admin, via technologies such as VVOLs, then storage management simplicity equivalence between HCI and shared array systems is effectively achieved. He says that a problem with HCI systems is that you can’t separately scale capacity and performance, which you can do with shared arrays. You can do this at the system level by scaling compute (servers) independently of capacity (storage arrays), and also with the storage array be separately scaling controllers, the performance storage capacity tier and, separately again, any other capacity tiers. We’d point out that multi-node HCI systems will spend more resources on inter-system messaging to ensure a single version of the virtual array stored truth as more nodes are added. With a shared array this need to co-ordinate servers with their own portions of the virtual array disappears. A further point; with DAS PCIe flash access speeds from a shared array then data locality needs, sometimes touted by HCI vendors saying compute and storage for apps on that compute need to be located close together, goes away. All the data on the shared NVMe fabrics array is effectively local to all servers connected with it over an NVMeF-class link. Consider composable infrastructure too, with racks full of compute, networking and storage shelves, all dynamically put together onto systems as needs dictate - think HPE Synergy - then, at a gross level, a rack of servers, network switches and storage shelves will be common between trad systems, converged systems and HCI systems. All that will differ will be the software organisation and buying process. Finishing view NVMe over fabrics access to NVMe drive arrays seems almost certain to be the external array future for storing performance data. As applications, middleware and operating systems are developed to take advantage of it then today’s IO-bound apps will lose that constraint and face a balance if being both IO- and CPU-bound instead, while the servers operate at hitherto unachievable levels of efficiency and applications run faster and do more. The public cloud will not be able to compete unless both apps and data are cloud-resident and run in hardware and software environments offering similar performance levels.. NVMe drives and fabrics offer a great opportunity to on-premises IT system and storage vendors, and to users, to turbo-charge existing systems and make them go a hell of a lot faster. We’ll drink to that. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register Apeiron claims NVMe fabric speed without NVMe over fabrics - but how?

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady IHS completes initial teardown, estimates iPhone 7 component costs around $220 Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, September 22nd, 2016, 05:20 Category: Hardware, iPhone, News Tweet They’ve run the numbers and after a preliminary teardown, iPhone 7 component costs are estimated to start at $219.80, which is $36.89 higher than iPhone 6s, according to a preliminary teardown of a 32GB model by IHS Markit. According to the report, the display remains the most expensive component, clocking in at an estimated $43 while the Intel modem and other baseband chips retail for about $33.90. Apple’s quad-core A10 Fusion chip is the third most expensive item on the bill of materials, costing an estimated $26.90. Meanwhile, the larger 1,920 mAh battery is said to cost just $2.50. The new rear-facing iSight camera and updated 7-megapixel go for a combined $19.90 while electromechanical components, including the Taptic Engine, antennas, connectors, microphones, and stereo speakers, cost an estimated $16.70 combined. The iPhone 7’s 2GB of Samsung RAM and 32GB of SK Hynix flash storage for for a combined $16.30. An audio codec and audio amplifier supplied by Cirrus Logic, an NFC controller supplied by NXP, a Bosch Sensortec-made barometer, along with an accelerometer, gyroscope, Touch ID, proximity sensor, and other sensors, cost an estimated $14 altogether. The accessories within the box, which include a Lightning-to-USB cable, Lightning-to-3.5mm audio adapter, EarPods with a Lightning connector, and 5W USB power adapter, go for an estimated $11.80 combined. IHS has estimated that Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 jumps to $224.00 after “basic manufacturing costs” related to assembly, insertion and testing. A 32GB iPhone 7 Plus costs $649 as a point of comparison. Still, before you get too irate about the price, this doesn’t cover other elements such as research and development, software, licensing costs and transportation. The accuracy of the component costs is also questionable. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he has never seen a cost breakdown that is “anywhere close to being accurate,” adding that they are generally “much different than the reality.” The iPhone 7 estimated development cost is more expensive than previous models while the iPhone SE’s costs remains around $160. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Google, now part of holding company Alphabet, was the top spender among tech firms on lobbying in the first two quarters of this year. The company spent roughly $8.04 million on Washington advocacy between January and the end of June. ADVERTISEMENT Next comes Amazon, which spent $5.81 million, and Facebook, which spent $4.97 million, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. “It seems as though the internet companies have decided to really invest more in Washington,” said Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director for the Center. Oracle, which along with a subsidiary spent $4.12 million, and Microsoft, which spent $4.09 million, round out the top five tech spenders for the first half of the year. Intel, Qualcomm, IBM and Apple are also spending heavily on lobbying. So is the Entertainment Software Association, which lobbies on behalf of the video game industry. The Hill’s list does not include telecom companies, like Comcast and AT&T, that provide the infrastructure of the internet or other media companies that often advocate on similar issues. Lobbying spending was down at many companies in the first half of 2016 compared to the year before. Such drops are often seen in election years, when lawmakers spend much of their time on the campaign trail rather than legislating. Tech nonetheless remains engaged with numerous policy battles in Congress and the executive branch. The prominence of web firms — compared with the last presidential election year in 2012 — reflects how they have become major players in Washington policy debates. “We think it is important to be part of that discussion and to help policymakers understand our business and the work we do to keep the internet open and to encourage economic opportunity,” said a Google spokesperson in a statement. Four years ago, during the last presidential election, Google also dominated lobbying spending in the tech sector. But Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Qualcomm and Siemens were also in the top five. Hewlett-Packard, which has since been split into two companies, and Siemens both spent significantly less in the first half of 2016 than they did four years ago. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise spent roughly $1.95 million in the first six months of the year, and HP Inc., which now contains the printer and personal computer divisions, spent $810,000. Their corporate predecessor spent $3.75 million in the first two quarters of 2012. Other companies are on the rise. Amazon has spent more than a million dollars more on lobbying in the first half of 2016 than it did in the same period in 2015. That increase, which began at the end of last year, appears driven by the company’s desire for expansion in everything from delivery to online video. The company’s representatives in Washington have lobbied policymakers on regulations related to video, drones and taxes, among other issues, according to filings. “Like a lot of businesses, Amazon has a presence in Washington and we focus on issues that matter to us,” former White House press secretary Jay Carney, now an Amazon executive, told The Washington Post in February. Jill Kerr, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to comment on its lobbying spending. Apple, too, has spent heavily on policy fights in recent years. The tech giant has spent roughly $2.2 million in the first two quarters of 2016, more than double the $970,000 it spent in 2012 during the same timeframe. Apple, however, has spent considerably less in the first half of 2016 than it did in the first half of 2015. And despite being the world’s largest and most profitable company, Apple spends less on lobbying than some of its competitors. Apple also pursues influence through other means that don’t show up in lobbying dollars. CEO Tim Cook’s relationships with politicians, for example, can help increase Apple’s political clout. In the past, Cook has fundraised for the likes of Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanTrump vowed to “drain the swamp,” here’s how Overnight Finance: House GOP plans short-term spending bill | Senate Republicans not happy | Yellen intends to finish term In Medicare fixes for ACA — keep the good stuff MORE (R-Wis.) and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonThe Hill's 12:30 Report Gardner's chief of staff tapped for Senate GOP campaign director Big change on the horizon for NASA under Trump MORE and has met with Sen.

When Apple does spend money on lobbying, it focuses on intellectual property — an area in which it has had high-profile legal battles with competitor Samsung — as well as labor reform, trade, surveillance, education and energy. Apple declined to comment for this story. Facebook, like Apple, has significantly boosted its lobbying spending since the first half of 2012, from around $1.6 million to roughly $4.9 million. The social media giant put lobbying dollars into areas like surveillance and trade but also immigration legislation to grant highly skilled workers visas, something that could benefit the company and tech in general as demand for skilled software developers continues to rise. Facebook and many other web companies have come to see Washington as integral to their success, experts say. “Only more recently have internet companies realized policies in Washington are extremely important to them and they need to play the same game that many other corporations do to be heard,” noted Novak, of the Center for Responsive Politics.

Intel is collaborating with Oakley to launch its first product, the voice controlled smart glasses, Radar Pace. These were first showcased at the CES, 2016 in Las Vegas earlier this year where three times Iron Man world champion, Craig Alexander starred in a demonstration video wearing Oakley’s Radar Pace during a workout. Oakley’s Radar Pace is designed on the principles of bi-directional communication, wherein the glasses are activated by the phrase ‘Ok Radar.’ This further activates a voice controlled workout plan along with motivational comments throughout the workout. The smart glasses also provide information of power in watts and pace per mile. The glasses consist of a collection of sensors that include an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer and sensors for humidity and proximity. The removable earphones that come along with the glasses act as microphones, which are backed by Intel’s Real Audio technology. Wearers could also communicate with other digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant. The system will reportedly understand English, Italian, German, Spanish and French initially. “The hardware is paired with an app. Like most workout apps, you start by entering your key metrics: gender, age, height, weight and then some details about your workout goals. The app is designed to learn from each workout and make adjustments to your regimen accordingly,” reported Mashable. Oakley’s Radar Pace is expected to be available for sale from October 1 onward.

Photo courtesy of BMW Group Navigation, visual scanning and artificial intelligence know-how originally developed for Israel’s military are now set to be the brains of almost everyone’s next vehicle. “As technology becomes a key element in the automotive industry and more global players aim toward developing these [driverless] vehicles, our multidisciplinary approach to high-tech is making us a bigger and bigger player in the industry,” said Ziva Eger, chief executive of Israel’s International Investments and Industrial Cooperation Authority. “With more than 300 companies in the auto-tech sector, the ‘Startup Nation’ is quickly becoming the ‘Transportation Nation,’ ” Eger, a retired Israel Defense Force Colonel, told the Journal. Over the summer, automakers BMW, Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co. announced partnerships with or acquisitions of Israeli firms developing the technology behind the coming generation of driverless vehicles. Amnon Shashua, a computer science professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is credited in large part for Israel’s emergence as a global leader in smart-car development. His company, Mobileye, is the top supplier of camera-based sensors used in driver-assistance systems already on the road.  In 1993, Shashua completed his doctoral dissertation, “Geometry and Photometry in 3D Visual Recognition.” In 1999, he co-founded Mobileye, and in 2014 the company launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $1 billion. The market value of all of Mobileye’s shares is estimated at $5.3 billion, setting the record as the biggest Israeli IPO ever in the United States.  Last month, Mobileye, BMW and Intel — the world’s largest chip maker — negotiated a pact to jointly develop autonomous-car technology. “It’s one thing to come and say: ‘I developed a technology,’ ” Shashua said. “It’s another thing to say, ‘I have already partnered with one-third of the global industry.’ ” In late July, in order to improve its driverless car technology, Ford Motor Co. bought Israeli computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS. Ford plans to put driverless vehicles on the road in a ride-sharing service such as Uber or Lyft by 2021. Although no financial details of the acquisition were disclosed, the Tel Aviv business daily Globes reports that Ford will pay in the tens of millions of dollars for the Israeli startup founded in 2013. SAIPS has developed algorithmic solutions in image and video processing, deep learning and signal processing needed to achieve what industry insiders call Level 4 technology. A Level 3 vehicle can operate safely with the driver’s “eyes off” the road, while Level 4 indicates a “mind off” vehicle able to perform all safety-critical functions throughout a trip without a driver having to be prepared to take control. “The next decade will be defined by automation of the automobile, and we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as Ford’s moving assembly line did 100 years ago,” said Ford CEO Mark Fields, in a statement released shortly after its Israeli tech acquisition. This year, Ford will triple its autonomous vehicle test fleet to be the largest of any automaker, bringing the number to about 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrid sedans, with plans to triple it again in 2017. In June, Volkswagen — Europe’s largest carmaker — invested $300 million in Uber’s Israel-based competitor Gett Inc., a move that helps the company acquire the ride-sharing information needed to repurpose geographic and driver behavior data into the deep intelligence needed to deploy autonomous cars. “The partnership with Gett marks the first milestone for the Volkswagen Group on the road to providing integrated mobility solutions that spotlight our customers and their mobility needs,” said Volkswagen’s Chairman Matthias Müller. Driverless vehicles will require the development of new rules of the road. Regulators in Washington, D.C., invited Israel’s Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz to a meeting with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to sign an agreement giving the American government an advisory role in the development of autonomous vehicles at the ministry’s technology center in Herzliya. Automotive firms know that connected cars are at risk of cyberattacks, and Israeli data security companies are already doing business with much of the industry worldwide. Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Argus, founded by veterans of Unit 8200 — the Israeli Army’s signal intelligence and code decryption branch — has opened offices in Michigan, Tokyo and Stuttgart, Germany, to serve global automakers.  “The more connectivity is embedded into these vehicles, the greater the need for cyber solutions to protect these cars from getting hacked,” Argus’ marketing director Monique Lance told the Journal.

X Oracle OpenWorld dreams of AI but deals in cloud computing Software giant has turned from sceptic about cloud to evangelist for it Thu, Sep 22, 2016, 06:20 John Holden San Francisco Oracle chairman Larry Ellison speaking at the OpenWorld 2016 conference in San Francisco. Photograph: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         The tech industry has to be the worst offender when it comes to perpetuating buzzwords and fads. As companies – small and large – gamble on their futures by backing one new tech innovation over another, they know that the more people hear and see the name of a new technology the more likely it will stick and become more than just the tech du jour. In previous times, Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle – the world’s largest business software firm – publicly wrote off internet-based computing, or “the cloud”, as a fad. Probably because those endorsing the new tech were in direct competition with the older business software programmes his company was still selling and maintaining worldwide. Then this summer, Ellison acquired cloud company NetSuite for $9.3 billion, a deal from which he reportedly made a personal profit of $3.5 billion (€3.2 billion). Oracle OpenWorld Now the cloud means everything to Oracle. The word was plastered on every poster and repeated ad nauseam by every speaker at Oracle OpenWorld 2016, an annual customer event, which celebrated its 20th year being held in San Francisco this week. Several thousand gathered at the downtown Moscone Centre – including 11,000 developers for the Java One Conference alone. The sun never stopped shining on the cloud appreciation event, which also had a surprisingly heavy security presence throughout. “We will look back to the dawn of cloud computing and compare it to the disruption created by PCs in the 1990s,” said Diane Bryant, executive vice-president and general manager of the data centre group for Intel Corporation, a key partner of Oracle’s in its expansion into the cloud. Oracle’s decision to stop worrying and love the cloud notwithstanding, the arguments for its proliferation into business are convincing. “This is not a fad, this is a generational shift,” said Oracle chief executive Mark Hurd. “If all the cloud did was cost less but do the same thing as on premise computing systems, everybody would switch to it. But that’s just one part – it makes the data environment more secure, more reliable and it’s far easier to use.” ADVERTISEMENT According to Hurd, cloud providers already generate $30 billion in revenue and yet the tech is so cost-effective for customers that it drives down everything from IT costs to labour and day-to-day office expenses. Various clients including Orange, HSBC and ride-sharing superstar Lyft were wheeled out to validate Oracle’s claims that the cloud makes economic sense. The savings made from a firm’s IT budget, says Hurd, can go into the R&D budget. “So moving to the cloud isn’t just a technical shift, it’s a different economic model,” he said. Artificial intelligence Even artificial intelligence (AI) technology – another major talking point in business tech circles at present – was developing at its current pace because of the data-storage capabilities afforded by cloud platforms. “Cloud computing is a fundamentally more efficient way to deliver all kinds of machine-learning services,” said Intel’s Diane Bryant. “It’s now cost-feasible to store and compute massive amounts of data, which is allowing for many of the advances we’re currently seeing in AI. “Data is the game-changer,” she said. “It is the differentiator for business. AI is all around us, not just in science fiction, and it is transforming the way businesses operate.” Really? Well kind of. “This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature,” reported Quentin Hardy this week in the New York Times. There’s certainly a buzz around AI for business at the moment but levels of conviction concerning its potential don’t seem as strong as, say, cloud-platform technology. “Everyone in the industry is talking up the possibilities of AI for business,” one Oracle staff member told The Irish Times. “There are some interesting products on offer but not all of us are convinced.” Online software platform for sales and marketing Salesforce. com announced last week it was including AI in its product suite. The timing of the firm’s announcement is significant as it meant it could take the sting out of any AI revelations Oracle might be planning at OpenWorld 2016 the following week. For now, AI remains a side project that business software companies must be seen to be active in. Today’s battle remains in the cloud. Even if the new computing platform did turn out to be tech’s latest fad and fall victim to its own hype (which is less than unlikely by the way) Larry Ellison and Co still have plenty to be positive about. Over 300,000 companies worldwide still use Oracle databases, while around 100,000 customers employ its business applications, meaning the corporation is still the world’s largest business technology provider.       Topics: Diane Bryant Larry Ellison Mark Hurd Quentin Hardy HSBC Intel Netsuite Oracle Salesforce San Francisco(US) Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Ireland could be facing even bigger recession, Martin warns Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Business Fold-away €5 bike helmet wins Dyson award Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Reuters/Maxim Zmeyev When the iPhone 7 launch craze seems to be dying down a bit, Apple’s MacBook Pro 2016 is taking centre stage. It’s a widely-anticipated device and rumours suggest that the Cupertino-based tech giant may unveil the device this October. However, some suggest that Apple will wait for the Intel Kaby Lake processors as it would make the MacBook Pro 2016 a must-have. It will be interesting to see whether Apple decides to release the MacBook Pro 2016 with minor upgrades or make it unique with top-class specs and never-seen-before features. Rumours suggest the upcoming MacBook has been given a major makeover with innovative designs, specs and features. According to Mobile & Apps, Apple will make the MacBook Pro 2016 thinner and lighter also introducing the innovative hinge design. More colour options are also a possibility. The company seems to be very serious about removing the 3.5mm headphone jack from its future devices as it is a way to show the world that Apple has the courage to think ahead. Thus, the MacBook Pro 2016, just like iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, may also have the Bluetooth AirPods. As per Apple Insider, MacBook Pro 2016’s physical function keys may also be replaced by an OLED display touch bar that could have modifiable software keys that will adapt to the functions and requirements of various apps. However, the most incredible change that is expected in the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 would be its processor. If at all Apple decides to release the device in October, then it would have to settle for the also-powerful sixth generation Intel Skylake processors. These processors are fast enough to provide a major boost to the device’s speed. The chipset may also help in better battery performance that can be more than just impressive. Now that Apple has introduced the Apple Pay for Mac, fans may be wowed to see an advanced Touch ID fingerprint sensor included in the MacBook Pro 2016. Some unconfirmed reports also stated that the device may have a detachable touch screen. An improvement in resolution is also highly possible. A highly upgraded Apple Pencil could feature with the Apple MacBook Pro 2016.

This is sensationalist, untrue and distracts from a genuine problem. With that solved, let's get to the real root cause of the problems here: The real problem here is that Intel do very little to ensure that free operating systems work well on their consumer hardware - we still have no information from Intel on how to configure systems to ensure good power management, we have no support for storage devices in "RAID" mode and we have no indication that this is going to get better in future. If Intel had provided that support, this issue would never have occurred. Rather than be angry at Lenovo, let's put pressure on Intel to provide support for their hardware. As someone who tried to move his retina MacBook Pro to Linux only a few weeks ago - I can attest to Intel's absolutely terrible Linux drivers and power management. My retina MacBook Pro has an Intel Iris 6100 graphics chip, and the driver for it is so incredibly bad that even playing a simple video will cause the laptop to become so hot I was too scared to leave it running. Playing that same video in OS X or Windows doesn't even spin up the fans, with the laptop entirely cool. Battery life in Linux measured in a 2-3 hours, whereas on OS X or Windows I easily get 8-10 hours.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple charges $649 for the cheapest version of the iPhone 7, but it actually costs a lot less to build. IHS Markit reports that it the materials inside each iPhone 7 add up to just $219.80, before adding an extra $5 per device to cover manufacturing. That’s actually $36.89 more than the iPhone 6s, according to IHS estimates, bringing Apple’s material cost closer to what Samsung pays per flagship smartphone. Cupertino reportedly pushed suppliers to cut costs ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, but it also packed the device with plenty of upgraded hardware. So it makes sense that the price of materials would go up slightly. Breaking down the components, the most expensive piece is the display at $43. Intel’s modem and other chips from the company cost about $33.90 overall. The new A10 Fusion processor reportedly costs $26.90, while the iPhone 7’s bigger battery is priced at $2.50. The front and rear-facing cameras add up to $19.90, while the iPhone 7’s 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage cost $16.40  IHS lumps the new Taptic Engine, antennas, microphones, speakers and connectors together at $16.70. The audio chips, barometer, accelerometer, gyroscope, Touch ID sensor and a few other sensors combine for another $14. Each iPhone 7 also comes with new Lightning EarPods, a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter and a USB power adapter. That’s another $11.80 per unit. Of course, that doesn’t factor in all the work the company does before manufacturing even starts, including research, design, engineering, software development, licensing and more. CEO Tim Cook has also previously denounced these sort of cost estimates, though it’s safe to assume each new iPhone will always come with a pretty big markup.

Ability to wage nuclear war at Trump’s ‘arm’s length’ 18-Nov-16 WASHINGTON: President-elect Do ... Merit is a misunderstood trait in our part of the world mainly because of lack of understanding. Clarity of definitions is always helpful. Merit is defined as the demonstrated ability or achievement that is worthy of praise while discretion is freedom of judgment or choice. Most of us claim to follow merit while using discretion that at times is obvious and blatant. Use of discretion usually leads to unfairness; in other words, it causes poor decisions and should be avoided as a matter of policy. Dr Andy Grove, one of the three co-founders of the Intel Corporation, said that for any serious consideration an idea should be produced in a written form. Most people believe that innovation starts with an idea but according to Dr Grove only when it is written down, understood and communicable it is worthy of consideration. In order for merit to prevail it should also be in a written from and communicated. Most quality management systems require job descriptions for important positions to ensure merit. Individuals have to meet the laid down conditions in order to qualify, and there is very little discretion or freedom to select at will. Several books have been written about the downside of discretion; the recent one is by James C Cooper titled The Perils of Excessive Discretion. Indeed, developing countries like Pakistan have suffered because of this menace. It invariably leads to the phenomenon of “blind leading the blind,” the end result of which is more blindness that we see all around us today. For those who cannot see, light has no meaning for them. The famous proverb “Light at the end of the tunnel” is rendered meaningless for those who live and prosper in darkness. There is no hope in their dawn or relaxation in their dusk; it is all the same drudgery for them. Good universities have written course outlines for every class. At the start of the term, the instructor is required to communicate the grading policy. It then constitutes an agreement between the teacher and the taught, which has to be adhered to. In my teaching experience, there have been situations where the student had managed to get an A grade though he was not worthy of it. Once the grading policy has been announced, teacher’s discretion to award grades is limited, and the criteria have to be followed. Even in ancient times, there were battles and contests for leadership. In history there are many famous duels. Emperor Humayun had to flee India when he was defeated by the brilliant leader, Sher Shah Suri. Historians believe had Suri lived on the Mughal Dynasty his brilliance would not have taken roots. Even in those times sword was used to establish merit. Weak rulers were weeded out or constantly threatened by the powerful. Merit was determined through power. In jungles the pack or herd animals have a framework for the leader to emerge, and there is no blind following. Naturally, they lack the ability to read and write that humans have; as such a written framework to ascertain merit is essentially required for humanity to move forward. The prevalent scenario in Pakistan is even worse than the jungle. Imagine the country under the premiership of Hamza Shehbaz Sharif or Maryam Nawaz Sharif. At least there should be some discussion on their education, credentials, experience and background before passing on the mantle to them. Lee Iacocca was perhaps the most brilliant corporate leader of the 20th century. He started his career as an engineer at the Ford Motor Company (FMC) in Michigan, and rose to be the president of the group. The Ford Mustang was his masterpiece development that brought him to prominence. The FMC was the last large family controlled business in the USA. For top management positions one had to be a Ford. Iacocca was fired by Henry Ford Jr, the last Ford to head the company. After leaving his parent company Iacocca then turned around the bankrupt Chrysler Corporation. In his book, he talks about his encounters with his boss. When discussions got heated and Henry Ford could not get his way he would take Iacocca to the window and show him the Ford name on the building. In other words, it was a shut-up call, as it was their company: the Fords had to be obeyed. My way or the highway was the approach, and eventually, Iacocca had to leave. When the Ford discretion destroyed the company the board finally decided to bring in professional management. The FMC not only survived it also became prosperous under the professionals. Meritocracy is the only way forward. Pakistan started off well. In Jinnah’s homeland where we opened our eyes merit was the order of the day. We were required to prove our credentials for which hard work was required. It was the result of these efforts that we produced winners in all fields. In 1996, Pakistan had five world championships — cricket, hockey, squash, snooker and yachting; today, we don’t have any international medal. Discretion has taken over merit with obvious consequences. It is time to put the country back on tracks. Abilities have to be demonstrable and communicable. Mystery is mischief; transparency and openness can effectively check the ills of discretion that is taking us down. It should be merit, merit and merit all the way if we desire to come out of this discretion-created mess.   The writer is a former chairman of the Pakistan Science Foundation, and can be reached at fmaliks@hotmail.com Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Margrethe Vestager is on a US charm offensive, making the case about recovering alleged unpaid taxes – but she has been met with more offense than charm The European Commission is seeking ‘recovery of illegal state aid’ from Apple for alleged unpaid taxes in Ireland. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP Geof Wheelwright Wednesday 21 September 2016 14.50 EDT Last modified on Thursday 22 September 2016 14.02 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old In the wake of last month’s controversial decision by the European Commission to seek “recovery of illegal state aid” for alleged unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple of up to €13bn – plus interest – the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, went to the United States this week on a “charm offensive” to make her case to government officials, lawmakers and trade officials. Vestager met with US treasury secretary Jacob Lew, had a closed-door session with members of the US Senate finance committee, and spoke at the Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium at Georgetown University, where she gave a vigorous defense of the EC’s decision. “Our rules don’t stop governments applying a low tax rate to every company,” she said in the speech. “What they can’t do is to select just a few favored businesses and give them special treatment which their rivals can’t get. So when we ask national governments to reclaim unpaid taxes, all we’re doing is ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity. The ​​commissioner failed to build an effective case for this highly politicized ruling Senator Orrin Hatch “That is only fair. And I think that’s what people expect of their public authorities. Not to get cozy with special interests, but to have the courage to defend the public interest. And that’s an area where competition enforcers can lead by example.” So far, however, reaction to her visit – and her comments – has been more offense than charm. The Senate finance committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, met with Vestager in advance of her meeting with the bipartisan Senate committee and was moved to make a statement about the meeting. “Rather than working with countries to strengthen the international tax framework and improve the rule of law, the European commission, in its recent state aid ruling, opted to run roughshod over an American firm by retroactively overriding a tax opinion between a sovereign country and a company,” he said. “Though our meetings were cordial, the commissioner failed to build an effective case for this highly politicized ruling rooted in an erroneous interpretation of law, underscoring the need for additional action in international courts.” After Apple: will other tech companies face Irish tax bills of their own? Read more Technology industry advocates and analysts echoed this view. Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council), said that members of his group (which includes Amazon, Apple, Dell, EMC, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel and Microsoft) did not think Vestager’s visit will have much of an impact. “It hasn’t changed anything,” he said. “It’s aimed at explaining and putting in context what is largely inexplicable.” Personal rapport, he said, is helpful to work through difficult trade issues, “so a degree of familiarity and trust is helpful, but the policy implications remain the same”. Technology industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president and principal analyst of San Jose-based Creative Strategies, was even more blunt. “Every major company we deal with has the same basic position – it’s sensitive for them to speak out, but as far as they are concerned, they have paid every tax they legally owe,” he said. “A retroactive tax just doesn’t sit well with anyone here in the US.” Bajarin, who has been advising US technology companies for more than 30 years, also offers a historical perspective based on his own work with those companies when they were being courted by Ireland’s Industrial Development Agency (IDA) to make a move to Ireland in the first place. “Had they not built this program, they would not have built a tech industry in Ireland,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland He also said that he was surprised by the European commission’s decision to seek retroactive taxes, since the EU was well aware of the IDA’s work with Apple and other technology companies from the start. “From when they first did the program, they got the EU’s approval – and nobody had any problems with it for almost 30 years.” Bajarin also suggested that it loses sight of why tax incentives were offered in the first place. “Parents were getting upset with the Irish government [because there was no significant technology sector in Ireland] and their kids would leave. That was a huge issue and why the Irish government created this program – so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry. And it was very successful,” he said. When Silicon Valley started booming, the IDA opened an office in San Francisco and pitched everything around tax, he explains. Yet despite concerns about the European commission’s decision on Apple, virtually all of the players on the US side of the discussion concede that tax reform in the United States is part of the solution. Hatch weighed into the issue in his comments on the meeting with Vestager. “We must do our part to address the anti-competitive nature of the US tax code and the impact it has had on our domestic job creators both here and abroad,” Hatch said. “Lowering the corporate tax burden and shifting to a territorial regime with base erosion protections will help shift our economic landscape and produce fertile ground for more businesses to invest here at home. It’s an achievable, bipartisan goal that holds great promise, should we get a willing partner in the White House.” The Irish government created this program so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry. And it was very successful Tim Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies Garfield concurred. “The best way to address this is to address the tax code and not to address the rules in the middle of the game,” he said, suggesting that no government should be making retroactive calls on taxation issues. Garfield also said he hoped that both of the leading candidates for the US presidency would recognize the importance of dealing with tax reform. “Tax reform should not be a political football,” he added. “The need for change is compelling and should be something all parties should agree on.” Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, commented on tax reform following the European commission ruling. “Apple has long supported international tax reform with the objectives of simplicity and clarity. We believe these changes should come about through the proper legislative process, in which proposals are discussed among the leaders and citizens of the affected countries. And as with any new laws, they should be applied going forward – not retroactively,” he said. Vestager’s US visit continues on Wednesday with a speech at New York’s Columbia University called “Tax avoidance and privacy in the digital age: an EU perspective”. She also issued a statement clarifying the commission’s definition of “state aid” as part of the announcement of a finding on Wednesday that found that “five public measures for purely local operations in Spain, Germany and Portugal involve no state aid because they are unlikely to affect trade between member states” and will thus not be the subject of any commission action. “In many cases member states can stimulate investment without asking the commission,” she said. “These decisions confirm that many local public support measures do not constitute state aid. This reflects the Juncker Commission’s approach to be ‘big on big things and small on small things’.” More news Topics Apple Tax and spending Silicon Valley European commission Margrethe Vestager Corporate governance Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Both drives feature 3D NAND (which Samsung refers to as V-NAND) to offer more storage capacity than a traditional 2D NAND methodology would allow. While companies like Intel are releasing their first batches of SDDs with the new technology this year, Samsung has been using 3D NAND for consumer hardware since the release of the popular 850 Pro and 850 Evo SSDs back in 2014. the first consumer SSDs from Samsung to use the NVMe interface specification Last year’s model, the 950 Pro, used 32-layer V-NAND technology from the 850 series of SATA SSDs, but replaced the older 2.5-inch SATA interface for the newer and smaller PCIe form factor. In 3D NAND, the number of layers is key to offering increased storage, and Samsung has managed to upgrade both this year's 960 Pro and 960 Evo to using 48-layer V-NAND technology. Both 960 series drives are also the first consumer SSDs from Samsung to use the newer NVMe interface specification to achieve faster speeds. The 960 Pro is the top-of-the-line consumer model, which uses faster and more reliable – but less memory dense and therefore more expensive – MLC (Multi Level Cell) memory, where each memory cell can contain 2 bits of charge. The 960 Evo, on the other hand, uses cheaper TLC (Triple Level Cell) technology, which divides each cell into three possible bits of data, at the expense of reliability and speed. But Samsung is touting even the budget 960 Evo models as faster than last year's 950 Pro, with speeds of up to 3200 MB/s read and 1900 MB/s write, while the flagship 960 Pro can reach up to 3500 MB/s read and 2100 MB/s write. Both the 960 Pro and 960 Evo are scheduled for release in October. The 960 Pro starts at $329.99 for 512GB up to $1,299 for 2TB, while the 960 Evo begins at $129.88 for 250GB up to $479 for 1TB of storage.

So you’ll want to consider getting a decent note-taking machine, but it doesn’t have to break the bank. Chromebooks are a option if you want to save money when buying a laptop, although what you have to consider is the fact they’re very different to MacBooks or Windows models. They use Google’s proprietary Chrome OS and predominantly function by being connected to the internet. Most of the device’s applications are cloud-based. If the mandatory Wi-Fi connection doesn’t bother you, then have a look at the Acer Chromebook 14. It’s one of the best Chrome devices you can get, offering you access to all Google’s cloud features in a sleek form and costing a little over £200. Sleek and stylish, it offers a 14-inch HD display, a 16GB hard drive and an Intel Celeron processor. The Chromebook 14 costs £240/$300.

Costing a little over £100, it’ll easily connect up to your phone via Bluetooth, offers 12 hours of battery life and is splashproof. The Libratone Too costs £110/$150.

For more information on Server Hardware Why Lenovo for Hyperconverged? Partner Offers HPE's all-in-one-box solution is the HC 250, which packs up to four nodes into a single 2U chassis. It comes in two basic flavors with support for both VMware and Microsoft's Cloud Platform Systems – Standard. The HPE Hyper Converged 380 is the newest member of the family and is based on the popular DL 380 Gen9 server. This product starts with a minimum of two physical servers and scales up to as many as sixteen nodes. With a front-panel storage capacity of up to twenty-four small form factor (SFF) drive slots, it's possible to max out the unit at 25.2 TB of storage per appliance with the current software. This will only increase over time. HPE's secret sauce for both of these systems is in the company's simplified OneView InstantOn (OVIO) deployment tool. This menu-driven question and answer tool takes the majority of the pain out of configuring multiple machines for clustering, networking and storage. On the storage side, HPE uses its StoreVirtual VSA (Virtual Storage Appliance) product for both the HC 250 and HC 380. StoreVirtual VSA takes the place of VSAN for VMware and Storage Spaces on the Microsoft side. We'll look at this feature in more detail in a bit. Hardware Details With the HPE DL380 used as the basic building block, the HC 380 requires a minimum of eight disk drives plus 10Gb networking added in. A minimum of 128GB of memory is the recommended starting point with a range of options for number of CPU cores. Our test system consisted of two HP DL380 systems equipped with Intel E5-2620 v3 CPUs and 128 GB of memory. While you can order the system with all 1 GbE networking, HPE recommends using 10 GbE for best performance. It's worth pointing out here that VMware requires a minimum of three hosts to construct a minimal VSAN cluster. Some deployment scenarios, such as remote office applications, can be configured as a two-node system with an external system (possibly remote) as the witness. StoreVirtual scales up to a total of 32 hosts should you need that big of a cluster. VSAN 6.2 now scales up to sixty-four hosts, giving it the edge on expandability. Disk configurations vary depending on your application. HPE recommends implementing one full block consisting of eight drives at a time. Each DL 380 will support up to three blocks or a total of twenty-four drives. These can be any combination of HDD or SSD drives to include all HDD or all SSD. All storage is managed by the StoreVirtual Appliance software and is fully integrated with VMware vSphere. The nice thing about using a commodity server like the DL 380 as the building block is the flexibility it brings. Special Sauce Setup and configuration is greatly simplified with the OneView InstantOn (OVIO) tool. The foundation of this tool is used for both the HC 250 running Microsoft's Cloud Platform System and the HC 380 we tested running VMware vSphere. Configuring multiple network addresses and individual settings for each node in a large cluster can be tedious and error prone (see Figure 1). HPE's OVIO takes all the information needed through a simple dialog process and then does everything for you. HPE HC380 - Figure 1 (Click for larger image) HPE offers a simulator-only version of the OneView InstantOn tool for instructional purposes. This tool works just like the real tool with the exception of actually installing or modifying any hardware configurations. It's useful for walking through the various menus to help identify any information required for a successful installation. In fact, it's a great way to identify all the IP addresses and system information you'll need to complete the process. Figure 2 shows the summary page listing the configuration details prior to deployment. HPE HC380 - Figure 2 (Click for larger image) Management Multiple avenues exist for managing the HC 380 system. An overall dashboard as shown in Figure 3 presents a summary of the system with quick links to tasks such as back and restore and software updates. HPE HC380 - Figure 3 (Click for larger image) Other tabs on the left side show Virtual Machines, system Activity and Utilization. The web-based management interface provides quick access to many functions that would typically take a number of clicks in the vCenter. HP OneView for VMware vCenter version 7.8.2 provides a connection to a number of management tools specific to the management of the HC 380. Figure 4 shows the menu that presents when you right-click on the cluster. The All HP Management Actions entry provides links to create a Datastore, VM from Template and deploy the HP StoreOnce management console or an additional VSA instance. HPE HC380 - Figure 4 (Click for larger image) All other vSphere actions, including creating, deleting, moving and cloning VMs, function just as you would expect against the VSA-based datastore. Bottom Line The HPE HC 380 builds upon the foundation of the venerable DL 380 system to deliver hyper-converged features with simplified installation and management. HPE's OVIO takes the complexity out of cluster installation and makes it cookie-cutter simple. HPE's StoreVirtual Appliance brings redundant, multi-node storage at a cost below what you would pay for a similar VSAN installation. Pricing remains in the "call for availability" category, but the product is listedon their website.

Promontory, my dear Watson Microsoft boasts its cloudy Hadoop big data mill's faster than yours Amazon: Students, we'll give you $2.5m for a chat-up, AI? Dell is all about engineered systems, or so its CEO Mickey D said recently, but actions speak louder than words and today the Texan infrastructure baron rolled out a box targeting firms running SAP HANA. The Dell EMC Validated Systems for SAP HANA v.4.1 is an updated version of Dell’s ready-built system for scale-out deployments of SAP’s analytic database platform aimed at larger enterprises. This is based on the firm’s PowerEdge R930 server hardware, which was itself updated back in June with Intel’s latest Xeon E7 v4 processor family. Dell EMC makes customary big claims that this is the “fastest server for running SAP workloads”, quoting benchmarks that rate it at 33,500 advanced navigation steps per hour with the SAP Business Warehouse Advance Mixed Load operating with 2 billion records. Coming next month is the Dell EMC Validated System for SAP HANA Edge, a platform aimed at making it easier for smaller mid-market companies to operate data analytics. First detailed earlier this year at SAP’s SAPPHIRE NOW event, this is delivered as a fully integrated appliance running SAP HANA Edge edition, advanced version and SAP Predictive Analytics. Continuing the SAP love-in, Dell EMC also unveiled a reference architecture aimed at helping manufacturing firms to implement predictive maintenance regimes through analysis of operational data - essentially a use case for the Internet of things (IoT). This reference architecture brings together Dell EMC’s Edge Gateway devices, sensors from ifm efector, and the Dell EMC Validated System for SAP HANA running SAP Predictive Maintenance and Service (PdMS), and is intended to cut operational costs through elimination of unnecessary maintenance and early diagnosis of any developing faults - that at least is the aim. These latest announcements seem to show the newly forged Dell EMC is well aware that has to offer something beyond just hardware and software, and is moving to become a one-stop provider of ready-integrated solutions for its business customers. As noted by The Register previously, this is a path already trodden by rival Oracle. The margins are better than on standard boxes and Dell needs as much margin as it can grab after the $63bn buy of EMC. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Michael Dell promises new EMC/Dell/VMware engineered systems Vmworld Expect them ASAP once the EMC deal closes, which will be real soon now 5 Comments Dell-EMC, Pure Storage disengage from legal brawl Lawyers weep as retirement plans go AWOL and Dell gets payment Dell EMC cranks Xeon servers into ludicrous mode with Tesla GPUs But can it play Crysis on ultra? 10 Comments EMC storage wranglers to cuddle Dell SC arrays Compelling development for SC, much less so for PS Series 3 Comments SonicWall goes it alone as Elliott and pal swallow Dell/Quest Software Rumours abound of product lines ending – and layoffs too 5 Comments Dell has laid off EMC people at Hopkinton Getting rid of overlapping job functions 7 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

In the rush to cross into Europe, following German Chancellor Angela Merkel's announcement that her country's doors were open to refugees, the German the Federal Bureau of Migration and Refugees (BAMF) struggled to deal with the sheer volume of migrants arriving in its borders.  © AP Photo/ Armin Weigel German Intel Warns Daesh Hit-Squads, Sleeper Cells Infiltrated Country Among Refugees A year on, politicians in the German Bundestgag have been told that only around 20-30 percent of migrants arriving showed any form of identity and that many passports being checked now are being found to be fake, giving rise to fears that there could be hundreds — or even thousands — of Daesh sleepers in Germany. According the Die Welt newspaper, at the height of the migration, hundreds of thousands were making their way into Germany each month via the West Balkan route and — without border controls — staff from BAMF were overwhelmed.

More Sleeper Cells There is evidence that sleeper cells may have been set up as early as 2012 — which the 2015 influx may have joined. According to a 99-page manifesto, "Black Flags from Rome" — which intelligence agencies have been aware of since January 2015 — radicalized Muslims who have been trained in Syria were told to form "sleeper" cells in Europe — particularly in areas of cities and towns that were heavily populated by Muslims. "While the experienced Islamic State fighters left Syria for Europe, the European Muslims who had emigrated to the Islamic State would train within the training camps, and nobody doubted — neither the Islamic State, nor the West — that some of these trainees would be sent back to Europe to form their own secret cells to continue the Jihad and to seek revenge for the western occupation of Muslim lands," the manifesto states. "These fighters would simply receive their training and be told to go back to their European home countries, to go into 'sleeper cell' mode until the Khalifah (Caliph) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ordered to start attacks in Europe." ...

After the second world war ended a policy of ethnic cleansing started that slowly but surely turned schools, streets, neighbourhoods, villages and large parts of cities from white to to black, from vaguely christian to muslim. A crime against the German/European people that doesn't have an equivalent in history and that will lead to the extermination of Germanic society, language, culture and people.

Our mission has always been to help companies ‘consume the cloud’. Whether that is public, private or hybrid, we don’t care which clouds they consume – only that they can do it on their terms. At the heart of this approach is digital transformation. Our customers, no matter the industry or region, are all facing the same pressures to push the digital frontiers, to increase the pace at which they do business, and to match or better the technology achievements of their competition. Cloud computing has been a critical part of this transformation story, but cloud alone is not the answer to all of today’s business challenges. In their excitement to adopt the latest cloud solutions, it’s easy for organizations to forget about issues around risk and security. Then, when the question does arise, it quickly becomes apparent that while traditional approaches to security may have worked in a pre-cloud world, they are far from adequate when faced with current business demands for speed, flexibility and agility.

By Owen Hughes September 21, 2016 13:24 BST The bug appears to be mostly affecting customers in the USReuters Some iOS 10 users have reported that using Airplane mode permanently disables mobile signal on their phone. Apple is now investigating the claims. It's unclear whether the issue is affecting iOS 10 or the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus specifically, although it appears to be mostly affecting US customers who purchased an iPhone 7 through AT&T. MacRumors notes that the iPhone 7 uses different modems depending on the network operator they're purchased through, with AT&T's iPhone 7 using an Intel modem rather than the Qualcomm unit used by rivals Sprint and Verizon. Some users have found that restarting their device solves the problem, however others have been forced to return their device to Apple in exchange for a new one. A video uploaded to YouTube shows an iPhone 7 with no cellular service, next to an iPhone 6S connected to a 4G signal. According to the owner of the video, the phone lost signal after turning on the device's Airplane Mode and then switching it off again. They told MacRumors: "All of a sudden today my iPhone 7 Jet Black model started not getting internet service – can't make outbound calls or receive calls – even though it showed 4 bars. I then put it in Airplane Mode, and back off, then it showed no service. It got pretty warm in the top right-hand corner. "I then took a video of my wife's iPhone 6S right next to my iPhone 7, put them both in Airplane Mode, and then switched Airplane Mode off and you can see immediately that the iPhone 6s gets signal instantly, and the iPhone 7 just sits there searching. I then took her SIM and put it in my iPhone 7, no luck, put my SIM in her phone, and it got signal right away." IBTimes UK tested out the reported Airplane Mode bug and found to have no problems regaining cellular connectivity. While Apple hasn't seen anything on the scale of exploding smartphones, the launch of its latest products hasn't been smooth sailing. In addition to finding hardcore porn in iOS 10's new GIF search feature, users have also reported handsets freezing and connectivity problems with Apple's Lightning EarPods. Apple has told network providers that customers who report the latest problem should be instructed to restart their phone, and remove and then reinsert the SIM card if the issue persists.

Hewlett-Packard's (HP) new product releases for August successfully widened the vendor's shipment gap by nearly 700,000 units with number two Lenovo. HP stayed firmly as the largest notebook vendor in the month. Dell turned its focus to the consumer sector in August, but its shipments only grew a single-digit percentage on month, according to Digitimes Research's latest report on notebook shipments. Asustek Computer and Acer both enjoyed over 10% on-month growths in August thanks to seasonality. With HP's significant shipment growth in August, the top-3 ODMs, which are all suppliers of HP, together achieved higher on-month growth than the top-5 vendors combined, while ODM's combined on-year shipment growth also turned positive for the first time in the past 16 months. Quanta benefited from HP's orders the most in the month, growing nearly 40% from July.

News & Analysis Startup Tips Machine Learning Chip Wave Computing aims to leapfrog Nvidia in AI Rick Merritt 9/21/2016 08:00 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – A new startup will emerge from stealth mode and into the super-heated market for machine learning next week. Wave Computing will describe a chip that can train neural networks ten times faster than Nvidias top GPUs while consuming the same power. Wave’s chip is one of a handful of announcements at next week’s Linley Processor Conference. Also at the event, Ceva will describe a new DSP core for computer vision, Adesto will detail a NOR chip that can handle both storage and execute code and ARM will announce a new member of its family of on-chip interconnects. The news comes at a time of growing specialization in microprocessor design, according to the event’s host, veteran chip analyst Linley Gwennap. “In the 1970’s and ‘80’s people created a lot of different architectures, but over the past 20 years work has consolidated more on to ARM and x86,” said Gwennap, principal of the Linley Group. “As Moore’s law slows, Intel can’t keep delivering twice the performance every two years, so people have to innovate at the architectural level again…and we will see more custom accelerators with special instruction sets to get a 10x boost in performance,” he said. Wave is the poster child for that trend at this year’s event, showing a custom chip for accelerating the TensorFlow algorithm Google developed and designed its own ASIC to run. “We’ve looked at their architecture, and it looks very innovative, their preliminary performance numbers are 10x better than traditional GPUs in the same power as a high-end Nvidia GPU,” Gwennap said. “It’s a hot space, and they have a similar business model to Nervana [recently acquired by Intel] of selling systems to accelerate machine learning,” he added. The systems approach makes sense given the difficulty of attracting the $50-100 million needed for a new chip startup and the higher revenues for selling systems, Gwennap noted. Indeed, even Nvidia is trying to sell machine learning systems that use four of its high-end Pascal-class processors. Among other newsmakers, Adesto will describe a NOR chip with a special interface geared to speed output of programs executed on it. Typically flash is too slow to execute programs, so engineers provide SRAM, generating unacceptable costs for Adesto’s target markets in wearables and the Internet of Things. For its part, ARM will detail a more feature rich on-chip interconnect. However it is not expected to support all the bells and whistles of offerings from companies such as Arteris and Netspeed. Several presentations will look at server and networking chips that aim to attack the dominance of Intel’s Xeon processors. AMD, not presenting at the event, will have the best chance of grabbing Xeon market share with its x86-based Zen chips expected next year. “Data center guys would love to see someone compete with Intel in a way they don’t have to move all their code,” Gwennap said. Applied's X-Gene 3 could become the closest ARM server SoC to Intel's Xeon in performance. (Image: Linley Group) ARM chips also have a shot in 2017, particularly Applied Micro’s X-Gene 3 which ranks highest in performance among the current crop. Cavium’s ThunderX has the most cores, but they are relatively small, low performance ones that keep overall performance below X-Gene 3. “ThunderX 2 is significantly better, but it will probably be ThunderX 3 before they can really compete with Intel,” Gwennap said. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: AI Drives Startup to Map Deep Learning Computer Data Centers Dominate FPGA Event EE Times Silicon 60: 2016's Emerging Companies to Watch Googles TPU Hit a Tight Sked Email This Print Comment More Related Links Integrated Resistors for an Advanced Node CMOS Qualcomm Boss Brainstorms on 5G Startup Programs Multicores on Data, Not Gut U.S. Analog IP Startup Partners with Megachips Chip Veterans Scan Horizon Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: A question spike_johan   9/22/2016 8:42:18 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Thanks Rick for your rapid reply. Yes, ASICs are all about custom silicon. So are FPGAs, except FPGAs are rewritable. I guess I am still wondering if the inherent logic blocks of an FPGA (or unchangeable ASIC) is where the heavy lifting is done via processing the algorithm.

Some do this work in software on CPUs, some want the fastest GPUs for best performance (see http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328464) and others are doing architectures tailored for it such as Wave and Nervana mentioned here. Google developed an ASIC to accelerate its TensorFlow version of the algorithms: See http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323500 Separately, Microsoft and Badu have implemented FPGA cards in servers to handle specific jobs such as accelerating search, network processing and cryto. See http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323500 This broader uses of accelerators in data centers was one of the motivations for Intel to buy Altera. That move motivated all their rivals to gear up for acclerators, too. See http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1329734 In short, there's a lot of related and somewhat orthognal things going on here. Hope this helps Rick         Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author A question spike_johan   9/22/2016 10:07:44 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Rick, thanks again for another informative article on the rapid transformation that is underway in the machine learning/AI space. This brings me to my question. If I have been understanding what I have been reading these past few months, is all of this new custom silicon based [sort of] on FPGA/memory closely clustered with a CPU(s) on an SoC where specific machine learning algorithms are configured in the logic blocks of the FPGA? And to where other tasks which can be offloaded from software have been done so to run faster on hardware accelerators? Thanks if you can shed any further light on where my thinking on this subject presently is. I have been out of the game for almost five years and I find it fascinating - if I am right - how early technology like FPGAs have been relegated these new tasks.

(SPEC) has released a new version of its virtualization benchmark that adds support for the latest web encryption protocols and power measurement devices. The new SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 benchmark uses real-world workloads and SPEC's proven performance- and power-measurement methodologies to enable vendors, users and researchers to compare system performance across multiple hardware, virtualization platforms, and applications. It was developed by the SPEC Virtualization subcommittee, whose members and contributors include HPE, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, Oracle, Red Hat, and VMware. Extending an industry milestone "Since its introduction six years ago as the first vendor-neutral benchmark to measure the performance of datacenter servers used for virtualized server consolidation, SPECvirt_sc has played a central role in enabling datacenter managers to make better-informed decisions about the right configurations to meet their demands," says David Schmidt, SPEC Virtualization subcommittee chair. "It has also been a valuable development and marketing tool for vendors of virtualization solutions." Upgrades in SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 include: Support for newer security protocols -- The new version continues to support SSLv3 and adds support for TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 with several new ciphers (encryption algorithms). Updates to the power and temperature daemon (PTDaemon) -- The PTDaemon that controls power and temperature measurement has been updated to V1.8.0, the latest version from the SPECpower subcommittee. This version supports the latest power analyzers and temperature sensors. Response to user feedback -- Improvements have been made to documentation in response to user suggestions and bug reports. SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 results are comparable to results from V1.0. Result submissions to the SPEC website can be made with the V1.0 or V1.1 version of the benchmark until December 21, 2016, after which all submissions must be made with V1.1. Available immediately SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 is available for immediate download from SPEC. The cost is $3,000 for new customers; discounts are available for qualified non-profit and educational institutions. Upgrades to V1.1 are free for current licensees. SPEC will contact existing licensees and make arrangements for free downloads. Additional product and ordering information is available on the SPEC web site at https://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/.

Israeli global equity crowdfunding platform OurCrowd has closed $72 million in Series C funding. Participants in this latest round include financial institutions, family offices, and private investors from five continents. OurCrowd CEO Jon Medved said, “OurCrowd has grown exponentially since our launch in 2013 to become the leading global platform for Equity Crowdfunding. This transformative Series C funding will allow us to take advantage of the growing investor interest in quality equity crowdfunding and further expand our global operations. One half of the round will be invested in the expansion of our 7 global offices, and further developing our technology platform. The other half of the Series C funding will be used to make sure that each and every company which raises funding on our platform receives participating investment from the General Partner on the same terms as the crowd. This new capital will help us hit our goal of investing $1 billion annually by 2020.” RELATED ARTICLES OurCrowd receives license to raise funds in Singapore OurCrowd raises $10m for Asian expansion Jerusalem-based OurCrowd has to date invested in 100 portfolio companies and funds on its platform. Total investment in companies and funds now exceeds $300 million. OurCrowd has had nine exits to date from its portfolio investments: two IPO’s and seven acquisitions. These include ReWalk (IPO: Nasdaq), Crosswise (bought by Oracle), Replay Technologies (bought by Intel), and NextPeer (bought by Viber). OurCrowd portfolio company Consumer Physics CEO Dror Sharon said, “OurCrowd was one of the earliest investors in the SCiO vision. We have grown up together and come a long way, from their initial investment of $325,000 in Consumer Physics to several million dollars invested by OurCrowd into Consumer Physics so far. But what makes OurCrowd so important for Consumer Physics is not just the money, but the assistance and worldwide connections they make for our company, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis.” According to Dr. Richard Swart, former Director of Crowdfunding Research at UC Berkeley, "OurCrowd continues to lead the equity crowdfunding market not just in numbers but in the quality of their deal flow and number of their exits. They have consistently proven that crowdfunding can deliver not only the best deals but also healthy returns. OurCrowd's impressive new funding round should enable them to address the considerable challenge of scaling up their business to the billion-dollar level." “We understand the ambitions of startups and emerging enterprises and want to help them grow into sustainable businesses. We look forward to working closely with OurCrowd to further develop their platform to support the startup ecosystem both in Singapore and the broader Asian market,” said Janet Young, Managing Director of Group Channels and Digitalization at UOB Group, one of Singapore’s leading banks. “Our investment into this Series C funding for OurCrowd reinforces our commitment to supporting startups and small businesses.” Geoff Levy, Chairman of Monash Private Equity in Sydney, Australia, an OurCrowd investor and member of the OurCrowd Advisory Board, stated that “OurCrowd has grown incredibly fast over the last 3+ years. With this new and important Series C funding, we expect to continue this steep growth trajectory, not only gaining more investors and capital worldwide, but most importantly increasing the ‘crowds’ involvement in sourcing and adding value to our remarkable portfolio of companies.” Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on September 21, 2016 © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2016 5 Comments View comments in rows Update by email about comments talkback POST Comments Your name Please insert your name Content Your comment Thanks You comment was recieved and soon will be published.

Following its success with the 950 SSD, which uses PCIe Gen 3 x4 technology in an M.2 form factor, Samsung has just announced a new line - the 960 series. The new 960 SSDs comes in two flavours - for mainstream home use there's the 960 EVO, and for enterprise and enthusiast use Samsung has its new 960 PRO. Both well exceed the speeds of the current gen of NVMe SSDs, of which there are but three - Intel's 750, Samsung's 950, and the new RD 400 from OCZ. Each of those products deliver nearly identical speeds - in the order of 2200MB/s read and about 1600MB/s write. The new drives from Samsung exceed that by making better use of available bandwidth. They still use four PCIe lanes, so we were a little surprised to learn that there was headroom there, which Samsung is exploiting. READ NEXT: One Minute Review: Seagate Innov8 Samsung claims that the 960 PRO will deliver peak sequential read speeds of 3500MB/s and read speeds of 2100MB/s. That's a huge gain over the current gen of NVMe drives. The 960 PRO series is also optimised for durability and a longer lifetime, in line with its SATA Pro series design. The 960 PRO will ship in capacities of 512GB, 1TB and 2TB. The more consumer-focussed 960 EVO delivers up to 3200MB/s read and 1900 write speeds, which is also a nice jump over the 950 series and its ilk. Capacities will be 250GB, 500GB and 1TB. The 960 EVO carries a three-year warranty and the 960 PRO has a five-year warranty. Both products will ship exclusively as M.2 devices, and we're told a PCIe card version won't be available, nor a U.2 interface version. Australian pricing has not yet been announced.
