With the device’s speculated release date fast approaching, leaks and rumors about the powerhouse hybrid are trickling in at a steady pace. While Microsoft is yet to confirm any of these speculations, the nature of these rumors is quite encouraging for avid fans of the device. Here then are three new compelling rumors that have recently emerged about the upcoming Surface Pro 5. An AMD Ryzen 7 Variant Since the Surface Pro 5 began doing its rounds in the rumor mill, speculations were already high that the upcoming hybrid device would feature Intel’s 7th-generation processors, the powerful Kaby Lake series. These processors are the best that Intel currently has to offer, and because Surface Pro devices have long used the chipmaker’s processors, speculations of a Kaby Lake-equipped Surface Pro 5 appear to be quite solid. Recently, however, rumors emerged that the Surface Pro 5 might feature another variant that does not utilize Intel’s latest-generation processors, according to a PC Advisor report. These speculations came as a result of the recent trailer for the upcoming sci-fi thriller film, Alien: Covenant, where characters in the movie’s teaser were shown using a very familiar-looking tablet device. @AlienMoviesUK Walter trailer showing the @Microsoft #SurfacePro5 uses an @AMD processor since they sponsor it? https://t.co/eyOLQh5xSx pic.twitter.com/0yPuZXIMHM — Robo Lobster (@RoboLobster) March 11, 2017 During the brief teaser for the movie (which could be viewed at the end of this article), a couple of scientists were featured using a device that looks very similar to the Surface Pro series. What was interesting, however, was the fact that the film itself was sponsored by Intel’s arch-rival, AMD. The official Alien: Covenant trailer, which has been uploaded and viewed over 2 million times on YouTube, even includes the phrase “Intelligence powered by AMD, Ryzen and Radeon” in its description. Of course, the links between the upcoming movie’s recent trailer and the upcoming hybrid device remain pretty slim. Considering the reviews that AMD’s Ryzen chips, mainly the Ryzen 7 1800X, have been getting from critics and users so far, however, there is a pretty good chance that the Redmond-based tech giant is considering AMD as a possible partner for the Surface Pro 5. Since the processors’ release, the AMD Ryzen 7 series has been showered with acclaim, with many stating that the chips were comparable in every way to Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. Rumors of a multi-variant Surface Pro 5 release have been around for some time. Over the course of the last few months, speculations were high that apart from the Kaby Lake variants of the device, Microsoft would also be unveiling an ARM-based LTE version of the Surface Pro 5. Thus, while the links between the Surface Pro 5 and AMD’s Ryzen chips are pretty flimsy at this point, the idea of an AMD-totting SP5 is completely plausible. Surface Pro 5 ! pic.twitter.com/hiiL7ph0aQ — FlashFly46 (@FlashFly46) March 3, 2017 USB-C Port Apart from the possible partnership with AMD for the Surface Pro 5, rumors are also high that Microsoft might finally begin adopting USB Type-C in the upcoming device. USB-C is quickly emerging as a powerful trend in the portable tech market, with firms such as Apple fully embracing the robust port for its notebooks such as the MacBook Pro 2016 and the 12-inch MacBook. Considering the advantages that the addition of USB-C could give to the hybrid device, there is a pretty good chance that the Surface Pro 5 might debut with the port as its primary connector as well. Unlike Apple, however, rumors are high that Microsoft would still keep the legacy ports that were present in the Surface Pro 4. Thus, while the Surface Pro 5 might ship with a USB-C port, there is a good chance that the device’s standard USB 3.0 and display ports would still be featured on the upcoming device. March 2017 Announcement The official release date for the Surface Pro 5 remains unknown at this point, though speculations are high that Microsoft would be announcing the powerful hybrid together with the next big update for Windows 10, the highly anticipated Creators Update. Considering that the W10 update is due for a Spring 2017 release, speculations are high that the Surface Pro 5 is due for a March 2017 announcement. As for the device’s availability, rumors are abounding that the Surface Pro 5 would be available sometime around April 2017, if a March 2017 reveal does happen. Of course, these are but speculations at this point, so do take these with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, fans of the hybrid device could be sure of one thing — the Surface Pro 5 is definitely coming, and it is only a matter of time before the highly anticipated hybrid device gets an official release.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD announces, details its new Ryzen 5 mainstream CPU family AMD announces, details its new Ryzen 5 mainstream CPU family By Joel Hruska on March 15, 2017 at 10:00 pm Comment Ryzen 7’s debut just under three weeks ago clearly kicked off an upgrade cycle for AMD fans and potentially some Intel converts — in the three weeks we’ve been watching, the Ryzen 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 have all maintained spots in the Top 20, and typically the Top 15. With 6-7 CPUs in the Top 20 compared with 2-3 prior to the launch of Ryzen, AMD is clearly better positioned (and earning at least somewhat more money, thanks to higher CPU prices). Still, the cheapest Ryzen 7 CPU clocks in at $329, and that’s not exactly affordable. Today, AMD is announcing its new Ryzen 5 CPU family. While the naming evokes the Core i5, the products themselves do not. First up, we’ve got a pair of six-core chips; the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1600. Both of them have SMT enabled, but the 1600X has a 3.6GHz base clock and a 4GHz Boost, while the 1600 has a 3.2GHz base clock and a 3.6GHz boost. Drop down the stack again, and we’ve got the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. Both CPUs offer quad-cores and eight threads, with clock speeds of 3.5GHz – 3.7GHz and 3.2GHz-3.4GHz respectively. While this is a touch lower than some of Intel’s Core i5s, the addition of SMT should more than compensate for lower clocks in multi-threaded workloads. I don’t plan to spend much time talking about chipsets, but I wanted to give an updated version of the image that’s been floating around for awhile. The X370 and B350 are the obvious enthusiast platforms, with the X300 available for SFF options. Of course, none of this means much if the prices aren’t good. Check this out. AMD isn’t done putting a world of hurt on Intel’s high-end product stack. We’ve put together a chart below to show how AMD’s new Ryzen 5 stacks up against Intel’s lineup, but we have to note that it’s not a perfect match. There are two sets of chips you can conceivably stack up against the quad-core Ryzen 5’s — the Core i7 family, which has four cores, eight threads, and is vastly more expensive, or the Core i5, which has quad-cores, no SMT, and is more competitive within the same price band. We decided to show two comparison points for the 1500X, but stayed with an i5 comparator with the Ryzen 5 1400. If you’re eyeing a $169 chip, stepping up to a CPU that costs twice as much probably isn’t something you’re very interested in doing (and there aren’t enough desktop chips in the Kaby Lake Core i7 family to give us much to compare with anyway). If you thought AMD was going to confine itself to gunning for Intel’s top-end Broadwell-E chips, think again. The six-core Ryzen 5’s are priced at 40% and 50% of their Intel equivalents, respectively. The quad-core chips are a bit of a mix. If you compare Ryzen 5 1500X against the Core i7-7700, the 1500X is definitely cheaper, but won’t match an i7-7700’s performance (the 7700K is more expensive, but also clocks higher). If you compare Ryzen 5 1500X against a Core i5, the cost difference is marginal, meaning this comes down to a pure performance fight. With eight threads vs. four, Ryzen should win that struggle, but we’re not going to call the situation either way until we have silicon in-hand. The Ryzen 5 1400 is in a similar position. It’s somewhat cheaper than the i5, but we’ll need to see performance before we render a verdict. But based on this lineup, AMD has a potent set of products, particularly at the six-core level. Ryzen will only have been in-market for a month when AMD’s next quarterly conference call rolls around, but a lot of eyes will be watching to see how the company’s CPU & GPU revenue looks. So far, it seems like they’ve got something to look forward to.

WIRE Intel Buys Self-Driving Car Tech Company Mobileye for $15 Billion The Israeli-based company is the latest in the self-driving sector to score a big-money deal. By Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at just over $14 billion, the latest push by a major tech company to advance autonomous vehicles that could change the way traffic moves globally. Mobileye develops technology that essentially gives computers a sense of their physical surroundings and it has also been busying creating ties to get that technology onto the road. Last year, it teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop the building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Also in 2016, ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. BMW, Intel and Mobileye also have a partnership, and Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne. In the latest deal, announced early Monday, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The companies put the equity value of the deal at approximately $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel's autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel and led by Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua. The organization will support both companies' existing production programs and build on relationships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, Tier-1 suppliers and semiconductor partners to develop advanced driving assist, highly autonomous and fully autonomous driving programs. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a company release that by working together, the companies will be able to "accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers." The deal, approved by the boards of both companies, is targeted to close within nine months. Mobileye's stock jumped nearly 32 percent Monday before the opening bell. --The Associated Press Published on: Mar 13, 2017 Advertisement

Today is the official announcement for Ryzen 5, featuring four processors in hex-core and quad-core formats, all with Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) and all using the same AM4 platform as Ryzen 5. Ryzen 5 Whereas Ryzen 7 was AMD’s main attack on high-performance x86 and a shot across the bow against Intel’s high-end desktop platform, Ryzen 5 is targeted more at mainstream users. The goal here is that where Intel has four cores with no hyperthreading, AMD can provide six cores with SMT, effectively offering three times as many threads for the same price and potentially smashing any multithreaded workload. Without further ado, here is where the Ryzen families stand: AMD Ryzen 7 SKUs   Cores/ Threads Base/ Turbo XFR L3 TDP Cost Cooler Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 3.6/4.0 +100 16 MB 95 W $499 - Ryzen 7 1700X 8/16 3.4/3.8 +100 16 MB 95 W $399 - Ryzen 7 1700 8/16 3.0/3.7 +50 16 MB 65 W $329 Spire RGB AMD Ryzen 5 SKUs   Cores/ Threads Base/ Turbo XFR L3 TDP Cost Cooler Ryzen 5 1600X 6/12 3.6/4.0 +100 16 MB 95 W $249 - Ryzen 5 1600 6/12 3.2/3.6 +100 16 MB 65 W $219 Spire Ryzen 5 1500X 4/8 3.5/3.7 +200 16 MB 65 W $189 Spire Ryzen 5 1400 4/8 3.2/3.4 +50 8 MB 65 W $169 Stealth Traditionally we are used to a part with fewer cores having a higher clock frequency, however perhaps due to the voltage scaling of the design, we see a matched Ryzen 5 1600X in frequency to the Ryzen 7 1800X, but the rest of the Ryzen 5 family are offered at a lower TDP instead. All the Ryzen 5 parts are unlocked, similar to the Ryzen 7 parts, and all four exhibit some movement in XFR mode, with the 1500X offering +200 MHz depending on the cooler used. AMD is going to offer some of these SKUs with their redesigned Wraith coolers: It is worth noting that the Wraith Spire for Ryzen 5 will not have RGB lighting, whereas the Wraith Spire for Ryzen 7 does use an RGB ring. OEMs will be able to use the higher-end Wraith Max stock cooler for their pre-built systems. AMD stated that at present, there are no plans to bring the Wraith coolers to retail as individual units, however they will keep track of how many users want them as individual items and regularly approach the issue internally. To clarify some initial confusion, AMD has given me official TDP support numbers for the coolers. The entry level Wraith Stealth is 65W, the Wraith Spire is 65W for high-ambient conditions (AMD states this might be considered an '80W' design in low-ambient), and the Wraith Max is 95W for OEM builds using Ryzen 7 95W parts. All the Ryzen 5 parts will support DDR4 ECC and non-ECC memory, and the memory support is the same as Ryzen 7, and will depend on how many modules and the types of modules being used. Recently companies like ADATA announced official support for AM4, as some users have found that there were memory growing pains when Ryzen 7 was launched. Platform support for Ryzen 5, relating to PCIe lanes and chipset configurations, is identical to Ryzen 7. Each CPU offers sixteen PCIe 3.0 lanes for graphics, along with four lanes for a chipset and four lanes for storage. Chipsets can then offer up to eight PCIe 2.0 lanes which can be bifurcated up to x4 (AMD GPUs can use chipset lanes for graphics as well, however at reduced bandwidth and additional latency). Competition The high-end Ryzen 5 1600X, at $249, is a shoe-in to compete against Intel’s i5-7600K at $242. Intel’s CPU is based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, and we’ve already shown in the Ryzen 7 review that by comparison Ryzen is more circa Broadwell, which is two generations behind. AMD won’t win much when it comes to single-threaded tests here, but the multi-threaded situation is where AMD shines. Comparison: Ryzen 5 1600X vs Core i5-7600K AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Features Intel Core i5-7600K 6 / 12 Cores/Threads 4 / 4 3.6 / 4.0 GHz Base/Turbo 3.8 / 4.2 GHz 16 PCIe 3.0 Lanes 16 16 MB L3 Cache 6 MB 95 W TDP 91 W $249 Price (MSRP) $242 Here we have twelve threads against four, at a 95W TDP compared to a 91W TDP (the 1600 is 65W, which looks better on paper). It is expected that for situations where a compute workload can scale across cores and threads that the AMD chip will wipe the floor with the competition. For more generic office workloads, it will interesting to see where the marks fall. On the quad-core parts, there are several competitive points to choose from. The AMD Ryzen 5 1500X, at $189, sits near Intel’s Core i5-7500 at $192. This would be a shootout of a base quad-core versus a quad-core with hyperthreading. Comparison: Ryzen 5 1500X vs Core i5-7500 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Features Intel Core i5-7500 4 / 8 Cores/Threads 4 / 4 3.5 / 3.7 GHz Base/Turbo 3.4 / 3.8 GHz 16 PCIe 3.0 Lanes 16 16 MB L3 Cache 6 MB 65 W TDP 65 W $189 Price (MSRP) $182 The reason why I didn’t pull out the Core i3-7350K there, at $168, is because the performance of the 7350K sits near the Pentium G4560, which is only $64 (and the subject of an upcoming review). That all being said, the $168 price of the i3-7350K matches up to the $169 price of the Ryzen 5 1400, although the 1400 has double the cores and double the threads of the 7350K. Cutting up the Cores Ryzen 5, both the hex-core and the quad-core variants, will use the same eight-core base Zeppelin silicon that Ryzen 7 does. The silicon design consists of two core complexes (CCX) of four cores apiece, and each with 8MB of L3 cache that is an exclusive victim cache. One of the suggestions regarding Ryzen 7’s performance was about thread migration and scheduling on the core design, especially as core-to-core latency varies depending on where the cores are located (and there’s a jump between CCXes). Despite the use of AMD’s new Infinity Fabric, which is ultimately a superset of HyperTransport, there is still a slightly longer delay jumping over that CCX boundary, although the default Windows scheduler knows how to manage that boundary as demonstrated by Allyn at PCPerspective earlier this week. So when dealing with a four-core or six-core CPU, and the base core design has eight-cores, how does AMD cut them up? It is possible for AMD to offer a 4+0, 3+1 or 2+2 design for its quad-core parts, or 4+2 and 3+3 variants for its hexacore parts, similar to the way that Intel cuts up its integrated graphics for GT1 variants. The downside with this way is that performance might differ between the variants, making it difficult to manage. The upside is that more CPUs with defects can be used. We have confirmation from AMD that there are no silly games going to be played with Ryzen 5. The six-core parts will be a strict 3+3 combination, while the four-core parts will use 2+2. This will be true across all CPUs, ensuring a consistent performance throughout. Performance Estimates We won’t have these CPUs in for a while, but given our new benchmark suite and the results we’ve seen so far with Ryzen, we’ve tried to lay out some estimates in performance in both single thread and multi-threaded workloads. Single thread performance is easy enough to estimate – we work from the turbo and XFR frequencies of each processor. For users looking for peak single thread performance, something like Intel’s Pentium G3258 or i3-7350K that can be overclocked to 5GHz+ (or starts as a base 4.2 GHz) is going to be a performance per dollar crown here. On the AMD side, we expect the Ryzen 5 1600X to match the Ryzen 7 1700X as it has the same frequency. Multithreaded is more difficult to predict. Some of our benchmarks offer perfect scaling across cores and threads, meaning that if you half the cores, you get half the score. Some of the benchmarks are not as clear cut though, hence why we see something like Intel’s Core i3-7350K, which should get about half the score of an i7-7700K, scoring 65% instead of 50%. We’ve tried to take this into account with the Ryzen 5 parts, and we get the graph above. The key results here show that the 1600 and 1600X should sit way above the i5-7600K, and the 1600X should offer so much better performance per dollar than the Core i7-7700K. On overall performance, taking the combination of results (our suite is slightly unbalanced in favor of MT, but this is taken into consideration) we funnily see a straight line between the 1800X, 1700X, 1700, 1600 and 1500X, putting the 1600X at a really good position as a performance per dollar CPU. The caveat here is that the Ryzen 7 processors came across as good workstation processors. Ryzen 7 was marketed towards that group of users, and it made sense. Ryzen 5 is more targeted towards mainstream gamers and users, which might offer some interesting results. Our results don’t feature any gaming numbers yet (still working on a Ryzen 7 part 2 for this), but it will be interesting to see how the core counts and frequency will affect gaming performance. The Bottom Line Ryzen 5. Two CPUs with six-core, from $219-$249. Two CPUs with four-core. From $169-$189. Retail availability on April 11th. Stay tuned for the AnandTech review.

POST A COMMENT 122 Comments View All Comments prisonerX - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Hmmm, AMD gives gamers 50% more cores for their expensive chunk of silicon, while with Intel you get... integrated graphics. But gamers are generally so stupid they'll keep buying Intel, becuase it's got 5% better single thread performance. Reply Makaveli - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Gamers generally use Dedicated GPU's not integrated graphics. When was the last time you heard someone bragging about a igpu?? Secondly if you use highend GPU's at low resolutions (1080p) for possibly higher Hz monitor. You have to go Intel right now. At 1440 and greater where you have to worry less about cpu bottlenecks you are good with ryzen. And lastly most games are gpu bound not cpu that's where you are best spending your money. Reply prisonerX - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link I know, that's what makes gamer's continued love of i7's so puzzling. If you look at the die of a Core i7-7700K for instance, the IGP takes up more space that the processing cores! So Intel could have given people twice the cores for the same cost in terms of silicon, which is the determining factor. Now, I understand that the i7 gave better performance, but now with AMD delivering more cores that are competitive, revealing how Intel has treated them like rubes, gamers still vilify AMD and back Intel. It's puzzling. Reply Kaggy - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Well most gamers need really large ATX cases, blinking lights on mouse and keyboard. And every component has a "gaming" attached to it. So generally gamers do not look at logic much if they belong to that class of users. Reply Drumsticks - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link That's a mighty high horse you've got there purely for disagreeing with somebody's aesthetic choices. Do you sniff at people's Non-Black vehicles or painted walls, too? Reply prisonerX - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Don't worry, no-one's trying to take away your blinken lights. Reply RMSe17 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link A lot of gamers are like me, and simply care about best FPS and shortest load times. I will buy whichever CPU/GPU/SSD delivers that, within a reasonable budget. Hating a company is in this case illogical. Reply beginner99 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I don't think it's puzzling at all especially given reviewers mostly do stupid benches. There are few games that actually benefit from 6 or 8 slow cores over 4 fast ones and that mostly only applies to multi-player like BF1 which hardly ever is benched. So the 7700k especially OCed still comes clearly out at the top. And as has been said for high refresh rate gaming a fast CPU is a must as it must pump out 120+ frames per second. Besides that the launch issues with Ryzen and the fact it is underperforming in gaming compared to other benches will make people hesitant to buy. push them towards the known factor, eg 7700k. Reply AS118 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I agree. I'm an AMD fan that'll probably get an R5 1600x, but everything you say about the 7700k is true. If I had a 144fps monitor and played at 1080p, I'd probably get a 7700k. I don't get why some people knock Intel's i7's unnecessarily. They have a use, and it's not stupid to get them over a Ryzen prodcut. Reply niva - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link If the usage is just for games it may be exactly stupid to get Itel over the new AMD product. As mentioned there should be issues expected at launch. Fact is that the issues identified so far are nothing major is pretty damn impressive. Look at performance per dollar, it appears that the AMD chips aren't even being harnessed properly yet, games and heck maybe even the windows kernel/scheduler may need some optimizing, yet its competitive. When you factor in the cost of the AMD chips I'm pretty damn impressed. Given this, the long term potential of the AMD chips simply beats the old Intel chips. Now, if you're using the system for things other than gaming, the Intel chip may have other intangible "benefits" attributed to it, such as stability. Those are going to be very difficult to understand until much more data is available a few months/years down the road.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / AMD Ryzen 5 Inbound: 6C12T and 4C8T CPUs Launch April 11th AMD Ryzen 5 Inbound: 6C12T and 4C8T CPUs Launch April 11th Luke Hill 23 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News AMD has announced its Ryzen 5 processors which will be launched and on shelves from April 11th 2017 in the form of two 4C8T parts and two 6C12T SKUs. Pricing will range from $169 to $249 USD, with the Ryzen 5 flagship 6C12T 1600X featuring a Precision Boost clock frequency up to 4.0GHz. After the disruption that Ryzen 7 has caused to the high-end prosumer market, taking on Intel’s vastly more expensive HEDT LGA 2011-3 processors, AMD is aiming to lay its stamp in the more popular sub-$300 segment. According to the Austin-based chip vendor, twice as many people choose CPUs at a sub-$300 price point than at higher levels. Simply put, AMD is trying to disrupt the sub-$300 processor landscape by putting 4C8T parts up against higher-clocked 2C4T Core i3 SKUs and 6C12T offerings against Intel’s 4C4T Core i5 range. In addition to Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), Ryzen 5 CPUs still have AMD’s SenseMI goodies baked in. That gives the chips access to features such as Precision Boost and Extended Frequency Range (XFR) that allow increased clock speeds under the relevant usage scenarios. Unsurprisingly, the processors also use the same AM4 platform as higher-end Ryzen 7 parts, making them compatible with the current crop of X370, B350, and A320 chipset motherboards, in addition to X300 and A300 offerings when they arrive. AMD is expecting Ryzen 5 chips to be paired with the more value-orientated B350 motherboards that still support overclocking, allowing Ryzen 5’s unlocked CPU frequency multiplier to be put to good use. Of course, there’s also no reason why the chips cannot be paired with a high-end X370 motherboard with a strong power delivery solution for enhanced overclocking.

Ryzen 5 1600X is the only 95W TDP part in the current Ryzen 5 line-up. This is a factor of its clock speeds which are as high as the flagship 8C16T Ryzen 7 1800X at 3.6GHz Base, 4.0GHz Boost, and probably 4.1GHz XFR (yet to be confirmed by AMD). The pair of 6C12T Ryzen 5 SKUs look to sandwich Intel’s 4C4T Core i5-7600K in terms of pricing. Ryzen 5 1500X is interesting as AMD confirmed in its briefing that the part will feature 200MHz of XFR headroom rather than the typical 100MHz for X-suffix SKUs. We asked AMD how the Ryzen 5 6C12T parts will be deployed from a design standpoint but we are yet to receive a reply. The six-core design will require two CPU Complexes (CCX) but AMD looks to have the option to disable one core per CCX or two cores on a single CCX. This choice may relate to yield of the four-core CCX modules or perhaps distribution of thermal energy within the die. Ryzen 5 six-core parts will have full access to the 8MB shared pool of L3 cache on each CCX, though the two disabled/removed cores will take their 512KB of L2 cache with them. This information is yet to be confirmed by AMD. Update 16/03/2017: AMD has confirmed to us that the Ryzen 5 six-core processors will be a 3+3 design both with the full total of 16MB L3 cache and 512KB L2 Cache per core (3MB in total). Depending on how the six-core chip is enabled, we may see a journey back to the old days for AMD users where there is an ability to unlock the disabled cores through the motherboard BIOS. That was a lot of fun for Phenom II users who could turn a dual- or tri-core into a full-fat quad. The 4C8T Ryzen 5 1500X and 1400 are likely to use a single CCX without the need for data transfer across the Infinity Fabric. This could aid performance, perhaps in gaming, where the latency penalty incurred by inter-CCX communications may be having a negative influence on performance. The four-core parts are likely to be equipped with 8MB of shared L3 cache and 512KB of L2 cache dedicated to each of the four cores. Update 16/03/2017: AMD has confirmed to us that the Ryzen 5 four-core processors will be a 2+2 design using a pair of CCX. Ryzen 5 1500X gets the full total of 16MB L3 cache (!) and 512KB L2 Cache per core (2MB in total). Whereas Ryzen 5 1400 gets 8MB of L3 cache and 512KB of L2 Cache per core (2MB in total). The dual CCX design will still rely upon Infinity Fabric for inter-CCX communications and data transfer. AMD will be bundling Wraith CPU coolers with the three 65W TDP Ryzen 5 parts. Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X get the same Wraith Spire that is bundled with the Ryzen 7 1700, though it does not feature the LED lighting of the Ryzen 7 version. We tested Wraith Spire with the Ryzen 7 1700 and found it to offer solid performance with capability for a moderate overclock. Wraith Stealth will be bundled with the Ryzen 5 1400 CPU. Ryzen 5 processors will launch and be available to buy on April 11th 2017. AMD also confirmed that Ryzen 3 is scheduled for the second half of 2017. KitGuru Says: Ryzen 5 is AMD’s weapon to shake up the sub-$300 processor market. With pricing that puts Ryzen 5 in competition with Core i3 and Core i5 CPUs, it will be interesting to see the performance on offer.

Add A Comment Pipeline statistics queries is the latest Vulkan capability being added to the Intel "ANV" Mesa Vulkan driver. Pipeline statistics queries allow applications to query a set of Vulkan pipeline counters. Developers interested in learning more about the feature can see the Vulkan documentation. Intel developer Jason Ekstrand sent out a set of 12 patches today, including an earlier patch by Ilia Mirkin for pipelineStatisticsQuery, for adding the necessary functionality to Intel ANV. The patches for review can be found on Mesa-dev. A benefit of the patches is that some bug fixes in them do fix rendering corruption for Intel with The Talos Principle. Besides pipeline statistics queries, other features ANV still has yet to implement in Mesa Git for device features are multi-draw indirect, depth bounds, shadow storage image multi-sample, shader storage image read without format, int16 shader support, shader resource min lod, variable multi-sample rate, and inherited queries.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 15, 2017 at 7:42PM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are two of the largest, most dominant semiconductor companies in the world. Interestingly, shares of both have dramatically underperformed their benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite, over the last five years for various reasons that we'll explore below. INTC data by YCharts. What's gone wrong at these long-vaunted chipmakers, and should investors consider purchasing either stock today? In this article, I'll examine Intel and Qualcomm through three different lenses in order to determine which company's shares look like the better buy today. Let's dive right in. Financial fortitude Two financial titans indeed, Intel and Qualcomm simply ooze balance-sheet strength. Take a look at these four important measures of solvency and liquidity to better help frame our discussion. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Qualcomm  $29.8 billion $11.7 billion $6.0 billion 1.9 Intel $14.9 billion $25.2 billion $21.8 billion 1.7 Data sources: Yahoo! Finance.  As you can see in either case, life isn't bad as the owner of a dominant semiconductor franchise (more on that below). Qualcomm enjoys far more net cash than Intel, but that's likely because Qualcomm doesn't operate its own chip fabrication facilities. Intel's unique manufacturing strategy requires more capital -- resulting in higher net debt than Qualcomm -- but it also throws off ample cash. At the end of the day, you can split hairs, but the more important, high-level takeaway should be that Qualcomm and Intel are two of the best-capitalized companies in the semiconductor industry. Winner: Tie. Image source: Getty Images. Durable competitive advantages Under normal circumstances, Intel and Qualcomm have two of the most dominant business franchises anywhere in tech. Qualcomm is the largest producer of mobile chips as of the first half of 2016 -- the most recent credible research available -- according to Strategy Analytics. Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile application processors claimed a 39% market share of the massive global market, comprised mostly of smartphones and tablets. And despite strong gains from emerging threats like MediaTek, Qualcomm also still controlled an estimated 50% of the global baseband chip market during the same period. Better still, the company is in the process of purchasing NXP Semiconductor to push deeper into the Internet of Things trend. Though Qualcomm's chip business produces the majority of its sales, its high-margin patent licensing business has historically contributed about two-thirds of the company's pre-tax profits. While an incredible asset historically, Qualcomm is being sued by the government of South Korea, the European Union, and its own customer Apple over alleged abuses in its patent-licensing practices. This follows a previous international lawsuit with the Chinese government that ended with Qualcomm paying a $975 million fine to Chinese regulators and agreeing to less onerous licensing terms with Chinese handset makers. If precedent is any indication -- and it is, generally, in legal matters -- Qualcomm's profit center is in serious trouble. The company plans to fight such charges, and it isn't clear what this specifically could mean for Qualcomm's business model. The company's stock has been hammered over fears relating to its legal headaches, which are the dominant narrative driving Qualcomm's investment thesis today. Turning to Intel, its microprocessors serve as the de facto standard to the PC and server industries. Even as a resurgent Advanced Micro Devices -- the longtime second fiddle to Intel in PC and servers -- attempts to steal market from the company, I remain skeptical that AMD can permanently close the gap between itself and Intel. Though the PC market and server space are fairly mature at this point, Intel's structural advantages still should allow it to maintain a strong competitive position well into the future. Intel's massive research and development budget, its in-house chipmaking facilities, and its longtime performance advantages over the competition form something of a virtuous cycle that allows Intel to traditionally remain one step ahead of the competition in terms of its chips' performance. Yes, Intel made a mistake by not switching to a 10nm manufacturing process sooner, which allowed AMD to temporarily close the performance gap between the two. However, I still believe that Intel's long history of out-innovating AMD happens for predictable reasons that should continue into the future. Winner: Intel. Valuation Turning to our analysis of Qualcomm's and Intel's valuations, let's frame our discussion with a few metrics. Here's how three of the most commonly used valuation ratios break down between the two chipmakers. Company P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Qualcomm  17.2  11.8 9.9 Intel 16.9  12.3 7.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Oddly, there isn't a lot of variation between the two. Both companies trade at substantial discounts to the broad market indices -- the S&P 500 currently trades at about 26 times earnings, a significant premium to its long-term averages. However, as we learned in the earlier section, both Intel and Qualcomm should be relatively cheap due to the growth issues affecting each company. They're cheap for a reason, and that's the important thing to keep in mind. In terms of reconciling their valuations with their growth outlooks, I don't love either company. However, if I had to choose a winner here, I'd pick Intel. Granted, I'm no Intel booster, but the legal blitzkrieg facing Qualcomm threatens to potentially undermine the economics of its entire business model. That's a big risk to stomach at 17 times earnings, so I'll reluctantly pick Intel as the winner here, though with some trepidation. Winner: Intel. And the winner is... Intel Don't queue the celebration just yet. Intel's victory here is more an indictment on the precarious state of Qualcomm's business. Indeed, Intel is making some smart bets on areas where it can potentially find some growth -- the Internet of Things, in particular -- but its relative stability is what won it this victory. Intel is cheap, profitable, and should return plenty of capital to shareholders. However, I'm not necessarily sold on its growth prospects. Qualcomm's legal headaches could be proven uniformly incorrect in due time, but they could also seriously undermine its patent licensing profit center. Between the two, I'll take Intel any day, mostly out of risk-aversion. Andrew Tonner owns shares of AAPL. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends AAPL and QCOM.

He provided no specific date for the briefing. FBI Director James Comey is on the Hill Wednesday to brief the chairman and ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee, Sens.

ADVERTISEMENT Graham and Whitehouse, who head the subcommittee that has oversight over the FBI, last week sent a letter to Comey and acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente, asking for any warrant application or court documents tied to potential legal wiretapping of the Trump campaign, Trump or Trump Tower. The resolution comes after Graham fired a warning shot to the FBI on Tuesday, telling reporters that the bureau was about to "screw up big time" if they didn't respond to his letter. Graham’s subcommittee is probing Russian influence in the presidential election. The bureau headed the investigation into the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is reportedly probing connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Both lawmakers argued Wednesday that the bureau should make the investigation public. “I just want to let the American people know that this subcommittee — we’re going to get an answer to whether or not the Trump campaign was surveilled. Was a warrant ever requested? Was it issued?” Graham said. “And I hope to be able to answer the question of is there an active investigation.” "It is now not only appropriate but incumbent upon law enforcement to say, 'We are looking at this. We intend to get to the bottom of this,' " Whitehouse said. The president earlier this month claimed that former President Obama had ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the campaign. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump tweeted. In addition to Graham's subcommittee, the Senate and House Intelligence committees are also probing Moscow's meddling in the White House race and any potential contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.

A Credit Suisse analyst has cut his rating on Intel’s stock due to concerns about a lack of insight into the company’s return-on-investment plans. / AFP PHOTO / KIMIHIRO HOSHINOKIMIHIRO HOSHINO/AFP/Getty Images By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 15, 2017 at 2:58 pm | UPDATED: March 15, 2017 at 2:59 pm Top of the Order:   Looking Inside Intel: Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor company, made a splash at the start of the week when it said it would pay $15.3 billion to acquire self-driving car technology company Mobileye. And now that Wall Street has had time to ponder that announcement, just what does it think about Intel? Well, for Credit Suisse’s John Pitzer, the feeling is … neutral. That’s not just a figure of speech. Pitzer cut his rating on Intel’s stock to neutral from outperform, which is analyst-speak for “buy,” calling it “a better company than stock.” Related Articles Biz Break: Russia denies involvement in Yahoo’s big hacking case Biz Break: Facebook, Twitter others could face huge fines in Germany for not deleting defamatory posts Biz Break: Google, Microsoft are said to be still waiting to hear from Wikileaks Biz Break: Finisar finds few friends after financial forecast flop Tesla’s newest solar project coming to Kauai So, why the disconnect? It doesn’t have to do with Mobileye. “We are one of the few (analyst teams) that actually like the Mobileye transaction,” Pitzer said, in a research note. “While it is still too early to pick the winners (in self-driving cars), the depth and breadth of resources and IP (intellectual property) that an Intel-Mobileye combination represents surely places them in the pole position.” What it does have to do with is what Pitzer sees as Intel’s lack of more details about its investment plans. Pitzer said he thinks Intel’s share price is likely to remain between $33 and just under $40. He cut his target price on Intel’s stock to $35 a share from $45. “(Intel) management needs to understand that without providing near-term milestones, either technical or financial, and without providing us with a long-term view of (return-on-investment) targets, they are making it increasingly more difficult to ease what should be an inherent tension between an investor’s time horizon and a company’s,” Pitzer said. The Mobileye deal may end up paying off for Intel. And in Pitzer’s view, Intel’s investors might have to wait a while for their own payoff, too. Middle Innings: Who Hacked Yahoo? Well, according the U.S. government, it was the Russians. A grand jury in the Northern District of California has indicted four Russians, including two men who are members of Russia’s FSB, on charges of illegally hacking into Yahoo’s network in 2014. That hack affected more than 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB is Russia’s successor agency to the old KGB of the Soviet Union. In other words, two of the men charged with hacking into Yahoo email accounts are spies. And Speaking Of Hacks: Some prominent Twitter accounts were hacked Wednesday morning. The accounts of Duke University, Justin Bieber, Starbucks and others began tweeting out a message in Turkish that included Nazi hashtags and swastikas, and a message that translated into, “See you on April 16.” On that day, Turkey is scheduled to hold a referendum that, if it passes, would increase Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s power. Twitter said it had addressed the hacking and restored the affected accounts. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Wednesday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from NeoPhotonics, Oclaro, QuinStreet, Inphi and Impax Laboratories. In the Red: Decliners included Twitter, Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices, Synopsys and Barracuda Networks. The major stock-market gauges all rose Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.7 percent to 5,900.05. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 percent to end the day at 20,950.10. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed by 0.8 percent to 2,385.26. Quote of the Day: “I think they believe in me.” — Rippling Chief Executive Parker Conrad, speaking about those who have invested in his payroll-technology startup. You might remember Conrad as the founder and CEO of Zenefits. Conrad was forced out of Zenefits last year following a scandal in which he was determined to be behind a scam that let insurance brokers fake the requirements for completing an online training course to become licensed insurance agents in California.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 15, 2017 2:30 PM PT Credit: Tag Heuer More like this Why Intel put a smartphone chip in Tag Heuer's $1,600 smartwatch Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Intel doesn't want Curie wearable computer making fashion statements Video Choosing technologies to drive digital transformation Every year, Intel is present at Fashion Week in New York, showing off how technology will change fashion. It's an odd match, but the depth of technologies shown by Intel has changed every year. In previous years, Intel showed off cool bracelets, smart clothes, and an odd robotic spider dress by Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht. Intel's 2017 showcase was a lot different and more practical, sprinkling in retail technologies with otherworldly wearables. That move to the practical, in a nutshell, describes Intel's tryst with its wearables unit -- from starting as a lab for cool devices to becoming a bootstrapped group focused on practical products amid the company's efforts to reduce wasted spending. Intel believes the best wearable products are yet to come, and it wants to change the way we interact with computing devices, share information, and even entertain ourselves. Intel is pursuing chips like Curie for wearables; it will be smaller and faster than existing chips, and help make sleeker wearables, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. "We have to run just like any other responsible business effort that Intel has," Bautista said. The wearables group started off under the New Devices Group, established in 2013. Intel subsequently acquired companies like Basis to boost its wearables offerings but the unit didn't turn a profit. Amid restructuring, reports emerged last year that Intel had quit wearables. But the effort is still alive and more focused on delivering products that complement Intel's broader focus in areas like servers and the internet of things. Wearables are a pretty small operation at Intel, and it'll keep operating under the radar, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. There are huge untapped markets in wearables, especially in vertical areas like health care. It's hard to say when Intel will find a commercially successful product, but the company will continue developing products, Brookwood said. "It's like Google: You keep throwing things against a wall, something may stick," Brookwood said. Despite a more disciplined approach, the cool products and bright ideas keep coming. Every trade show, Intel dazzles audiences with wearable technologies based on its chips and software. Intel's stage shows have featured Oscar winner A.R. Rahman playing music out of smartwatch-like devices, small shirt buttons that can gather health data, and helmets that can make driving cars and riding bikes safer. Intel has also shown its Project Alloy headset, a mixed-reality headset where objects pop up as floating images in mid-air. It's much like Microsoft's HoloLens -- which also uses Intel chips -- but with faster hardware. Recently, two smartwatches from New Balance's RunIQ and TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 carried Intel software and hardware technologies. An Oakley Pace Radar headset, which runs on Intel software, provides fitness guidance when training. The company's approach to wearables is being replicated in other areas like the Intel Sports Group, which is developing technology so users can watch 3D sports broadcasts as if they were in the stadium. One way to achieve that is by putting more cameras across the field, including helmets worn by players. Using algorithms, Intel servers slice and dice the images from the cameras to provide the customized footage. This will translate well to wearables like VR headsets, as users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Chips like Curie are already instrumental in improving the sports viewing experience from events like last year's Winter X Games. In real time, viewers were able to view key athlete performance data like the height of a snowboarder jump and how far they rotated. The data was captured from the Curie chip and sensors on the snowboards. Data has become extremely valuable, and wearables can help gather more information, especially biometrics. Wearables are edge devices that collect data and feed them to into the large flow of data being sent to cloud servers for analysis, Intel's Bautista said. In some way, one could think of wearables as an extension to Intel's interest in IoT, and it is in some ways similar to other technologies like connected thermostats and consumer sensor devices, Bautista said. Intel cares about how the collected data is analyzed and presented to the user, Bautista said. Wearables will be key for health-care application development, and Insight 64 analyst Brookwood identified galvanized skin response as a big wearable opportunity that Intel could pursue. Wearables also fuel the development of software applications that can be used for analytics, Bautista said. For example, Intel is developing software tools that will bring artificial intelligence to smartwatches like the new Tag Heuer smartwatch with Android Wear 2.0.  Intel is taking an open architecture approach to IoT devices and wearables, and a device doesn't have to be tied to x86 chips. When planning the recently released smartwatches, Intel looked at the best chip and software that may fit into a device. Intel has packed the x86 Atom smartphone chips in the recent New Balance and TAG Heuer smartwatches, but it has put ARM processors into other wearables. It remains to be seen how long Intel plays in wearables, Brookwood said. The wearables market will take years to mature, so Intel has to remain in it for the long haul.  At the same time, Intel has failed in many of its consumer-facing efforts, especially in media and TV. If Intel technology doesn't power a hit wearable device in the coming years, the effort could be canned. The days of Intel splashing money at efforts that don't produce are gone, Brookwood said.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Mark WarnerMark WarnerDem senator: Trump at zero credibility after wiretap claims Overnight Cybersecurity: Trump standing by wiretapping claim | Cyber gets boost in Trump budget | Bad bots on the rise | McDonald's Twitter hack Senate Intel leaders were 'fully briefed' on wiretapping allegations: report MORE (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Senators were tightlipped leaving the meeting, offering no details on what, if any, answers they received from the FBI director.  "This briefing was all on sensitive matters and highly classified, and it's really not anything that we can answer any questions about," Feinstein told reporters, noting that she was speaking on behalf of herself and Grassley.  ADVERTISEMENT Feinstein further declined to comment on whether Comey confirmed the FBI is investigating a link between Trump officials and Russia, adding: "I'm sorry, but it's the way life is here."  When a reporter asked if they were "satisfied" with the answers they got, Grassley turned to Feinstein, asked if she was "ready to go" and the two headed toward the subway that connects the Capitol to the Senate office buildings.  "If you want to ask me some other time, but not in this environment right here," Grassley told the swarm of reporters and TV cameras. The closed-door meeting comes after Grassley warned he would block Rod Rosenstein's nomination to serve in the No. 2 role at the Department of Justice (DOJ) until he is briefed on Russia.  "I will not schedule a hearing on the Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein] until we get a briefing from Comey," Grassley told reporters, according to Talking Points Memo.  Asked if he was prepared to move forward with Rostenstein's nomination after Wednesday's briefings, Grassley appeared to signal that the No. 2 DOJ nominee is still in limbo — at least temporarily. "I won't answer that until I've gone over all the answers I got," he told reporters Wednesday. As chairman of the committee, Grassley can effectively hold up the nomination by refusing to schedule a committee vote.  Grassley and Feinstein requested a briefing last month on circumstances surrounding Michael Flynn's resignation as President Trump's national security adviser, as well as any call transcripts and the FBI's summary of the calls.  Feinstein credited Grassley's "tough language" in that letter for securing the face-to-face meeting with Comey. The House and Senate Intelligence committees are also investigating Russia's meddling in the presidential election and any ties between the Trump team and Russia.  Warner declined to comment on the Wednesday meeting with Comey, but said he expects the Senate Intelligence Committee to start announcing the next steps of its investigation soon.  "I think we'll have news soon on hearings and … when we're going to start to be interviewing witnesses," he told reporters, indicating an announcement could come in the next few days.  Comey is expected to testify in a public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee next week.  Tags Dianne Feinstein Chuck Grassley Mark Warner   View the discussion thread.

It's an odd match, but the depth of technologies shown by Intel has changed every year. In previous years, Intel showed off cool bracelets, smart clothes, and an odd robotic spider dress by Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht. Intel's 2017 showcase was a lot different and more practical, sprinkling in retail technologies with otherworldly wearables. That move to the practical, in a nutshell, describes Intel's tryst with its wearables unit -- from starting as a lab for cool devices to becoming a bootstrapped group focused on practical products amid the company's efforts to reduce wasted spending. Intel believes the best wearable products are yet to come, and it wants to change the way we interact with computing devices, share information, and even entertain ourselves. Intel is developing pursuing chips for wearables like Curie, which will be smaller and faster than the existing chip, and help make sleeker wearables, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. "We have to run just like any other responsible business effort that Intel has," Bautista said. The wearables group started off under the New Devices Group, established in 2013. Intel subsequently acquired companies like Basis to boost its wearables offerings but the unit didn't turn a profit. Amid restructuring, reports emerged last year that Intel had quit wearables. But the effort is still alive and more focused on delivering products that complement Intel's broader focus in areas like servers and the internet of things. Wearables are a pretty small operation at Intel, and it'll keep operating under the radar, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. There are huge untapped markets in wearables, especially in vertical areas like health care. It's hard to say when Intel will find a commercially successful product, but the company will continue developing products, Brookwood said. "It's like Google: You keep throwing things against a wall, something may stick," Brookwood said. Despite a more disciplined approach, the cool products and bright ideas keep coming. Every trade show, Intel dazzles audiences with wearable technologies based on its chips and software. Intel's stage shows have featured Oscar winner A.R. Rahman playing music out of smartwatch-like devices, small shirt buttons that can gather health data, and helmets that can make driving cars and riding bikes safer. Intel has also shown its Project Alloy headset, a mixed-reality headset where objects pop up as floating images in mid-air. It's much like Microsoft's HoloLens -- which also uses Intel chips -- but with faster hardware. Recently, two smartwatches from New Balance's RunIQ and TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 carried Intel software and hardware technologies. An Oakley Pace Radar headset, which runs on Intel software, provides fitness guidance when training. The company's approach to wearables is being replicated in other areas like the Intel Sports Group, which is developing technology so users can watch 3D sports broadcasts as if they were in the stadium. One way to achieve that is by putting more cameras across the field, including helmets worn by players. Using algorithms, Intel servers slice and dice the images from the cameras to provide the customized footage. This will translate well to wearables like VR headsets, as users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Chips like Curie are already instrumental in improving the sports viewing experience from events like last year's Winter X Games. In real time, viewers were able to view key athlete performance data like the height of a snowboarder jump and how far they rotated. The data was captured from the Curie chip and sensors on the snowboards. Data has become extremely valuable, and wearables can help gather more information, especially biometrics. Wearables are edge devices that collect data and feed them to into the large flow of data being sent to cloud servers for analysis, Intel's Bautista said. In some way, one could think of wearables as an extension to Intel's interest in IoT, and it is in some ways similar to other technologies like connected thermostats and consumer sensor devices, Bautista said. Intel cares about how the collected data is analyzed and presented to the user, Bautista said. Wearables will be key for health-care application development, and Insight 64 analyst Brookwood identified galvanized skin response as a big wearable opportunity that Intel could pursue. Wearables also fuel the development of software applications that can be used for analytics, Bautista said. For example, Intel is developing software tools that will bring artificial intelligence to smartwatches like the new Tag Heuer smartwatch with Android Wear 2.0.  Intel is taking an open architecture approach to IoT devices and wearables, and a device doesn't have to be tied to x86 chips. When planning the recently released smartwatches, Intel looked at the best chip and software that may fit into a device. Intel has packed the x86 Atom smartphone chips in the recent New Balance and TAG Heuer smartwatches, but it has put ARM processors into other wearables. It remains to be seen how long Intel plays in wearables, Brookwood said. The wearables market will take years to mature, so Intel has to remain in it for the long haul.  At the same time, Intel has failed in many of its consumer-facing efforts, especially in media and TV. If Intel technology doesn't power a hit wearable device in the coming years, the effort could be canned. The days of Intel splashing money at efforts that don't produce are gone, Brookwood said.  ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The company has purportedly acquired Tesla contractor and computer vision developer Mobileye for a staggering $15 billion, Reuters reports. Intel is expected to announce the buyout – that will make Mobileye the largest ever acquisition for an Israeli tech company – later on Monday, according to local financial outlet TheMarker. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Mobileye solidified its status as a leading supplier of collision-avoidance car systems after building the tech that powers the first version of Tesla’s flagship Autopilot feature. The two partners later went their own ways following a highly publicized argument over the safety of Autopilot earlier in 2016. The electric car-maker eventually teamed up with Nvidia to release its next-generation Autopilot 2.0. It remains unclear whether Intel has any plans to attempt to iron out the differences between Tesla and Mobileye in the future. Intel and Mobileye have already been collaborating with BMW on an ambitious undertaking that will see the iconic German manufacturer put a fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles on the road later in 2017, with plans to launch its first autonomous vehicle for consumers by 2021. Intel’s foray into self-driving technology hardly comes as a surprise. Earlier last year, the chip-maker partnered with scientists from Damrstadt University in Germany to develop a clever new method of using visual data from Grand Theft Auto to teach vehicles how to drive autonomously. on Reuters Read next: A mysterious Turkish exile just bought luxury phone brand Vertu GearIntelTesla Share on Facebook (335) Share on Twitter (250) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 15, 2017 1:56 PM PT Credit: Tag Heuer More like this Why Intel put a smartphone chip in TAG Heuer's $1,650 smartwatch Intel packs a tablet chip from yesteryear inside New Balance's new RunIQ... Inside Intel's bold plan to personalize live 3D sports broadcasts Video Nvidia's mighty GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cranks PC gaming to 11 Every year, Intel is present at Fashion Week in New York, showing off how technology will change fashion. It's an odd match, but the depth of technologies shown by Intel has changed every year. In previous years, Intel showed off cool bracelets, smart clothes, and an odd robotic spider dress by Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht. Intel's 2017 showcase was a lot different and more practical, sprinkling in retail technologies with otherworldly wearables. That move to the practical, in a nutshell, describes Intel's tryst with its wearables unit -- from starting as a lab for cool devices to becoming a bootstrapped group focused on practical products amid the company's efforts to reduce wasted spending. Intel believes the best wearable products are yet to come, and it wants to change the way we interact with computing devices, share information, and even entertain ourselves. Intel is developing pursuing chips for wearables like Curie, which will be smaller and faster than the existing chip, and help make sleeker wearables, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. "We have to run just like any other responsible business effort that Intel has," Bautista said. The wearables group started off under the New Devices Group, established in 2013. Intel subsequently acquired companies like Basis to boost its wearables offerings but the unit didn't turn a profit. Amid restructuring, reports emerged last year that Intel had quit wearables. But the effort is still alive and more focused on delivering products that complement Intel's broader focus in areas like servers and the internet of things. Wearables are a pretty small operation at Intel, and it'll keep operating under the radar, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. There are huge untapped markets in wearables, especially in vertical areas like health care. It's hard to say when Intel will find a commercially successful product, but the company will continue developing products, Brookwood said. "It's like Google: You keep throwing things against a wall, something may stick," Brookwood said. Despite a more disciplined approach, the cool products and bright ideas keep coming. Every trade show, Intel dazzles audiences with wearable technologies based on its chips and software. Intel's stage shows have featured Oscar winner A.R. Rahman playing music out of smartwatch-like devices, small shirt buttons that can gather health data, and helmets that can make driving cars and riding bikes safer. Intel has also shown its Project Alloy headset, a mixed-reality headset where objects pop up as floating images in mid-air. It's much like Microsoft's HoloLens -- which also uses Intel chips -- but with faster hardware. Recently, two smartwatches from New Balance's RunIQ and TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 carried Intel software and hardware technologies. An Oakley Pace Radar headset, which runs on Intel software, provides fitness guidance when training. The company's approach to wearables is being replicated in other areas like the Intel Sports Group, which is developing technology so users can watch 3D sports broadcasts as if they were in the stadium. One way to achieve that is by putting more cameras across the field, including helmets worn by players. Using algorithms, Intel servers slice and dice the images from the cameras to provide the customized footage. This will translate well to wearables like VR headsets, as users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Chips like Curie are already instrumental in improving the sports viewing experience from events like last year's Winter X Games. In real time, viewers were able to view key athlete performance data like the height of a snowboarder jump and how far they rotated. The data was captured from the Curie chip and sensors on the snowboards. Data has become extremely valuable, and wearables can help gather more information, especially biometrics. Wearables are edge devices that collect data and feed them to into the large flow of data being sent to cloud servers for analysis, Intel's Bautista said. In some way, one could think of wearables as an extension to Intel's interest in IoT, and it is in some ways similar to other technologies like connected thermostats and consumer sensor devices, Bautista said. Intel cares about how the collected data is analyzed and presented to the user, Bautista said. Wearables will be key for health-care application development, and Insight 64 analyst Brookwood identified galvanized skin response as a big wearable opportunity that Intel could pursue. Wearables also fuel the development of software applications that can be used for analytics, Bautista said. For example, Intel is developing software tools that will bring artificial intelligence to smartwatches like the new Tag Heuer smartwatch with Android Wear 2.0.  Intel is taking an open architecture approach to IoT devices and wearables, and a device doesn't have to be tied to x86 chips. When planning the recently released smartwatches, Intel looked at the best chip and software that may fit into a device. Intel has packed the x86 Atom smartphone chips in the recent New Balance and TAG Heuer smartwatches, but it has put ARM processors into other wearables. It remains to be seen how long Intel plays in wearables, Brookwood said. The wearables market will take years to mature, so Intel has to remain in it for the long haul.  At the same time, Intel has failed in many of its consumer-facing efforts, especially in media and TV. If Intel technology doesn't power a hit wearable device in the coming years, the effort could be canned. The days of Intel splashing money at efforts that don't produce are gone, Brookwood said.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 March 2017 by Military News Intel Corporation Is Losing Focus On March 13, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announced that it would be paying $15.3 billion for computer vision specialist Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) . The purpose of this transaction, per Intel, is to merge Mobileye’s computer vision technology with its own computing and connectivity technologies to become a „leading end-to-end [autonomous driving] technology provider from the vehicle to the cloud.” To sell investors on this deal, Intel talked up how the total addressable market for self-driving car systems and services could be on the order of $70 billion. Considering that Intel’s Internet of Things Group (IoTG), which consists of its current Autonomous Driving Group (ADG), hasn’t yet crossed the $3 billion annual revenue mark, the potential long-term upside for Intel if self-driving cars get going could be large. Image source: Mobileye. Nevertheless, I don’t really like this deal. Although it was expensive ($15.3 billion for a company that only generated $358 million in revenue in 2016 is steep, even if the growth prospects for the business look good), the high price isn’t the only thing that makes me unhappy with it. It’s the fact that this buy is symptomatic of what appears to be a bigger problem for Intel: It’s losing its focus. Intel is big and well funded, but… To be clear: Intel is an extremely well-funded company and has room to spend lavishly while still maintaining robust profits. If managed properly, Intel should be able to invest in both in the businesses that pay the bills today as well as in the businesses that could potentially drive huge growth tomorrow. The problem is this: Intel’s execution in its core businesses is slipping. Intel routinely sees delays of critical products to its core Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center Group (DCG) businesses, weakening its competitive positioning and providing openings to new competitors . Additionally, Intel’s crown jewel and historically a critical enabler of its competitive advantages over the competition — its Technology and Manufacturing Group (TMG) — has also struggled to execute for years now; critical manufacturing technologies that are used to build virtually all its processor products almost always see delays now (impacting competitiveness /product schedules), and even when they are finally forced to see the light of day, there seem to be extended yield challenges — negatively impacting the company’s profitability and/or its ability to apply its newest technologies to key product segments. Intel has some serious issues that it needs to work out in its core businesses — namely, it has to improve its product execution in PC and data center processors and platforms while at the same time substantially improving its execution in chip manufacturing technology. Can’t Intel do everything? I am a firm believer of getting the basics right and building from there. It’s important for Intel to be a well-oiled machine in the core businesses that today generate value for stockholders, supporting the current share price. And getting the basics right will make it much easier for Intel to successfully attack new markets by leveraging its core technologies and competencies. If the fundamentals are shaky, however, Intel might find itself losing ground in its core markets while not getting as much traction in new markets (despite spending a lot of money chasing them) as it could otherwise with its core competencies intact. In blowing $15.3 billion on Mobileye, Intel might improve its position in self-driving cars in the future, and it may very well serve to unlock a larger portion of the $70 billion total addressable market that the company touts. However, if in several years Intel continues to stumble in its core business, then it’ll have Mobileye’s great computer vision technology but less-than-ideal products to go with that technology. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Analysts are split on the benefits of the move.  Stephen Chin at UBS cheered the acquisition, saying it "provides a path for further P/E multiple expansion from sales diversification into the fast growing autonomous driving (AD) market, positions Intel as a broader ecosystem play, and could drive margin expansion." UBS maintained its a buy rating and a $42 price target. The bank added it likes "how Intel is transforming the company into a diversified business that can grow faster than the 'low-single digits %'." On the other hand, Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to neutral and slashed its price target from $45 to $35. Credit Suisse approves of the acquisition but thinks that the short-term costs of such a major and expensive (29x 2017 sales) acquisition cannot be ignored. With Intel already trading at a premium to its peers and slim growth prospects, the investment bank just cannot find the justification to keep an outperform rating on this stock. It's important to note that Intel has a history of acquisitions gone terribly wrong but Intel CEO Brian Krzanich argued that Mobileye would be different: The next data revolution will be visual data," he said. "Those cars see the world. And so as we're looking for things, as visual data becomes important, that is a new whole business and new whole regime of data management that is going to become available. It's important now, because if you take a look at what you're doing — talking about car models in 2020, 2021 — and so we need to get in there. We need to get this platform developed, brought to them, and have that confidence so that we can really influence the real start of autonomous driving in that time frame. Since the deal, Intel's stock is down $1 or 2.5% to about $35 a share.

Digital Trends Home > Deals > These PC hardware deals give you more savings on… These PC hardware deals give you more savings on your custom computer build By Lucas Coll — March 15, 2017 10:15 AM Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Building a computer can be an intimidating task if you’ve never done it before, but a number of online resources can make it much easier for folks to jump into the wide world of custom PCs. Purchasing components and assembling everything yourself can not only make your money go a lot farther when it comes to performance, but allows you to customize your computer build so you can get exactly what you need and aren’t stuck with anything you don’t want. Selecting the parts for your computer build is by far the most important and time-consuming part of the process, so to help you save some time and money, we’ve collected a few of the best deals going right now on various components. Note that this is a list of some of the best discounts available at the moment and is not a guide or parts list for a specific build. Be sure to check out online resources such as our PC building guide to help you determine parts compatibility and what components will work best for a computer that best suits your individual needs. Cooler Master HAF 912 mid-tower computer case Once you’ve determined what sort of computer build you want, a good next step is to start looking at different cases and deciding which size you will need. A quality mid-tower will suit most builds, and Newegg is currently offering the Cooler Master HAF 912 for just $40 after a $20 mail-in rebate through Monday, March 20. That’s a 33 percent discount. Cooler Master is a household name when it comes to computer cases, and the HAF 912 is a rugged-looking and attractive mid-tower that is compatible with standard ATX motherboards. The design is optimized for maximum airflow and contains room for a 120mm radiator and up to six 120mm fans to keep your system cool.

While we weren't expecting a new x86 SoC in the space, Intel did not specify that would be the case: the agreements with third-party SoC developers such as Spreadtrum and Rockchip were still in place. Despite this, we were surprised to hear that At MWC 2017, Intel’s partner Spreadtrum introduced a brand new application processor for high-end handsets, featuring Intel’s 2015 Airmont cores (as seen in Cherry Trail) and made using Intel’s 14 nm process technology. The Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA SoC features eight Intel’s Airmont cores with running at up to 2 GHz, with Imagination Technology's PowerVR GT7200 GPU. Also integrated is Spreadtrum's own 5-mode LTE Cat 7 modem (up to 300 Mbps download, up to 100 Mbps upload). The SoC also integrates an ISP that supports up to two 13 MP camera sensors, a dedicated sensor hub, and hardware-based decoders/encoders for HEVC and other popular video codecs that support up to 3840×2160 resolution. The display controller can handle resolutions up to 2560×1600. Spreadtrum's 8-Core Airmont SoC   SC9861G-IA CPU Cores 8 × Intel Airmont at up to 2 GHz GPU PowerVR GT7200 Imaging Capabilities Up to 26 MP, up to two 13 MP sensors Video 4Kp30, HEVC Display Controller 2560 × 1440 Modem TD-LTE/FDD LTE/TD-SCDMA/WCDMA/EGG LTE Category 7 (DL: 300Mbps, UL: 100Mbps) Process Technology 14 nm To date, the Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA is the most powerful (and presumably energy-efficient) x86-based SoCfor smartphones. It has more cores, better graphics, and a faster modem than Intel’s own code-named Moorefield SoCs introduced in 2014, made using its 22 nm fabrication process, or the SoFIA chips (designed by Rockchip) launched in 2015 made using TSMC’s 28 nm technologies. Using Intel’s 14 nm manufacturing technology for this new SoC helps to reduce minimum power requirements and die size (which still remain unknown). The SC9861G-IA is the first x86-based SoC by Spreadtrum, and the development was enabled by an agreement signed in late 2014 after Intel acquired a $1.5-billion worth stake in Tsinghua Unigroup, the owner of Spreadtrum. The chip will not carry the Intel Atom brand, and thus Intel will not help makers of devices to integrate it or make any other incentives to popularize the platform. It will also not invest in its advertising. What is interesting is that the SC9861G-IA will not be Spreadtrum’s last x86-based SoC, according to the CEO of Intel. “We look forward to working with Spreadtrum on additional mobile platforms,” said Brian Krzanich. Neither company elaborated on the future plans, and we do not know whether Spreadtrum will continue to introduce smartphone SoCs featuring Intel’s low-power cores, or if they will launch something for higher-end tablets as well. Intel and Spreadtrum did not disclose when they expect the first devices based on the SC9861G-IA to show up, but only noted that the platform can address both mainstream and high-end handsets.

Reply witeken - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link It is, but actually it was on the roadmap for a H2'16 release for a long time, it's just that people have forgotten about Intel's mobile efforts after they quit last year. Spreadtrum is also working on a 10nm (Intel Custom Foundry) SoC. Reply edlee - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link This is a waste, i never buy, let alone let a friend or colleague buy atom based products, performance is soo piss poor for 2017, its a joke. Its slower than core 2 duo from 10 years back. Intel has to stop this nonsense, and just make a lower mhz kaby lake like 1ghz, and it will still be faster than these atoms Reply Darkknight512 - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link I'm quite happy with the performance of Atom based CPUs in tablets. I own a Dell Venue 8 Pro running Windows 10. I run CAD programs and microcontroller development IDEs on it to view CAD models in the field and flash/debug MCUs in the field. The performance is absolutely excellent. Reply Ro_Ja - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link CAD Programs aren't heavy? Reply ddriver - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Well, I suppose something as ancient as autocad 2007 would fly on it. Modern cad software would run very poorly. "microcontroller development IDEs" that's pretty much a glorified text editor. Not exactly demanding to run, also targeting MC platforms isn't exactly demanding when it comes to the actual compilation. Try the latest visual studio and see how long you will take it before you smash that poor venue in anger. Atoms are seriously slow. In fact even core m is too slow for the vast majority of professional work. I pin my hopes on a zen apus making their way to tablets and convertibles, finally producing some useful and reasonably priced ultra portables. Reply niva - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Even if AMD has a competitive chip for ultra portables, which right now they don't, what makes you think anyone would allow them to actually produce a good device that could be sold in great numbers to consumers? We've been down this road before. That being said, you do sound like an absolute joy of a person to be around. :) Reply ddriver - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I don't care about devices selling in great numbers. It has been a while since I bought one of those. My needs and tastes rarely coincide with the mainstream. What I'd like to have is a 2 cm or 3/4 inch thick tablet device, with a notebook grade quad core in around 25 watts TDP budget and a huge ass battery. Fast storage for data acquisition, 32 gigs of ram, good stylus support. Certainly not something that would sell in great numbers, even considering its usability and current uniqueness. Reply lmcd - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link In other words you'd like a unicorn that can drag your private jet and stows itself in your carry-on luggage during flight. Pretty sure if that could exist it'd hit mainstream extraordinarily fast. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link "Spreadtrum" - now that's an awful name for a brand. Sounds like spread rectum. Seriously!

Find Corporate Buyers Next Article IoT Spells Trouble for Data Center Security, Networks Microsoft's Open Compute-inspired servers on display at the Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara in March 2017 (Photo: Yevgeniy Sverdlik) AMD, ARM, Blades, Featured, Intel, Microsoft, Open Compute Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 13, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Recent years’ relative quiet on the ARM server front, the scarcity of large-scale IBM Power deployment news, and the consistent growth reported by Intel’s Data Center Group may in totality create an impression that the data center chip wars have subsided, with Intel enjoying a massive – and secure – lead. A few announcements that came out of last week’s Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara and the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco however showed that while Intel’s lead may be massive, it’s under bigger threat than may have appeared. The biggest news out of the Open Compute event was that Microsoft had been working with ARM chip makers Cavium and Qualcomm on ARM server designs to run many of its cloud services (Qualcomm’s processors are in a big but reportedly waning share of the world’s smartphones). This was not an announcement like the ones we’ve heard in the past from Facebook and Google –non-committal revelations that they had been testing ARM servers here and there, and that they were really always testing everything on the market, just in case. Microsoft thinks there’s real potential for ARM servers to eventually provide more than half of its cloud data center capacity. Coming from the world’s second-largest cloud provider, that kind of announcement should give Intel a lot to think about. As more and more corporate applications are headed for the cloud, the number of servers traditional hardware vendors sell to enterprises is on a gradual decline, while cloud providers are buying more and more processors to support those migrating workloads. The prospect of ARM servers working out the way Microsoft is picturing they may for its Azure cloud threatens Intel’s biggest source of revenue growth. Learn about Project Olympus, Microsoft’s pioneering effort to design data center hardware the same way open source software is developed, at Data Center World, which is taking place next month in Los Angeles. Kushagra Vaid, Microsoft’s general manager for Azure Cloud Hardware Infrastructure, will be giving a keynote titled Open Source Hardware Development at Cloud Speed. The same week, speaking on stage at Google’s big cloud event, Raejeanne Skillern, leader of Intel’s Cloud Service Provider Group, confirmed what Google had announced earlier, that Intel had sold to Google its latest-generation Skylake server chips before it would let any other company have them, giving Google’s cloud platform a temporary performance advantage over its competitors. Timing of both announcements may be a coincidence, but one reason Microsoft has been working with ARM server vendors is to avoid putting all its eggs in one basket, especially if that basket is a supplier that’s not required to provide all its customers with a level playing field. Read more: Google Expands Cloud Data Center Plans, Asserts Hardware, Connectivity Leadership In order to avoid having to rewrite much of the software that powers its cloud services, Microsoft has ported Windows Server 2016 to ARM, Leendert van Doorn, distinguished engineer for Azure, announced from stage at the summit. The company envisions using ARM servers to power its cloud storage, Big Data, Machine Learning, search, index, and other workloads. “Those properties together actually represent over half of our data center capacity, so there’s quite a lot of potential for different kinds of servers there,” he said, adding that the workload that for now is safely in the x86 corner is running customers’ cloud VMs, also known as infrastructure-as-a-service. “We work closely with our x86 partners too, so one of the key things here for us is choice,” van Doorn said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Besides Intel, those x86 partners also include AMD, which is staging a “comeback” to the data center market, leading with its upcoming high-performance Naples chip. Project Olympus, Microsoft’s effort to leverage the open source hardware design community of the Open Compute Project to create its next cloud server, includes motherboards for Intel, AMD chips, as well as the ARM variants by Cavium and Qualcomm. The ARM server ecosystem has to a great extent benefited from the massive scale of the high-end smartphone market, van Doorn wrote in a blog post. The developer ecosystem that has grown around ARM-powered smartphones has “significantly helped Microsoft in porting its cloud software to ARM servers.” Van Doorn cited throughput-oriented ARM designs as a key reason Microsoft is getting so heavily involved with the architecture. “Those are things with high-performance IO, high IPCs (instructions per cycle), lots of cores and threads, large numbers of them, and lots of interesting connectivity options, especially with some of the newer bus standards, which are very interesting from an accelerator perspective,” he said. Simpler hardware compatibility is another factor. Because ARM chipsets and motherboards are built on open standards, there’s absolutely no difference between Cavium and Qualcomm versions of Windows Server 2016 for ARM, van Doorn said. A single generic ARM ACPI driver will enable the OS to discover and onboard peripherals and such instead of different drivers for different chipsets, as explained by The Register. Another trend that’s playing out in Microsoft’s ARM and AMD announcements is the new opportunity to optimize cloud hardware for specific workloads. That opportunity is in the economies of scale the cloud has made possible. From van Doorn’s blog post: “Due to the scale required for certain cloud services, i.e. the number of machines allocated to them, it becomes more economically feasible to optimize the hardware to the workload instead of the other way around, even if that means changing the Instruction Set Architecture.” A bigger variety of chipmakers in theory makes that kind of optimization easier.

According to a cover story in The Atlantic by Liza Mundy, while tech giants like Google and Facebook struggle to overcome bias and bring more people of color and women into overwhelmingly white, male offices, Intel may have figured out a way to make hiring more fair without sacrificing quality. The billion-dollar tech corporation, which dates back to 1969, has managed to get its numbers up faster than its younger peers. It has succeeded not by forcing its hiring managers into diversity training sessions or by employing anti-bias apps, but, instead, by offering cold hard cash. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Intel employees walk by a sign as they enter their office in Santa Clara, California. Hirers are now rewarded for bringing on candidates who are not white men. According to The Atlantic: Since it began linking bonuses to diversity hiring, Intel has met or exceeded its goals. In 2015, 43 percent of new hires were women and underrepresented minorities, three percentage points above its target. Last year, it upped its goal to 45 percent of new hires, and met it. These changes weren't just happening at the entry level: 40 percent of new vice presidents were women and underrepresented minorities. Intel's U.S. workforce in 2014 was just 23.5 percent female. By the middle of last year, the percentage had risen two points, to 25.4 percent. By contrast, Google and Facebook are moving more slowly, Mundy reports, albeit in the right direction. In 2016, Google reported incremental improvements: 31 percent of its overall workforce is now female, up one percentage point over the previous year. Nineteen percent of technical roles are held by women, also up a percentage point. At Facebook, women's overall representation went up from 32 percent to 33 percent. In technical roles, women's representation also increased a single percentage point, from 16 percent to 17 percent. Intel made news on Monday for its ambitious investment in driverless-car technology. It is clearly focused on the future, and employees tell Mundy that they appreciate the company's commitment to making sure that future is at least somewhat female. Still, much work remains to be done in tech overall. Although in the past couple of years, companies have "pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars changing their work climates, altering the composition of their leadership, and refining their hiring practices," Mundy writes, "the transformation hasn't yet materialized: The industry's diversity numbers have barely budged, and many women say that while sexism has become somewhat less overt, it's just as pernicious as ever." Intel's strategy of paying for the results it wants has been effective but it hasn't yet gone viral. And even its efforts have not changed the overall situation of women and minorities. Joelle Emerson, founder and CEO of the San Francisco firm Paradigm, consults with top employers such as Slack, Airbnb and Pinterest on issues related to diversity. "At Emerson's talk on unconscious bias last summer, someone in the audience asked her which Silicon Valley companies are managing bias well," Mundy writes. Emerson's answer: "No one." show chapters This tech start-up lets you try out for your job, before you get an offer    Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 | 10:27 AM ET | 01:09 Ester BloomSenior Editor, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The camera was mounted behind the rearview mirror during a demonstration of the system, in Ann Arbor, Mich. Intel is buying Mobileye in a deal announced Monday, March 13, 2017, and valued at about $14.09 billion, the latest push by a major tech company into autonomous vehicles that could change the way traffic moves globally. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) Intel's deal this week to acquire car-sensor maker Mobileye closed out a successful investment for Clayton-based Enterprise Holdings. Enterprise, the parent of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, invested in Mobileye in 2013. The Israeli company needed money to work on its driverless-car technology, and it raised $400 million from Enterprise and four other investors. Mobileye was valued at $1.5 billion back then. Intel is paying $15 billion, so the early investors obviously did very well for themselves. We don't know exactly how much Enterprise made on the investment, but securities filings provide some clues. Enterprise owned 14.3 million shares, or about 6.6 percent of Mobileye, when the technology company went public in 2014. Enterprise sold 2.5 million shares in a March 2015 secondary offering, then sold 1.8 million shares in November 2015, reducing its stake to 4.6 percent. Enterprise still owned 10 million shares as of November 2015, but spokeswoman Christy Conrad said Wednesday that the car-rental giant had exited the investment. "We've reduced the shares over the past year, and sold the rest off Monday with the Intel announcement," she said. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Mobileye shares traded between $32 and $47 in the year preceding the Intel announcement, and they jumped to $60.62 Monday. This is a rough guess, but if Enterprise sold half its shares at around $40 and half near Monday's closing price, it would have received around $500 million, in addition to approximately $292 million from the 2015 sales. Enterprise didn't disclose how much it paid for the Mobileye stake, but if it put up about one-fifth of the $400 million in 2013, it reaped a nearly 10-fold return in less than four years. That's not bad for a big car buyer's bet on the cars of the future. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

View All Pages Ryzen 7 has already proven to be a worthy contender for Intel’s LGA 2011-3 set of processors thanks to its similar, or sometimes better, performance levels and significantly cheaper cost. That metric is stretched even further with the 8C16T Ryzen 7 1700 that ships at just £330. At a relative bargain price compared to the higher-end Ryzen 7 SKUs, never mind Intel’s £1000 octa-core part, Ryzen 7 1700 operates at a reduced clock speed out-of-the-box and is given a 65W TDP rating. You also get a decent Wraith Spire CPU cooler thrown into the bundle. The most important point to enthusiasts is its retention of the unlocked CPU frequency multiplier that should allow a typical 1700 to reach 3.8-4.0GHz without much hassle. A £70-170 discount versus Ryzen 7 1700X and 1800X with the ability to hit similar top speeds certainly makes the 1700 chip an intriguing value proposition. As we highlighted in our review of the 1700X, it is not uncommon for AMD to release multiple processor SKUs to market which are all essentially the same silicon. Binning is not an uncommon process in the computer hardware industry and it still remains an excellent method for enthusiasts to extract additional performance from a lower cost part. For now, AMD’s highest quality silicon forms the 1800X, with less-prime chips finding their home as 1700 and 1700X parts. There is a caveat to that logic, though, and that’s the 1700’s 65W TDP which will force it to use silicon that fits a different position on the voltage-frequency curve. On the topic of that 65W TDP, we can already foresee the excitement of the 1700 to Small Form Factor (SFF) users once the AM4 mini-ITX motherboard situation improves. If you want to squeeze a high number of cores into a mini-ITX build, Ryzen 7 1700 looks to be an excellent method of doing so. That’s also whilst avoiding the complexities of using LGA 2011-3 and 140W TDP Core i7 or Xeon CPUs in the same form factor. The ASRock X99E-ITX/ac is still an excellent work of engineering, nevertheless, which can single-handedly help Intel’s HEDT platform in the SFF fight against Ryzen 7. AMD’s Ryzen 7 1700 comes bundled with a heatsink and fan, which is now unusual for £300+ CPUs since Intel removed the stock cooler from K SKUs with Skylake. The Wraith Spire cooler features a five-bladed, 92mm fan that forces air over an aluminium fin array fed by a copper slug in the core. The mounting mechanism now employs screws that fasten to an AM4 motherboard backplate, which is an upgrade over the relatively flimsy clip approach deployed with AMD’s AM3 stock coolers. Compared to an Intel stock cooler pulled from an old 4790K or modern multiplier-locked Core i5 or i7, it is easy to see the size advantage for the Wraith Spire. Also worth noting is the braided 4-pin fan cable that adds an element of quality. There’s also an RGB LED ring on the top of the fan that can be controlled by the included 4-pin RGB adapter cable. The Wraith Spire’s mount on our AM4 ASUS Crosshair VI Hero was very solid and did not cause interference with neighbouring components. Removal of the plastic retention brackets is required as the cooler screws straight into the AM4 backplate. With the 4-pin RGB cable connected to our motherboard’s header, the Wraith Spire cooler picked up the ASUS cyclic RGB profile without our adjustment and synchronised its operating mode and colours. Good job, AMD and ASUS. Of course, being a cooler designed for use on AMD’s PGA socket, you still get the old traditions of having to yank the CPU out of its socket when removing the cooler. This is largely due to the very sticky pre-applied thermal paste. It’s something to watch out for if you decide to replace this cooler in the future as this is an easy way to damage the CPU.

The 1700 retains the 8C16T design split over a pair of CPU Complexes (CCX) as is used for the 1700X and 1800X. 20MB of total cache is still available and the core frequency multiplier is unlocked to allow for easy overclocking. The differences between the 1700 and other Ryzen 7 SKUs come in the form of out-of-the-box frequency, TDP, and XFR headroom. By default, the 1700 operates at a modest, due to the TDP target, 3.0GHz with a maximum Precision Boost clock speed of 3.7GHz. Highlighting the non-X difference of this SKU, XFR headroom is cut in half compared to the 1700X and 1800X, allowing the 1700 to operate at 50MHz above its maximum Precision Boost clock speed under the relevant conditions. With sufficient cooling, you’ll get a 3.2GHz all-core operating frequency out-of-the-box, 3.7GHz maximum multi-core Precision Boost operating speed, and 3.75GHz XFR frequency for single-core operations. Of course, that’s before playing with the core ratio multiplier that can give 25MHz granularity for CPU speed increases.

Was this a mistake or is XFR actually enabled on the 1700 contrary to what I’ve read pretty much everywhere else? Luke XFR is enabled but only at half the headroom. The current X chips get 100MHz of XFR headroom whereas this non-X chip gets 50MHz. We validated this with multiple single-threaded tests and watched the frequency in CPUID HWMonitor report as 3750MHz on the loaded cores. ZippyZion Interesting. I didn’t know that was a thing. Thanks! Next gripe. Page 3 has the Ryzens listed at Summit Ridge, which isn’t their code name. The code name was Zen. Summit Ridge refers to the Zen based APUs that AMD has yet to release. ZippyZion Thanks for the info. I’ve been following closely but I was completely unaware that the 1700 had XFR. Barron Good review, so in summary, if you want to play your games at very low resolutions, with refresh rates that your monitor does not support get the i7-7700k . But if you want a real PC that can do all other workstation tasks, and game at high resolution, get the Ryzen 1700. Anyhow, I don’t think anymore will buy a high end GPU and play in low res. What we need is a Real World comparison between the AMD and Intel chips. Can you do one for us please? Greg Bryett The 1700 is an impressive cpu. I can’t deny that it will do better in games once developers begin optimizing. I have mine sitting in the MSI Carbon Pro and is happily running at 4.0ghz 24/7 at 1.3875vcore. However try as I might I am not able to get my 3200 ram above 3000 at the moment. MSI have not been quick to produce new bios revisions and to date only have the one bios listed on their website!!! Luke There are 4K gaming tests in there also, which show very little difference between the Intel and AMD chips due to such demand being placed on the GPU.

The system will debut on a new smartwatch Intel is building with TAG Heuer. Announced this week, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a circular smartwatch with a 1.39-inch touchscreen display. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and 4GB of memory. The watch will run Android Wear 2.0, the latest version of Google's wearable operating system. Although the Connected Modular 45 is being recognised for its Swiss design and blend of traditional and modern technology, one of its software features could be the most significant component. Intel is building a futuristic virtual assistant to sit on the watch, enabling owners to use their voice to ask questions and carry out commands. Cortana on an Android phone Microsoft Not a lot is known about the assistant at present. However, Jerry Bautista, vice president of the New Technology Group at Intel, told The Verge it will have a genderless personality. As Silicon Valley debates whether tech companies should use female AI personas by default, Intel's move will enable it to avoid the controversy aimed at its industry rivals. In particular, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana are designed as female assistants. Alexa's name hasn't proved popular with feminists and Amazon has been criticised for reinforcing sexist views. For its part, Cortana's personality is generally female too. Although the assistant is derived from the female Cortana character in Microsoft's Halo video games, opponents of the brand say Microsoft should be doing more to develop an obviously gender-neutral variant. Google Assistant Google Google has also been targeted. It deliberately left its new AI without a "human" name. Google Assistant still defaults to a female persona though, making the neutral "Assistant" branding a wasted effort. With it clear that people want to at least have a choice over their assistant's gender, Intel's solution could be better received than the assistants launched to date. Details are currently scant on what Intel's take will offer or how its "genderless" nature is achieved. The Verge reports the app will be able to handle voice conversations while maintaining context, proactively give you reminders and alerts throughout the day and integrate with other services. Intel is calling it a "new experience of time," suggesting it will be a smartwatch-exclusive service for now. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 Intel The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is available from today online and in TAG Heuer stores and specialist watch vendors. It retails from $1,600 USD and comes in a choice of satin or polished grade 5 titanium base finishes. The design is available in 56 different variants encompassing a large selection of personalisation options. Intel's assistant will arrive in a software update later in the device's life. It isn't clear when the AI will launch or what platforms it'll be available on.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 15, 2017 at 1:45PM On March 13, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that it would be paying $15.3 billion for computer vision specialist Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). The purpose of this transaction, per Intel, is to merge Mobileye's computer vision technology with its own computing and connectivity technologies to become a "leading end-to-end [autonomous driving] technology provider from the vehicle to the cloud." To sell investors on this deal, Intel talked up how the total addressable market for self-driving car systems and services could be on the order of $70 billion. Considering that Intel's Internet of Things Group (IoTG), which consists of its current Autonomous Driving Group (ADG), hasn't yet crossed the $3 billion annual revenue mark, the potential long-term upside for Intel if self-driving cars get going could be large. Image source: Mobileye. Nevertheless, I don't really like this deal. Although it was expensive ($15.3 billion for a company that only generated $358 million in revenue in 2016 is steep, even if the growth prospects for the business look good), the high price isn't the only thing that makes me unhappy with it. It's the fact that this buy is symptomatic of what appears to be a bigger problem for Intel: It's losing its focus. Intel is big and well funded, but... To be clear: Intel is an extremely well-funded company and has room to spend lavishly while still maintaining robust profits. If managed properly, Intel should be able to invest in both in the businesses that pay the bills today as well as in the businesses that could potentially drive huge growth tomorrow. The problem is this: Intel's execution in its core businesses is slipping. Intel routinely sees delays of critical products to its core Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center Group (DCG) businesses, weakening its competitive positioning and providing openings to new competitors. Additionally, Intel's crown jewel and historically a critical enabler of its competitive advantages over the competition -- its Technology and Manufacturing Group (TMG) -- has also struggled to execute for years now; critical manufacturing technologies that are used to build virtually all its processor products almost always see delays now (impacting competitiveness/product schedules), and even when they are finally forced to see the light of day, there seem to be extended yield challenges -- negatively impacting the company's profitability and/or its ability to apply its newest technologies to key product segments. Intel has some serious issues that it needs to work out in its core businesses -- namely, it has to improve its product execution in PC and data center processors and platforms while at the same time substantially improving its execution in chip manufacturing technology. Can't Intel do everything? I am a firm believer of getting the basics right and building from there. It's important for Intel to be a well-oiled machine in the core businesses that today generate value for stockholders, supporting the current share price. And getting the basics right will make it much easier for Intel to successfully attack new markets by leveraging its core technologies and competencies. If the fundamentals are shaky, however, Intel might find itself losing ground in its core markets while not getting as much traction in new markets (despite spending a lot of money chasing them) as it could otherwise with its core competencies intact. In blowing $15.3 billion on Mobileye, Intel might improve its position in self-driving cars in the future, and it may very well serve to unlock a larger portion of the $70 billion total addressable market that the company touts. However, if in several years Intel continues to stumble in its core business, then it'll have Mobileye's great computer vision technology but less-than-ideal products to go with that technology.

Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at just over $15 billion, the latest push by a major tech company to advance autonomous vehicles that could change the way traffic moves globally. Associated Press Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Associated Press   By Tom Krisher Associated Press Autos Writer DETROIT -- Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing this week as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver-assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said this week's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It's likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup "confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors" threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. • Aron Heller in Jerusalem, Michael Liedtke in San Francisco and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 15, 2017 at 9:45AM For years, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) told its investors to expect a long-term revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from its Data Center Group (DCG). And, for years, Intel fell short of that 15% growth, except for the 18% growth that this business achieved in 2014. During its Feb. 9 investor meeting, Intel finally took that long-term CAGR forecast down from 15% to just "low double digits," which is believed to mean anywhere from a 10% CAGR to a 13% CAGR. Intel DCG chief Diane Bryant. Image source: Intel. The company says that it reduced its long-term forecast for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it significantly lowered its expectations around the enterprise-server processor market. Secondly, in the time frame for which the CAGR applies (2017 through 2021), Intel expects delays in ramp-ups of new products. If Intel's predictions were too bullish last time, investors should be skeptical of its new ones. But management tried to assuage investor fears about the current CAGR by explaining that it can still achieve its predicted growth given a variety of trends in the enterprise-server processor market. Intel's three paths In the slide below, you'll see the three different scenarios that Intel has cooked up with respect to potential declines in enterprise-server processors: Image source: Intel. Note that in each of the three scenarios -- which range from enterprise-server processor sales dropping at a 1% CAGR from 2017 to 2021 (a total revenue drop of around 5%) to dropping at a 7% clip (a total revenue drop of around 30%) -- Intel should be able to achieve its goal of "low double digit CAGR." Of course, with the power of compounding, a 10% CAGR over a five-year period leads to a vastly different total amount of growth than a 13% one does. Growth of 10% compounded over five years is a total of 61% growth; growth of 13% compounded over that time frame is a total of 84.2% growth. Translating that into hard dollar figures, 61% growth from the $17.2 billion that Intel's DCG saw in 2016 would lead to $27.7 billion in revenue by 2021; 84.2% growth from that same baseline would yield $31.7 billion in revenue -- a difference of $4 billion. A big caveat to these growth scenarios The figures that Intel shows in this slide appear to assume that in each scenario, everything but enterprise-server processor sales is fixed. It is entirely possible that the growth rates Intel is currently betting on in the cloud and networking markets -- both markets where Intel will arguably face more heated competition than in the traditional enterprise-server processor space -- fall short of expectations, negatively impacting DCG's long-term growth rate. Indeed, just because Intel has built its new growth targets around more reasonable expectations about the enterprise-server market, investors shouldn't necessarily have faith in the rest of its forecasts being realistic. Investment takeaway What's interesting is that if Intel manages to achieve the long-term growth CAGR it has projected, its DCG business should, by 2021, be roughly the size of its Client Computing Group (CCG) business. At that point, the company's sensitivity to the structurally challenged personal-computer market (the bulk of the company's CCG revenue) should be much lower. And if Intel is able to keep its operating expenses under reasonable control and keep its gross profit margins roughly where they are, it should be able to generate much greater profits, too. For now, though, Intel has its work cut out for it. A lot of change can happen in five years: in the macroeconomic environment, in the competitive landscape, and even in how well the company can execute new products and ink deals to sell said products. It's by no means assured that the company will hit the long-term growth rate it has put out there, so investors shouldn't plan as if it's in the bag. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The biggest beneficiaries from the sale of Mobileye(NYSE: MBLY) to Intel will obviously be its two founders, chairman Prof. Amnon Shashua and CEO Ziv Aviram, and Dr. Shmuel Harlap, a controlling shareholder in auto importer Colmobil. The wealth generated by Mobileye, however, is not confined to these three. Its beneficiaries include a considerable number of Mobileye senior executives and its 600 employees. The company's option plans listed in its annual documents gives an indication of the extent of this wealth. These plans benefit primarily the two Mobileye founders and its senior management, but it is reasonable to assume that the other employees also derived some benefit from them. The price of Intel's acquisition of Mobileye, $15.3 billion in cash, reflects all the company's share capital, including the shares that will be issued immediately after the deal is closed in respect of the exercise of the all the options granted to employees. A check by "Globes" shows that these options reflect a huge $1.2 billion (NIS 4.4 billion) pre-tax value. RELATED ARTICLES Mobileye exit over double Israeli record Mobileye deal will bring Israel tax windfall The Mobileye billionaires Mobileye a magnet for investment in Israel Intel confirms $15b acquisition of Mobileye Another interesting figure is that two thirds (66%) of the options were distributed at strike prices substantially lower than the $25 share price in the company's IPO. In other words, the strike prices are negligible, especially in comparison with the share price at which the company was sold. These options, which were granted to employees when Mobileye was still a private company, reflected its value before it became a public company. Furthermore, in the 30 months since the company's IPO, options were exercised reflecting a total benefit of $500 million. "Globes" calculated this benefit on the basis of the average share price on the market during the entire year. In its documents, Mobileye discloses the holdings of company directors and senior officeholders classified as parties at interest. It is important to note, however, that some of the managers already sold their holdings after Mobileye's IPO, and that these holdings do not necessarily reflect the wealth accumulated in the company. The most senior manager is senior VP and CFO Ofer Maharshak, who joined the company a decade ago after leaving Lipman Electronics Engineering, sold to Verifone. Maharshak's current holding is worth $7 million. A check by "Globes" revealed that he has sold shares for $12.8 million to date, meaning that he accumulated at least $20 million (gross, before taxes). The directors, whose names are familiar to the economic press, were not neglected, either. The first is Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) CFO Eyal Deshe, a director in Mobileye since before its IPO. His holdings are worth $6.4 million (gross). Another one is Eli Barkat, appointed as a director immediately following Mobileye's IPO, whose holdings are worth $1.3 million. Barkat made his pile out of the BRM Capital venture capital fund - the first investor in Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP). The last one is Judith Richter, one of the owners of stent manufacturer Medinol. Like Barkat, Richter was appointed as a director on the occasion of Mobileye's IPO, and her holdings have the same value as Barkat's. Other new Mobileye millionaires include senior VP production programs Dr. Itay Gat (holdings worth $11.3 million), senior VP R&D Gaby Hayon ($8.6 million), and senior VP advanced development and strategy Erez Dagan ($1.4 million).

"Intel acquired Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) because it could; it had the money. Intel is an excellent company, and its connection with another excellent company creates a lot of value. I've no doubt that it will be a marvelous marriage, and will provide many advantages, including business opportunities. I think that the planets are very nicely lined up for Israel and the US," says Ray LaHood, US Secretary of Transportation in the first Obama administration and an Illinois Congressman in 1995-2009. LaHood is currently a consultant for the DLA Piper international law firm, which jointly organized a transportation conference in Tel Aviv with Israeli law firm Herzog, Fox & Ne'eman.  RELATED ARTICLES DLA Piper Conference in Israel discusses global real estate trends DLA Piper makes legal inroads into Israel At the conference, LaHood spoke about the future of transportation, and emphasized that success in this sector will be if in 10 or 20 years, the average number of cars per family in the US is one, due to the fact that there are no good alternatives. "A lot of money will be invested in all varieties of the next generation of transportation. In the US, a large proportion of the next generation of transportation will be based on railways. That's what people want, and as Secretary of Transportation, I traveled to 18 countries to study the subject. We invested a lot in this," he says. "There are a lot of people in the US, especially young people after college, who are moving to Chicago, Washington, New York, and other large cities, and one of the things they don't want is a car. They use mass transit. There's a lot of technology in this, and we have invested billions in subways and in cities that want an alternative to cars. We explained this to people in a simple way: 'When your kid comes back from college to the city, it will be because of well-paid jobs, affordable housing and convenient transportation.' That has to be part of the calculation." LaHood later spoke in greater detail about the changes brought about by technology, one of which is vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, saying, "When I was Secretary of Transportation, I funded research in Michigan in which they gave people various cars. One family got a Ford, another a Chevrolet, but what they all had in common was that in each area, these cars spoke to each other. The goal was to have the cars warn the drivers about relevant information that can prevent accidents, and it worked. What did the car companies do after this experiment? They began to install the technology in their cars. "Another area I think is critical is the autonomous cars. I developed a relationship with Uber, which asked me to do work for them. I drove to Pittsburgh last year, where Uber tested the autonomous car. I met with a guy at least 30 years old, but who was probably one of the smartest people I ever met in my life. I asked him when this autonomous car would be on the road, and he answered, 'In five years.' This means that we'll all be part of it. Autonomous cars are becoming an important matter. Google is investing a lot of money in it, and so are Apple and Uber, because they know it's the future, that it's what people want. We'll see if this is right."

The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye‘s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Intel’s involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1 billion purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country’s history. He said he’s been assured that the company’s operations will stay in Israel. “The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is turning into a global technology center,” he said. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel’s autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel, supporting both companies’ existing production programs and building on relationships with automakers, Tier-1 parts suppliers and semiconductor partners, the companies said.

The results from a new Intel benchmarking study show comparable performance for Hadoop when running in a bare-metal environment or in a containerized environment using the BlueData EPIC™ software platform. This study proves that it is possible to deliver the benefits of containerization for Big Data workloads without paying a penalty in performance. This groundbreaking benchmarking milestone was the result of ongoing collaboration between the Intel and BlueData software engineering teams. The detailed results, methodology, and specific Hadoop software and Intel hardware configurations for the benchmarking are described in this new white paper: Bare-metal performance for Big Data workloads on Docker* containers. Intel Xeon® processor architecture provides a high-performance, security-enabled, and robust foundation for Big Data analytics. Leveraging the power of Docker containers, the BlueData EPIC software platform makes it easier, faster, and more cost-effective to deploy Big Data infrastructure and applications -- including Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, and more -- whether on-premises, in the public cloud, or in a hybrid architecture. Working closely with BlueData, Intel ran systematic performance comparisons using the BigBench benchmark kit for on-premises test environments on Intel Xeon processors: Apples-to-apples comparison: The Intel team evaluated and benchmarked identical configurations for a bare-metal environment versus a containerized environment using BlueData EPIC. Both test environments used the same hardware and were configured using the same Hadoop software - benchmarked at 10, 20, and 50 Hadoop compute nodes with 10 terabytes of data in HDFS. The Big Data workloads in both test environments were deployed on the Intel Xeon processor E5-2699 v3, which help reduce network latency, improve infrastructure security, and minimize power inefficiencies. Both test environments also used Intel Solid-State Drives to optimize the execution environment at the system level. Ground-breaking performance results: The results from this in-depth benchmarking study show performance for containerized Hadoop on BlueData EPIC to be comparable to the performance for bare-metal Hadoop. In fact, in some cases, the containerized environment achieved superior performance to the bare-metal environment. For example, the BlueData EPIC platform demonstrated an average 2.33%* performance gain versus bare-metal across three test runs for 50 Hadoop compute nodes and 10 terabytes of data in HDFS. This performance boost is due to BlueData EPIC's proprietary IOBoost™ technology, which enhances input/output (I/O) performance using asynchronous storage I/O and data caching. Industry-standard benchmark with real-world use cases: BigBench is an industry-standard benchmark to measure the performance of Big Data analytics frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem, including MapReduce, Hive, and Spark MLlib. This benchmark provides a realistic measurement and comparison of performance by implementing 30 queries that simulate Big Data processing, analytics, and reporting in real-world use cases. The BigBench data model includes structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data; it covers a range of essential functional and business aspects for Big Data use cases. No modifications to the Hadoop software: BlueData EPIC allows enterprises to deploy Big Data frameworks and distributions unmodified, running in Docker containers. The use of Docker is completely transparent, but BlueData customers benefit from the agility, flexibility, and efficiency advantages of containers. For this benchmarking study, both the bare-metal and containerized test environments used the same open source Hadoop distribution with no modifications. Because BlueData runs Hadoop distributions and other Big Data frameworks completely unmodified, these performance results also apply to other Hadoop distributions as well as other Big Data frameworks such as Spark standalone. Collaboration with Intel: In August 2015, Intel and BlueData embarked on a strategic technology and business collaboration agreement. One of the goals was to ensure optimal performance for BlueData EPIC running on Intel Xeon processors. The outstanding results for BlueData EPIC in this benchmarking study were due in part to the ongoing engineering collaboration between Intel and BlueData to investigate, benchmark, test, and continuously improve the software platform. Working together, BlueData and Intel have shown that the performance for Hadoop in a containerized environment (using the BlueData EPIC software platform) is on par with the identical set-up on bare-metal. "Intel has been great in helping us to optimize and enhance the BlueData EPIC software platform, putting it through its paces to get the best possible performance," said Kumar Sreekanti, co-founder and CEO at BlueData. "Together, we've shown that you can achieve the same performance -- or even better -- for Big Data workloads running on our container-based platform. The results are a testament to the collaboration between our teams." Intel's collaboration, performance testing, and feedback helped BlueData make ongoing software enhancements to ensure high-performance Big Data deployments. The collaboration resulted in an unprecedented performance milestone for Big Data workloads running in Docker containers. With this breakthrough, BlueData and Intel can enable enterprises to take advantage of containerization to simplify and accelerate their on-premises Big Data implementations -- while ensuring the best possible performance. And with BlueData, these customers can run Big Data analytics using the same Docker-based application images for both on-premises and public cloud deployments -- leveraging the inherent infrastructure portability of containers. "BlueData delivers greater simplicity, agility, and cost-efficiency for Big Data deployments," said Michael Greene, vice president and general manager of System Technologies and Optimization in the Software and Services Group, Intel Corporation. "Now, working together, we've demonstrated that you can achieve these benefits while also ensuring performance that's comparable to bare-metal Big Data implementations." BlueData is highlighting these performance results and demonstrating the BlueData EPIC software platform running on Intel Xeon processors at the Strata + Hadoop World event in San Jose this week (at booth #1415). BlueData's co-founder and chief architect, Thomas Phelan, will be presenting "Benchmarking Performance for Hadoop on Docker Containers versus Bare-Metal" in the Intel booth (#917) at the event on Thursday March 16th at 10:45am.

The results from a new Intel benchmarking study show comparable performance for Hadoop when running in a bare-metal environment or in a containerized environment using the BlueData EPIC™ software platform. This study proves that it is possible to deliver the benefits of containerization for Big Data workloads without paying a penalty in performance. This groundbreaking benchmarking milestone was the result of ongoing collaboration between the Intel and BlueData software engineering teams. The detailed results, methodology, and specific Hadoop software and Intel hardware configurations for the benchmarking are described in this new white paper: Bare-metal performance for Big Data workloads on Docker* containers. Intel Xeon® processor architecture provides a high-performance, security-enabled, and robust foundation for Big Data analytics. Leveraging the power of Docker containers, the BlueData EPIC software platform makes it easier, faster, and more cost-effective to deploy Big Data infrastructure and applications -- including Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, and more -- whether on-premises, in the public cloud, or in a hybrid architecture. Working closely with BlueData, Intel ran systematic performance comparisons using the BigBench benchmark kit for on-premises test environments on Intel Xeon processors: Apples-to-apples comparison: The Intel team evaluated and benchmarked identical configurations for a bare-metal environment versus a containerized environment using BlueData EPIC. Both test environments used the same hardware and were configured using the same Hadoop software - benchmarked at 10, 20, and 50 Hadoop compute nodes with 10 terabytes of data in HDFS. The Big Data workloads in both test environments were deployed on the Intel Xeon processor E5-2699 v3, which help reduce network latency, improve infrastructure security, and minimize power inefficiencies. Both test environments also used Intel Solid-State Drives to optimize the execution environment at the system level. Ground-breaking performance results: The results from this in-depth benchmarking study show performance for containerized Hadoop on BlueData EPIC to be comparable to the performance for bare-metal Hadoop. In fact, in some cases, the containerized environment achieved superior performance to the bare-metal environment. For example, the BlueData EPIC platform demonstrated an average 2.33%* performance gain versus bare-metal across three test runs for 50 Hadoop compute nodes and 10 terabytes of data in HDFS. This performance boost is due to BlueData EPIC's proprietary IOBoost™ technology, which enhances input/output (I/O) performance using asynchronous storage I/O and data caching. Industry-standard benchmark with real-world use cases: BigBench is an industry-standard benchmark to measure the performance of Big Data analytics frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem, including MapReduce, Hive, and Spark MLlib. This benchmark provides a realistic measurement and comparison of performance by implementing 30 queries that simulate Big Data processing, analytics, and reporting in real-world use cases. The BigBench data model includes structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data; it covers a range of essential functional and business aspects for Big Data use cases. No modifications to the Hadoop software: BlueData EPIC allows enterprises to deploy Big Data frameworks and distributions unmodified, running in Docker containers. The use of Docker is completely transparent, but BlueData customers benefit from the agility, flexibility, and efficiency advantages of containers. For this benchmarking study, both the bare-metal and containerized test environments used the same open source Hadoop distribution with no modifications. Because BlueData runs Hadoop distributions and other Big Data frameworks completely unmodified, these performance results also apply to other Hadoop distributions as well as other Big Data frameworks such as Spark standalone. Collaboration with Intel: In August 2015, Intel and BlueData embarked on a strategic technology and business collaboration agreement. One of the goals was to ensure optimal performance for BlueData EPIC running on Intel Xeon processors. The outstanding results for BlueData EPIC in this benchmarking study were due in part to the ongoing engineering collaboration between Intel and BlueData to investigate, benchmark, test, and continuously improve the software platform. Working together, BlueData and Intel have shown that the performance for Hadoop in a containerized environment (using the BlueData EPIC software platform) is on par with the identical set-up on bare-metal.

Snap – Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage on Snap with an "underweight" rating, saying it finds Snap's valuation rich under most scenarios and that its model with marketers is unproven. Netflix – Jefferies upgraded the streaming service to "hold" from "underperform," citing larger-than-expected growth opportunities in both Germany and India. Hostess Brands — The maker of Twinkies and other snack foods reported adjusted quarterly profit of 14 cents per share, one cent a share below estimates. Revenue did beat forecasts, however, in the company's first report since it came back to life as a public company. Gap – Gap named former Gymboree CEO Mark Breitbard as chief executive of its Banana Republic unit. Breitbard will join the apparel retailer in early May. Microsoft – Microsoft named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman to its board of directors, effective immediately. Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26.2 billion late last year. Yahoo – Yahoo's data breaches in recent years are reportedly the subject of new charges to be unveiled at a news conference later today. Sources told multiple news outlets that some of the alleged hackers have ties to the Russian government. Apple – Apple's price target was raised to $155 per share from $140 at RBC Capital, which rates the stock "outperform." RBC cites a number of catalysts, including the anticipated introduction of the iPhone 8 later this year and the increasing growth of Apple's services business. Monsanto – Monsanto employees are accused of ghostwriting reports that U.S. regulators used in determining that Monsanto weed killer "Roundup" did not cause cancer. The accusations come from farmers and others who are suing the agricultural chemical maker. FTD Companies – FTD reported earnings and revenue were slightly below estimates, in the flower and gift seller's first report since John Walden was named CEO two weeks ago. Walden said the company has recently performed below potential but has various assets to build upon. CSX – The railroad operator was upgraded to "overweight" from "neutral" at Atlantic Equities, which said the full upside of having veteran railroad executive Hunter Harrison as CEO has yet to be priced into the stock.

PHOTO: TAGHEUER Swiss watch manufacturer TAG Heuer in collaboration with Intel and Google has launched its latest Android smartwatch called the Connected Modular 45. The Modular 45 is TAG Heuer’s second installment in Android wearables following its ‘Connected’ smartwatch which was launched last year. The watch manufacturer has, however, taken a new approach with its latest product as the Modular 45 now comes with interchangeable parts making it a lot more versatile than its predecessor. The ‘Connected’ module features a 1.39-inch AMOLED touchscreen display covered in 2.5mm sapphire crystal glass and a titanium casing. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z34XX processor, 4GB of memory, WiFi, GPS, more than 24 hours of battery life and water resistance up to 50 meters. Tag Heuer, Intel to challenge Apple with Android smartwatch The smartwatch also comes with Android Wear 2.0, which means better navigation, NFC support and a standalone app store, so you can use it with an iPhone as well. The latest smartwatch by TAG Heuer is also the “first Swiss-made connected watch” which gives users the option to switch the 45mm Connected module with a purely Swiss-made mechanical option that transforms it into an ‘ordinary’ luxury timepiece. TAG Heuer currently offers two options that are the Calibre 5 and the much more premium Heuer 02T Tourbillon, which the company claims has “the most accurate mechanical movements around.” This also means that users will still be able to have a high-end TAG Heuer wrist watch even if the ‘Connected’ module gets outdated. Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer unveils smartwatch running Android In addition to this, users also have the option to swap straps, buckles and lugs on the new smartwatch. The core Connected Modular 45 range consists of 11 different designs; the watch module comes in either silver or black, while the straps are available in rubber, leather, titanium or ceramicand in a slew of different colors. TAG Heuer also offers 45 additional options, which include premium materials like patent leather, rose gold and even diamonds. That amounts to a grand total of 56 different designs and, according to the company, over 500 different design combinations. TAG Heuer’s Connected Module 45 will set you back $1,650 for the base model, which some might thing is high for a smartwatch, however interchangeable parts also mean that users can get a full luxury watch as well at a discounted price.

AP / Carlos Osorio Exclusive Intel buying Mobileye in biggest ever deal in Israeli high-tech Who rakes in billions from Intel's $15b Mobileye buy? Without a car to its name, Israel emerges as auto tech superpower Of course, the Mobileye deal should make every Israeli proud. It’s like one of our own coming home with an Olympic gold or an Oscar for best foreign film. And even though Mobileye’s enormous success is the work of a few hundred people, just as an Olympic Gold or an Oscar is the work of one person, we can’t help but bask in the glory. And in the case of Mobileye, we can take some deserved satisfaction knowing that the government wants to use its $1 billion slice to pay for tax cuts for the rest of us. But there’s a much bigger good to all this than national morale and a few extra shekels in our paychecks. Mobileye is Exhibit No. 1 for the case that Israel’s technology prowess runs deep and that its impact stretches far beyond the realm of the next cool gadget. Not a one-trick pony There was a time when Israel’s early successes in high-tech were discounted as one-time wonders. Back then in the ‘90s the tech sector was just taking off on the back of the internet revolution, telecommunications deregulation and the Bug-2000 hysteria, all of which provided unprecedented opportunities for Israel’s proven experience in information technology. When those revolutions ran their course, it would all be over, many said. It hasn’t worked that way at all. All the world is going digital as artificial intelligence and big data invade one industry and one market after another and fundamentally change their dynamics. Mobileye is the latest example. The automobile industry − an old-economy industry if there ever was one − is being upended by the rapid move to driverless cars. Never mind pistons, learn coding Israel never had an automobile industry to speak of, but in the brave new world of autonomous driving, you don’t need expertise on what goes on under the hood, you need to know how to work with algorithms. That change involves more than cars. Everything from retailing and sports to insurance, banking, medicine and law is undergoing the same kind of revolution, and in almost every area there’s a handful of Israeli startups − some of which will grow up to be the next Mobileye. That’s the good, but there’s the bad, too. Ten years from now, when you’re tooling around in your car (or actually, being tooled around by your car), it will be Intel inside – not Mobileye. The $15.3 billion price tag Intel put on Mobileye is a lot of money, but Intel wouldn’t be paying it without being confident its investment will earn it a lot more over the years. Intel will be the one that owns the patents and makes and sells the chips − earning profits while employing many thousands and spreading those benefits throughout the U.S. economy. Coincidentally, the day the Intel-Mobileye deal was announced, Israel's Science, Technology and Space Ministry released a poll of which Israeli inventions over the last 70 years Israelis think were the most important. In order, they were the Iron Dome anti-missile system, the Waze navigation app, DiskonKey (the USB flash drive), the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, drip irrigation and microprocessors developed by Intel’s Israeli R&D team. Now look carefully at that list. Of those, two (DiskonKey, Waze) were bought by U.S. companies, and a third (Intel chips) was developed in Israel for a U.S. company. Only Iron Dome and Copaxone are actually produced in Israel. And therein lies a critical difference: Teva, the company that makes Copaxone, employs 6,860 people in Israel (and 57,000 worldwide); Mobileye, the day it agreed to be bought by Intel, employed 660. Mobileye will keep hiring in Israel even after it’s bought, but most of the jobs and all the profits created by Intel for its autonomous-car business will be elsewhere. If the Mobileye deal has its good and bad elements for Israel, for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement it’s nothing short of ugly. Whatever progress BDS has made on college campuses and in cooperative grocery stores was wiped out by a single giant deal. And it’s not just the billions of dollars involved but the fact that BDSers now face the unpleasant prospect of knowing that not just their laptops and smartphones are filled with Israeli technology, but in short order so will their cars. This is the movement’s problem: Israel technology is buried deep inside devices, or hosted on a network, or used by your provider. You might stand a chance at convincing consumers to boycott SodaStream, but they’re not going to boycott Amazon because it uses cloud computing technology from Israel, or Google because it bought Waze, or not buy an iPhone because its camera was developed by Israeli engineers. It’s worse than hopeless. Strangely enough, even as the Mobileye-Intel deal tells a totally different story, the government is obsessed by the supposedly growing threat from BDS. That seems more a function of the right’s insatiable lust for uncovering anti-Semitism and Israel hatred wherever it can find it. For the real facts, follow the money.

Projects that were finished and have seen no new developments are omitted. 1) $1.1 billion Posco project in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Licensed in 2006, the project aimed to build a steel plant on an area of 130 hectares. The plant is going to operate for 48 years, producing cold and hot rolled, as well as galvanized steel items. The first phase of the plant was completed in 2009 at a cost of $340 million and now has a total capacity of 700,000 tonnes per year. In September 2016, the Government Inspectorate requested the Chairman of Ba Ria-Vung Tau People’s Committee to review the licenses for four steel projects in the province because they are not included in the government’s master plan on steel development. The Posco project is one of these, besides the ones by Fuco Steel Corporation Ltd., Vina Kyoei Steel Co., Ltd., and China Steel Sumikin Vietnam Joint Stock Company. 2) $1 billion Intel project in Ho Chi Minh City Intel Corp first announced its $300-million investment for an assembly and test plant in Vietnam in 2006. The firm’s total registered investment was raised to $1 billion during the following year. The $1 billion plant in Ho Chi Minh City went into operation in 2010. In November 2014, the company expanded the plant with an additional CPU production line. At the beginning of 2016, there were some rumours that Intel Corporation’s operation in Ho Chi Minh City will be stopped. Instantly, the representative of Intel rejected this rumour. Nevertheless, Intel confirmed its plan of sharply cutting the number of staff from October 2016. 3) $6.2 billion Nghi Son Refinery in Thanh Hoa Invested by four companies, namely PetroVietnam, Kuwait Petroleum International, and Japanese companies Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsui Chemicals, the refinery was licensed in 2008. With an area of 400 hectares, the refinery produces LPG, Ron 92 and 95 fuels, diesel, fuel oil, jet fuel, polypropylene, para-xylene, benzene, and sulphur. The investors raised the capital by $2.8 billion in 2013 to make the refinery the biggest oil refinery and petrochemical project ever licensed in the country. It is scheduled to become operational in 2017 and reach its maximum annual capacity of 9.62 million cubic metres of petroleum products by 2018. At the end of 2016, the project was 94.4 per cent complete, behind schedule because the contractor had not achieved the deadline as specified in the EPC contract.  Besides, Nghi Son Refinery may not be eligible for the preferential selling price negotiated with PetroVietnam. The reason is that its products do not meet the Euro 4 standards and the water supply is neither clean nor enough. 4) $4.3 billion New City in Phu Yen The project, licensed in 2008, is an investment of the Brunei-based New City Properties Development. Occupying an area of 560 hectares, the project was supposed to include a resort, hotel, villas, bungalows, a cruise port, and various sea entertainment facilities. However, the project was coming along rather slowly. In September 2014, the People’s Committee of Phu Yen allowed the investor to reduce the project area to 357 hectares and the investment capital to $1 billion. Sun Rise Vietnam, a joint venture between South Korean companies Hyundai Telecom and Hwa Pyung Holding, now holds 70 per cent of the project. The remaining stakes are held by companies from China, the US, and Australia. In June 2015, New City Vietnam Ltd. held the project’s ground breaking ceremony. Local authorities expect the project to become a highlight of the province and a major tourist attraction. In the first quarter of 2017, the project is still being constructed, however, due to unfavourable weather conditions, it is behind schedule. 5) $4.2 billion Ho Tram project in Ba Ria-Vung Tau The Grand Ho Tram Strip Hotel was licensed in 2008 and is developed by Ho Tram Project Co., Ltd., majority owned by US fund Harbinger Capital Partners. The first phase of the five-star fully integrated resort opened in July 2013. This is the first resort in Vietnam with permission to operate a casino on its premises. In December 2015, Ho Tram Project Co., Ltd. signed an agreement with Vietnamese company CotecCons to erect condo towers on a 164-hectare area of the project site. In July 2016, the developer proposed the plan of a specialised airport to transport tourists to the complex and the Ba Ria-Vung Tau People’s Committee has agreed in principle to the construction of the airport in Loc An Commune. However, according to the 2020-2030 air transportation development plan approved by the Prime Minister, Ba Ria-Vung Tau will only have two airports (in Vung Tau and Con Dao), so the project will need to secure approval from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Transportation before the company can request the government to adjust this plan.  6) $2 billion Nhon Trach Berjaya Dong Nai New City in Dong Nai Licensed in 2009, the project is located on a 600-hectare site in Dong Nai Province, about 25 kilometres from downtown Ho Chi Minh City. It will house a theatre, cultural house, square, exhibition centre, museum, administrative quarter, and commercial and social facilities, such as offices, hotels, serviced apartments, food and beverage outlets, and entertainment spaces, a sports centre, hospital, and open green spaces. Developer Berjaya Land Bhd., a subsidiary of Berjaya Corporation Berhad, stated in October 2015 that the construction of the project will begin in 2016. 2016 has passed and the project is still idle, like a number of other Berjaya projects in Vietnam. Yet in October 2016, Berjaya met with the authorities of Danang, an attractive tourism city, to show interest in building a resort and shopping mall complex in the city centre. 7) $4 billion South Hoi An project in Quang Nam South Hoi An project, a complex including a residential and a commercial area, a resort, and various gaming facilities, was licensed in December 2010. VinaCapital and its closed-end fund VinaLand Limited planned to develop the project with Malaysian company Genting Berhad. However, in September 2012, Genting withdrew from the project, leaving VinaCapital to adjust the project plan in mid-2013, rescheduling the first phase to start operation by the end of 2015. In September 2015, VinaCapital announced its newfound partnership with Hong Kong company Chow Tai Fook in the project. VinaCapital continued to be the strategic shareholder. Now the first phase is set to start construction in 2016. Unfortunately, less than a year after the construction started, Chow Tai Fook chairman Henry Cheng took an abrupt leave due to unspecified illness, letting his heir Adrian take over the firm. At present, there is no information about the implications for the South Hoi An project. 8) $1 billion Kobelco steel plant in Nghe An Licensed in 2010, Japanese Kobe Steel’s plant was to operate at a capacity of 2 million tonnes per year. The raw material for steel production would be sourced from Thach Khe Iron Mine in Ha Tinh and the coal from Quang Ninh. As of October 2015, construction of the Kobelco steel plant had yet to start due to delays in the exploitation of Thach Khe Mine. According to a member of the People’s Committee of Nghe An Province, Kobe is working with Thach Khe Iron JSC, the owner of the mine, on a potential purchase of shares in the company. A VIR source commented that negotiations had been on-going for two years at the time and the two parties had yet to reach an agreement. At the beginning of 2017, some experts urged Ha Tinh to facilitate Thach Khe Mine. It is hoped that when the Thach Khe project is green-lighted by authorities, the Kobelco project will also be implemented. 9) $902.5 million Skybridge Dragon Sea resort project in Vung Tau Skybridge Dragon Sea MICE project, invested by US-based Skybridge Intercontinental Development Corporation, was Ba Ria-Vung Tau province’s largest project in terms of registered capital at the time of its licensing in 2010. The project had been delayed for years. The delay, according to Skybridge chairman cum CEO Michael Nguyen, was due to the overly high land rental fees in the past few years. According to Nguyen, the rent specified by the province’s Department of Finance rose from VND325 billion ($14.6 million) in 2010 to VND1.7 billion ($76.2 million) in 2012 when the company was to start construction. As of the end of 2016, the Ba Ria-Vung Tau authorities were looking for Michael Nguyen to officially revoke the project. 10) $2.26 billion Jaks Hai Duong thermal power plant The 25-year BOT 2x600 MW project by Malaysian company Jaks Resources Bhd. was licensed in 2011. Preliminary construction work on the project has already started, with the land clearance and boundary walls completed. In July 2015, Jaks Resources Bhd. inked agreements with China Power Engineering Consulting Group Co., Ltd. to jointly develop the plant through a 50:50 joint venture. The project’s construction was kicked off in March 27, 2016. Since then, there was no progress. By the end of 2016, the Hai Duong People’s Committee was trying to find ways to urge the developer to continue with the project but there is no new development as of now. 11) $1.2 billion Tokyu Binh Duong New City Licensed in 2012 and starting construction in the same year, Tokyu Binh Duong New City is a 1,000-hectare industry-service-urban complex in Binh Duong, invested by Becamex Tokyu Ltd.—a joint venture between Vietnamese company Becamex IDC Corporation and Japanese company Tokyu Corporation. The Binh Duong authorities estimated that the total investment into the complex is going to exceed VND150 trillion ($6.7 billion) by 2020. Many domestic and foreign investors have built high-rise buildings and carried out low-price commercial housing projects in the province, but sales fall below expectations. Over the two-year construction, SORA Gardens I, which consists of two 24-storey towers on an area of 10,000 square meters, was completed in 2015. In 2016, another city house and city garden house project, called Midori Park, was opened for sales in New City. Besides, the developers have also erected several convenient stores, transportation facilities, etc., to serve citizens in New City. 12) $574.8 million Bridgestone radial tyre manufacturing plant in Haiphong Licensed in 2012, the plant invested by Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone started operation in October 2014. Currently, the plant boasts a capacity of 6,000 tyres a day. As of January 2016, in a meeting with Haiphong authorities, leaders of the company talked about the prospects of expansion and about selling its products in Vietnam, instead of producing purely for export. At present, Bridestone has a range of dealers to distribute its products in Vietnam and has developed a range of Passenger Tire Care Service Centres in Hanoi, Haiphong, and Dongnai, among others. 13) $2.018 billion Vinh Tan 1 Thermal Power Plant in Binh Thuan Licensed in 2013, the BOT plant is an investment of a consortium of two Chinese companies and Vietnam National Coal-Mineral Industries Holding Corporation Ltd. (Vinacomin). The plant is part of Vinh Tan Thermal Power Complex, which consists of four projects with a total capacity of 5,600 MW. This is the country’s largest coal-fired thermal power plant. While Vinh Tan 1, 3, and 4 remain under construction, Vinh Tan thermal plant 2 has started operation in January 2014. The operation of the plant sparked strong opposition from residents in the surrounding area on account of potential pollution hazards. Due to strong coastal winds, Vinh Tan Thermal Plant 2 is obscured by fumes and dust, despite efforts to regularly irrigate the area, as required by local authorities. In April last year, thousands of people blockaded National Highway No. 1A, stopping traffic for hours to complain about coal dust and cinder from the power complex, especially the newly built Vinh Tan No 2. The Binh Thuan People's Committee urged the power complex management board to stop all executive work when wind speed reaches above level 8 (88 km per hour). At the end of 2016, Binh Thuan authorities stopped Vinh Tan 1 from pouring 1.5 million cubic metres of waste into the sea. As of January 2017, people living nearby still complained about the coal dust and cinder from the plant whenever wind blows heavily. 14) $1 billion Bus Industrial Center in Binh Dinh Russian investor Bus Industrial Center Ltd.’s project was licensed in 2013, with a view to build a factory to produce spare parts for buses and provide related services. Since licensed, the Russian project stood still and by April 2016, it was revoked. 15) $3 billion Samsung Thai Nguyen phase II In 2014, Samsung received the license to invest $3 billion in the second phase of Samsung Electronics Vietnam Thai Nguyen Plant (SEVT 2), raising the facility’s total investment capital to $6.5 billion. SEVT 2 was designed with a capacity of 10 million products per month and to employ 30,000 workers. The project is currently being built. 16) $1.4 billion Samsung CE Complex Ho Chi Minh City Licensed in October 2014, the construction of Samsung’s Ho Chi Minh City complex started in May 2015 on a 70-hectare area of Saigon Hi-Tech Park (SHTP). The complex is expected to come into operation in February 2016. SHTP has recently granted investment licences to several projects worth more than $120 million that will produce components for the complex. In December 2015, Samsung received the investment certificate to expand the project by $600 million, bringing the complex’s total investment value to $2 billion. Samsung will set up a research and development centre for audio-visual devices and provide warranty services at SHTP. Samsung’s complex in Ho Chi Minh City was put into operation in June 2016. 17) $2.018 billion Duyen Hai 2 thermal power plant in Tra Vinh Licensed in 2015 by Malaysian Janakuasa (Malaysia), the Duyen Hai 2 thermal power project is going to be built in a BOT format. The project has two turbines with a total capacity of 1,200 MW. Construction is going to start in the second quarter of 2016. The plant, which is expected to go on stream before 2020, will be one of the four thermal power plants in Duyen Hai Power Centre. The remaining plants, representing a $6 billion investment by Electricity of Vietnam Group (EVN), are Duyen Hai 1, Duyen Hai 3, and Duyen Hai 3 extension. Once completed, the power centre will contribute to the national power grid an additional capacity of 30 billion kWh annually. On August 3, 2016, the Malaysian investor broke ground for this project. 18) $1.2 billion Empire City in Ho Chi Minh City The developer is a joint venture of Tien Phuoc Real Estate JSC, Tran Thai Real Estate JSC, and UK-based Denver Power Ltd. a subsidiary of multinational financial company Gaw Capital Partners with the two Vietnamese companies contributing 50 per cent of the capital. Licensed in 2015, the project is expected to be completed in 2022. Occupying a 14.5-hectare area on the bank of the Saigon River, the project is going to include a trade centre, a five-star hotel, office space and apartments, and a multifunctional building of 86 floors. Construction started in October 2015, and by February 2017, the foundation for the first tower had been constructed. 19) $1 billion Cheng Loong Binh Duong packaging plant In December 2015, Taiwanese industrial paper producer Cheng Loong received the investment certificate to build its $1-billion packaging factory in the southern province of Binh Duong. The plant is going to be built on an 80-hectare land plot in Ascendas Protrade Singapore Tech Park and will have the capacity to push out one million tonnes of industrial paper and consumer paper products per year. Cheng Loong currently has 29 plants all around the world, providing supply packaging to big companies, such as Apple and Nike. The Vietnamese plant is Cheng Loong’s biggest ever, according to the company’s president Tsai Tong Ho. At the moment, the plant is being built. 20) $1 billion Samsung Display Bac Ninh project Licensed in 2014, Samsung Display project, which produces screens for mobile phones, started operation in March 2015. The project aims to supply the two Samsung plants in Bac Ninh and Thai Nguyen with screens and has a capacity of 48 million products per year. In August 2015, Samsung increased the project’s total investment volume by an additional $3 billion, to $4 billion. At the end of February 2017, Samsung affirmed the $2.5-billion expansion of the Samsung Display project in Bac Ninh. With this project, Samsung Display’s total investment in Vietnam is going to be $6.5 billion. 21) $2 billion Nghi Son 2 Thermal Power project in Thanh Hoa Nghi Son 2 was the first international tender for a large-scale coal-fired power plant in Vietnam. The project is going to be carried out under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) format. The $2-billion plant will be located in the province’s Nghi Son Economic Zone. It will have a capacity of 1,200 MW, produced by two 600 MW units.  In November 2016, the consortium of Japanese company Marubeni Corporation and Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) signed with the Ministry of Industry and Trade the investment agreement for the project. As of the end of 2016, the consortium was awaiting the investment certificate and was arranging the finances for the project. Though the ground-breaking ceremony was held in September 2015, the project has yet to secure a range of agreements to complete the BOT contract package.  22) $1.5 billion LG Display project in Hai Phong The project of South Korean LG Display to produce organic light emitting diode (OLED) display products is located in Trang Due Industrial Zone (Hai Phong), covering an area of 40 hectares. LG Display received the investment certificate for this project at the end of April 2016. Construction started in May 2016, and the plant is expected to start operation in the middle of 2017. Only 20 per cent of the products would serve domestic consumption. 23) $3.5 billion Vietnam International University Township project in Ho Chi Minh City Having received its investment certificate in July 2008, Berjaya’s project is going to have 20 schools and universities, as well as a multi-purpose complex on an area of 925 hectares. However, almost ten years since then, the project is still a field of grass. Therefore, in 2016, the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee has requested the city’s Department of Planning and Investment to review Berjaya’s project. It is likely that this project will be revoked if Berjaya keeps delaying.

By admin in Uncategorized March 15, 2017 Junko Yoshida, EETimes 3/15/2017 00:01 AM EDT PARIS — Intel’s Mobileye acquisition Monday has stirred mixed emotions and contrasting reviews among those who cover the industry. Excitement, puzzlement, surprise, fear, confidence and some disappointment. One of the most scathing comments came from Semiconductor Advisors LLC, financial and strategic advisory services: Even though Intel tried to suggest a strong link to Intel’s data center business we find little to no synergy as there is no direct uplift of the data center business. This suggests that Intel is taking a leap of faith to go very far outside its core business franchise.

Israeli media reported that the deal, worth approximately US$15.3 billion, was the largest-ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to US$70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real time camera systems, used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. DATA CENTRES ON WHEELS Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry”. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. “As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels,” the statement said. “Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity.” Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country’s high-tech sector — an industry that has given it the nickname the “start-up nation”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with Aviram to congratulate him, a statement from the premier’s office said. “The deal dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is being realised,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is becoming a global technology centre not only in the field of cyber but also the automotive field.” Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio that “what’s important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located”. The centre for work on the combined autonomous vehicle will be Mobileye’s headquarters in Jerusalem, the firms said. Aviram told Netanyahu that a global development centre will be established in Israel and “will be responsible all the international activity of Intel’s autonomous cars”, the statement from the premier’s office said. Intel has long operated in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $US6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

By Gwen Ackerman. Added by Agency Staff on 15 March 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: Benjamin Netanyahu, Eli Groner, Intel, Mobileye, Qualcomm Tweet Mobileye technologies … Intel is buying the Israeli company for $15bn Israel’s emergence as a centre for automotive technology got a vote of confidence on Monday when Intel said it would pay US$15bn for Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based maker of chips and software for driverless cars. It will be the largest takeover of an Israeli tech firm and follows a series of deals and partnerships inked in recent years by major tech and auto companies. “The deal proves in a dramatic manner that our vision is coming true. Israel is becoming a global technology centre, not only in cyber, but also in the automotive area,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a text message. Israel had already singled out the automotive technology sector as a possible economic boon, allotting it 250m shekels (R900) for the next five years. At least five major car manufacturers have made investments in Israel. Ford bought computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS in August and BMW invested in transit app Moovit in 2015. Daimler and General Motors have also opened research and development centers in the country. The Mobileye deal went far beyond the US$4,7bn sale of fibre-optic company Chromatis Networks to Lucent Technologies in 2000, which was the country’s biggest tech deal before Mobileye. Founders Ziv Aviram, who is also the CEO, and chairman Amnon Shashua, will share just under $1bn from the sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 31 December. Shmuel Harlap, the largest shareholder, will make $1bn, according to Bloomberg data as of 1 April 2016. Netanyahu’s director-general Eli Groner said the autonomous tech sector could potentially boost economic growth by 50%. Israel is not renowned for its car-making industry, once turning out fibreglass-shelled cars that were briefly popular in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the country is now benefiting from the car industry’s increasing focus on software rather than hardware. In Israel, the automotive technology sector currently counts about 350 start-ups, according to industry monitor IVC Research Centre, with the potential, according to Gruner, to grow bigger than the cybersecurity industry, which drew 15% of global capital raised by the sector in 2016, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a group that promotes Israel start-ups. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Argus Cyber Security, based in Tel Aviv, in January announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies to protect cars from hackers. Otonomo Technologies, a data platform that tells users when to stop driving due to a malfunction and can call emergency services when there is an accident, is working with nine car manufacturers, including Daimler. Aquarius Engines, which has designed and developed an engine to generate electric power, is working with Peugeot SA and three other automobile companies. Gal Fridman, chairman and chief marketing officer of Aquarius Engines, said the deal “definitely makes our lives easier”. “It validates Israel’s ability in technology in the automotive industry, traditionally American and German and not at all Israeli,” Fridman said. “Mobileye has dramatically helped us open the door wider into this industry.” Growing pains The autonomous sector is expanding even as Israel’s tech sector suffers from growing pains. Although the country’s tech industry grew faster than GDP nearly every year between 1998 to 2009, in the five years following it surpassed national growth only once, in 2012. The finance ministry acknowledged in a report last year that the industry that fueled Israel’s economy for the past two decades was stagnating. Mobileye has also had its issues. Last year, Elon Musk’s electric car maker Tesla stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the break-up. After the Mobileye acquisition was announced, Netanyahu and finance minister Moshe Kahlon, who have been reducing corporate taxes, announced they would consider further cuts. “We view this deal as an indication that the more attractive Israel is for foreign investors, the more tax revenue we will generate,” Groner said in a phone interview. Tax breaks are already part of the government’s programme to encourage global technology companies to do more research and development in Israel as other countries vie for companies like Intel to put down roots on their soil. “The deal will increase the attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next-generation autonomous driving technology start-ups,” said Jon Medved, founder of OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform based in Jerusalem.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 28DStv mulling streaming-only option 9Grants fiasco underscores SA leadership crisis 9Mteto Nyati quits MTN for Altron top job 9Uber: heading for a crash 8ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Most of those answers, however, won’t be terribly favorable opinions regarding the deal. Source: Shutterstock Either the iconic chipmaker overpaid for Mobileye shares, or Intel has no business leaving its comfort zone (CPUs and chipsets), or both. Besides, long-term INTC owners know the company doesn’t have the best track record when it comes to making acquisitions. There’s a certain “crazy like a fox” quality to this purchase, though. Intel stock holders may want to take a step back and look at the same long-term picture CEO Brian Krzanich is seeing. Not Optimistic On Monday, tech-giant Intel announced it was acquiring Mobileye — the maker of the “eyes” used by self-driving and auto-braking automobiles — for $63.54 per share of MBLY, or $15.3 billion in all. That’s a 45% premium to Friday’s closing trade! But perhaps more concerning is that at $15.3 billion, Intel will be paying 42.7 times last year’s sales and 141.7 times 2016’s income from Mobileye. Both are on the order of ten times the norm. Analysts were mixed on the matter, although a few were particularly optimistic. Perhaps the most bullish view came from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who explained: “Intel is seeking relevance in automotive with the Mobileye acquisition in a market that is moving at a faster-than-expected pace. The acquisition is in line with the Altera acquisition in that it is defensive in nature and meant to defend Intel’s historical CPU (central processing unit) incumbency from various accelerator technologies.” At the more pessimistic end of the scale, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry opined: “Basically, Intel has now inherited Mobileye’s problems, and we don’t think Intel has the capacity to fix Mobileye’s issues.” All those views may be too short-sighted, however. What Intel Sees in Mobileye Krzanich justified the decision to INTC shareholders by saying: “It’s important now, because if you take a look at what you’re doing – talking about car models in 2020, 2021 – and so we need to get in there. We need to get this platform developed, brought to them, and have that confidence so that we can really influence the real start of autonomous driving in that time frame.” He’s right, in all ways. He’s right in the sense that although self-driving cars aren’t exactly new, the market isn’t gelled yet — there’s room for new players to step up and shape what the future of autonomous driving looks like. Better for Intel to shape it on its terms then end up chasing the lead pace set by the likes of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He’s also right in the sense that by 2020/2021, the landscape of the self-driving car market is going to look radically different. Not only will the market leaders be well-entrenched by then, there’s going to massive growth in the number of autonomous cars on the road by that time. How massive? BCG recently crunched some numbers, concluding that by 2035 annual sales of fully autonomous vehicles will reach 12 million. Annual sales of partially-autonomous cars will rise to 18 million by that point. Investors won’t have to wait that long to see big-time growth, though. BCG thinks the market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, and grow to $77 billion by 2035. At the end of the timeframe, roughly a fourth of all new cars sold will offer autonomous driving features.

By: Reuters | San Francisco | Updated: March 15, 2017 11:14 am Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management, which feeds data about a vehicle’s surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. To understand Intel’s $15.3 billion proposed acquisition of Israel’s Mobileye, imagine the data created and compiled by a self-driving car scanning the road and objects around it as a potential source of revenue. That data, says Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology. Self-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centers, or better city planning based on data. Watch all our videos from Express Technology “Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal. To be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun. Still, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start. “That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters. “When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.” Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle’s surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen , which mean those carmakers’ vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue. Intel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany’s automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye’s REM. Given there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has “significant early mover advantage” in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month. “This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable,” Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters. Needham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies. Playing Catch-Up? Given the expense and complicated nature of autonomous driving systems, most carmakers rely heavily on suppliers like Mobileye for key technology. Tesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye’s camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers. Traditional suppliers like Germany’s Continental or Sweden’s AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play “catch-up” to Intel, said Evercore’s Chris McNally in a note. One issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right. While drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year. Some data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. “Every autonomous car out there shouldn’t have to find the same pothole and log it,” she wrote.

Benchmarking new hardware is part of the fun. But when that hardware happens to be a brand new CPU, which isn't from the same family of CPUs that have enjoyed years and years of optimisations and familiarity with developers and operating systems, things can get tricky. While there's a lot to like about the Ryzen 7 series of octa-core CPUs, there's also been a quietly understood reality that Ryzen's full performance will take some time to bear. Developers have been making games on Intel hardware for a long time. Intel's CPUs have had a lot more optimisations and affinity with Windows 10 than Ryzen has. And that affects the end results. In a post on their community site, AMD's Robert Hallock outlined a discovery with F1 2016 that saw the average FPS of a Ryzen 7 1800X increase (sometimes, quite noticeably). Image: AMD Now you have to take the above graph with a slight grain of salt. AMD's trying to make the point that your system setup matters, which it does. But when you have effectively six different sets of settings - overclocked, not overclocked, different memory timings, HPET enabled, a different power profile for Windows 10 selected - it can be a little misleading. But, that's not the curious part. Here's Hallock talking about F1 2016. "Throughout this process we also discovered that F1 2016 generates a CPU topology map (hardware_settings_config.xml) when the game is installed. This file tells the game how many cores and threads the system’s processor supports," Hallock wrote. The problem: the topology map is stored in the Steam Cloud, not on the player's hard drive. "This settings file is stored in the Steam Cloud and appears to get resynced on any PC that installs F1 2016 from the same Steam account. Therefore: if a user had a 4-core processor without SMT, then reused that same game install on a new AMD Ryzen™ PC, the game would re-sync with the cloud and believe the new system is also the same old quad core CPU." After editing the file directly to force F1 2016 to treat the Ryzen machine as an 8-core, 16-thread system (instead of the game thinking it was a 16-core CPU, courtesy of the freshly created topology map), the average FPS (1080p, High preset, clear weather, no anti-aliasing) jumped by almost 3%. The process shows why you should always test things on a fresh install, if possible. And it raises a real problem: how many other games automatically build a topology map and store that information in the Steam Cloud - rather than on the users' hard drive - and what other games and benchmarks are affected? F1 2016 isn't the only title that builds a profile of a computer's CPU. A quick search of my local settings folder found that every recent Codemasters game has an XML configuration file with settings for the amount of cores, hyperthreading and settings for that computer. Shots of the XML files from F1 2016 and DiRT 3 There were also CPU settings in XML files for other games - TERA, Dragon Age: Origins, Remember Me, as well as Mass Effect 2 and 3 - that specified the amount of cores the CPU had. It's not known whether those settings were downloaded from Steam (or Origin, in ME3's case), whether the information is overridden if the game detects a change in hardware (or whether graphics/profile settings are reset) and whether changing that setting would have an impact on performance for Ryzen CPUs. But at a minimum, AMD has shown that you can get a performance bump from Codemasters games (DiRT Rally and the F1 series; I don't think anyone is really anticipating any FPS issues with the upcoming Micro Machines). I've asked their local team whether AMD is aware of other games that store CPU settings in the cloud, and whether those settings are correctly identifying the number of cores on Ryzen CPUs. They didn't respond at the time of writing, but if more info comes out I'll let you know. Comments James @jamesh Mar 15, 2017, 7:32pm Wouldn't it involve more code to write out the CPU core count and topology to a file and read it back at start up than it would to just ask the CPU each time the game starts up? That seems bizarre. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion! Cancel Reply Log In / Sign Up Name Email You are starting a new discussion.

Junko Yoshida 3/15/2017 00:01 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet PARIS -- Intel’s Mobileye acquisition Monday has stirred mixed emotions and contrasting reviews among those who cover the industry. Excitement, puzzlement, surprise, fear, confidence and some disappointment. One of the most scathing comments came from Semiconductor Advisors LLC, financial and strategic advisory services: Even though Intel tried to suggest a strong link to Intel's data center business we find little to no synergy as there is no direct uplift of the data center business.   This suggests that Intel is taking a leap of faith to go very far outside its core business franchise.  This can also be viewed as an admission that the core Semi business is not likely getting significantly better any time soon and that the company needs something new to jumpstart growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Clearly, those at Semiconductor Advisors aren’t buying Intel CEO Brian Krzanich’s argument. Krzanich reportedly told shareholders at last month’s investor day that the “traditional market view” of Intel as a Silicon Valley giant making chips for PCs and servers is “wrong.” Intel today, he said, sees itself as “a data company.” There are, of course, numerous tech analysts applauding Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye. While acknowledging that autonomous vehicles are still in their infancy, this school of observers believes this was the right decision at the right time. Smartphone lessons Most seasoned electronics industry veterans remember how badly Intel missed the smartphone market. Intel didn’t listen to customer demand and believed they could forcefeed the x86 architecture onto a market already dominated by ARM. The Mobileye buy, however, is different. Some die-hard Intel skeptics appear to be even optimistic, inferring that Intel might have learned its lesson as it prepares its plunge into the automotive market. Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research, shared his view in his research note: "Missing the boat in mobile has damaged Intel’s reputation…The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel highlights both Intel’s determination not to miss the next big trend as well as the concentration of Google’s competitors around HERE." He further noted, "In addition, other ecosystems such as Tencent, Baidu, Facebook and Amazon are also working with HERE for their location data, all of which will benefit Intel as it tries to break the mold that the market has set for it." Windsor said that Mobileye represents the second largest acquisition in Intel’s history. "It underlines the need for semiconductor companies to move into markets beyond consumer electronics and PCs. This is why Qualcomm is buying NXP and why Samsung is buying Harmon." Mobileye's dominance Technology/industry analysts who cover the automotive market see the Mobileye acquisition as Intel’s getting “a seat at the table,” as Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor of technology advisory Vision Systems Intelligence, said. Further, the deal will allow Intel “to be a one-stop-shop offering hardware and software solutions for infotainment and automated driving applications,” according to IHS Markit. The key to understanding Intel’s move is to know how powerful Mobileye has gotten over the last several years in the ADAS market.

I don't see a reduction in Intel commitment to silicon, even more they are now directly and in house involved in NAND production. I think analysts have done their time. Most of times they are wrong.

We Want to Change the World' Amnon Shashua defends the sale of the self-driving car technology firm to Intel as essential for the company’s growth. Eliran Rubin and Oren Dori Mar 15, 2017 9:58 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Amnon Shashua poses for a photograph at his office in Jerusalem, September 14, 2016. RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS Opinion Mobileye-Intel: The good, the bad and the ugly Who rakes in billions from Intel's $15b Mobileye buy? Without a car to its name, Israel emerges as auto tech superpower “I want to say something a little unusual: It’s not the money. What we want to is to change the world. And the tie-up with Intel ensures this,” Amnon Shashua, founder and chairman of Mobileye, said at a press conference Tuesday with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They came to celebrate a day after Intel agreed to pay $15.3 billion for Mobileye, the maker of self-driving car technology in the biggest high-tech merger and acquisitions deal in Israeli history. It was Intel’s second-biggest acquisition ever, Krzanich said. Asked why he consented to selling Mobileye when it was riding the crest of the autonomous-car wave, with a market cap of $10 billion and alliances with some of the world’s top auto makers, Shashua said he saw it as the only way for the company to keep growing. “Since we went public [in 2014], we’ve expanded into many areas – mapping different driving systems, and it all takes time,” he explained. “Under Intel there’s the infrastructure and the resources that we don’t have. If we want to change the world and to be a key player, we have to think in terms of a complete industry, not just a product – and that’s the reason for the merger.” Netanyahu opened the press conference by calling the sale a red letter day for the Israeli economy and in particular for Jerusalem, where Mobileye has its headquarters. “Israel has quickly become an advanced technology power. That’s not by chance. It’s a vision we have been advancing, which is a combination of a free economy and advanced technology. Of course, without the brains we have we wouldn’t have gotten far, but without a free market and with an insufferable bureaucracy, we wouldn’t have gotten anywhere,” Netanyahu said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (L), Mobileye CTO Amnon Shahua and Klaus Froehlich, member of BMW board, view BMWi Inside Future concept car in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 4, 2017.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Mobileye sale eased way for tax cuts Hand in hand with the Mobileye-Intel announcement, Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon had said on Monday they also planned another round of reductions in the personal and corporate income tax and value-added tax. Sources said that one of the factors in moving ahead with the plan earlier than they had first envisioned was the $1 billion tax windfall the government expects to earn from the Mobileye sale. Many economists and Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug have urged caution. Yesterday Netanyahu and Economy and Industry Minster Eli Cohen defended the move, saying it boosted economic growth and helped lure multinational companies to Israel. “Lowering taxes helps economic growth and growth gives us [tax money] for the budget. Every time I lower tax rates, I get more growth,” the prime minister said. “I’m glad that giant companies are coming to Israel and I think that if Israel’s macroeconomic policies were not as good, I’m not sure we would see them operating here.” The prime minister said Israel was giving the same priority to automotive technology that it was giving to cyber-security, where it has invested considerable money and resources, including sponsoring a cyber-security tech center in Be’er Sheba. The celebrations of Israeli high-tech, however, have been shadowed by the hard line that the Transportation Ministry is taking against ride-sharing services, like Uber. Last week TheMarker reported that officials were weighing starting criminal proceedings against the American company for violating regulations of driving for profit with its Uber Night service. In response, Netanyahu said he would discuss the matter with Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz. “I will do everything I can to solve regulatory issues so that Israel leads the world in the autonomous-driving revolution,” he said. In a meeting with Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram and Intel Israel chief Yaniv Garty, Katz said all cars imported to Israel starting next January would have to have systems that alert drivers they are too close to another vehicle or have veered out of their lane. Katz said he would sign the order, which is expected to give a boost to Mobileye, which In addition to its self-driving technology also makes anti-collision systems and works with all of Israel’s car importers. Even today, 54 percent of all imported cars feature the technology because of tax breaks offered on it, Transportation Ministry director general Keren Turner told a news conference.

Pondering post-PC life, Intel dabbles in drones with $1,099 quadcopter Intel is now selling the Aero Ready to Fly drone, which is pre-assembled and comes with a RealSense 3D camera Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 17 February, 2017 06:41 0 - - - - print email Intel has made a name for itself in PCs and servers but is now dabbling in a new product category with its first-ever quadcopter now on sale. The chipmaker's US$1,099 Aero Ready to Fly Drone comes fully assembled, with an integrated flight controller. It also comes with a remote control receiver and transmitter. The drone has cool features like auto-pilot, with the ability to self-navigate by coordinating GPS and recognizing surroundings to avoid collisions. It has a 3D RealSense depth camera that can recognize objects and take rough measurements. The Aero drone has a carbon fiber frame, electronic speed controllers, motors, and propellers. It has a range of sensors including an altimeter and magnetometer. For all its cool features, it doesn't come with a battery pack. Intel recommends buying a specific type of high-capacity lithium-polymer, and details can be found on Intel's website. Intel has been chasing the drone market aggressively, and it has been putting on aerial shows including one choreographed for the Superbowl. The company put 300 drones in the air, and they changing colors and drew up images in the sky. The drones make coordinated movements, and algorithms helped draw up a flight path and the in-air animations. The Aero Ready to Fly Drone is similar to the one already flying in Intel's shows. It's also reprogrammable -- computer vision applications can be coded into the drone. Some drone users just want something to develop their apps on, which is where the Aero Ready to Fly Drone fits in, an Intel spokesman said. A comparable drone is DJI's Phantom 4, which sells for $1,199. Like Intel's drone, it has a 3D camera to visualize the flight and has obstacle-tracking sensors to avoid crashes. It has a 28-minute flight time. Intel already sells a $399 Aero Development Kit, which is aimed at people who want to program and build a drone from scratch. Users have to buy the RealSense camera, rotors, and other accessories separately. The Aero Ready to Fly drone is based on the company's Aero Compute Board, which has an Atom x7-Z8750 processor. Other specifications include 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and a USB 3.0 port. It also has a front-facing 8-megapixel camera and a downward-facing VGA camera which helps in smooth flight. It has an ARM-based microcontroller for autopilot features and a reprogrammable FPGA (field programmable gate array). It runs on an embedded Linux OS. Unfortunately, it won't ship to all countries. A list is available on Intel's website. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Intel is making a huge investment in autonomous driving. The chip giant on Monday announced plans to acquire Jerusalem-based self-driving technology firm Mobileye for $15 billion. The transaction is expected to close within the next nine months. Mobileye makes computer vision, machine learning, data analysts, and mapping technology for advanced driver assisted systems and autonomous driving. Intel said the acquisition will position it as a "leading technology partner for the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles." With Mobileye under its wing, Intel said it will be able to "accelerate innovation for the automotive industry." Intel sees huge moneymaking opportunities here. The company estimates the vehicle systems, data, and services market to reach $70 billion by 2030. Following the acquisition, Mobileye will combine with Intel's existing automated driving group. The team will be headquartered in Israel and led by Mobileye's Co-Founder, Chairman, and CTO Amnon Shashu. Related How Delphi, Mobileye Are Fast-Tracking Driverless Car Tech How Delphi, Mobileye Are Fast-Tracking Driverless Car Tech "This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement (PDF). "Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car's path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry's best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers." Intel said fully autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming "data centers on wheels," and estimated they will generate 4TB of data per day by 2020. The company said that the complexity and computing power of automated vehicles created big opportunities for its high-end processors and other technologies. Meanwhile, Intel and Mobileye already have one big-name customer: BMW. The companies in July 2016 announced they were teaming up to bring fully automated vehicle to market by 2021. AT CES this year, the companies announced that autonomous BMW 7 Series vehicles would be hitting roads in the US and Europe this year for testing.

The deal announced Monday is the latest in a series of big acquisitions for Intel, which have historically produced very little for the company. “There’s general acknowledgment within the executive team and the board at Intel that we haven’t done as well as we could do on past acquisitions,” Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, told Bloomberg in 2015. He said Intel is putting more work into planning how to integrate its acquisitions. And with its core PC market fading, Intel is under increasing pressure to continue diversifying into new technologies. That’s why it was willing to make the $15 billion gamble on Mobileye, which reported just $358 million in revenue last year. Here’s a look at some other notable Intel acquisitions, and how they fit in — or don’t — with the overall company: Wind River, 2008: The $884 million deal was the company’s largest in a decade, helping position Intel in the market for “embedded systems” — cars, planes, telecommunications gear and industrial equipment. Intel has continued to operate Wind River as an independent subsidiary, but the acquisition helped position the chipmaker for the emerging Internet of Things — wearable computing, appliances and other new applications. McAfee, 2010: This $7.7 billion transaction was a high-profile failure for Intel, which had hoped to incorporate McAfee’s online security technology directly into computer chips. Intel paid a 60 percent premium for McAfee but never succeeded in achieving its technological goals. Intel announced last fall it would spin McAfee out but retain a 49 percent stake in the business. That transaction valued the security company at $4.2 billion, 45 percent below the purchase price. Infineon’s wireless group, 2010: Late to the wireless market, Intel spent $1.4 billion in 2010 to buy the wireless division of Germany’s Infineon Technologies. Intel remains a laggard in wireless, but does have modems in some models of Apple’s latest iPhone. Intel is now focused on the forthcoming 5G wireless standard. Basis Science, 2014: Reports valued this deal between $100 million and $150 million, buying Intel a pioneer in the smartwatch market. Consumers have been cool on wearable technologies, though, while the Basis Peak smartwatches turned out to be too hot. Intel recalled them last year, warning they could overheat and injure wearers. Altera, 2015: Intel’s largest deal ever, the $16.7 billion transaction brought programmable chip technology Intel said could help its data center chips. Intel indicated that Altera gained market share in 2016, its first year under Intel ownership. Lantiq, 2015: The deal bought Intel technology for the “connected home,” which was briefly a top Intel priority. Intel didn’t disclose a purchase price for the German company and hasn’t focused on home technology in recent months. Intel made a series of relatively small deals last year, the results of which are too early to asses. Here’s a rundown: Itseez: A computer vision technology, like Mobileye, for self-driving cars and other autonomous technologies. Replay Technologies: Replay technology for wraparound, 360-degree views at big-time sporting events. Intel has featured this technology at major events, including last year’s Super Bowl. Ascending Technologies: Intel paired the German companies’ aerial drones with Intel’s own RealSense 3D cameras to give drones enhanced navigation capabilities. Drones remain a priority for Intel. Movidius: Like the Mobileye deal, this transaction gave Intel new computer vision technology — this time focused on aerial drones and virtual reality. Nervana: Pegged at $350 million, this acquisition gave Intel “machine learning” technology — enabling computers to observe the results of their actions and adjust to improve the results. Voke: Intel created a new sports group inside the company for Voke, whose technology is designed to stream sporting events for virtual reality.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 14, 2017 at 6:30PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has, for years, claimed that it has had a manufacturing lead over the rest of the industry. It has routinely asserted superior manufacturing technology density relative to its peers, and last year Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at the 2016 stockholder meeting that he expected the company to maintain a sizable lead in the performance of its manufacturing technologies relative to competing technologies. To refresh your memory, here's what he said:  My commitment to you is that, yes, you can, as an investor, count on Intel having a clear manufacturing lead. You have to remember these measurements don't necessarily mean all the same thing and how people are measuring the 10-nanometers versus 14-nanometers is different. You really need to take a look at the performance of the devices and what's being delivered. And, so, we believe our 14-nanometer technology will still outperform any of the other technologies that'll be introduced in the next several years. Our 10-nanometer technology will again make another large leap in performance and be even further ahead than we think the 14-nanometer will be. However, a recent disclosure from rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) seems to suggest that Intel may soon lose its edge in chip manufacturing technology.  Image source: Intel. Samsung to ramp Gate-All-Around FETs in 2018 According to an article in DigiTimes, Samsung VP of Technology Ho-Kyu Kang told attendees of the China Semiconductor Technology International Conference (CSTIC) that it will be adopting a fundamentally new transistor structure for its 7-nanometer technology that it expects to be ready for volume production in 2018 called a gate-all-around (GAA) FET. In an interview with Semiconductor Engineering, Intel senior fellow Mark Bohr said, "GAA transistors provide better electrostatics than finFETs, which should allow for some additional gate length scaling." Those aren't Samsung's words -- they come from a key Intel technologist. Furthermore, from reading the entire article linked above, it seems that getting that technology ready for high-volume production is quite the challenge. Even if Samsung's 7-nano tech using this GAA structure is only ready for mass production by late 2018, that should still put it well ahead of Intel. Intel sticking with tried-and-true finFETs Intel has already disclosed that its upcoming 10-nanometer technology -- which it says will begin mass production late in 2017 for 2018 product shipments -- will continue to use the older finFET structure. Moreover, Semiconductor Engineering's sources confirmed back in February what I reported back in September  2016 -- that Intel's 7-nanometer technology, scheduled for high-volume production in 2020, will continue to use the finFET structure. What this seems to indicate is this: Intel has not only seen its lead with respect to chip manufacturing density erode (right now both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are in mass production on their respective 10-nanometer technologies, both of which are denser than Intel's currently in production 14-nanometer technology), but it may be on the verge of seeing its leadership in transistor technology and materials science disappear as well. Indeed, Intel was the very first to transition to the finFET transistor structure back in late 2011 (the rest of the industry didn't start mass producing finFETs until 2015), but now it seems that as the rest of the industry transitions to the "next big thing" (gate-all-around FETs), Intel may be left scrambling to catch up.  Time for some clarity, Intel At this point, Intel needs to start providing shareholders with some real answers vis-a-vis chip manufacturing technology. The company avoided going into detail about this at its Feb. 9 investor meeting, but it has promised to host a separate day dedicated to manufacturing technology at some point in the first half of this year. Intel needs to make a compelling -- and intellectually honest -- case for why it believes it has a "leadership" position in manufacturing technology because right now things don't look good on its manufacturing front at all.

The logical step down for more mainstream folks is the Ryzen 5 series of chips. AMD revealed two of those parts—the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1500X—alongside the Ryzen 7 family, and today we're learning more about a new pair of Ryzen 5 CPUs that complete the midrange tier of AMD's new processor lineup. Model Cores Threads Base clock Boost clock XFR TDP Price Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 GHz 4.0 GHz Yes 95W $249 Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 GHz 3.6 GHz 65W $219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.7 GHz $189 Ryzen 5 1400 3.2 GHz 3.4 GHz $169 At the top of the range, the Ryzen 5 1600X is joined by the Ryzen 5 1600. The 1600X will likely be pitted against Intel's entry-level six-core CPU, the Core i7-6800K. The aggressively-clocked 1600X boasts what AMD calls a "full" XFR range, although the company says the definition of "full" isn't being revealed at this time, and our guess is that it could vary from chip to chip in this lineup. Of the Ryzen 5 CPUs being announced today, the 1600X is the only one that will slot into a 95W TDP. Meanwhile, the modestly-clocked Ryzen 5 1600 retains XFR, but it likely won't benefit as much as its sibling from a bigger cooler on top.  That chip puts an impressive six cores and 12 threads into a trim 65W thermal envelope. Most builders are used to four cores and eight threads from Intel's $300+ Core i7 CPUs, but AMD is taking four Zen cores with SMT under $200 with the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. The Ryzen 5 1500X will boast 200 MHz of XFR headroom on top of its already-appealing base speeds, and it'll retain the unlocked multiplier common to all Ryzen CPUs. Whether that's enough to match or outpace the potent Core i5-7500 at $205 will be an interesting question as we approach review time. At the base of the lineup, the Ryzen 7 1400 offers what could be an impressive level of multithreaded performance and unlocked multipliers for about $25 less than the Core i5-7400. AMD will include unilluminated versions of its Wraith Spire cooler with the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X, while the Ryzen 5 1400 will get the more modest Wraith Stealth heatsink. In response to questions about whether it would offer RGB LED-illuminated versions of these coolers separately, AMD said that builders who want the blinkenlights will need to shell out for a Ryzen 7 chip. As the enthusiast-class six-core chip in this lineup, the Ryzen 5 1600X will sell as a bare processor only. Some mysteries remain about the Ryzen 5 lineup. AMD didn't answer my questions about CCX arrangements for these parts, although the wide XFR boost range the company let slip for the Ryzen 5 1500X suggests that only one CCX may be underneath four-core Ryzens' heat spreaders. We also don't know these chips' cache arrangements just yet. All will be revealed soon enough, as AMD says the entire Ryzen 5 family will hit store shelves April 11.

Everything The Walking Dead What's New on Netflix: Movies and Shows Added This Month Today’s News The Voice: A (Not Very) Scientific Breakdown of How Adam, Alicia, Gwen and Blake Chose Their Teams by Malcolm Venable | Mar 15, 2017 8:37 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Pinterest Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp Let the games begin! The Voice's blind auditions are over, and the 48 contestants now battling for the top spot in the 12th season of NBC's vocal showdown are in place. The four coaches now each have a dozen people on their squads -- folks who'll now be belting out their best "Ooh baby oohs" in the battle rounds, which start Monday. That's when the coaches will pit two of their own team members against each other in "dueling duets" (which sounds like something you wanna safeguard antsy pets from) to choose who's strongest. It's also when we'll start to see advisors: DJ Khaled (with Alicia Keys); John Legend (for team Adam Levine); Luke Bryan (for Blake Shelton) and Celine Dion (for Gwen Stefani's team). Before all that gets underway though, we thought we'd take a step back and see exactly how these teams -- the full lineups for each of which are below -- came to be. All the coaches have their own distinct styles in selecting artists; here's a very unscientific assessment of their approaches. The Voice: The 6 best performances from the Season 12 premiere Adam Levine, The Voice Adam Levine Persona: Your Long Lost Bro Intel: Always ready with a wisecrack -- and the sense that there's a vape pen and/or a brewski under his chair -- Adam makes his charges feel like he'll swoop them up in a loving headlock and impart cool-guy knowledge like how to sing so girls (or boys) will like you. So far this season, Adam has tended to overcompensate for being passed over for other coaches, which only ramps up the intensity of his hard-yet-appealing sales pitches. It's from a good place though: Very fond of singers with soul and/or an edge, Adam projects a sensitivity and sense of caring that feels really genuine. He's a big bro with a heart. Motto: "Dude! No, seriously. Dude." Hallmarks: Upbeat compliments, cute self-depreciation Best attribute: Gushing over singers he likes and offering encouragement Weakness: Blake, and whining about losing out to Blake Greatest success story: Billy Gilman, Season 11's outstanding 2nd place winner Full team: Taylor Alexander Gaby Borromeo Sheena Brook Malik Davage Kawan DeBose Hanna Eyre Johnny Hayes Mark Isaiah Jesse Larson Julien Martinez Nala Price Josh West Alicia Keys, The Voice Alicia Keys: Persona: Earth Mother Intel: Practically radiating patchouli and a quiet hum from lots of meditation, Alicia conveys a kind of ever-present calm -- and a sense that she knows exactly what she's looking for in a member of her team. She tends to gravitate toward singers whose voices convey the sense that this isn't their first time here -- not The Voice, mind you, but life itself -- and are receptive to her advice on how to use music to become fully enlightened. Motto: "Show me your soul!" Hallmarks: Verbal hugs, actual hugs, really deep advice about being true to yourself Best attribute: Reminding contestants that they're unique, special and have a story to share Weakness: Defaulting to singers close to her R&B/soul wheelhouse Greatest success story: Wé McDonald, the New York teenager she helped get to the finals in Season 11 Full team: Chris Blue Jack Cassidy RJ Collins Vanessa Ferguson Lauryn Judd Lilli Passero Hunter Plake Missy Robertson Quizz Swanigan Felicia Temple Autumn Turner Anatalia Villaranda Gwen Stefani, The Voice Gwen Stefani: Persona: Ms. Most Popular Intel: Gwen Stefani is flawless and she knows it; her singular blend of squeaky peppiness, glamour and yes, extensive music knowledge obtained over decades (she's 47!) is unsurpassed. As vast as her education in music is though, Gwen more than anything seems to be seeking people a lot like her: confident, not easily defined and looking to have a good time. Which is not to say seriousness about the competition isn't important to her. She's discerning, for sure, but folks who don't have skills, swagger and sunshine in their voices aren't going to hang out with The Voice's version of the cheerleading squad captain. Motto: "We could have so much fun together!" Hallmarks: Charm, big smiles, being gorgeous Best attributes: Versatility/experience across multiple genres including pop, punk, ska and hip-hop Weakness: Blake Shelton Greatest success story: Nabbing this season's frontrunner JChosen Full team: Jozy Bernadette J Chosen Johnny Gates Savannah Leighton Davina Leone Kenny P Troy Ramey Stephanie Rice Aaliyah Rose Brandon Royal Caroline Sky Sammie Zonana Blake Shelton, The Voice Blake Shelton: Persona: The Wise, Sneaky Owl Intel: Blake's goofy Southern charm act is a cover for his cunning -- and his gift for being able to quickly hear (and get) some of the strongest competitors in the game. That's not always due to his talent-scouting ability -- nor his comfort recognizing talent across country, soul, rock and more. Blake is not above using some tricks to get people for his team -- as he did earlier in Season 12's blind auditions when he snatched contestant Enid Ortiz from other coaches' clutches at the last minute. His approach clearly works: of the current lineup of coaches, he's won the most at five times. Motto: "You want to win, right? Hallmarks: Dispensing wisdom, laid-back nonchalance Best attributes: Southern gentility, ability to annoy Adam without trying Weakness: Mind games and dirty tricks that undermine his superiority Greatest success story: Sundance Head, his most recent winner, from Season 11 Full team: Brennley Brown Dawson Coyle Lauren Duski Josh Hoyer Casi Joy Ashley Levin Aliyah Moulden Enid Ortiz Valerie Ponzio Andrea Thomas Micah Tryba TSoul The Voice airs Monday and Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC.

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this press release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this press release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD's manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD's business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMDs of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numeasis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD's receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD's business and operating results; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD's notes and the secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD's products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD's ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation's support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD's products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; and AMD's reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks.

AMD specifically designed these processors for performance desktop users, AAA-title and streaming gamers, and the new AM4 desktop platform. Featuring AMD SenseMI technology and impressive multi-tasking capabilities, the groundbreaking AMD Ryzen 5 adapts to consumers’ needs with incredible responsiveness and performance. Previously, AMD demonstrated the Ryzen 5 1600X beating the Intel Core i5 7600K by 69 percent2 in CPU performance testing using Cinebench R15 nT. Product Line Model Cores Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) Included Cooler TDP (Watts) Suggested Price, SEP (USD) AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 4.0 N/A 95 $249 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 12 3.2 3.6 Wraith Spire 65 $219 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 3.7 Wraith Spire 65 $189 AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4 8 3.2 3.4 Wraith Stealth 65 $169 Game Optimizations With the announcement of the Ryzen 5 lineup, AMD reiterated its commitment to delivering excellent gaming performance to ensure existing and future game titles take full advantage of Ryzen. “We are impressed by the technological evolution enabled by the Zen architecture, which was designed to keep pace now and well into the future as gaming, eSports and virtual reality experiences continually push the limits of devices,” said Vlatko Andonov, president of Bethesda Softworks. “Working with an all-new microarchitecture, like that in the Ryzen family of processors, means that everyone has the opportunity to raise their game and bring the very best interactive experiences to players. All of us at Bethesda are excited about working with AMD to keep evolving the premium performance that Ryzen offers.” Ryzen 5 Processor and Platform Availability Availability for all four Ryzen 5 models begins April 11 at etailers around the world.

(NASDAQ: INTC) is continuing its strategy of investing in data-intensive market opportunities that build into the firm’s strengths in computing, connectivity and the cloud. The company recently announced that it aims to acquire Israeli tech firm Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY). Although many see this in a positive light and as a natural expansion for Intel going forward, one key analyst slashed its price target on Intel and downgraded the stock. Credit Suisse downgraded Intel to a Neutral rating from Outperform and lowered its price target to $35 from $45. Although the firm did maintain its calendar 2017 and 2018 earnings per share (EPS) estimates of $2.80 and $2.95, respectively. The consensus estimates call for EPS of $2.80 in 2017 and $2.93 in 2018. The brokerage firm ultimately likes the strategic rationale behind the Mobileye acquisition. While expensive, Intel is buying a market leader with above corporate average margins and a potential long-term total addressable market that is multiples of the purchase price. However, Credit Suisse is struggling with an investment horizon inside of Intel that is not compatible with most of its clients, and the Mobileye transaction serves to highlight the difference. While the brokerage firm applauds management for using a stable core franchise in Client Computing Group and Data Center Group to invest in future growth, the lack of emphasis on near-term operating margin creates a growing “opportunity cost” for investors. The firm made sure to say that this recent spending spree is not a sign of management “running scared.” Credit Suisse believes that Intel will be able to use its utility/stability of PCs, among other things, to provide durable cash flows to make larger riskier investments with longer payback. In the report, Credit Suisse’s John Pitzer detailed: While it is still too early to pick the winners in HAV and FAV (Highly Autonomous and Fully Autonomous Vehicles), the depth and breadth of resources and IP an Intel/Mobileye combination represents surely places them in the pole position. In addition, while Mobileye has a decidedly vision-centric view of HAV/FAV, Intel’s complete system will also leverage other sensing technologies like RADAR and LIDAR and be able to provide from entry level to high end and from end device to cloud solutions. More importantly, while the endpoint might be out 10 plus years, HAV/FAV is likely to be a sizeable total addressable market. Shares of Intel were trading down 0.7% at $34.94 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $40.34 and a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45.

Justice Department lawyers revealed the decision late Wednesday in a filing with the Denver-based Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where the federal government under had been fighting against the oil and natural gas industry and conservative states to get the rule reinstated. It is the latest in a series of high-profile Obama environmental rules the Trump administration is repealing or working to change. ADVERTISEMENT Earlier Wednesday, President Trump asked the Environmental Protection Agency to consider weakening greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars. Trump has ordered the EPA to consider repealing Obama’s Clean Water Rule, and will soon seek to undo the Clean Power Plan, the coal leasing moratorium for federal land and other climate and environmental regulations. Attorneys said the Interior Department and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have been reviewing rules as part of a White House directive on reducing unnecessary and burdensome regulations. “As part of this process, the department has begun reviewing the 2015 final rule … for consistency with the policies and priorities of the new administration,” lawyers wrote. “This initial review has revealed that the 2015 final rule does not reflect those policies and priorities.” Attorneys said that Interior would formally propose to repeal the rule within 90 days. That will start a process, likely to take a year or more, of undoing a rule that was a high priority for Obama and took many years to write. Greens slammed the Trump administration’s decision Wednesday. “This disturbing decision highlights Trump’s desire to leave our beautiful public lands utterly unprotected from oil industry exploitation,” Michael Saul, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Backing away from these modest rules is doubly dangerous given the administration’s reckless plans to ramp up fracking and drilling on public lands across America.” The move comes as little surprise. The rule was a top target of the oil and natural gas industry as well as Republicans – all key allies to Trump. The rule set standards in three areas for federal-land fracking: integrity of well casing, storage of waste fluids and public disclosure of the chemicals used. It was written in part to respond to suspicion and anger from the public regarding the controversial oil and gas extraction technique, which has grown exponentially and been behind the boom in domestic energy production and resulting low prices. Wyoming federal Judge Scott Skavdahl, an Obama nominee, blocked the rule last year. He accepted arguments from industry and a handful of states that the BLM is prohibited by federal law from regulating fracking. The Obama administration appealed to the Tenth Circuit. Oral arguments were scheduled for later this month in the appeals court before a three-judge panel, but the Trump administration asked that they be canceled pending the regulatory repeal. Environmental groups that joined the litigation to defend the rule could ask the court to keep the case active, but the court is not obligated to comply. Once Interior finalizes its action to rescind the rule, it could be subject to litigation, including from environmental groups, states or others affected.

He's doing good in school so I guess he deserves to be rewarded with his own rig and account. Also, I couldn't play with him sitting on my chair and messes up my competitive points. I've been asking in the forums about a good bang for the buck motherboard to start with and received a lot of good suggestions from other members. I took their recommendations seriously and came up with something I could be proud of and I guess making this thread is a nice way to share what I have. First of, let me start with the unboxing of the BIOSTAR RACING B250GT5. I do now understand that there are people out there who loves to take pictures of their recent purchase and shares them everywhere. Just like having a new car, or a smartphone or something, we do get "overexcited" and shares to everyone every tiny bit of it so please excuse me on this one. While others manufacturers are busy competing teeth-to-teeth with their animal-inspired designs, BIOSTAR introduced their Intel 200 series motherboards with something that relates to speed, thus RACING. It's pretty obvious with the carbon fiber design printed all over the box and the zooming car at the middle. The back portion of the box shows info about features this motherboard flaunts. And oh, I forgot to mention you get a World of Tanks premium account that comes free when buying one. I play FPS mainly but I might give it a try. The package includes, four SATA cable, a User Manual, a DVD for drivers, an I/O shield, an RGB LED adapter cable and a BIOSTAR VIVID LED fan. Fan alone could cost $15 or more but it is bundled with the motherboard. Though I really think the 120mm fan should come in a basic color, perhaps black. I've been using BIOSTAR boards way back AM2 days for a simple reason, it is cheap. And I do understand that in order to sell their boards at an affordable price, they do stuff like using cheap solder mask that makes the PCB look brown. The BIOSTAR RACING B250GT5 is a standard ATX size motherboard that sports a matte black PCB that even under high exposure you can't see any trace of anything bronze. The RACING theme is very visible with a racing flag printed on the PCB and the heatsink as well. It may not be the best-looking board out there but it is strikingly clean and good-looking. The headers, PCI-E slots and the buttons are all well-placed. The BIOSTAR RACING B250GT5 supports the new Intel 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors. I am only planning to get at least a Core i5-7500 since my only purpose for building a new one is mainly gaming. An i7 would be too much and a "K" CPU is not necessary since this board has limited overclocking capabilities. It has 4X DDR4 memory slots that supports Dual Channel DDR4 2400.There are 2 5050 LED-headers where you can install RGB LED fans or LED strips and easily adjust colors with VIVID LED DJ app. You can also sync those lights with music so you can have your own club in your room. How cool is that? There are two touch buttons beside the usual reset and power. Called GT Touch, it features Sport and Eco mode. Sport gives you instant systems boost that makes you an instant overclocker with just one soft touch of a button. Eco mode optimizes energy consumption. The BIOSTAR RACING B250GT5 has 2 PCI-E X16 3.0, 2 PCI-E X1 and 2 PCI slots. The motherboard features 6 SATA3 connectors and 2 M.2. slots. BIOSTAR is always associated with the Hi-Fi word for some reason. Under that shiny piece of metal is a Realtek ALC892 7.1-Channel Blu-ray audio that has Double Hi-Fi AMP IC where you'd get same sound quality whether your source output is set on front or rear. The golden line on the left bottom is the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Ground that isolates analog audio signals from digital sources. Beside it is a series of RGB LED lights that sync with the RGB LED light on the heatsink and any RGB stuff you will install. The front panel, audio, USB and fan headers are all well placed. Rear I/O ports include 1 PS/2, 2 USB 2.0, 3 USB 3.0, 1 HDMI, 1 DVI-D, 1 VGA, 1 Gigabit-LAN, 6 audio and a USB 3.0 Type C. Like I've said, I am just starting to build a new Kaby Lake system and all I have is the motherboard and I don't have the other components so I could test it. I went to a good friend and borrow his Intel Core i7-7700K and other stuff to see how the BIOSTAR RACING B250GT5 goes. Since it's an unlocked processor we decided a little oveclocking, adjusted vcore, set the multiplier to 5 and managed to get a 4.2ghz. The BIOSTAR RACING B250GT5 is a 100 USD motherboard with a lot of features that could compete with what other manufacturers have at the same price point. The VIVID LED lighting feature and the 5050 LED Fun fan headers this motherboard flaunts is something you can found on some high-end models other manufacturers offer. Not to mention the free VIVID LED fan that comes along with it. Aesthetics and build quality looks and feels on par compared to the top-tier of the motherboard industry which is always a good thing. The layout is good and the slots and headers are all well-placed. This motherboard is well-suited for the gaming market. If you are a gamer and plans to have a new build then don't go buy that Z motherboard. It has tons of features that gamers don't actually need. Some will say that this RGB hype doesn't have anything to do with the performance of your system. I agree, but I guess it ain't that bad to have something that does good and looks good as well.     MOAB View Public Profile Find all posts by MOAB     (#2) Darkest Ancient Guru     Videocard: HD7950 Processor: i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z77 D3H Memory: HyperX Beast 16GB 2133 Soundcard: Aune T1 + HD650/DT990 Pro PSU: OCZ ZS 550w 03-15-2017, 15:17 | posts: 9,796 Thanks for the review, I've been interested in these boards since I saw the announcement.

I guess they have really improve their designs since 100 series to catch up with the top manufacturers. Free 120mm fans comes also with their AM4 boards, I really wish they included a pair lol.

Man I guess I have to update my details, that setup was 2 years ago.

The missive said she had recently changed her password, and asked her to call a phone number if that wasn’t the case. It wasn’t, so Fuchs called. The email had come from a “service@paypal.com” address and included a link to the PayPaypal website. However, she became suspicious when the person on the other end of the line asked for her credit card information to “verify her account.” View photos An example of a phishing email.More It doesn’t matter who you are or what email service you use. If you have an email account, you’ve received some kind of scam, or phishing email, just like my editor. Most of the time, these emails are relatively easy to spot. Some African prince or other wealthy individual wants to send you money until he can make it to the US. You just need to send your bank account information and Social Security number. But criminals are quickly changing their tactics, firing off more sophisticated emails in an attempt to trick you into giving away your personal information. According to Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel (INTC) Security, in a recent study, more than 19,000 people were asked to look at 10 emails and identify which ones were scams. Only three percent of them were able to find all of the phony messages. Worse still, some phishing messages contain ransomware, which locks down your entire computer until you pay the culprits a ransom. Yes, it’s a scary world out there. But there’s hope. If you follow some of these quick tips, you’ll be able to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. Read the subject line and sender’s address Phishing emails are designed to sucker as many victims as possible. They cast a wide net by covering topics like banking and package deliveries—two things most people generally receive emails for. You should be on high alert if you get a message from an unknown sender with a subject line mentioning changes to your bank account—or that you need to pick up a package that can’t be delivered—and you aren’t expecting either of those things. It’s probably a phishing attempt. Just delete the message and move on with your life. Hover over links Okay, so you can’t remember if you changed your bank account info or aren’t sure if you have a package in the mail, so you open the email. That’s cool. As Intel Security’s Gary Davis explains, it’s rare that just opening a message executes any kind of code on your computer. View photos It doesn’t matter what email service you use, you’ve definitely received a phishing email.More The message, however, tells you to click a link to check out the changes to your account or the status of your package. What do you do? Simple: Hover your mouse over the URL. When you point to a link without clicking, most web browsers and email programs automatically display the web address that link will open. If the email says it’s from your bank or delivery service, but the link points to a different site, don’t click it. Urgency is suspect A good number of phishing emails try to get you to act before you think—by adding a sense of urgency to their messages. An email telling you to log into or verify information for your bank or other account labeled “Final Warning” or “Urgent Notification” should set off warning bells right away. Kevin Haley, director of product management for Symantec’s (SYMC) Security Response, explains that you should be suspicious if you receive an email with a URL or attachment that is trying to get you to click on something right away.

So if you get a message telling you to do something instantly, ignore it. If you think it’s legitimately from your bank, skip the link and just go directly to your company’s website. Hooked on phonics The easiest way to identify a phishing email is if it’s loaded with grammatical or spelling errors. As Microsoft points out in its phishing email primer, legitimate businesses hire professionals to ensure that communications with customers are mistake-free. Criminals? Not so much. So if you get an email that’s strangely formatted, and is loaded with enough grammar issues to drive your fifht-grade English teacher insane, delete it. View photos If you receive an email with especially poor grammar, just delete it.More Patience is a virtue A lot of people fall victim to phishing emails because they’re simply in a rush. They’re in the middle of cooking dinner and taking care of two toddlers, see an email from their bank and BAM, that’s that. So how do you fix this? Just take a few minutes, breathe, and read your emails carefully. That’s pretty much it. What to do when you’re hooked So you’ve clicked a link or downloaded an attachment in a phishing email. You’re done for, right? Not exactly. Both Davis and Haley suggest that if you realize you’ve been the victim of a phishing scheme and you’re fast enough, you can change your passwords on any affected websites before the criminals get access to your accounts. If you can’t do that, your best bet is to disconnect your computer from the internet and run an antivirus program. Disconnecting your computer (like turning off WiFi) ensures that any malware you downloaded can’t communicate with its home server and steal your information; meanwhile, the antivirus program takes care of anything on your machine. You should also enable two-factor authentication on your accounts, which requires that you enter both your password and a second string of characters usually sent to your smartphone via text or an app, to keep people from accessing your information.  If, however, you’ve given your private information to someone via email, well, your best bet is to use a credit-monitoring service to make sure that no one is opening credit-card accounts in your name.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 March 2017 by Military News Path to Driverless Transportation Rolls Through Data Collection, Analytics SOURCE: Black & Veatch DESCRIPTION: Data collection and the processing power needed to support autonomous driving are huge areas of focus for development. Companies are investing heavily in driverless technologies, evidenced by news that Intel Corp. is acquiring Mobileye, an autonomous driving technology leader whose portfolio includes machine learning, road mapping, sensors, and data analytics among other technologies. The $15 billion purchase of Mobileye by Intel has enormous implications for automotive chipset integration in the autonomous driving market. For Intel, mapping may be the first application that the chip-maker could commercialize with the Mobileye acquisition. Real-time mapping is a useful component to today’s advanced driving tools, and one that provides an opportunity to integrate chipsets within automotive management systems. These same processors can communicate with vehicle sensors and control systems to provide precise location and relation information.  Such applications require low-latency, real-time processing. Easing traffic congestion is a key objective of Smart City programs and there is growing interest in improving vehicular movement and optimization of path. Assisted driving will require large volumes of processing support for incident avoidance and emergency braking.  For more information about the connections between smart cities, smart transportation and data analytics, download Black & Veatch’s 2017 Strategic Directions: Smart City/Smart Utility Report Integration of in-vehicle communications technology is a significant revenue opportunity. Virtually every automotive manufacturer has an initiative focused on assisted or autonomous driving. Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye provides them a path to more rapidly commercialize that technology. In the mid-term, there will be opportunities to provide intelligence to autonomous vehicles like small transit buses traveling along predictable paths. Trials of this technology are already underway in many locations all over the world. In the longer term, full autonomous driving will emerge. It will be important to consider the implications of data’s role in smarter transportation, especially for cities. Leaders of the smart city movement believe open data architecture will promote growth and development within their urban cores, resulting in an increased economic base. As more devices become chip-enabled, more data is collected and analyzed, with processing taking place at the edge where the device resides, and through communications networks and the cloud to places where the data can be aggregated and analyzed.  At every stage of this ecosystem there is opportunity for products that include components developed or manufactured by Intel and their competitors. Companies specializing in systems integration can help cities take full advantage of these emerging technologies. Greater volumes of data means increased need for servers and data centers.  These are all growth opportunities for Intel and other companies seeking to establish beachheads in the market for smart transportation and smart cities. Through targeted acquisitions like Mobileye, Intel may be able to increase the likelihood that it is their chipsets that become part of the foundational architecture of autonomous driving technology. These and other technology companies want to drive further up the stack to ensure their product is at the core. If they can make additional revenue off the applications themselves, they can generate even stronger returns for their shareholders.

Committee heads Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Adam SchiffAdam SchiffOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump standing by wiretapping claim | Cyber gets boost in Trump budget | Bad bots on the rise | McDonald's Twitter hack Senate Intel leaders were 'fully briefed' on wiretapping allegations: report FBI chief expected to deny wiretapping claim, Dem says MORE (D-Calif.) revealed Wednesday that they are pressing the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) on aides who may have been spied on through a loophole in U.S. surveillance law and were then subsequently “unmasked” and exposed to the media. The demand formalizes Nunes’s promise to investigate media leaks of sensitive information, and his recently expressed concern over backdoor surveillance of Americans. ADVERTISEMENT Nunes pointed to former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign last month after leaked surveillance of his phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak revealed that he had misled Vice President Pence about a discussion of U.S. sanctions. “We know for a fact that incidental collection on General Flynn was picked up,” Nunes told reporters. “I remain concerned that there was additional incidental collection that we are not aware of," Nunes said. "If additional names were unmasked, we’re going to have to understand, were proper procedures followed and did official names get leaked to the media?” Nunes and Schiff set a Friday deadline for FBI Director James Comey, CIA head Mike Pompeo and NSA head Michael Rogers to provide the information they request in their letter. The request specifically demands the names of any Americans whose identities were “disseminated in response to requests from [intelligence community] agencies, law enforcement, or senior Executive Branch officials … that relate to Presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton and their associates in 2016.” It also demands the names of any agencies or executive branch officials that requested or authorized the disclosure and dissemination of those names — as well as the recipients of that information. Nunes said that the committee would “most likely” subpoena for the information if it does not receive a response by Friday. Both Comey and Rogers are set to testify Monday in the first open hearing in the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the election, lawmakers announced Wednesday. U.S. surveillance law largely prohibits spying on U.S. citizens, but a commonly used loophole allows intelligence agencies to collect, search and share Americans’ communications — without a warrant — that are caught up “incidentally” in legal surveillance of foreigners. The only major requirement is that the U.S. person cannot be the “target” of the initial surveillance. Experts widely believe that this is how the content of Flynn’s Dec. 29 calls to Kislyak came to the attention of Justice Department officials, who informed the White House in February. The details of those calls were first reported by The Washington Post. The Intelligence Committee is also demanding that the Justice Department provide evidence for Trump’s claim that former President Obama “wiretapped” Trump Tower during the campaign, under threat of subpoena. Both lawmakers emphasized Wednesday that they have seen no evidence Trump was directly surveilled. “We don't have any evidence that [wiretapping] took place,” Nunes said. “I don't think it was an actual tap of Trump Tower.” But while Nunes said that it is “very possible” that the president himself could be one of the names swept up through incidental collection — telling reporters that “we should know that by Friday” — Schiff insisted that the question of inappropriate use of Americans’ information by intelligence agencies was not related to Trump’s claims. “I want to underscore that this is a separate matter from whether the president’s allegations have any truth,” he said. “While we’re talking about both these issues, the two are not related in the sense that there’s no evidence that there was a wiretap of Trump and his associates in Trump Tower." The divergence hinted at a delicate bipartisan compromise in the highly charged probe. The two committee heads stood stiffly next to one another throughout the press conference, each providing answers through two subtly different lenses. While Democrats have pushed for a major investigation into whether any Trump campaign associates had any contact with Moscow during the election, Republicans have argued that the graver concern is the surveillance of Americans and the leaking of classified information to the media. The committee has agreed to investigate both, according to a formal document outlining the objectives of the investigation. Tags Adam Schiff House Inteligence Committee   View the discussion thread.

AMD has said on multiple occasions that gaming performance will improve in time as developers start leveraging Ryzen's architecture and features. However, in the meantime, there are some things you can do to ensure you're getting the most out of AMD's latest processors. Some of the following information comes straight from the good folks at AMD, while other tib-bits are based on our experience with the Ryzen platform thus far. Let's get started. Update, Update, Update One of our most stable Ryzen Motherboards - Gigabyte's Aorus AX-370-Gaming 5 AMD released a new motherboard platform for Ryzen called AM4. It is the first time in a long time that AMD has truly targeted the performance enthusiast with CPUs, so there are going to be some growing pains and a maturation process. Whether you own a top-of-line X370 motherboard or one of the lower rung chipsets (B350, A320, etc.), check for firmware updates right out of the gate. With AMD working with developers and hardware partners to make sure Ryzen shines, it stands to reason that there will be important UEFI ROM and microcode updates on a regular basis. Even if you're running the latest firmware, check back every so often to make sure you're not missing out on an important update. Firmware updates can help in a number of ways, everything from playing nicer with Windows and improving stability, to making better use of memory and improving overall performance. As a general tip, also be sure that your graphics card drivers are up to date, your games are patched, and that you're running the latest drivers for your motherboard and AMD Ryzen. It's not the easiest to find but AMD's Ryzen chipset/driver support page is located right here, and here's AMD's RAIDXpert support page for storage drivers. Side note, in our experience, the Gigabyte GA-AX370-Gaming 5 board we used for our review of the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X has been the most trouble free and stable so far, but we're sure others will catch up quickly with BIOS updates and patches. Memory Matters Ryzen processors do not offer memory dividers for DDR4-3000 or DDR4-3400. If you're shooting for a higher overclock, AMD suggests users should aim for 3200 or 3500 MT/s. That doesn't necessarily have to be in conflict with high capacity kits, either—some memory vendors have begun validating 32GB (4x8GB) kits at 3200 MT/s for certain motherboards. After installing your RAM, take note of the recommended timings (CAS/tRCD/tRP/tRAS/tRC/CMD) and voltages. If an overclock is unstable, some motherboards will dial memory settings back as it chases a stable boot. Hop in there and make sure your RAM is running as advertised. If it's not, adjust the settings accordingly. Getting back to our first tip, AMD has promised to increase support for overclocked memory configurations with higher memory multipliers as part of its ongoing effort with its AM4 platform. It intends to issue updates to motherboard partners in May, so keep checking for firmware updates throughout the year. As to which kit you should go with, there are many out there. Likewise, memory makers are starting to churn out memory kits that are specifically targeted for Ryzen. We've had good luck with Kingston's HyperX Predator memory. The Gigabyte AX370-Gaming 5 board we tested was limited to a max memory frequency of 2933MHz with the early BIOS installed on the board. We have seen memory speeds as high as 3400MHz on Ryzen, but this is an area that’s still actively being optimized, so maximum memory speeds and compatibility from board to board will be in flux for a while until the kinks are worked out. Selecting The Right Power Plan If it's performance you're after, select the High Performance plan in Windows. Not only is this power plan geared towards performance over power savings, but there are two specific reasons AMD recommends this for Ryzen: Core Parking OFF: Idle CPU cores are instantaneously available for thread scheduling. In contrast, the Balanced plan aggressively places idle CPU cores into low power states. This can cause additional latency when un-parking cores to accommodate varying loads. Fast frequency change: The AMD Ryzen processor can alter its voltage and frequency states in the 1ms intervals natively supported by the 'Zen' architecture. In contrast, the Balanced plan may take longer for voltage and frequency changes due to software participation in power state changes. For those of you concerned about power savings, especially on laptops, this is a temporary solution. AMD says it will provide an update for Ryzen processors by the first week of April that optimizes the power policies of the Balanced plan. Green Light To Overclock The neat thing about overclocking, when it works, is that it gives you a free performance boost. Ryzen is no exception. In fact, AMD has embraced the fact that enthusiasts like to overclock, hence why every Ryzen processor has an unlocked multiplier. There are some impressive gains to be had, and you don't need LN2 cooling to get there. In our evaluation of the Ryzen 7 1800X, we were able to overclock the chip from 3.6GHz to 4GHz without any trouble. It wasn't stable at 4.1GHz and above, though had we spent some more time tinkering and perhaps used a higher-end cooler, we're confident it would have got there. Don't look for a magical elixir here—all standard overclocking tips apply, such as better cooling, keeping temps in check, not going crazy with voltage (around 1.4V should be the max without exotic cooling), and taking things slow in step increments as you determine stability at speed. It is also worth mentioning that only the CPU multiplier can be altered at this time. There are no memory multipliers for 3000MHz+ available, at least with the most recent firmware updates. So to fine tune, you'll have to change the BLCK. It's not ideal, as that will also throw off PCIe clocks. Final Takeaway One thing to keep in mind is that Ryzen is brand new. It also represents a return to a frontier that AMD has mostly been off track from for the past several years. That means it will take some time for the industry to catch up with and the technology to mature. These tips aren't going to drastically change things, but they will make sure you're on solid footing as Ryzen becomes more potent. Keep checking back at HotHardware too. We'll be following Ryzen's progression closely and plan on posting more guides in the future.

The allegations were made by President Donald Trump nearly two weeks ago in a series of tweets that accused the former president of committing the illegal act. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer seemlingly walked back on Trump's use of the word "wiretap," saying that "The President used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities." Members of the Obama administration have vehemently denied the allegations. Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Republican Rep. Devin Nunes and ranking member Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff briefed members of the media on the committee's findings. Both say they're still waiting for evidence from the Justice Department backing up that claim. Schiff says he and Nunes are willing to take steps to compel the department to comply with their request if it refuses by the March 20 deadline they've given the Justice Department. "It deeply concerns me that the president would make such an accusation without basis," Schiff said at a Wednesday news conference. Nunes says he doesn't believe there was "an actual tap of Trump Tower" in New York. Nunes also says the committee is tussling with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence over whether the committee will be allowed to have the computer technology needed to go through CIA evidence about Russia's interference in the election. The leaders say FBI Director James Comey and the head of the National Security Agency will testify at a public hearing on March 20. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Aaron Blake By Aaron Blake March 15 Follow @aaronblake House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Ranking Democrat Adam Schiff (Calif.) expressed doubt, March 15, about President Trump's claim of a 2016 wire tap at Trump Tower. (Reuters) If there is one man on Capitol Hill whom President Trump might want to stay in the good graces of, it's Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Nunes is the head of the House Intelligence Committee, which is in charge of investigating Russia's role in the 2016 presidential race — you know, the one Democrats think could prove collusion between the Trump campaign and a foreign power. And until this week, that was a good setup for Trump. Nunes had been a member of his own transition team, after all, and he seemed to go out of his way to defend Trump — in a way few others did, frankly. That may no longer be the case. Nunes delivered a reasonably strong rebuke of Trump on Wednesday for his tweet that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower, saying that if the tweet were to be taken literally, “clearly the president was wrong” (meaning Trump). The comment came a couple of days after Nunes threatened to subpoena the Trump administration for not turning over evidence related to Trump's claim. As I argued Tuesday, Nunes seems to be fed up with this story line, and he's suddenly willing to wield his authority in a way that Trump probably doesn't love. Or, at the very least, Nunes is now bowing to the reality of Trump's wayward and still evidence-free conspiracy theory. And that's a clear reversal from where Nunes has been in recent weeks. A month ago, when then-national security adviser Michael Flynn was in hot water, Nunes gave him a big — if ill-timed — vote of confidence. He said Flynn should not step down mere hours before Flynn was forced to do so. “No, I don't,” Nunes told Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto. “I have great confidence in Mike Flynn. He’s probably the best intelligence officer of his generation. And Neil, he’s being attacked maliciously by the press, which is not uncommon in this town.” Two weeks later, Nunes shrugged off the idea that Trump might have asked Flynn to signal to the Russian ambassador to the United States that Trump would ease Obama's sanctions once Trump was in office. Even discussing those sanctions during Trump's transition period risked violating the law, and Flynn later misled the White House about it, leading to his resignation. At the time, Nunes said he didn't think it was even plausible that Trump had directed Flynn to talk sanctions because Trump was so busy — a curious argument, in my mind. “I would find that hard to believe because they were so busy, and I think these conversations were all very short,” Nunes said. Then, last week, Nunes seemed to pooh-pooh the same tweets he addressed Wednesday, suggesting that Trump should be excused for being a newcomer to politics and not having lawyers review every tweet. It was truly a wide-ranging defense. “The president is a neophyte to politics,” Nunes said. “He’s been doing this a little over a year. And I think a lot of the things that he says, you guys sometimes take literally. Sometimes he doesn’t have 27 lawyers and staff looking at what he does — which is, I think, at times refreshing and at times can also lead us to have to be sitting at a press conference like this, answering questions that you guys are asking. But at the end of the day, I think tweets are a very transparent way for a politician of any rank to communicate with their constituents. So I don't think we should attack the president for tweeting.” Fast forward to Wednesday, and Nunes has now delivered perhaps the most significant contradiction to the White House's ongoing claim — which Trump apparently still subscribes to — that Obama surveilled him somehow. We'll see where Nunes's relationship with Trump goes from here, but he's in a position of power. And perhaps he's finally realizing that. politics the-fix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Devin Nunes told reporters on Capitol Hill. Trump caused a stir earlier this month when he claimed on Twitter that he had just learned that Obama tapped the phones in Trump Tower. It is believed he based the claim on analysis from conservative radio host Mark Levin. Though Levin’s analysis misses key details about what’s been reported about the surveillance used in the investigations into Russian meddling in the election, the White House has insisted that evidence supports Trump’s claim that Obama directed politically-motivated surveillance against the Republican’s campaign. Nunes’ committee is investigating Trump’s claims as well as other issues related to Russia’s interference in the election. The FBI is reportedly investigating whether any Trump associates colluded with the Kremlin to influence the election. Some news outlets have reported that the FBI has picked up conversations between Trump associates and Russian operatives. Many of the reports have stated that investigators have yet to find any evidence of collusion. It is unclear how the phone calls were intercepted, though Trump implied in his tweet that they were picked up by wiretaps of Trump Tower or of campaign members. An alternative explanation is that any correspondence was scooped up by U.S. intelligence agents listening in on Russian operatives’ phone calls. The Trump advisers who have been identified in news reports as corresponding with Russian officials have all denied knowingly communicating with Kremlin operatives. Nunes said Wednesday that Trump’s tweets would be more accurate if read as a general statement about the Obama administration’s investigation rather than a literal claim about Obama’s actions. “But if you’re not going to take the tweets literally and if there’s a concern that the president has about other people, other surveillance activities, looking at him or his associates, either appropriately or inappropriately, we want to find that out. I think it’s all in the interpretation of what you believe,” he said. Rep. Nunes: If you’re going to take Trump’s tweets literally on wiretapping, then “clearly the President was wrong” https://t.co/aVdo8qR3vS — CNN (@CNN) March 15, 2017 Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Devin Nunes, Donald Trump Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For March 15, 2017 Why Are Top Fund Managers Buying The No. 9 IBD 50 Stock? (Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced that it was acquiring Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY), with the deal expected to close over the next nine months. Canaccord Capital’s Matthew Ramsay maintained a Hold rating on Intel, with a price target of $38. Impact Of Acquisition Expressing a mixed reaction to the acquisition, the analyst mentioned that on the positive side, “Mobileye will almost immediately cement Intel into a leading ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) position with many OEMs, and Intel’s n-node silicon and high performance client and datacenter computing leadership should enhance Mobileye’s EyeQ chipset and software/mapping roadmaps.” On the other hand, this acquisition will meaningfully impact Intel’s revenues for 2017. Given the company’s processor/software R&D scale, Ramsay expressed disappointment that Intel appeared to be often late to emerging computing technology shifts outside its core markets. “Overall, while we agree with management’s long-term decision to invest for growth; our short and medium term concerns remain for Intel’s growth trajectory such as exiting 2016 with “peak” PC margins and into a period of DCG (Data Center Group) margin compression and increased capital investment,” the analyst stated. Related Link: Intel May Have Just 'Burned' $15 Billion On Mobileye Hurdle To Positive Returns While Intel’s shares are expected to generate a robust yield and remain inexpensive, Ramsay believes the stock could remain range bound, with margins stagnating and until investors are able to see evidence of the new investments in 10/7nm, IoT (Internet of Things), memory and automotive generating solid returns within a “reasonable” time horizon. Although the price for the acquisition appears steep, at $15.3 billion, the $100 billion end to end automotive TAM (total addressable market) would be critical for Intel’s growth going forward. At the same time, this deal, combined with the substantial investments in memory, 4G/5G models, etc., the analyst believes “the hurdle height continues to grow higher for Intel to generate positive returns on sizable non-core investments.

Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} March 15, 2017 11:08am   Comments Share: Related BBRY Benzinga's Option Alert Recap From March 13 Watch These 10 Huge Call Purchases In Tuesday Trade The Blizzard Edition Of The Samadhi Tech Update (Seeking Alpha) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s surprising $15.3 billion buyout of Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) was good news for Mobileye shareholders. However, the deal immediately sparked market speculation that it could also be a major positive for Blackberry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY). While most traders associate Blackberry with smartphones, the company’s rebranding efforts in recent years have focused on security and software. One of the major components of Blackberry's software business is its Blackbery QNX, which supplies software platforms to the auto industry. In recent years, the company expanded its offerings into Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Connected Vehicle and Autonomous Vehicles and secure over-the air software update services. Blackberry already has its software installed on millions of vehicles, and traders are speculating the Mobileye buyout now makes Blackberry a prime buyout target as well. In fact, using the sales multiple of the Mobileye deal as a guide, Blackberry could potentially have more than 60 percent upside from its current levels. Unfortunately, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry believes a potential Blackberry buyout isn’t coming anytime soon. "No, I don't think so," Chowdhry told Benzinga. "At least not for the next one or two years." Related Link: A Bullish Case For BlackBerry As An 'Anti-Trend Play' While Mobileye's automotive technology focuses on autonomous driving, Blackberry’s area of expertise is Advanced Driver Systems (ADAS). According to Mobileye, "the road from ADAS to autonomy" involves technological pillars such as sensing, mapping and driving policy. Despite its ADAS technology, Blackberry may still be behind the game when it comes to the more advanced technology associated with the transition to autonomous driving. That lag doesn't mean Blackberry stock won't see some upside in the next year, it just might not come from a buyout. Chowdhry recently wrote that Blackberry is an "anti-trend play" and could be a major beneficiary from the cybersecurity side of President Trump's aggressive infrastructure investment plan.

Germany's Bosch competes with Israel's Mobileye, which supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that are essential for autonomous driving, and owns about 70 percent of the market. "We are investing a lot of money in our own video technology and we want to stick with this strategy," Bosch managing board member Dirk Hoheisel, who is in charge of mobility services, told a news conference at the Bosch Connected World exhibition. The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, promises to escalate the arms race among carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. The deal was announced on Monday. Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said it was too early to say what effect the merger would have on the competitive landscape or Bosch's own strategy. "I can only comment about the two companies as of today. Intel is a major chip supplier and therefore also partner of Bosch. Mobileye today is clearly a competitor," he said. "What the future merger will bring, we will have to see. We will talk of course to Intel and Mobileye." Bosch, along with rivals including Autoliv and Continental, have decided to stick to plans to develop their own technology for the current generation of ADAS, unlike for example Valeo, which stopped in-house development and decided to buy Mobileye's products instead. Bosch also relies on an array of partnerships with software makers including SAP, Software AG, IBM, General Electric and Amazon. The co-founder of Mobileye as well as the chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, with whom Bosch has a partnership in on-board computers, are also due to speak at the Bosch exhibition in Berlin. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is expected to give more details on Thursday of the partnership with Bosch, in which they will develop artificial intelligence to guide self-driving cars through complex traffic situations. The computers will be designed to learn how to use knowledge about the vehicle's surroundings gathered with the help of cameras and sensors to make intelligent decisions about how to act, for example to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road. The on-board systems to enable fully automated driving are planned to come onto the market from 2020. "Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being... so it's a promise," Denner told the news conference.

Apple.Com/Mac A lot of Apple fans are waiting for the company’s fresh batch of new products. And even though the next iPhone is getting the most hype, a large portion of the Cupertino, California-based tech titan’s fans are looking forward to the MacBook 2017 models. Apple has been tight-lipped about its upcoming laptop line-up, but the new set of MacBooks is reportedly going to be worth the wait. The Apple laptop that has experienced the most recent refresh is the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which was launched during the company’s October event last year. No updated MacBook and MacBook Air were presented at the conference, and Apple eventually dropped the 11-inch Air after the affair. The Mac-maker may be leaning towards replacing the Air series with the upcoming 12-inch MacBook model. Just like the expected 2017 revamp of the iMac, the upcoming MacBooks have been unsurprisingly linked to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake chipset, which has DisplayPort 1.2, Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 support. According to a Bloomberg report from last month, Apple is designing a new chip for the next batch of MacBooks that would “take on more of the functionality currently handled by Intel processors.” The new chip, which is internally known by its T310 codename, is reportedly going to deal with the “Power Nap” feature while also enhancing the Mac laptops’ battery life. Previous reports indicate that the MacBook 2017 models, which could launch in early third quarter, may come in two RAM variants: the standard 8 GB model and a 16 GB option. The 8 GB model should do well as the more affordable option, while the 16 GB unit will be a godsend to those who have been longing for an Apple laptop with a memory upgrade. The upcoming MacBook Pro 2017 model is, of course, keeping the Touch Bar. The 13-inch basic Pro laptop may reportedly sell for around US$2,199 (AU$2,898), while the 15-inch variant with Touch Bar could carry a price tag of US$4,249 (AU$5,599). If the projected price of the upcoming iPhone is any indication, the new MacBook Pro units may be priced even higher. No less than a 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ display is expected on the MacBook Pro 2017 as Apple is set on improving its Retina Display, which has been left behind by other devices. A premium model has also been mentioned in earlier reports, which could pack up to 32 GB of RAM.

And there’s no doubt the region’s tech sector is growing rapidly. But time and time again, its sector is being left in the shade by a country whose ingenuity is seriously giving the Californians a run for their money, and also a cause to spend it. The Israel Valley Yet another significant deal was concluded in Israel this week in which a US tech company has paid billions of dollars for an Israeli startup that develops vision technology for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. In this case, Intel has purchased Mobileye for 15 billion US dollars, and it would appear to indicate that Denmark is on the right track following the one laid out by Transport Minister Ole Birk Olesen’s January law proposal regarding self-driving car technology. Of interest to Copenhagen The deal, which was the biggest in Israel’s high tech industry history, will enable Intel to utilise technology that promises to one day eradicate as many as 93 percent of all traffic accidents. “It’s a great deal: a representation of what Israeli companies are, and one that shows the growth of the Israeli tech sector,” said Avi Hasson, the chief scientist at the Israeli Ministry of Economy, this week. Mobileye’s tech will especially interest Denmark as one of its Mobileye Shield+ tools provides accuracy in blind spots, which is ideal for large vehicles operating in urban environments with cyclists like Copenhagen (see video below). Will take a team effort “We can’t ignore the gradual development taking place in self-driving car technology: from the ABS brake, which allows inexperienced drivers to perform close to a perfect car brake in a critical situation, to intelligent headlights, pedestrian protection and automated parking,” said Olesen just two months ago, and it would appear that the development has moved from ‘gradual’ to rapid. “Autonomous cars are not a dream anymore. It’s not a matter of ‘if’. It’s matter of ‘when’,” Mobileye’s co-founder, president and chief executive Ziv Aviram told the Jerusalem Post. While the global director of sales, Lior Sethon, underlined to media this week that the various tech hotspots around the world – Silicon Valley, Israel, maybe even Scandinavia – will need to work together to make it happen. “It will take an industry effort,” he said. From sci-fi to reality Mobileye was co-founded in 1999 by Aviram and Professor Amnon Shashua from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It failed to make any profits until 2007, at which point autonomous cars were still considered in the realm of science fiction. But today, Israel is rapidly making it tomorrow’s reality.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 15 March 2017 | MYT 3:08 PM Intel bets on selling Mobileye data, with maps a first test Driverless tech: Mobileye says it has 80% of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: To understand Intel's US$15.3bil (RM68bil) proposed acquisition of Israel's Mobileye, imagine the data created and compiled by a self-driving car scanning the road and objects around it as a potential source of revenue. That data, says Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology. Self-driving car data could bring in US$450bil (RM2tril) to US$750bil (RM3.3tril) globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centres, or better city planning based on data. "Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal. To be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun. Still, Mobileye says it has 80% of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start. "That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation," Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel's automated driving unit, told Reuters. "When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles." Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle's surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen, which mean those carmakers' vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue. Intel already owns 15% of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany's automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye's REM. Given there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has "significant early mover advantage" in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month. "This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable," Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters. Needham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of US$8.5bil (RM37.8bil) by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies. Playing catch-up? Given the expense and complicated nature of autonomous driving systems, most carmakers rely heavily on suppliers like Mobileye for key technology. Tesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye's camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers. Traditional suppliers like Germany's Continental or Sweden's AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play "catch-up" to Intel, said Evercore's Chris McNally in a note. One issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right. While drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year. Some data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. "Every autonomous car out there shouldn't have to find the same pothole and log it," she wrote. —  Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Twitter swastika hack comes at fragile time for company Telegram was the app where Iranians talked politics – then the government caught on Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

For gamers who are still contemplating on whether the RTS is worth buying, here’s a way for you to test out the video game for a limited time before deciding if it is for keeps. At the start of this week, the “Halo Wars 2” demo arrived on the Microsoft Store, and this means players who are intrigued by the real-time strategy game will now have the chance to test it out. Like the official game, the demo is available to play on the Windows PC platform and the Xbox One console. For PC players, the minimum system requirements for their Windows 10 computer include 6GB RAM, an Intel i5-2500 or AMD FX-4350 processor, an nVidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti or AMD Radeon HD 7750 or Intel HD 520 GPU and DirectX 12 API with Hardware Feature Level 11. On the other hand, the recommended system requirements include 8GB RAM, a 4GB Video Memory, an Intel Core i5-4690K or AMD FX-8350 processor, an nVidia GTX 1060 or AMD RX 480 GPU and DirectX 12 API with Hardware Feature Level 12. The “Halo Wars 2” demo comes with the first mission of the campaign and Blitz Firefight, a new co-op mode. In Blitz Firefight, players will find themselves in a fast-paced environment where they will have to use decks of cards to summon troops and vehicles that would fight against the AI-controlled enemies. Since this is a demo, players will only be entitled to access limited content. Of course, they can play and accomplish the entire first mission, but as for the Blitz Firefight multiplayer mode, their access to this part of the game is only good as a sampling, as per GameSpot. The demo is clocking in at 16.7 GB on PC and it performs well at 1080p at 60 fps depending on the PC device being used. For the uninitiated, “Halo Wars 2” is the latest installment in the Halo franchise. It marks the return of the Lead Spartans, Warthogs and other fighting forces to the cataclysmic Halo universe.

Turns out, the Swiss timepiece manufacturer has unveiled the $1,500 TAG Heuer Connected, its first ever high-end smartwatch. Over the past 14 months, TAG Heuer saw strong sales for the expensive wrist piece, selling 56,000 units exceeding its initial goal of 20,000 units. All said and done, Biver still considers smartwatch technology to be in the “Stone Age,” with incremental future potential. The 157-year-old Swiss watchmaker aims to see around 150,000 units of the new version. It will tap into Mainland China and Europe to recover from the slowdown from last year. Modular $1,500 Smartwatch Jerry Bautista, vice president of New Technology Group at Intel says TAG Heuer Connected is a luxury Android Wear module. TAG Heuer worked with Intel to build the watch like any other luxury watch. The smartwatch is modular, so one can customize its body parts before they make the purchase. One can pick from different colors, “modules, bracelets, horns and buckles.” TAG will also let you swap the module for mechanical or trade the entire kit for a Heuer 02T Tourbillon Chronograph. Dubbed the Modular 45, it comes in 56 versions, available in titanium, rose gold, ceramic and diamonds. One can get a module that will have a traditional face instead of the smartwatch one for an additional $1,650. The smartwatch features a larger screen and is powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor. It operates either on Android or iOS systems. Additionally, it has a memory of 4 gigabytes and a battery that lasts more than 24 hours. It also comes with Wi-Fi and GPS and can make mobile payments. TAG Connected is introduced against Google Android Wear 2.0 which was unveiled last week. It is also introduced against the high-end Apple Watch. Global Smartwatch Market Luxury smartwatches are touted as the next wave of digital innovation. The reality is much different though; smartwatches pale in comparison to notable brands like Rolex and Audemars Piguet. The limited functionality has reduced the smartwatch to a digital watch. For example, one needs to purchase an accompanying smartphone of the same brand to make phone calls.  Most smartwatches lack craftsmanship of the traditional timepieces. While Apple and Samsung have dominated the smartwatch market, the sector has diminished over the last fifteen months. A few smartwatch manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, Pebble and Garmin have remained lucrative players. The rest, are either going out of business or pivoting their business models.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (10) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Setapp: Explore a universe of apps for just $9.99 per month!

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo 5/5 By Alexandria Sage | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO To understand Intel's $15.3 billion proposed acquisition of Israel's Mobileye, imagine the data created and compiled by a self-driving car scanning the road and objects around it as a potential source of revenue. That data, says Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology. Self-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centers, or better city planning based on data. "Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal. To be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun. Still, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start. "That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation," Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel's automated driving unit, told Reuters. "When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles." Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle's surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen, which mean those carmakers' vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue. Intel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany's automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye's REM. Given there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has "significant early mover advantage" in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month. "This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable," Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters. Needham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies. PLAYING CATCH-UP? Given the expense and complicated nature of autonomous driving systems, most carmakers rely heavily on suppliers like Mobileye for key technology. Tesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye's camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers. Traditional suppliers like Germany's Continental or Sweden's AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play "catch-up" to Intel, said Evercore's Chris McNally in a note. One issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right. While drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year. Some data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. "Every autonomous car out there shouldn't have to find the same pothole and log it," she wrote.

Still, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start. You May Also Want To Watch: “That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters. “When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.” Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle’s surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen , which mean those carmakers’ vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue. Intel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany’s automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye’s REM. Given there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has “significant early mover advantage” in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month. “This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable,” Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters. Needham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies. PLAYING CATCH-UP? Given the expense and complicated nature of autonomous driving systems, most carmakers rely heavily on suppliers like Mobileye for key technology. Tesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye’s camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers. Traditional suppliers like Germany’s Continental or Sweden’s AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play “catch-up” to Intel, said Evercore’s Chris McNally in a note. One issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right. While drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year. Some data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. “Every autonomous car out there shouldn’t have to find the same pothole and log it,” she wrote.

Bloomberg Who rakes in billions from Intel's $15b Mobileye buy? Without a car to its name, Israel emerges as auto tech superpower Opinion Mobileye-Intel: The good, the bad and the ugly Court awards Alona Bar-On shares in parent company of Globes financial daily Alona Bar-On will get control of Monitin, the parent company of the financial daily Globes, with her 106 million-shekel ($28.9 million) bid for the share once controlled by fallen tycoon Eliezer Fishman, Tel Aviv District Court Judge Eitan Orenstein ruled Tuesday. The decision was a surprise because all the receivers for the Monitin shares had recommended that they be sold to Russian oligarch David Davidovich, who had raised his bid to 110 million shekels after the deadline to file. Orenstein said he decided on the acceptance of the lower offer from Bar-On, who is already a Monitin shareholder and daughter of founder Haim Bar-On, because he found Davidovich’s offer “problematic” and not significantly higher than Bar-On’s. Davidovich is likely to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. The staff of Globes – a rival to TheMarker – are divided. Management has expressed support for Davidovich while the journalists’ union backs Bar-On, although four editors came out in favor of Davidovich. (Nati Tucker) Foresight soars after Mobileye-Intel deal Shares of Foresight Autonomous Holdings, a tiny Tel Aviv Stock Exchange-traded company developing collision-prevention technology, rocketed higher after Intel announced Monday it was buying Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Foresight shares jumped 10% right after the news and continued higher on Tuesday, closing up 8.8% at 2.63 shekels (72 cents) and raising its market cap to 191 million shekels. Just before the Mobileye deal was announced, Foresight said it increased the size of a secondary securities offering by 15% to 23.5 million shekels, selling shares at 1.90 shekels each and warrants for the right to buy shares in the future at 2.92 each. The company will use the proceeds to accelerate research and development and boost its shareholders’ equity ahead of an initial public offering on Wall Street. Foresight’s technology is based on a homeland-security platform developed by another startup called Magna that uses two cameras aboard the vehicle to create three-dimensional pictures. (Guy Erez) Welfare minster cited by Securities Authority lawyer for possible ethics violations For the first time ever, the Israel Securities Authority said in public that it was investigating suspicions that Welfare Minister Haim Katz had committed ethics violations. The allegations were raised on Monday during the trial of financial adviser Moti Ben-Ari, where ISA attorney Eran Shaham-Shavit told the court that “Knesset member Haim Katz was given favors in exchange for advancing interests related to Equital and the defendant [Ben-Ari] connected with, among other things, the legislative process for Amendment 44 of the Securities Law.” The issue concerns Ben-Ari’s presence at 2011 deliberations by the Knesset Labor and Welfare Committee, which Katz chaired at the time. The panel was debating the amendment, which would bar controlling shareholders from redeeming bonds they hold in their companies before other bondholders had been repaid. Bar-Ari was finance director of the holding Equital, which controls Isramco, among other companies, and was also a Katz associate but was introduced to other MKs simply as a financial adviser. (Efrat Neuman) Assets grow 3.6% in 2016 Israeli held 3.4 trillion shekels ($930 billion) in financial assets at the end of last year, a 3.6% increase over the same time in 2015, the Bank of Israel said Tuesday. Most of the 119 billion-shekel rise was in cash and bank current accounts, which grew by 51 billion shekels, the central bank said. Assets held in time deposits climbed 41 billion shekels and holding of corporate bonds by 24 billion. Holdings of short-term notes dropped by 19 billion. Tel Aviv shares end lower as bank rally stalls Tel Aviv shares ended lower Tuesday as the rally in bank shares stalled and tech stocks finished lower. The blue chip TA-35 index finished down 0.35% at 1,435.09 points, while the TA-25 lost 0.25% to 1,279.30, on turnover of 1.27 billion shekels ($350 million). Banks ended a four-day run of gains and were led lower by an 0.6% drop in Hapoalim to 24.10 shekels and an 0.5% decline in Leumi to 16.88. Compugen paced tech stocks lower, falling 3.2% to 16.69 and TowerJazz fell 2.8% to 82.28. Perrigo weighed on the market with a 1.6% decline to 252.60. Africa Residences rose 1.7% to 76.90 after it said 2016 net profit soared 73% to 377 million shekels. Somoto advanced 2.1% to 3.10 as net more than doubled to 7.7 million shekels from 3.5 million in 2015. In foreign currency trading, the dollar weakened nearly 0.5% to 3.6610 shekels.

Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are ranging. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the downside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 35.99. The projected upper bound is: 36.11. The projected lower bound is: 34.19. The projected closing price is: 35.15. Candlesticks A white body occurred (because prices closed higher than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 22 white candles and 28 black candles for a net of 6 black candles. A long lower shadow occurred. This is typically a bullish signal (particularly when it occurs near a low price level, at a support level, or when the security is oversold). Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 32.4360. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 14 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 36.60. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 86 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -192.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 4 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 8 period(s) ago. Rex Takasugi – TD Profile INTEL CORP closed up 0.020 at 35.180. Volume was 29% above average (neutral) and Bollinger Bands were 33% narrower than normal. Open High Low Close Volume___ 35.060 35.230 34.660 35.180 28,586,872 Technical Outlook Short Term: Neutral Intermediate Term: Bearish Long Term: Bearish Moving Averages: 10-period 50-period 200-period Close: 35.68 36.40 35.35 Volatility: 15 17 22 Volume: 27,518,960 24,532,496 22,244,240 Short-term traders should pay closer attention to buy/sell arrows while intermediate/long-term traders should place greater emphasis on the Bullish or Bearish trend reflected in the lower ribbon. Summary INTEL CORP is currently 0.5% below its 200-period moving average and is in an downward trend. Volatility is low as compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. Our volume indicators reflect volume flowing into and out of INTC.O at a relatively equal pace (neutral). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bearish on INTC.O and have had this outlook for the last 28 periods. We are aware of the heightened political tensions globally, these must be monitored daily to protect your portfolio.   Intel Corporation, NASDAQ, NASDAQ:INTC, news, outlook, shayne heffernan, trading Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Heffx Technical Analysis added by HEFFX Australia on March 14, 2017 View all posts by HEFFX Australia → The following two tabs change content below.

By Stephen Lawson Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 14, 2017 4:31 PM PT Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this From M2M to IoT: Old industries have to learn new tricks The Bumpy Road to Private Clouds Is this the year IoT standards will finally make sense? Video Nvidia's mighty GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cranks PC gaming to 11 Wind River, an IoT software division of Intel, wants to help industrial users bring their legacy machine-to-machine systems into the age of open source and cloud computing. On Tuesday, it introduced software to virtualize industrial applications at the edge of the network, letting enterprises gradually migrate from older M2M technology to modern systems that give them more flexibility. The platform, called Wind River Titanium Control, runs on commodity Xeon hardware and uses widely adopted cloud platforms such as OpenStack and KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). The company has validated hardware systems from major manufacturers to run Titanium Control and pre-validated virtual network applications through its Titanium Cloud Ecosystem, begun in 2014. Titanium Control is targeted at industries like manufacturing, energy and health care. Machines have been talking to other machines for decades, but before IoT, they used closed systems that couldn't take advantage of the internet or open-source development. IoT is designed to replace those vertical solutions with horizontal layers of technology available from multiple vendors. Virtualized cloud infrastructure could help companies make that transition. Some legacy M2M users are under pressure to do so because the older systems are starting to reach the end of their lives and demand difficult and expensive maintenance, Wind River says. Titanium Control is designed for on-premises cloud infrastructure that can operate alongside legacy industrial systems so enterprises can migrate old applications and services over time. In addition to OpenStack and KVM, it works with Linux and the Ceph distributed storage system. It also includes management tools for things like upgrading software and patching components without shutting down service, Wind River says. The platform can scale from two to more than 100 compute nodes. It can be used in architectures like fog computing that place processing at the edge of a network to minimize delays and network traffic, Wind River says. That serves one of Intel's other big goals in IoT, where it wants to sell chips into the potentially huge market of edge computing.

A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump's first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Getty Images Travelers arrive at the international terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport, March 6, 2017 in New York City. President Donald Trump signed a new executive order on Monday that will ban travelers from six majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States for 90 days. Airbnb, Dropbox and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief. Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft, eBay, Intel, Netflix and Twitter. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump's executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson's order "unprecedented judicial overreach." Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump's executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the "friend-of-the-court" brief this time around. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. "We do expect the group to expand." Ride-hailing company Uber was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said. Box, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position. A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump's initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment. Representatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Peter Bright - Mar 16, 2017 2:00 am UTC reader comments 130 Share this story The first chips with AMD's new Zen architecture were the high-end, enthusiast-oriented Ryzen 7 parts. It's now the mainstream's turn, with AMD announcing Ryzen 5. There are four Ryzen 5 parts launching on April 11. At the top end is the R5 1600X: 6 cores, 12 threads, with a base of 3.6GHz and a turbo of 4.0GHz, for $249. Below that is the $219 1600. It has the same core and thread count but cuts clock speeds to 3.2/3.6GHz. At the bottom end are a pair of 4-core, 8-thread parts: the $169 1400 at 3.2/3.4GHz, and the $189 1500X at 3.5/3.7GHz. The chips will continue to use the AM4 socket and will be compatible with all the same chipsets and motherboards as the R7s. Just as was the case with the Ryzen 7, AMD is offering many more cores and simultaneous threads than Intel does for similar money. Whether driven by a different ideology or the practical realities of having to go head to head with a much larger competitor, AMD doesn't limit features such as simultaneous multithreading or unlocked multipliers to certain expensive chips; all the Ryzen 5s include these features, just as all the Ryzen 7s also do. The 6 core parts use two 4-core Core Complexes (CCXes) with one core from each disabled. Each core within a CCX has a 2MB slice of level 3 cache, and interestingly, all 16MB of cache are available. The 1500X again uses two CCXes, this time with two cores from each disabled, but again still offers the full 16MB of level 3 cache. The cheapest 1400 part, however, only has 8MB cache. So the top $249 processor is competing with Intel's Kaby Lake i5-7600K, a 4-core, 4-thread processor running at 3.8/4.2GHz retailing at around $240, and the bottom-priced R5 1400 is going up against the i3-7350K, a 2-core, 4-thread part running at a fixed 4.2GHz selling for around $174. Just as with Ryzen 7, the Ryzen 5 parts are going to give up quite a bit of single threaded performance relative to the Kaby Lakes; they have lower clock speeds and execute fewer instructions per cycle. But the presence of those extra cores means that in many workloads, the Ryzen will be able to hold its own, or even pull ahead, making the decision of which processor to buy more complex than it has been in the past; Kaby Lake may win for some workloads, especially older games that lean heavily on one or two compute-bound threads. But other workloads, including an increasing number of modern game engines, show much greater ability to distribute their work across multiple cores, and for those applications, the Ryzen will be a compelling option.

Intel buying Israeli driverless car-tech firm Mobileye for $15 b. (credit: REUTERS) The purchase by Intel International of Mobileye – the pioneering Israeli collision-warning- system company now developing autonomous driving – is the “best proof of what I have been saying since I took office: that our technology is amazing and greatly admired all around the world,” Science, Technology and Space Minister Ofir Akunis said Tuesday. In an interview on National Science Day (the anniversary of Albert Einstein’s birthday), Akunis told The Jerusalem Post he will leave next week for Beijing as a member of a delegation headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for the China-Israel Innovation & Investment Summit. There, he will sign agreements on joint brain research and laboratories. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. New Worlds: Nanoscale catalysts show ‘defects’ are useful Tobacco company files suit against Health Ministry The event marks two decades of scientific cooperation between China and Israel, the minister said. From there, he is to proceed alone to Tokyo for meetings with Japanese leaders to deepen scientific cooperation between the two countries. A few months ago, he was in India and Switzerland to promote scientific ties with those countries. Meanwhile, the science minister – a traditional Jew who does not wear a kippa – denounced the hanging in effigy in Jerusalem’s ultra-Orthodox (haredi) neighborhood of Mea She’arim on Purim of manikins depicting haredi soldiers in uniform. “This was an obscene act,” he said. “Soldiers, including observant ones, protect all Israelis, including the residents of Mea She’arim. Instead of degrading and denouncing them, they should thank and salute them. Jerusalem’s security has always been threatened by terrorism. It’s shameful that those people ridiculed soldiers. Those who did it should be caught and punished.” As for Rabbi Yigal Levinstein, head of a pre-army yeshiva in Eli who denigrated religious women soldiers, saying they would turn into “non-Jews” by serving in the IDF, Akunis said the institution has produced “Israeli heroes. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman will decide what to do. What Rabbi Levinstein said was repulsive, but the yeshiva should not be closed.” Akunis said he favors the advancement of women in the military and in scientific institutions and professions.

It’s safe to say that we’re still far away from napping on our drive to work, but it was a reminder of the innovations we have to look forward to in the automotive industry. The news even benefited traditional areas like Automotive – Original Equipment. However, this space doesn’t need flashy acquisitions to outperform the market. It is in the top 14% of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 35th spot out of 256 industries. There are 37 stocks in the group, and an impressive 8 of them are Zacks Rank #1s (Strong Buys) while another 3 are Zacks Rank #2s (Buys). Only 5 stocks in the industry have a sell ranking. The space benefited from a strong year for auto sales in 2016. But what about THIS year? Auto sales have lagged a bit in January and February to start things off. However, the economy (and bull market for that matter) show no signs of slowing down at the moment. Employment is on the rise and consumers are feeling pretty optimistic about the economy’s future. So why not buy that car? And this doesn’t even take into account the pro-growth policies that the new administration are promising. The companies with factories outside of the U.S. may run into some trouble in these more protectionist times, but President Trump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending could open up numerous avenues of continued success. 7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to Buy For today, let’s focus on three Zacks Rank #1s that are outperforming this highly ranked industry: Next Page   1 2 3 4 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/03/3-auto-parts-stocks-to-rev-up-your-portfolio/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like Weeds 4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Pass Up 3 Growth Stocks No Longer Growing GoPro Stock Rebounds, But ...

So now you have to decide, as I mentioned to last week, are you going to take the tweets literally? And if you are, then clearly the president was wrong. But if you’re not going to take the tweets literally, and if there’s a concern that the president has about other people, other surveillance activities looking at him or his associates, either appropriately or inappropriately, we want to find that out. JOHN YANG: The committee gave the Justice Department until last night to produce any evidence to support the president’s claim. Instead, the department got an extension until next Monday, when FBI Director James Comey is to testify before the panel. Adam Schiff is the committee’s top Democrat. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-Calif.: I do think it’s incumbent that, if we get to March 20 and we have the testimony I think we all expect from the director that there was no substance to the accusation that Barack Obama illegally wiretapped Trump Tower, that the president explain himself. I think this — you can’t level an accusation of that type without either retracting it or explaining just why it was done. JOHN YANG: Senator Lindsey Graham wants to know if there’s a warrant for a wiretap. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Congress is going to flex its muscle here. We will issue a subpoena to get the information. JOHN YANG: FBI Director Comey was on Capitol Hill this afternoon to brief leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Chairman Chuck Grassley and top Democrat Dianne Feinstein want to know about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials. Flynn is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny for dealings with Russians during the campaign. One-time Trump adviser Roger Stone said today he thinks a special surveillance warrant uncovered his contacts with a Russian-linked hacker who claimed credit for the cyber-attack on the Democratic National Committee. For the PBS NewsHour, I’m John Yang. JUDY WOODRUFF: And late today came word that, in an interview to air tonight on FOX News, the president was asked again about his wiretapping accusation, and he said: “Wiretap covers a lot of different things. I think you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.” Back on Capitol Hill, lawmakers from both parties expressed frustration with FBI Director James Comey, and what they say is an unwillingness to provide them with critical information. Joining us now, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a member of the Intelligence Committee. Senator, thank you for being with us. Are you getting the cooperation you need from the intelligence community? SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-W.Va.: Well, Judy, first of all, it’s good to be with you. And we are going to be able to get that. We have been speaking to them. We have been out to the CIA. We’re looking at all the documents, and they’re providing those to us. The Intel Committee is able to get in-depth, if you will, with all of our different intelligence agencies. I have great confidence in them, and we have got to get to the bottom. There’s an awful lot that’s going on here. There’s two different paths. You have one with the Russians involved in our election process. To what extent — we know they made an attempt. They made more of an attempt this time than ever before. We know that the outcome of the election, they were not able to intervene or interfere with that or disrupt that whatsoever, but their desire was there. We must prevent that from ever happening again and also to help our allies. Then you have the other Russian intervention, if you will. How much of an association is there? Is there any type of with the associates from President Trump during the campaign, his people, himself, his family, whatsoever? And is there any intertwinement? So, I think the American people want to know. And we need to get through this and get — come to the conclusion, and do the business of this great country. And, right now, that’s our — that’s the hot topic. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, at this point, do you think you’re any closer to knowing whether there was any, as you call it, intertwinement or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials? SEN. JOE MANCHIN: I can only say what we have seen to date. Now, I don’t see any evidence of that whatsoever. But we’re just in the start of this. So it would be premature for me to say anything, a definite yes or no. But we’re going to look at everything. We’re going to turn over every stone that we possibly can. We’re going to make sure we interview and bring people in that have — names have been mentioned that you have mentioned on your NewsHour, and we’re going to make sure that we get the facts. And intelligence is to provide the facts to us. The facts will usually take you to the truth. And then, when we get the truth, we have got to make the decisions and do what’s best for this country. (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator, let me just stop you there and ask you about this other strand of the story today. And that is President Trump saying in that interview that we just mentioned that we’re going to see more, in his words, in the next few weeks come to the forefront about the wiretap that he accused President Obama of being behind. What do you know at this point about that? SEN. JOE MANCHIN: Well, the only thing I can discuss and what I know about that is what you all have been reporting on and what has been reported in the news today. Jeff Sessions said he didn’t advise or didn’t say a thing about a wiretap and knows of no wiretap. And there’s no evidence of showing any wiretap to date. If there’s other evidence to come forth, we will be happy to look at that and evaluate it and investigate it, but, as of right now, that has not come forth. JUDY WOODRUFF: In the end — well, let me just rephrase that. Is it up to the White House, for the president to provide whatever evidence he has? SEN. JOE MANCHIN: Well, I would think that, if he has evidence that the intelligence community doesn’t have, and it’s not being brought forth, and he wants to make sure that that’s considered into this whole process, then I would hope that they would. JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you, Senator, to the other issue that we’re covering right now on the Hill, and that is, of course, health care reform, the Republican relationship legislation that seems to be running into more opposition from Republican members of the House and the Senate. Where do you think that stands right now? SEN. JOE MANCHIN: Well, it’s over in the House, and I guess, if they put the push on, they can push that out and send it over to the Senate. I don’t see a receptive audience. I don’t know of one Democrat that would vote for the process they’re sending over for the piece of legislation. I’m not voting to repeal, Judy. I have been very clear. I told President Trump this many weeks ago. There’s no way I can vote to repeal and throw people off, when I know the political toxic atmosphere that we have in Washington, thinking that we can come back and repair it. They can get rid of it with 51 votes. They don’t need a Democrat. But they can’t fix it unless they have eight of me, eight Democrats who are willing to sit down and work and fix some of the market conditions that we have that make it so really costly and very hard, very much a hardship on a lot of people that didn’t get the expansion or the subsidies or any of that. So, I understand where the problems are. But no one seems to want to fix it. So, I said this. I said, why don’t we vote and sit down, have a working group voting on the market repairs that we could do, and see if you can get 60 votes, before you throw the baby out with the bath water? JUDY WOODRUFF: And have they responded affirmatively to any — to your suggestion or anything like it? SEN. JOE MANCHIN: I have only had one — one of my colleagues — Republican Senator Bill Cassidy come over. And we have sat down twice to see if there was a pathway forward. He had a piece of legislation. We looked at it. We told him our concerns with it, but we had a dialogue going. And then, basically, the House has gone off on their own, and the things that we, Bill and I, were talking about didn’t materialize. So, nobody seems to want to do anything. (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF: I’m sorry to interrupt you. But just quickly, so, at this point, where do you see this legislation headed? SEN. JOE MANCHIN: I don’t see it moving on this side. I really don’t, on the Senate side right now, unless there are some tremendous changes made. Judy, let me just tell you, the state of West Virginia, 172,000 people got the expansion. That means the people that were not on Medicaid, but within the 139 percentile — 172,000. Another 36,000, 38,000 got some, basically, subsidies. That means, because of their income, they were subsidized about $388. And then we had the donut hole filled for our seniors. We have a poorer population. All of a sudden now, all of a sudden, they’re going to give the wealthiest of the wealthiest in the country $575 billion tax credits, $575 billion. And that’s going to be on the backs of the poor, the elderly, and those who have been addicted and are getting in treatment centers or being able to get treated for addiction, which is a horrible problem in my state. So, I get hit three ways. The poor get hit harder, the elderly pay more, and the people that are addicted are not going to get treatment that’s needed. JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, we thank you. SEN. JOE MANCHIN: Thank you, Judy.

King’s 'somebody else’s babies' comments on House floor By Cristina Marcos - 03/15/17 08:22 PM EDT 10,291   A House Democrat called out Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on the floor on Wednesday for his controversial comments that “we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.” Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) brought a poster featuring photos of prominent Americans with immigrant roots when they were babies to accompany his speech. It featured public figures like former President Obama, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, Walt Disney, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.  ADVERTISEMENT “These are not somebody else’s babies. These are immigrants, the children of immigrants, and they are our babies,” Swalwell said. King drew public outcry over the weekend when he posted a tweet in support of anti-Muslim nationalist Dutch politician Geert Wilders. “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies,” King tweeted. The Iowa congressman has since doubled down on his remarks, saying in an interview with CNN, “I meant exactly what I said.” "I'd like to see an America that's just so homogenous that we look a lot the same, from that perspective,” King added, explaining he believes Western civilization is "superior." Swalwell singled King out by name during his House floor speech, three days after the controversy first unfolded. “There’s nothing to restore. We are the greatest country in the world,” Swalwell said. “But worse, by disparaging the value of ‘somebody else’s babies,’ Mr. King argues for an America void of people of color or who worship differently than he does. That’s not who we are.” A handful of fellow House Republicans have condemned King’s comments, including Florida Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Cuban Americans, and Rep.

According to DOJ allegations, the hackers targeted high-profile government and military officials as well as commercial entities such as investment banks A grand jury indicted the four men "for computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo's network and the contents of webmail accounts," a Justice Department press release says. ADVERTISEMENT A DOJ official noted that the activity continued through 2016, but declined to comment on whether the suspects had any relation to a 2013 hack. Officials also noted that they had no reason to believe the hack was connected to the cyber attack on the Democratic National Convention allegedly carried about Russians. Two of the defendants, Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev and Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, worked for Russia's main security agency, known as the FSB, the successor unit to the KGB and the FBI's point of contact with Moscow for cyber crime. Sushchin, Dokuchaev's superior also, worked as the Head of Information Security at a Russian investment bank. The other two defendants, Alexsey "Magg" Alexseyevich Belan and Karim Baratov, are believed to be the criminal hackers. Read more here. DEM SAYS YAHOO SHOULD HAVE ACTED SOONER: Sen.

TECH COMPANIES JOIN FIGHT AGAINST NEW TRAVEL BAN: More than 50 technology companies have signed onto an amicus brief opposing President Trump's revised executive order barring foreign nationals from six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. Airbnb, Lyft, Dropbox and Y Combinator were among the major technology-focused organizations and companies that signed onto the brief, which was filed Wednesday and supports Hawaii's lawsuit to block the implementation of the order Trump signed last week. In the brief, the groups railed against the travel ban, writing that "the purported urgency of implementing the new travel ban is entirely unsupported by facts, data, or logical explanations that would justify such a dramatic reversal of American tradition."

Thomas Bossert, an adviser to President Trump on homeland security and counterterrorism, said that the new administration will require agencies and departments to abide by the framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and report back to the White House on their adoption and implementation of the cybersecurity recommendations.

The Oracle logo is displayed on the exterior of the Oracle headquarters on June 19, 2014 in Redwood City. After the close of trading Wednesday, Oracle reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings as its cloud-based software business continued to grow. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 15, 2017 at 2:16 pm | UPDATED: March 15, 2017 at 8:08 pm REDWOOD CITY — Oracle on Wednesday delivered better-than-expected earnings as the Silicon Valley software giant progressed with its transformation toward more cloud-based services and sales. After the stock market closed, Oracle said that for its fiscal third quarter, its adjusted earnings were 69 cents a share, on $9.21 billion in sales, compared with earnings of 64 cents a share on revenue of $9.01 billion in the same period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast Oracle’s adjusted earnings would be 62 cents a share on $9.25 billion in revenue. Faced with challenges from the likes of Salesforce.com, Oracle has recently emphasized its cloud business over its traditional database software and services. Last year, Oracle acquired cloud-based software company NetSuite for more than $9.3 billion to boost its cloud offerings. Oracle said sales from cloud-based software reached $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 62 percent increase from a year ago. Software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service cloud sales rose 73 percent from the year-ago period, to $1 billion. Rob Enderle, director of tech research firm the Enderle Group, said Oracle’s results suggest the company, which had resisted embracing cloud-based software while companies such as Salesforce and Amazon had adopted the concept, can make a go of it when new technologies upend old industries. “For a company that didn’t seem to get the cloud a few years ago, their cloud efforts were particularly impressive,” Enderle said. “They had good growth across the board with no obvious weaknesses.” In reporting Oracle’s results, co-Chief Executive Mark Hurd didn’t miss a chance to take a shot at one of the company’s top cloud-software rivals. “If these trends continue,” Hurd said, “it’s just a matter of when we catch and pass Salesforce.com in total cloud revenue.” And on a conference call to discuss Oracle’s results, Larry Ellison — the company’s co-founder, philosophical leader and chief technology officer — also showed he still believes Oracle can do anything better than its competitors. “We have a very large database business,” Ellison said. “There are millions of applications that run on the Oracle database. Most will move to the cloud, and we think we have a huge technology lead over Amazon (Web Services) and (Microsoft) Azure.” Oracle also raised its quarterly dividend payment to 19 cents a share from 15 cents. Oracle’s other co-CEO, Safra Catz, said that for Oracle’s fourth quarter, the company expects to earn between 78 cents and 82 cents a share, with revenue down 1 percent, or up as much as 2 percent, from the $9 billion reported a year ago. Investors showed their support for Oracle’s results, boosting the company’s shares by 5.4 percent to $45.40 in after-hours trading.

Share on Facebook Send via email The Kogi state government has destroyed two buildings which were used as the Kogi Operational Headquarters of Boko Haram terrorists group. Boko Haram stronghold in Kogi state destroyed (Photos) The Senior Special Assistant on new media to the governor of Kogi state Petra Akinti Onyegbule said that the Ahlul-Sunnah Mosque in Inike, Okene LGA which was taken over by members of the Boko Haram terrorist group, was destroyed, after the Nigerian Army got Intel that members of BH used the mosque as operational base. READ ALSO: UPDATE: Six killed, 16 injured as Boko Haram bombers hit Maiduguri Adding that in 2015 it was a battle between the sect and the army, on the grounds of the mosque. "You can see signs of the gun duel on the building," Petra stressed Boko Haram stronghold in Kogi state destroyed (Photos) It still stood after the duel, it was used for producing IEDs. Some of the fundamentalists still gathered at the mosque clandestinely in the name of Islam to plan and hatch evil. Governor Bello, who was accompanied by the State Police Commissioner, Mr Wilson Inalegwu and heads of other security agencies, particularly demolished buildings used by suspected kidnappers, Boko Haram terrorists and armed robbers in Okene in the Central Senatorial District of the state. The two buildings brought down on Tuesday, March 14, belonged to a suspected kidnap kingpin popularly known as Alhaji Tijani Bakare in Oyunkoko Ward in Okene while the second building levelled to the ground by the machines was the notorious Ahlul-Sunnah Mosque in Inike, Okene LGA which was reportedly hijacked in 2015 by members of the Boko Haram terrorist group and has been serving as an operational base for their nefarious activities. Boko Haram stronghold in Kogi state destroyed (Photos) The Governor said he had no sympathy for anyone engaging in heinous acts, as he would implement to the letter the law against anti-kidnapping, robbery and terrorism. He said however is found culpable by the law would be made to face the full weight of the law without fear or favour. “For those who are in the habit of harbouring criminals in their houses, we will fish them out and mete out serious punishment to them as if they are criminals themselves,” the governor warned. The governor warned that more property of criminals would be demolished as they are identified by the security agencies to serve as a deterrent to potential criminals and hoodlums. Kogi state police commissioner, Wilson Inalegwu, said it would no longer be business as usual for criminal elements operating in any part of the state, saying the action was to send a strong message to kidnappers and hoodlums that they must change their ways. Inalegwu said: “They should work hard and earn a decent living. We want to make Kogi safe so that those living here or travelling through Kogi will not have fear of being kidnapped.” Related Stories Troops ambush Boko Haram fighters on the run (Photos) Senate issues arrest warrant on customs boss Hameed Ali Third day in office, President Buhari approves another appointment My rejection won't stop me from fighting corruption, Magu speaks after HOT session with Senate Think it is important?

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Ryzen 5 six core and quad core SKUs leak, will land in April and start at $169 Ryzen 5 six core and quad core SKUs leak, will land in April and start at $169 Paul Taylor 1 day ago CPU, Featured Tech News An accidental leak, just a day shy of the actual announcement, has revealed AMD’s plans for its Ryzen R5 CPU line-up. According to a post on Guru3D.com (now removed), AMD Ryzen R5 CPUs will come in four different flavours – two hexacores and two quadcores – with a clear assault on Intel’s Core i5 range of CPUs. At the top the R5 food chain is the $249 Ryzen R5 1600X 6-core/12-thread, which clocks in the highest at 3.6GHz base clock. It is followed by its non-X brethren, the $219 Ryzen R5 1600, at 3.2GHz base clock. Both have a 400MHz boost clock. The hexacores are carved out of two CCX complexes operating the full 16MB of cache, connected by AMD’s Infinity Fabric – essentially your standard Summit Ridge design, only with two cores disabled. These come with a 95W TDP rating. The bottom-half of the R5 line-up is populated by the $189 R5 1500X 3.5GHz (3.7GHz boost) quadcore and the $169 Ryzen R5 1400 at 3.2GHz (3.4GHz boost), also a quadcore. These SKUs are single CCX modules rated at 65W TDP. All the CPUs in the R5 line-up feature SMT and are unlocked for overclocking. Here’s a handy list of the upcoming SKUs as leaked: AMD Ryzen R5 1600X, 6C/12T, 3MB L2, 16MB L3, Base 3.6GHz/Boost 4GHz, 95W TDP, $249 AMD Ryzen R5 1600, 6C/12T, 3MB L2, 16MB L3, Base 3.2GHz/Boost 3.6GHz, 95W TDP, $219 AMD Ryzen R5 1500X, 4C/8T, 2MB L2, 8MB L3, Base 3.5GHz/Boost 3.7GHz, 65W TDP, $189 AMD Ryzen R5 1400, 4C/8T, 2MB L2, 8MB L3, Base 3.2GHz/Boost 3.4GHz, 65W TDP, $169 According to the post, AMD is promising a hard launch, similar to R7, with units being available for shipment on the 11th of April just four weeks from now. While the R5 1600X seems to offer killer value with higher clocks, more cores and bigger cache (we’d chance saying it could potentially rival an R7 1800X at half the price), benchmarking of the R7 has highlighted some shortcomings of the Infinity Fabric and the dual CCX design. Putting it another way, the R5 1500X single-CCX might be the AMD dark horse you’ve been looking for if you’re a gamer. KitGuru says: Ryzen R5 has the potential to further shake up the status quo, provided motherboard partners are getting their kit to stores. Intel’s Core i5 line-up is dead centre in AMD’s sights with this launch and this may trigger another wave of price cuts on Intel’s side. More to come in R5 coverage… stay tuned.

I would love to know the actual reason behind this.

This is what i did… http://www.wzurl­.­me/tEXzrw Florin Actually the 1600 has 65W TDP, also i’d like to know if they come with any decent cooling. Simon Walker When mobo OEMs got RYZEN engineering samples to test and build the Mobos around by AMD they still weren’t particularly great as they were still quite early samples. Which in turn made OEMs think that when the CPU is released it would be another case of AMD the bulldozer debacle. Where the CPUs weren’t all they cracked up to be leaving a lot of Mobo OEMs with spare boards that they wanted to ship and get rid of. Between the time the OEMs received their samples and official release of RYZEN to the public AMD had made some significant improvements to RYZEN but OEMs didn’t realise until it was too late how good/popular RYZEN would end up being. So hence the Shortages at the moment 🙂 Levi I had assumed that was at least part of story just with a unhealthy dose of competitor intervention thrown in for good measure. Either way, I received my motherboard today, just waiting on adapter for CPU cooler. Cheap capable cooler on the way while I wait the extra two weeks. It is all very strange and something I have only witnessed once before in the last 25 years. On that occasion there was much talk about competitor intervention.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 15, 2017 9:23 AM PT Credit: Nvidia More like this Xavier and BB8: Nvidia heroes drive ambitious autonomous car plans Intel's Go supercomputer for cars points to a PC-like horsepower race Why Intel is buying car-vision company Mobileye for $15.3B Video Mingis on Tech: Videoconferencing arrives, and what's up with 'digital... Nvidia will work with automotive supplier Bosch to mass-produce self-driving car systems using the upcoming Xavier chip. Bosch provides automotive parts and in-vehicle technologies used by automotive companies worldwide. For example, Bosch supplies sensors and automotive parts to Tesla's cars with self-driving technology. Nvidia last year announced that its Drive PX board product line will use the powerful Xavier chip, but didn't provide a shipment date. Bosch will be one of the first companies to develop a computer using that board. The joint development project was announced Wednesday. Nvidia packs parallel programming and machine learning software development platforms into the Drive PX boards. Bosch will also use those technologies with the car computer, and it will supply the end product to car makers. [ Further reading: Why Intel is buying car-vision company Mobileye for $15.3B ] That's a positive development for Nvidia, which is competing with car and chip makers in the emerging autonomous car market. Intel this week made a big splash, saying it would pay $15.3 billion to acquire Mobileye, which develops sensors, chips and software for self-driving cars. Nvidia's self-driving car technologies are mostly homegrown, and the chip maker is working with a wide range of car makers including Volvo, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Ford. The Drive PX with Xavier will be the third model in Nvidia's car computer lineup, designed to allow cars to recognize images and quickly draw up accurate maps. That will help develop self-driving cabs, in which accurate point-to-point driving is paramount. The Drive computers are also mean to help avoid collisions and make smart driving decisions. Nvidia has already developed a self-driving car based on the first Drive PX model that can change lanes, stop at signals, ride highways and go from one point to another by drawing up maps. The Drive PX systems collect data from GPS, radar, lidar, cameras and other sensors to make driving decisions. The computer being built by Bosch and Nvidia will be like a supercomputer in a car. Nvidia has said that its Drive PX computers will ultimately have the ability to recognize everything in sight as a car is moving, which will help autonomous vehicles make driving decisions. The delivery date for the computer made by Bosch and Nvidia wasn't announced. But getting a big car parts supplier is a good way for Nvidia to get its technology into autonomous vehicles. Intel is also working with car parts supplier Delphi in a similar fashion. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

(AMD)? AMD stock could be attractive to a number of larger companies By Larry Ramer, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 15, 2017, 1:18 pm EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)? 3 Chinese Solar Stocks That Will Heat Up Big-Time Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)? Recent Posts: Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)? 3 Health Insurers Getting a Donald Trump Boost 3 Chinese Solar Stocks That Will Heat Up Big-Time View All Posts With its strong positive catalysts and leverage to high growth technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could very well follow in the footsteps of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) and become a takeover target. Given its powerful growth catalysts and high takeover potential, AMD stock is attractive at current levels, despite its huge advance over the last year. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Of course, Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) acquisition of Mobileye was seen as an effort by the chip giant to buy a growth engine. Similarly, AMD’s highly regarded new chips and processors, combined with its significant presence in the rapidly expanding gaming and graphics markets, make the company a growth engine that could easily attract a suitor such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) or International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). AMD’s upcoming Zen chips “are expected to be good,” reported PC World, and Forbes columnist Anthony Leather said of its Ryzen chips, “for anyone that does often use rendering, video editing or other programs that benefit from the extra cores and threads, Ryzen is shaping up to be fantastic value.” Most reviewers found that the Ryzen 7 1800K processor slightly outperforms the equivalent Intel processor, but AMD’s product sells for half the price of Intel’s offering, Leather reported. Moreover, Ryzen processors will be used for video gaming, as are AMD’s Radeon graphics cards. Demand for digital games is growing quickly as mobile games become more popular, new consoles are launched, and virtual reality and augmented reality start to take off. Speaking of VR and AR, “AMD’s Radeon RX 480 (graphics card) can …power virtual reality headsets offered by Facebook Inc’s (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus and HTC,” but the cards have a relatively low price tag, VentureBeat has said, as I noted in this Seeking Alpha piece. So by buying Advanced Micro Devices, an acquirer would obtain access to VR and AR, which are expected to be quite lucrative, PC World has quoted research firm IDC as saying. Specifically, by 2020, 64.8 million VR devices will be shipped, up from an estimated 9.6 million last year, the firm predicted. Some 45.6 million AR hardware products will be shipped in 2020, up from 400,000 in 2016, according to the firm.

The reality is that things are changing at an incredible pace, and some things that are considered miracles now could be ho-hum to people just a short five or 10 years from now. One thing is for sure, the technological breakthroughs for 2017 are certain to astound even the most jaded of our society. A recent Jefferies research report included a link to Massachusetts Institute of Technology Review that listed 10 absolutely incredible potential technological breakthroughs for 2017. Whether they all indeed come to fruition this year or in years to come, they truly are game changers for all of us. 1. Reversing Paralysis. Scientists are making incredible progress at using brain implants to restore the freedom of movement that spinal cord injuries take away from people. 2. Self-Driving Trucks. We all have heard how numerous companies are in the process of autonomous cars. The MIT team feels that tractor trailers will also soon be equipped with autonomous driving capability. 3. Paying With Your Face. In a huge effort to combat fraud and identity theft, face-detection systems in China now authorize payments, provide access to facilities and track down criminals. 4. Practical Quantum Computers. According to the article, huge technology advances at major companies like Google and Intel and at research groups indicate that computers with previously unheard power are within reach. Recently the Department of Energy announced that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is expected to take delivery of a new IBM system, named Summit, in early 2018 that will now be capable of 200 peak petaflops. That would make it almost twice as fast as the current leader. Summit will deliver over five times the computational performance of Titan’s 18,688 nodes using only about 3,400 nodes. 5. The 360 Degree Selfies. Inexpensive cameras that can make spherical images are ushering in a new photography era, and they could change the way people shares stories. 6. Hot Solar Cells. Converting heat to focused beams of light may provide a new solar device that could create cheap and continuous power. 7. Gene Therapy 2.0. Scientists are solving fundamental problems that were prohibiting the ability to find cures for rare hereditary diseases. The hope is the same approach may be used to cure cancer, heart disease and other deadly illnesses that plague mankind. 8. The Cell Atlas. The MIT article says that biology’s next major mega-project will truly find out what humans are really made of. 9. Botnets of Things. In a rather frightening scenario, the report makes that case that the huge push to add connectivity to home gadgets like webcams, digital video recorders and other devices is creating dangerous fallout that could get worse. A botnet (also known as a zombie army) is a number of internet computers that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been setup to forward transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on the internet. 10. Reinforcement Learning. This is another scenario that could be a little frightening. By experimenting, computers are learning how to do things that programmers can’t teach them to do. Needless to say, there are more than a few Hollywood movies that have put forth this scenario. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Of course, some of this is still very much in the genesis process, but one thing seems evident. The ability for scientists, inventors and even tech entrepreneurs to innovate is being made easier by the day as technological advances continue to move at light speed. Plus, it’s important to remember that now people with an ordinary smartphone have the ability to access all the knowledge from literally the beginning of time in a device that fits into their pocket. That didn’t exist at the turn of the century. That’s an example of how fast things can change.

(screen capture: Youtube/OrcamTechnologies) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics OrCam Mobileye Intel Corp. Related Stories Israel sees Mobileye as world R&D center for self-driving cars TLV Fashion Week falls flat on the runway 13 arrested for ‘deep corruption’ at Israeli Aerospace Industries Israeli-American medical tech makes taking blood easier FBI places public warning against ‘Binary Options Fraud’ at top of its main website Minister: All imported cars to have safety sensors from 2018 Netanyahu congratulates Intel, Mobileye on deal By law, Israelis over 80 can now skip to front of lines Gas find off Egypt reviving interest in region — industry official The Intel Corp. deal to acquire Israel’s Mobileye for a whopping $15 billion will no doubt put the spotlight on another Israeli startup by the founders of the self-driving tech company. And that firm is OrCam Technologies Ltd., which has developed devices to assist the blind and visually impaired. “We have seen more incoming calls into our call centers in the last day or so,” said Rafi Fischer, the director of media communications at OrCam. “There is huge interest in OrCam, given we share the same two co-founders as Mobileye.” Fischer was referring to Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram. Shashua is the chief technology officer and chairman of OrCam, which, like Mobileye, develops products based on advanced computerized visual interpretation capabilities, with Aviram as the company’s president and chief executive officer. Each spend part of their time away from Mobileye developing the startup. The Jerusalem-based startup, founded in 2010, has developed two devices that are being sold globally, including in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Germany, Israel and France, said Fischer. Very soon the product will be available also in Italy and Spain and other European countries. The US was the first country in which the device was made available to consumers in 2015. “We are already selling our product to thousands of people around the world, and we believe that in 2017 we will greatly increase sales,” Fischer said. The OrCam MyEye product helps the visually impaired navigate the world with a low-cost device and without invasive procedures. Its software uses a high-resolution video camera and smart algorithms that analyze what the camera is seeing, and reads back the information to a user in real time. The product is basically a little camera with a mount attached to a computing device — the size of a smartphone that fits in a pocket — and a personal speaker. When the OrCam camera is attached to the frame of a pair of glasses, and the users point to a text or surface, the speaker transforms the image into words and reads them to the users, enabling them to “read” newspapers, restaurant menus, or books. The device can also be programmed to recognizes faces and objects. The database recognizes words and text from any surface and remembers faces too. The OrCam MyReader product focuses on reading only and is good for people who can see but have trouble reading, said Fischer, like people with dyslexia or who have suffered a stroke. OrCam’s product can recognize text from any surface (Courtesy) The MyReader costs $2,500 while the MyEye costs $3,500. In the US some states fully fund the devices for qualified residents, Fischer said. Globally the products are sold via optical stores, distributors, vision centers and optometrists. The languages the software supports are English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Hebrew. In coming months Portuguese, Norwegian and other European languages will be added as well as Russian and Arabic and Asian languages in the longer term, Fischer said. The company is also working on a new product called OrCam MyMe, which will serve as a personal assistant to any user, recognizing faces and whispering their names into the ears of forgetful executives or keeping track of what a person eats, Fischer said. OrCam employs 125 people in Jerusalem. According to The Marker website, the startup has raised $22 million thus far, including a $6 million investment from the investment arm of Intel (Intel Capital). Other investors include Aviv Ventures and the Barkat brothers’ BRM Group. The founders are planning an IPO for the company, Fischer said, though there is no firm timeline yet. Perhaps in 2018, he said. Mobileye listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, with the IPO still the largest VC-backed auto-tech exit to date. Shashua and Aviram, who respectively held stakes of 7.6 percent and 6.9% in Mobileye, will share just under $1 billion from the sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bosch provides automotive parts and in-vehicle technologies used by automotive companies worldwide. For example, Bosch supplies sensors and automotive parts to Tesla's cars with self-driving technology. Nvidia last year announced that its Drive PX board product line will use the powerful Xavier chip, but didn't provide a shipment date. Bosch will be one of the first companies to develop a computer using that board. The joint development project was announced Wednesday. Nvidia packs parallel programming and machine learning software development platforms into the Drive PX boards. Bosch will also use those technologies with the car computer, and it will supply the end product to car makers. That's a positive development for Nvidia, which is competing with car and chip makers in the emerging autonomous car market. Intel this week made a big splash, saying it would pay $15.3 billion to acquire Mobileye, which develops sensors, chips and software for self-driving cars. Nvidia's self-driving car technologies are mostly homegrown, and the chip maker is working with a wide range of car makers including Volvo, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Ford. The Drive PX with Xavier will be the third model in Nvidia's car computer lineup, designed to allow cars to recognize images and quickly draw up accurate maps. That will help develop self-driving cabs, in which accurate point-to-point driving is paramount. The Drive computers are also mean to help avoid collisions and make smart driving decisions. Nvidia has already developed a self-driving car based on the first Drive PX model that can change lanes, stop at signals, ride highways and go from one point to another by drawing up maps. The Drive PX systems collect data from GPS, radar, lidar, cameras and other sensors to make driving decisions. The computer being built by Bosch and Nvidia will be like a supercomputer in a car. Nvidia has said that its Drive PX computers will ultimately have the ability to recognize everything in sight as a car is moving, which will help autonomous vehicles make driving decisions. The delivery date for the computer made by Bosch and Nvidia wasn't announced. But getting a big car parts supplier is a good way for Nvidia to get its technology into autonomous vehicles. Intel is also working with car parts supplier Delphi in a similar fashion.

Business Arrow Electronics Boosts Collaboration between Hong Kong Startups and Mainland China Technology Industry via Internet of Things Innovations Showcase in Shenzhen Corporate News Media-Outreach | Thursday, Mar 16, 2017 Corporate News Media-Outreach Thursday, Mar 16, 2017 HONG KONG, CHINA - Media OutReach - March 15, 2017 - Arrow Electronics, Inc., (NYSE: ARW) today held an Internet of Things (IoT) Innovations event in Shenzhen, China to connect Hong Kong innovation startups with technology companies in China. As part of Arrow's vision of guiding and connecting innovators, entrepreneurs, customers and suppliers in the IoT design-to-production journey, the event attracted over 500 attendees from all sections of the IoT ecosystem in Hong Kong and China.  Simon Yu, president of Arrow's components business in the Asia-Pacific region took a group photo with the startup representatives and has shared his thoughts on the ideas from them and appreciated their innovative products. According to "Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Hong Kong and Shenzhen Report 2016-17"1 released last month by the business school professors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University, the entrepreneurship in Hong Kong and Shenzhen was at a 206% and 284% increase from 2009 to 2016 respectively.  The report findings indicated that both districts have the utmost potential to emerge as a key entrepreneurial innovation cluster hub. However, the incubation of some ideas lags behind due to the limited resources of engineering expertise, as well as large-scale yet affordable production capabilities in Hong Kong.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the river, Shenzhen is not only a global mass-market electronics-manufacturing center, but also a vast electronics market for IoT consumer innovations and enterprises solutions. With its many years of experience in providing end-to-end IoT product lifecycle solutions in the APAC region, Arrow is bridging the two cities by creating a point of convergence for some of the brightest IoT startups, entrepreneurs and enterprises to advance IoT development. "Arrow has long supported technology innovation in Hong Kong and China. Our engineering expertise and IoT industry reputation, especially in the greater China area, can definitely assist IoT startups in removing key barriers and connecting them with the ecosystem players on their road to innovation entrepreneurship and social impact," said Simon Yu, president of Arrow's components business in the Asia-Pacific region. Arrow's IoT Innovations event provided an exchange platform for IoT businesses in China and Hong Kong to collaborate. In addition to startups and entrepreneurs, Arrow invited more than 50 local and international technology manufacturers of all sizes.  IoT solution providers and systems integrators, design houses, and global technology suppliers included Analog Devices, Cypress, Honeywell, Infineon, Intel, Nexperia, NXP, ON Semiconductor, Qualcomm, and STMicroelectronics, among others.   During the collaboration showcase session, leaders and specialists shared their opinions on the enhancement of over 100 products and solutions presented on site, such as Heartisans, Woofaa, and Cwlinux. Guiding IoT Startups Forward Heartisans, a startup producing life-saving wearable devices that monitor the heart conditions of heart disease patients, is among the first to partner with Arrow. "Our key innovations are a machine learning algorithm that is capable of determining the risk of a cardiac arrest five to 10 minutes in advance, and measuring blood pressure without an inflatable cuff with pulse transit time. Arrow's engineering expertise and consultation from proof-of concept, to hardware components selection to system integration enable us to significantly reduce product development cycle time and cost.  A solution showcase like this is an incredible platform to connect us with exciting manufacturing capabilities in bringing our products to the hands of consumers," said Tim Lui the co-founder of Heartisans. Marc Chow, whose company Woofaa is developing an indoor electronic air quality monitor that can be a part of a sensor network for wireless real-time monitoring, control, and data analysis , also shared his views on the collaboration with Arrow: "I have a building engineering environmental background but I know very little about electronics engineering.  Arrow gave us a lot of guidance on fields across wireless connectivity, sensing, systems integration, and data management and connected us with a vast network of IoT technology partners and resources.  Their support has assisted us in overcoming hardware design challenges and accelerated our product development process.  Arrow's event was an invaluable opportunity for us to engage face-to-face with some of the world's leading IoT experts and vendors and we look forward to collaborating with them on our next IoT idea," Chow showed the finished product during the presentation. End-to-end IoT Offerings Success in IoT takes more than innovative ideas and designs and remarkable production; it also requires a sound IoT ecosystem to further drive IoT development.  "STMicroelectronics offers a unique portfolio of everything from analog and mixed-signal components, connectivity, microcontrollers, power and energy management, and sensors to help develop applications for IoT. Combined with Arrow's end-to-end IoT capabilities and solutions, we are well positioned to help tech companies and startups create the kind of smart IoT devices that bring us a greener, safer, more convenient and enjoyable lifestyle," said Salvatore Settinieri, STMicroelectronics' vice president of Distribution for Asia-Pacific region.  Among the latest IoT solutions and tools on showcase is Arrow-built DragonBoard™ 410c, which is based on the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 410 processor.  It is a high-performance and low-cost development board designed to support rapid software development and prototyping. It is ideal for creating embedded computing and IoT products, including next-generation robotics, cameras, medical devices, vending machines, smart buildings, digital signage and gaming consoles, among others. With the addition of IBM's Watson IoT Platform, DragonBoard 410c developers can quickly create, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud--without having to deal with any complicated, underlying infrastructure.

Video Nvidia's mighty GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cranks PC gaming to 11 Nvidia will work with automotive supplier Bosch to mass-produce self-driving car systems using the upcoming Xavier chip. Bosch provides automotive parts and in-vehicle technologies used by automotive companies worldwide. For example, Bosch supplies sensors and automotive parts to Tesla's cars with self-driving technology. Nvidia last year announced that its Drive PX board product line will use the powerful Xavier chip, but didn't provide a shipment date. Bosch will be one of the first companies to develop a computer using that board. The joint development project was announced Wednesday. Nvidia packs parallel programming and machine learning software development platforms into the Drive PX boards. Bosch will also use those technologies with the car computer, and it will supply the end product to car makers. That's a positive development for Nvidia, which is competing with car and chip makers in the emerging autonomous car market. Intel this week made a big splash, saying it would pay $15.3 billion to acquire Mobileye, which develops sensors, chips and software for self-driving cars. Nvidia's self-driving car technologies are mostly homegrown, and the chip maker is working with a wide range of car makers including Volvo, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Ford. The Drive PX with Xavier will be the third model in Nvidia's car computer lineup, designed to allow cars to recognize images and quickly draw up accurate maps. That will help develop self-driving cabs, in which accurate point-to-point driving is paramount. The Drive computers are also mean to help avoid collisions and make smart driving decisions. Nvidia has already developed a self-driving car based on the first Drive PX model that can change lanes, stop at signals, ride highways and go from one point to another by drawing up maps. The Drive PX systems collect data from GPS, radar, lidar, cameras and other sensors to make driving decisions. The computer being built by Bosch and Nvidia will be like a supercomputer in a car. Nvidia has said that its Drive PX computers will ultimately have the ability to recognize everything in sight as a car is moving, which will help autonomous vehicles make driving decisions. The delivery date for the computer made by Bosch and Nvidia wasn't announced. But getting a big car parts supplier is a good way for Nvidia to get its technology into autonomous vehicles. Intel is also working with car parts supplier Delphi in a similar fashion. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory In a brief press conference with reporters, House Intelligence Committe head Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) said his committee has seen nothing to indicate that Donald Trump’s offices were wire tapped during the 2016 election. Speaking with Intel committee Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), at his side, Nunes statied bluntly, “We don’t have any evidence.” Nunes also stated “very possible” that Trump’s communications were swept up in FBI surveillance of Russians, adding, “We think we understand how Gen. Flynn was picked up from incidental collection.” Schiff then called for President Trump to provide them with any evidence he might have to back up his claims. Rep.

The Gtel T 9000: Windows device at its core, or a tablet with choice ? Posted 25 Mar 2015 by Prince Jones (@) Read 8 Comments While the bulk of manufacturers and suppliers are focusing on Android devices, local company GTel has once again opted to be unique. It has done this by giving customers a chance at using Windows as an OS for their tablet.  The merits of this are that most of us are already familiar with the Windows ecosystem, no matter how “different” Windows 8.1 is. The Windows tablets have not had much success on the market, mostly because of the increased cost of the operating system which in turn makes the tablet pricing poor compared to its rivals. Microsoft changed this by making its operating system license free for devices with screens smaller than 9” (this includes phones and tablets).   advertisement First Impressions Gtel packs this tablet with a wireless keyboard, which is handy for your extended periods of typing. There’s also the charger and a USB cable for connecting the tablet to your PC. Unlike Android tablets, you cannot directly connect your tablet to the PC and copy files, instead you need to have software to copy files to the device. An alternative would be to do some networking using a wireless router to connect your PC to the tablet. The tablet comes equipped with an Intel atom quad core processor which is no slouch and 2GB of DDR3 RAM which is quite quick. The onboard storage operates at speeds similar to many mechanical drives. While high-end solid state storage can be a lot faster, the higher speed drives would raise the price to a figure that is a lot higher than what it is. The operating system boots to the desktop in about 15 seconds which is a lot faster than a lot of desktops out there. The body of the tablet is quite well designed, with an aluminum black and silver ring, with red accents for the sides. The front and back have glass on them reminiscent of Sony’s design which gives a really premium feel and looks rather good. The only downside on the tablet is the weight, which is rather hefty for a tablet. The SIM slot and the micro-SD card slot are both accessible using a tray which can be pulled out using the supplied SIM tray remover tool. The T 9000 comes with no software, aside from the regular Windows apps that come with Windows 8.1. On the plus though, the version of windows installed is the 32 Bit x86 version. Which basically means you can move all your 32 Bit desktop apps right over to the tablet. The result is that unlike the ARM versions of windows which are restricted to the store, you have the plethora of apps that is able to run on the desktop version of Windows 8.1. The one annoying bit for the tablet again is the ability to connect it to your computer in order to copy files, hopefully Gtel will provide software to help make access to the T9000’s storage much less of a hassle. Remembering that this is the desktop version of Windows 8.1, forget having the phone functions that the android family of tablets usually has (yes that means no WhatsApp). Instead, the T9000 is designed for one function/purpose; productivity. With this tablet, all your office apps are going to run as long as they run on Windows 8.1. That means you truly are able to work on the go without worry of trying to integrate the system with existing platforms. Specs OS Windows 8.1 with Bing Processor Intel Atom z3735F Quad Core 1.83Ghz with 2MB cache RAM 2GB DDR3L Primary memory ROM 32GB Support TF cards of up to 32GB extended Camera 5MP Back camera, 2.0 MP front Wireless connectivity options 3G,WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Gravity Sensor, USB Graphics Intel HD graphics Battery 8000mAh DIsplay 8.9" 1920x1200 ~ 254ppi Display The T9000’s display is quite good, carrying a display resolution of 1920×1200 which is approximately 254ppi on an 8.9” tablet means that images are sharp. I found the whole process of changing screen brightness a little out of the norm and somewhat difficult to get used to. Unlike android tablets where the notifications panel also acts as quick settings access, the Windows system is a bit more of an activity and requires one be a bit acquainted with OS. The brightness of the screen was quite good though, being very visible both indoors and outdoors. I also found that the T 9000 has rather good viewing angles, meaning you do not always have to be facing the screen overhead in order to use the tablet. Media players The T 9000 comes by default with the normal Windows apps which have limited media file support. However, since this is the desktop version of Windows, you can use your normal desktop apps to watch videos. The only problem comes with the apps not always being optimised for tablets. The result is that unless you have the keyboard it is sometimes an awkward affair to use the apps. On the plus, it is easy to get any and all codecs for your media files. The media experience on the tablet was a bag of mixed feelings. On one hand the T 9000 comes with a good display, on the other, the side mounted speakers do not complement the display all that well because low output of the volume. When sitting in a room alone, the T 9000 would have sufficient volume levels, however in a room with people the speakers are barely audible. Camera Like many tablets, the T 9000 has a decent 5 MP camera, one sufficient for quick snaps. However it is not by any means a DLSR camera, nor is it a camera like those found in flagships. So if high-quality images are needed another device would need to be acquired. The Camera has no flash and performs rather poorly in low light situations. The front camera works well for video calls and for the quick selfie while doing any social networking. Battery I found the 8000mAh battery sufficient for general use, with an hour of video consuming about an hour of battery with medium to low screen brightness settings. The time drops a bit more when browsing, depending on what pages are being visited, flash video consuming the most power. For regular work like typing, the battery will last you the day assuming that the Wi-Fi is turned off. Conclusion As far as Windows tablets go, the Gtel T 9000 seems like as good a bet as any for one to go with. The model that Gtel has made available is quite responsive, its one major drawback being that it is a little on the heavy side. On the plus, you have a tablet able to install all the 32bit apps you have on your laptop, but is much more portable than the laptop. Gtel is offering the tablet for $450 or $600 on terms payable in 12 months. The package also includes a wireless keyboard that makes the whole activity of typing a whole lot less cumbersome than it would be on screen.  Another plus is that updates are handled by Microsoft, so you are sure to be supported with updates for any issues that Microsoft would identify as opposed to the situation with Android which leaves updates to the device manufacturer. The price and the software support would make this a rather good buy for students and business people looking to keep productive while on the move. One thing to note, the box says you can choose between Windows and Android. However, it seems that the user is restricted to Windows. While the Windows experience was quite good, the absence of choice in the end is a bit of a disappointment. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Android, Device Review, G Tel Tablets, GTel, Gtel T 9000, Microsoft, Tablets, Windows 10, Windows 8 Previous Post « Supreme Court dismisses Econet legal action: How does that affect us anyway?

For the curious, here’s the link to banecat https://youtu.be/5ywjpbThDpE Back on topic, the cash price makes it a better value proposition than what i initially concluded from your teaser article. Unfortunately for some like me, working on the go on a tablet means using surface pro level hardware, all academic really since the t9000 and surface beynd my means right now. Surprisingly enough, for pure media consumption and web browsing, i found the disowned blackberry playbook quite compelling: it has a great screen, lovely front facing stereo speakers, great native codec support and build quality. I was so impressed with it I’d consider it even now, dead end software and all!

I’ve been throng to buy a nice tablet pc, for some general purpose use online with my studies as buying a tablet pc is presumably supposed to be cheaper than a laptop! Being a student, I know buying impulsively is not an option so I did a trek week research on this issue. Here’s what I discovered: 1) G Tel’s tablet pc is more expensive compared to actual new and used laptops from a number of brand names! There a popular Laptop Shop in Newlands shopping center where the base price for most of the laptops is 320! PC’s with 4GB ram and 500HDD! So getting a laptop is far much better! 2) The gtel tablet has nothing that makes it a high end tier tablet. Infact, it has the same specs as the HP 8″ Stream or iView 8″ tablet for 5 times the Price! What’s worse is the atom z3538 is the same, screen resolution and these come with free office360 . conclusively, the gtel is a worst of money…. entirely ! The problem with them is that they want to take advantage of their monopoly but thanks to free import on tech gadgets I’ll never buy a GTel product for more than $120! ever!

For an earlier morning read on exponentially more races — and for a more comprehensive aggregation of the day's most important campaign news — sign up for Campaign Pro today. (http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo) Story Continued Below VOTING PATTERNS — “Trump-state Democrats choose party over president,” by POLITICO’s Elana Schor: “Donald Trump carried Missouri by 19 percentage points on his way to the presidency. But Sen. Claire McCaskill, who faces a fight for reelection next year in the conservative-leaning state, isn’t exactly voting like Washington's idea of a red-state Democrat. McCaskill has sided with Democratic leaders against all of Trump’s most contentious Cabinet nominees and five of the seven regulatory rollbacks teed up by the Senate GOP since Inauguration Day, according to a POLITICO analysis. She is not alone among red-state Democrats who lately have remained in their party’s fold: On the Senate’s highest-profile votes since the president took office, eight of the 10 most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot next year voted with their party nearly four-fifths of the time. Even famously GOP-friendly Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has sided with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as often as he aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).” Full story. HEALTH PUSH — American Action Network spending pushing GOP health law hits $10 million: The Republican nonprofit is airing another $1.5 million in ads targeting 15 districts mostly represented by battleground and/or moderate House Republicans. The district-specific ad thanks members by name for “keeping their promise with a new plan for better health care.” However, one of the targeted Republicans, GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, just said that he is “not prepared” to vote for the current GOP bill. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida (not one of the targets of this round of AAN ads) joined Issa in opposition on Tuesday. HEAVY HITTER — Former President George W. Bush to headline Flake fundraiser, via the Arizona Republic’s Dan Nowicki: Flake and the current Republican president have a rocky relationship, but he's getting 2018 help from the previous one. From Nowicki: "[Bush] is the attraction for an April 11 dinner event at the Paradise Valley home of former Intel Corp. chairman and chief executive Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara Barrett, who Bush in 2008 nominated to serve as U.S. ambassador to Finland. Bush's guest appearance could give Flake a shot of momentum as he comes under increased pressure from the right and left. During last year's campaign, Flake emerged as one of now-President Donald Trump's most persistent GOP critics and ultimately did not endorse nor vote for Trump.” Full story. FINANCIAL TIMES — The DCCC raised $9.8 million in February as the NRCC raised $10.5 million, via Huffington Post’s Matt Fuller: “That is almost double the DCCC’s previous February record of $5.1 million in 2015 … a significant chunk of their fundraising for this month ― $6.4 million ― is coming from small-dollar donors. Online donations are also up by 300 percent from February 2015, when the DCCC raised $1.5 million.” Full story. GOVERNOR PRIMARY WATCH — “J.B. Pritzker exploring run for Illinois governor,” by POLITICO Illinois’ Natasha Korecki: “A spokesperson said Pritzker will also contribute $200,000 to cover day-to-day operations associated with the exploratory committee.” Full story. — Pritzker’s move is another step toward a potentially expensive primary with fellow wealthy businessman Chris Kennedy, who is already running. (Though Pritzker’s estimated $3.5 billion fortune eclipses the millions Kennedy brings to the table.) — Former Rep. Gwen Graham (D-Fla.) moves $250,000 into state campaign account, via POLITICO Florida’s Matt Dixon: “A state political committee has been setup to help former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham with her expected gubernatorial bid. On Feb. 3, Graham for Congress, her congressional account, gave $250,000 to Our Florida, a state political committee set up one day earlier. The committee is chaired by Stephanie Toothaker, an attorney with the Tripp Scott law firm. She served as special counsel for Gwen’s father, Bob Graham … As of Jan. 31, Graham’s congressional committee had $1.2 million cash on hand, including the $250,000 she has transferred.” Full story.

SPECIAL ELECTION UPDATE — Club for Growth PAC endorses Bob Gray for GA-06: “Congressional Leadership Fund is already on the air attacking Democrat Jon Ossoff, but the Club could become the first outside group to jump into the crowded intra-GOP competition ahead of next month's” all-party primary. Full story. HOUSE PRIMARY WATCH — Democratic businesswoman looking at Lipinski challenge in IL-03: Democrat Marie Newman is gearing up to run against Rep. Dan Lipinski, Greg Hinz reports at Crains Chicago Business. Newman has been meeting with Indivisible grassroots chapters as well as Pantsuit Nation and Action for a Better Tomorrow. She’s also working with top Chicago Democratic consultants Tom Bowen, John Kupper, and Tammy Duckworth pollster Jill Normington. More from Newman here. DIGITAL BUY — The Republican Party of Wisconsin’s first digital buy of the 2018 cycle hits Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin over a thorny issue from the state’s 2016 Senate race: the Veterans Affairs center in Tomah. The ads from the state GOP, which will be promoted on Facebook and Twitter and other digital platforms, say that Baldwin “failed Wisconsin veterans” regarding an inspector general’s report on problems at the facility. TV BUY — "Planned Parenthood to unleash campaign against Trump," by POLITICO's Josh Dawsey: "Republicans have promised to strip funding from Planned Parenthood because the organization funds abortions. Now, in a bid to keep their federal funding, the group is highlighting cancer survivors who were treated at the organization's centers in a bid to tilt the debate in their favor. The organization is launching a $1 million national television and digital campaign with cancer survivors telling the story of Planned Parenthood — with ads tailored to the shows President Donald Trump watches, including spots playing on Morning Joe, Fox and Friends and in West Palm Beach markets this weekend, when Trump visits Mar-a-Lago." Full story. PROBAMACARE — Save My Care touts opposition to GOP health bill in robopolls of Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Nevada: A memo from the group argues that voters will be less likely to support legislators who vote for the current House bill and tests some provisions that Democrats are already thinking about weaponizing for 2018, including allowing insurance companies to charge older customers at a higher rate than current law permits. Read the memo here. FOOD FOR THOUGHT — California voter-data expert Paul Mitchell writes in Capitol Weekly about how the new administration and new voter laws are affecting the next round of political campaigns: “We see increased public interest in political events, with voters seemingly at the edge of their seats awaiting the next move or tweet from the new Trump administration. … But those putting together next year’s campaigns are struggling to understand the nexus between this charged political atmosphere and what we generally expect to be a low turnout for the gubernatorial primary and a mediocre turnout for the general election. ... Will this level of engagement extend to June of next year, or will the public burn out? Will voters connect the dots between the national events and state elections?” Full story. ADMINISTRATION SPEED READ — “Senator: Comey to say whether FBI probing Russia, Trump campaign by Wednesday,” by CNN’s Manu Raju and Tom LoBianco: “Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said Tuesday that FBI Director James Comey promised to tell him Wednesday whether the FBI is investigating ties between Russia and the campaign of President Donald Trump. The Rhode Island Democrat said that Comey made the promise in a March 2 meeting with him and Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina. According to Whitehouse, Comey assured them he would confirm if an investigation exists ‘and the scope of their Russia/Trump investigation because he had not been able to at that point say that there was one.’” Full story. — “Trump Paid $38 Million in 2005 Federal Income Tax,” via MSNBC: “DCReport.org obtained two pages from what it said were Trump's 2005 Form 1040. The site's founder, David Cay Johnston, a former reporter for The New York Times, disclosed the details of the two pages, which he said were sent to him through the U.S. Postal Service, on Maddow's program. The pages come from a part of the return that doesn't break down Trump's sources of income.” Full story.

ELLIOTT 3/15/2017 Reprints Stocks opened higher Wednesday as oil prices bounced, the dollar eased and markets looked toward the Federal Reserve's rate policy decision this afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 climbed 0.2% and the Nasdaq was up 0.1%. The focal news item for the stock market today, and the week, is the Federal Open Market Committee's rate policy announcement, scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, and followed by a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at 2:30 p.m. ET. The National Association of Home Builders' closely watched Housing Market Index is due out later this morning. In Play: Chevron, Rio Tinto, Snap, Nike, MSCI Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) each muscled up a fraction on the Dow. Apple (AAPL) added 0.2%. Intel (INTC) dropped nearly 1%. Nike's (NKE) rose nearly 1%. The sportswear maker is battling through a 16-month consolidation. It reports its fiscal Q3 on Tuesday. Among S&P 500 stocks, Southwestern Energy (SWN) rose 3% after Citigroup upgraded the gas producer to buy from neutral. Southwestern shares have been in a steep decline since December and well off the peak at 49.16 reached nearly three years ago. Investment research tools developer MSCI (MSCI) rocketed 11% ahead of the starting bell. Shares are extended above a 90.89 buy point from a cup base cleared in February. Metal and ore mining stocks were in motion. Rio Tinto (RIO), Brazil's Vale (VALE) and BHP Billiton (BHP) were up 1.5% to 3%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) posted a 1% advance. Snap (SNAP) leaned more than 1% lower after Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage on the IPO with an underweight rating. The note set the stock's price target at 18, nearly 13% below Tuesday's closing price. Snap shares ended Tuesday 21% above their March 2 IPO price, and 30% below their March 3 high. On the IBD 50 list, Momo (MOMO) pulled back 1% at the open. The China-based micro-blogging service bolted 7% higher in heavy trade Tuesday, leaving it just below last week's high and up 40% since a February breakout. Oil, Copper Jump; N.Y. Manufacturing Slows, New Orders Spike Oil prices bounced in early action, sending West Texas Intermediate up nearly 2% and back above $48 a barrel. Copper jumped more than 1% and gold dipped a fraction to $1,199 an ounce. The dollar gave up some ground vs. the euro and the yen, and the 10-year yield dipped 3 basis points to 2.57%. Manufacturing growth in the New York region cooled in March, sending the New York Federal Reserve Bank's Empire State Manufacturing Survey to 16.4 for the month, down from 18.7 in February. The survey's new orders index spiked to 21.3, "its highest level in several years, pointing to a substantial increase in orders," the report said. Consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February, the Labor Department estimated, slowing from January's 0.6% gain but meeting expectations. Core prices, minus energy and food, rose 0.2%, also in line with views and down from a 0.3% increase in January. February retail sales also gained 0.1%, meeting economists' targets. The Commerce Department also revised its January retail sales increase higher, to 0.6%. Taking away automobiles and gasoline sales, February sales rose 0.2% — just below the 0.3% consensus projection and down from a 0.7% improvement in January. At 10 a.m. ET, January business inventories are due from the Commerce Department, and the National Association of Home Builders releases its March builders' confidence index. At 10:30 a.m,. the Energy Information Administration delivers its weekly oil inventories report.

Here are 4 ways tech is already impacting the hiring process. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 15 March, 2017 22:32 - - - - print email Comments From professional networking sites and job boards to online applicant systems, technology has revolutionized recruitment, profoundly changing how employers and recruiters find potential candidates. For example, applicant tracking systems and new AI software can help HR departments manage the massive influx of resumes they receive daily, says Michael Fauscette, chief research officer at G2 Crowd, a business software review platform. But, while technology can offer easy solutions, it often has a way of creating new problems in the process. "The new AI-powered systems can do a great job sorting through candidates, but the risk is that non-traditional candidates or candidates with unusual experience that might be a very good fit could fall through the rules-based system, even one that learns and improves with 'experience'," he says. While applicant tracking systems might be the most obvious way technology has impacted recruitment, it has changed far more behind the scenes. Here are four ways technology has changed recruitment forever, and how the industry has had to adapt. [ Related story: Top 10 recruiting software platforms ] Data overload in recruitment Businesses can't get enough of big data - and it's certainly valuable in recruitment - but there is such a thing as too much data. And, considering that IDC predicts big data and analytics will grow from $130.1 billion in 2016 to over $203 billion in 2020, it doesn't look like companies will start taking a more minimalist approach anytime soon. "More data is not always a good thing if you don't know what to do with it. They say knowledge is power, but in the wrong hands or with the inability of how to use that knowledge, it can be detrimental and damaging," says Jeff Mills, director of solution management and talent acquisition at SAP SuccessFactors, a company that offers software for human resources. More data means more confusion, allowing tiny details to "skew process and drive people to take action on things that don't matter, while ignoring the real underlying problems with the recruiting function." And, as Fauscette points out, analytics and AI are only getting "more intelligent," with some systems so finely tuned that they can boil a pile of resumes down to one applicant who will be the best fit. As these systems grow and evolve into more sophisticated platforms, they're only getting more complex to maintain. That's why Mills suggests hiring a data scientist or analyst to help make sense of the information, and to maintain the software and hardware used to collect and store the data. Otherwise, businesses run the risk of finding themselves with more data than they know what to do with, which can create more chaos and waste resources. [ Related story: 7 job boards that focus on remote tech jobs ] Global reach to find potential candidates Technology hasn't just made it easier to apply to jobs, it has also made it easier for businesses to find qualified candidates anywhere in the world. Recruiters can now scan job boards and professional network sites, like LinkedIn, for qualified candidates with the right skills - without the limits of geography. According to research from Global Workplace Analytics, it's estimated that nearly half of the US workforce holds a job that is "compatible with a least partial telework" and that 20 to 25 percent of the workforce "teleworks at some frequency." Meanwhile, 80 to 90 percent of the US workforce says they "would like to telework at least part time" for two or three days a week. With so many eager candidates looking to telecommute, it makes it easier for recruiters to reach out to candidates they may have overlooked due to location. And it opens a recruiter's reach to find professionals with a specific skill set that they can't find locally. "Recruiters are no longer limited to newspaper distribution and a file of known candidates; this means tapping into a significantly larger talent pool, a more diverse pool - both of which help competitiveness of companies and expand their abilities to innovate and service customers," says Mills. Eliminating, or introducing, bias There is a laundry list of reasons why unconscious bias in hiring hurts companies, but beyond the obvious implications around equality in the workplace, a strong case can be made that diversity can make a business more successful. In one study, Intel cited diversity as a "massive economic opportunity" - to the tune of $470 to $570 billion. Intel estimates that better diversity in tech could add anywhere from 1.2 to 1.6 percent to the national GDP. And new technology can help businesses not only remove unconscious bias by eliminating anything from a resume that might identify gender or race, but it can also help bring a specific bias into the recruitment process. For example, if a company looks at their workforce and realizes they have predominantly male developers, they can use technology to target female developers in the recruitment process, says Mills. It can also help companies evaluate their job descriptions to identify any biases in the phrasing, says Mills. Studies even show that "gendered wording" in job descriptions can unintentionally encourage a hiring bias. "No matter how much a recruiter or HR rep tries to be unbiased and balanced, there often is some level of selection bias present. The AI-based systems, assuming there are no biases in the algorithm of course, doesn't suffer from the same tendencies," says Fauscette. More flexibility at the expense of control Mills says it's been a difficult shift for businesses to give up a sense of control over the workforce. Even with the ability to hire workers from anywhere around the world that there's an internet connection, some businesses are still reluctant to embrace telecommuting. But companies that can get comfortable with the new digital workforce stand to gain more in employee engagement. Mills says allowing employees the freedom to work however they work best - whether from home, in an office or from a coffee shop - creates a shift where employees start working from a position of "desired duty" instead of "required duty." "This flexibility creates an overall sense of ownership; employees feel like they own their own career paths. The phrase 'pride of ownership' exists for a reason," he says. Technology presents endless tools and resources for HR, and the best way to figure out how they can improve your hiring process is through trial and error, says Mills. "Operate with a scientific methodology mindset. Observe, question, hypothesize, experiment and analyze. Look at sourcing new channels, try new regions, colleges or leveraging social to build mindset and trust. Break the mold of how you think recruiting should operate. Talk to advertising and PR agencies to help find new approaches. Just be smart about it," he says.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Rumor: Nvidia’s Volta to be built on TSMC’s ‘new’ 12nm process Rumor: Nvidia’s Volta to be built on TSMC’s ‘new’ 12nm process By Joel Hruska on March 15, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Nvidia’s Pascal GPU family has been tremendously successful, but the company is already looking ahead to a new architecture, codenamed Volta. Details on the chip are scarce, though Nvidia has previously given guidance that Volta would be its first consumer HBM2 product and would feature a stacked memory architecture. Now, rumors are flying that the chip will actually be built on TSMC’s “new” 12nm node. The reason we’ve put the word in quotes is because 12nm isn’t really a new node at all. Here’s how TSMC’s CC Wei described it in TSMC’s last quarterly conference call. [O]ur strategy is continuously to improve every node in the performance, such as 28 nanometer. And are continuing to improve the 16 nanometers technology. And we have some very good progress, and you might call it the 12 nanometer because we’re improve in the density, classical density, performance and power consumption. Yes, we have that. TSMC appears to be performing the same kind of optimization and improvement to existing nodes that every foundry performs over time. It’s just that this time, they’re calling it something a little different. This photo shows TSMC’s various types of 28nm technology and their respective characteristics at a very high level. The deeper you drill into the characteristics of each sub-type, the larger the differences become. A device built on TSMC’s 28LP process would have very different characteristics than a device built on 28HP, even though both are based on 28nm. Over the last 20 years, it’s become increasingly difficult to cleanly define a node. In the old days, node size and gate length were synonymous. As time has passed, the metrics for a new node have grown more complex. Samsung, TSMC, and Intel all tend to brand their products as belonging to the same node (save for TSMC going with 16nm as opposed to 14nm), but that doesn’t mean they are identical, as the chart below demonstrates: Intel, TSMC, and Samsung feature sizes at 14nm. Over the last few years, we’ve started to see more and more manufacturers taking this route. Samsung’s 14nm technology is based on a respin of its original 20nm process, not the 20nm process it publicly reported when it first discussed the technology. It’s debuted multiple variants of 14nm, while TSMC has both 16nm and 16FF+. Intel has respun 14nm into 14nm+, and some rumors suggest the firm will do a third respin (14nm++). TSMC likely isolated some additional improvements it could make to its 16nm node and decided to adopt a new naming convention. Several years ago, I predicted we would begin to see more firms debuting their own methods of identifying process nodes as advances became more difficult and the speed of improvement fell. Samsung is positioning its 10nm node as a long-lived node, while TSMC believes its 10nm will be a short-lived process. Calling its new 16nm refresh “12nm” allows the company to appear to stay in near-lockstep with the rest of the industry, as opposed to falling behind it (even if that ‘falling behind’ is illusory and based in marketing nomenclature, not fact). Intel’s 10nm node will be smaller than Samsung’s, but Intel generally marches to the beat of its own drum. But we’re seeing a bit of jockeying for position and even different plans around specific nodes today that didn’t used to be the case. TSMC’s 12nm process will undoubtedly deliver some improvements over its 16FF+ node, but it’s not going to be the same as a full-node shrink, and the improvements may range from small to modest. I’m not too worried about how this could impact Volta, though. Nvidia has already demonstrated that it can deliver a new GPU on the same process node with significant performance improvements, and Volta could turn out to be a major advance over Pascal, even if its 12nm node is more of a 16nm tweak.

Ogg March 15, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open marginally higher on Wednesday, a morning that will probably be met with a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on in the day. Even with the bull market now eight years old, investors have managed to buy stocks on every pullback. Those same investors are also looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Some color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was reiterated as Outperform at RBC Capital Markets, but the firm raised its price target to $155 from $140 (versus a $138.99 prior close). Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $140.28 and the consensus analyst price target was last seen at $142.69. Finisar Corp. (NASDAQ: FNSR) closed down 4% at $25.69 on Tuesday but was indicated up 1.3% at $26.03 on Wednesday. It was raised to Buy from Hold at Jefferies, and the firm noted that it believes that the recent soft results and guidance and weakness in Finisar shares stem from technical product issues that likely will be resolved shortly and concerns around China where it is confident longer-term demand trends will be strong. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and the price target was slashed to $35 from $45 (versus a $35.18 close) at Credit Suisse. The firm likes the Mobileye rationale but feels the price of Intel is just too high. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) was raised to Hold from Underperform at Jefferies, but the firm is caving on a lower target by raising its target to $135 from $95 (versus a $143.19 close). This call is after Jefferies conducted a survey targeting consumers in Germany and India and found that the Netflix growth opportunity appears larger than the firm had expected. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Merrill Lynch. This is just a day after Credit Suisse gave a similar upgrade to Outperform. The 52-week range is $61.01 to $78.48. Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) was started as Underweight and assigned an $18 price target at Cantor Fitzgerald. The shares closed down 2.4% at $20.58 on Tuesday and were indicated down 2% more at $20.17 on Wednesday. Snap’s post-IPO range has been $20.15 to $29.44, and it priced at $17 per share.

DCU researchers have gained funding to develop the Recap project, along with Intel in Ireland and seven other agencies in Spain, Sweden and the UK. The aim of Recap is to develop the next generation of cloud, edge and fog computing, but with a preference towards the future of IoT, where estimates of the number of sensors by the end of the decade range up to multiple billions. Recap aims to find answers to improve the capabilities and capacity of future networks, through targeted research advances in cloud infrastructure .optimisation, simulation and automation The researchers will focus particularly on how to overcome the latency and delays arising from the growing usage between the end user and data centres. Recap will also incorporate a much more elastic model, which delivers services and allocates resources while being tied to time-varying user requirements. Theo Lynn, principal investigator for Recap at DCU, said: “Ireland plays an important role in the provisioning of cloud services through the various multinationals that host in – or base their data centres in – Ireland. “As our conceptualisation of the cloud and the benefits that the ‘internet of everything’ will bring evolves, new technologies are needed to support the quality of service that enterprises and consumers expect. “Recap is at the forefront of research in this area and will make a valuable contribution to the next generation of the cloud.” The project will run until January 2020.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Windows 10 VR Headsets Will Take PC Gaming To Another Level In 2017 Posted: Mar 15 2017, 5:48am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Technology News     There are a bunch of VR headsets available now, but new headsets from major companies are coming soon If you are a PC gamer you are probably already familiar with the VR headsets that are on the market today. These headsets are designed to be worn and pull you into video games with levels of immersion that aren't possible with other hardware. With a VR headset on your face, you are part of the video game and your view inside the game changes as you move your head around. Don't Miss: Find a NES Classic in stock online These headsets connect to your PC and replace the normal computer monitor you use when gaming. Eventually there will be things you can do with VR headsets other than gaming with augmented reality capability in the works to overlay data from your computer on the real world. If you have decided to step into the VR world with your Windows 10 compteur, there are some details you need to know. The first thing is that you need to be sure your PC has the brawn to run VR content. Your PC needs Windows 10 obviously, 4GB of RAM, a GPU that works with DirectX 12, a quad core CPU (dual core processors with Hyperthreading will work), and a USB 3.0 port. Keep in mind those are minimum specifications for your computer, better specs will deliver better performance and some goggles might require higher specs to function. The next thing you need is a VR headset and there are several on the market and more coming. This list runs down available Windows 10 VR headsets and some of them may also support other versions of Windows. New VR headsets from major Microsoft partners are due out this month. PIMAX 4K VR Headset This headset is notable because it has 4K resolution with 3840 x 2160p native resolution. It supports 806 ppi for perfect and clear video. It uses dual 53mm aspherical lenses that deliver a 110 degree FOV. The headset is lightweight at 290g and has 1000Hz dual gyroscopes. The headset also has a detachable 3.5mm headphone port, 40mm drivers and support for virtual 5.1 surround sound. People who need glasses can use this headset thanks to an adjustable lens distance. The headset is compatible with Windows 7, 8, and 10. It states an Intel Core i5 or higher processor is needed. An HDMI output is required for connectivity along with a USB port. Refresh rate is up to 90 Hz in asynchronous mode and 60hz in synchronous mode. The headset is available via Amazon for $399 and can be had at other retailers. 3Glasses Bluebur S1 3Glasses is one of the major VR partners with Microsoft that is set to launch cool VR goggles this year. One of the offerings from the command is the Blubur S2. these glasses have a 110-degree FOV and are designed to be adjustable for comfort with adjustable straps and soft padding. Native resolution for the headset is 2800 x 1440 with a 120Hz refresh rate. The goggles have Blue Light Cut tech inside that removes 99% of the short-wave blue light to protect eyesight. The goggles are made using a Sabic infrared transparent material and have integrated earphones for sound. You will need Windows 10, a Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and at least an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 video card. A DisplayPort 1.2 port and USB is needed for connectivity. Pricing is unknown. 3Glasses D2 2K VR headset The 3Glasses D2 VR headset has a 5.5-inch HD 2K display with 534 ppi, native resolution is 2K 2560 x 1440. The goggles have low latency and a high refresh rate to help reduce dizziness felt by some users. Latency is less than 13ms and refresh rate is 60Hz. The goggles can be used with glasses thanks to an adjustable pupil distance. FOV is 110-degrees and the lenses are coated with anti-blue light material. The goggles weigh 246g and have an ergonomic design for comfort. Pricing is unknown. Oculus Rift One of the best known names in Windows VR headsets is Oculus with its Rift headset. This is also one of the more expensive headsets available for Windows users ticking in at $598 with the touch controllers. The headset like most others does require a camera to track movement and that camera is included. Oculus' recommended specs for your computer to work with the headset include an NVIDIA GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 480 or higher video card. The processor needs to be an Intel i5-4950 or equivalent. Your machine needs at last 8GB of RAM and a HDMI 1.3 output. Connectivity recommendations include three USB 3.0 ports and a single USB 2.0 port and Windows 7 or higher for the OS. The Rift has an OLED display with 2160 x 1200 resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. The field of view is 110-degrees and the tracking area is 5 x 11 feet. Audio is integrated as is a mic. The headset works with the Oculus Touch or Xbox One controllers. HTC Vive Another well known and mainstream VR headset comes from HTC in the form of the HTC Vive. This headset has specs very similar to the Oculus Rift with an OLED screen, 2160 x 1200 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, 110-degree FoV, integrated audio, and a built-in mic. The Vive does have a larger tracking area measuring 15 x 15 feet. The Vive minimum requirements for your PC are a GTX 960 video card or Radeon RX 480 or higher. An Intel Core i5-4950 or higher CPU, 4GB or more RAM, HDMI 1.3 output, one USB 2.0 port, and Windows 7 or higher. Lenovo VR headset As of now we don't know all there is to know about the coming Lenovo VR headset. It was on hand at CES 2017 back in January and promises to ring in at around $300 making it much cheaper than either the Rift or the Vive. Since the Lenovo headset hasn't launched yet, there is a chance specs will differ when it lands. As of CES 2017, the specs included a target weight of around 350g, and a pair of 1440x1440 resolution OLED panels giving it better resolution than Rift and Vive. One big change for the Lenovo headset and all the the 2017 Microsoft VR headsets is that you won't need an external camera or sensor for tracking, all the sensors needed are inside the headset. Lenovo isn't offering any controllers for the headset whether, it's relying on third party offerings that meet Windows Holographic specs. We don't know exactly when this headset will launch. Other Windows 10 VR Headsets 2017 will be a big year for VR on the Windows 10 platform. Along with the Lenovo VR headset we just talked about, there will be new VR headsets coming from Acer, Asus, HP, 3Glasses, and Dell. All of these headsets will be part of Microsoft's big push and all will have internal sensors for motion tracking. Many of the VR headsets on this list are available for you to purchase right now. You tend to get what you pay for in the VR realm so be warned that other bargain headsets on the market might not perform well. The new VR headsets coming this year will likely outperform all the existing hardware, but the upside to newer and better headsets landing is that prices of existing VR headsets should fall.

Despite all the products so far on ARMv8, the server world continues to mature and to move forward.  The AppliedMicro X-Gene 3 Back in 2015, we reviewed the 40 nm 8-core X-Gene 1 (2.4 GHz, 45W), which found a home in HP's Moonshot processors. Performance wise the SoC was on par with the Atom C2750 (8 cores @ 2 GHz), but consumed twice as much power, which led in our review to an overall negative conclusion. The power consumption issue was understandable: it was baked on a very old 40 nm process. But the performance was rather underwhelming, as we expected more from a 4-issue superscalar processor at 2.4 GHz. The Atom core, by comparison, was only a dual-issue design and offered similar performance at a lower frequency. Moving forward, we got the X-Gene 2. This was a refresh of the first design, but built on 28 nm. It was still at 2.4 GHz, but with a lower power consumption (35 W TDP) and a smaller die size of around 100 mm².  Despite the relatively lackluster CPU performance, the overall efficiency increase meant that the X-Gene 2 did find a home in several appliances where CPU performance was not the top priority, such as switches and storage devices.  MACOM, the new owners of the X-Gene IP, claim that the new X-Gene 3 is a totally different beast. The main performance claim is that it should be >6 times faster in SPECintRate than X-Gene 1 or 2. That performance increase is mostly because the new SoC has 4 times as many cores: 32 rather than 8.  Besides the 32 ARMv8-A 64-bit cores in X-Gene 3, it will also include eight ECC capable DDR4-2667 memory channels, supporting up to 16 DIMMs (max. 1 TB), and 42 PCIe Gen 3.0 lanes.  MACOM's reference X-Gene 3 platform has everything working at near full speed: all 32 cores are functional and run as fast as 3.3 GHz. The SoC design gives 32 MB of L3 cache through a coherent network, and we are told is 'at full speed'. PCIe, USB and integrated SATA ports all work at full speed also. Memory is initially limited to 2400 MT/s instead of 2667 MT/s, but considering that the current memory market only offers buffered DDR4 DIMMs at 2400, that is not an immediate issue.  That set of specifications is impressive, but if the X-Gene 3 really wants to be a "Cloud SoC", performance has to be competitive. We look forward to testing. The ARM Competition The other two players are Cavium and Qualcomm.  Cavium has been on a buying spree as of late, acquiring Broadcom Vulcan IP and also Qlogic, a network/storage vendor. If Cavium can inject all that IP in it's Thunder-X server SoC line, its next generation could be a very powerful contender.  Qualcomm will have its 48-core Centriq-2400 SoC ready by the second half of this year, and it will run Windows Server.  Predicted Performance Analysis: Xeon-D Alternative The only performance figures for X-Gene 3 we have seen so far are the ones found in a Linley Group white paper that can be accessed here: Based on testing of the current configuration of 3.0GHz CPU frequency and DDR4-2400, the company expects the chip to deliver a SPECint_rate2006 (peak) score of at least 500 when running at its peak speed of 3.3GHz and DDR4-2667 and with some additional hardware and compiler tuning.  That benchmark value is the basis for the claim of "6x more powerful than the predecessor". We can somewhat predict how this can be possible, since SPECInt_Rate2006 scales almost perfectly: 32 cores instead of 8 already give us a 4 times increase. In order to get an overall 6x bump in performance then, each core must be (overall, including frequency) about 50% faster.  Most of the performance boost will come from the frequency: as the SoC can boost to 3.3 GHz on X-Gene 3 over the 2.4 GHz X-Gene 2, this translates to a 37.5% increase. The rest of the gains are most likely related to IPC improvement, in branch prediction and TLB architecture. All in all, 6 times higher performance is not an outrageous claim, but there are few snakes in the grass to consider.  Firstly, MACOM extrapolates from numbers at 3 GHz to 3.3 GHz. Thus the final frequency for the parts is still at the whim of tweaking and optimization, and may result in an increase in TDP over 125W. Also to note is that "additional hardware and compiler tuning is necessary", which is a general term for expected software improvements. While that might turn out to be true, other companies have promised similar and been unable to deliver, so until there's some proof it might be hard to determine at this point. Last year APM estimated that the new X-Gene 3 would achieve 550 SPECInt_Rate2006 at 3 GHz. That claim has been revised to 500 at 3.3 GHz.  The graph above also seems to show SPEC scores run with GCC, as most published scores place the Xeon E5-2580v4 at 669. While we favor results obtained with GCC too as they more realistic, based on experience we are wary that the graph above could paint a rosy picture of X-Gene's performance.  The Linley Group states:  “X-Gene 3 can handle a broad range of cloud workloads, including scale-up and scale-out applications. The processor excels on big data, particularly in-memory databases, because of its high memory bandwidth." The 8-channel 32 core X-Gene 3 achieves 67 GB/s. It is weird that the paper, written in March 2017, still mentions the use of DDR4-2133. If we compare the results to the typical Xeon scores we have measured in previous reviews, we get the following:  Our testing methodology is described here.  For those of you who are not familiar with Stream: the CPU does not matter much. When there are enough cores/threads to generate sufficient demand on the memory subsystem, the peak bandwidth numbers are observed regardless of additional cores (see testing done by Dell). In some circumstances adding more cores actually gets a net decrease. So despite including Intel's top model in the graph above, there is no performance benefit. The 8-channel X-Gene 3 achieves, with 32 cores, somewhere between 24% (compared to the best result of the Xeon in ICC) and 63% better bandwidth than a similar single Xeon system with DDR4 at the same speed. But an Intel system with the same amount of memory channels would still be better. For comparison, but not listed on the chart, in our test of a single CPU Power8 system, it achieved 91 GB/s due to its memory subsystem (using Centaur chips), despite our relatively simple GCC settings and the use of DDR3-1333. The X-Gene 3 bandwidth numbers are vastly superior to those of the X-Gene 1 (19 GB/s, see here), but it is worth noting that X-Gene 1 had only 4 channels using DDR3-1600.   The X-Gene 3 results are more than respectable, but the official quotes from the Linley paper that 'the processor excels on big data' would seem to come across as an exaggeration without any direct benchmark data to back it up. As always at AnandTech, we like to make conclusions on hard data, and look forward to being able to verify the claims. Conclusion From the announcement and released data, the new X-Gene 3 core would appear to be the fastest ARM-v8a server SoC announced in the market so far. The engineers behind X-Gene deserve some applause for their tenacity, and for gradually improving their product to the point where it is a serious threat to the lower to mid-end of the Xeon E5 range. But those numbers need to be externally verified. There are still a number of uncertainties, for sure. The bandwidth numbers are good, but not impressive. The power usage has not been tested, and only publishing SPECInt_rate2006 estimates (that already have been revised downwards) does not by itself as a guarantee of good overall server performance for the platform.  One thing is interesting: the arrival of the X-Gene 3 puts a lot of pressure on Intel's decision to artificially curtail the Xeon D* platform. Intel's fastest Xeon D (D-1587) offers lot of performance with 16 cores and 32 threads as 2.3 GHz, all inside a low 65W TDP - but the Xeon D has only 2 memory channels, can support only 128 GB of memory, and costs $1754 list price. *We say curtail, based on Xeon-D being based on Broadwell and rather than updating to the latest microarchitecture. Intel's recent release of new networking focused Broadwell-based Xeon-D parts suggests that an update to the platform might be far off in the distance. From what we can tell, the X-Gene 3 is rumored to cost less than $1200. At that price, it offers much more memory bandwidth and capacity, given its 8-channels and support for up to 1 TB. So although we have some reservations, we welcome the X-Gene 3 to be the cat among the Xeon D pigeons. Additional Images While at MWC, Anton was able to score some images of an X-Gene 3 system being demonstrated at the show. Despite it being a mobile show, given the size of ARMs presence, perhaps it might not be unexpected to see some of them on display. The unit was at the Kontron booth, and the date code on the heatspreader puts the manufacturing timing at 2016, week 53.   Gallery: X-Gene 3 at MWC Related Reading Applied Micro's X-Gene: The First ARMv8 SoC ARM Challenging Intel in the Server Market: An Overview X-Gene 1, Atom C2000 and Xeon E3: Exploring the Scale-Out Server World     Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

I'm reading the first paragraph and it's already barely readable. Wonder how the rest will be. HP's Moonshot processors = HP's Moonshot servers ... which in our review to an overall negative conclusion = which in our review led to an overall negative conclusion Reply Ian Cutress - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Sorry, I take responsibility for that - I edited the piece last night. Reply Yojimbo - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link I wonder who will end up buying the X-Gene line, as Macom said they will divest themselves of it. Reply rahvin - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Just like the HP Moonshot, no one at all. It'll cost more, use more power and perform less work than a cheaper Xeon if we can go by all the other Arm server attempts. Someone like Facebook might buy a few to serve a need that involves some specialized load but probably not. But ultimately I suspect it'll go the same way all the others have, they'll tape out, get to the test servers, realize no ones going to buy it and then dump it like a hot potato. There's a growing pile of ARM server chips that never were at this point. ARM's attempts to develop a real server spec that uses ACPI, UEFI and others might have a chance down the road but all these early attempts have been underwhelming and total failures and I suspect that's going to continue. Ultimately if one of them succeeds Intel will just pull a generation forward 6 months or cut prices so that it never has a chance. Reply webdoctors - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Is applied micro's server CPU still relevant? With AMD cores finally competitive, and their bargain basement pricing, most of the motivation for ARM servers is gone, the power advantages is negligible in IO heavy environments, and performance abysmal in other cases. Plus with AMD you're getting tried and true x86 compatible performance. The risk to jump to an ARM server now just doesn't make any sense. Reply Yojimbo - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Macom recently claimed they have interest and will complete the sale within the 100-day period after closing (Jan. 23 IIRC) they originally promised. Reply Yojimbo - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Macom is divesting themselves of the business. I wasn't asking who would buy the chips, but rather who would buy the business. Reply name99 - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link The obvious choice would be a Chinese company like Phytium. I would assume that legally this is OK, those with these high-tech sales it's always somewhat random whether the US govt will or will not see some security concern to the sale.

Previous Article Video: Watch AWS Try to Blow up Its Snowball Data Transfer Box Next Article Ascenty Secures $190M to Fund Data Center Construction in Latin America Microsoft Project Olympus server (Image: Microsoft) Blades, Data Center World, Featured, Microsoft, Open Compute Meet Microsoft, the New Face of Open Source Data Center Hardware by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 15, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet If you’re running a cloud platform at Microsoft’s scale (30-plus regions around the world, with multiple data centers per region) and you want it to run on the best data center hardware, you typically design it yourself. But what if there are ideas out there — outside of your company’s bubble — that can make it even better? One way to find them is to pop your head out as much as possible, but which way do you look once you do? There’s another way to do it, and it’s proven to be quite effective in software. We’re talking about open source of course, and Microsoft — a company whose relationship with open source software has been complicated at best — has emerged as a pioneer in applying the open source software ethos to hardware design. Facebook, which has been a massive force in open source software, became a trail blazer in open source data center hardware in 2011 by founding the Open Compute Project and using it to contribute some of its custom hardware and data center infrastructure designs to the public domain. But there’s been a key difference between Facebook’s move and the way things work in open source software. The social network has been open sourcing completed designs, not trying to crowdsource engineering muscle to improve its infrastructure. Late last year, Microsoft, an OCP member since 2014, took things further. In November, the company submitted to the project a server design that at the time was only about 50 percent complete, asking the community to contribute as it takes it to 100 percent. Project Olympus (that’s what this future cloud server is called) is not an experiment. It is the next-generation hardware that will go into Microsoft data centers to power everything from Azure and Office 365 to Xbox and Bing, and it’s being designed in a way that will allow the company to easily configure it to do a variety of things: compute, data storage, or networking. Learn about Project Olympus directly from the man leading the charge next month at Data Center World, where Kushagra Vaid, Microsoft’s general manager for Azure Cloud Hardware Infrastructure, will be giving a keynote titled Open Source Hardware Development at Cloud Speed. There’s a link between the design’s modularity aspect and the open source approach. Microsoft wants to be able to not only configure the platform for different purposes by tweaking the usual knobs, such as storage capacity, memory, or CPU muscle, but also to have a single platform that can be powered by completely different processor architectures — x86 and ARM — and it wants to have multiple suppliers for each — Intel and AMD for x86 chips, Qualcomm and Cavium (and potentially others) for ARM. The sooner all the component vendors get involved in the platform design process, the faster a platform will emerge that’s compatible with their products, goes the thinking. Read more: Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle “Instead of having a team do everything in-house, we can work with these folks in the ecosystem and then bring the solutions to market faster, which is where differentiation is,” Kushagra Vaid, general manager for Azure cloud hardware infrastructure, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. “So, it’s been a completely different development world from that standpoint versus what we used to do.” Making Data Centers Cheaper to Operate Microsoft has already seen the benefits of going the Open Compute route with its current- and previous-generation hardware developed in collaboration with suppliers. Project Olympus widens the pool of potential engineering brainpower it can tap into. About 90 percent of the hardware it buys today is OCP-compliant, meaning it fits the basic standard parameters established by the project, such as chassis form factors, power distribution, and other specs. It hasn’t always been this way. Microsoft’s Project Olympus servers on display at the Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara in March 2017 (Photo: Yevgeniy Sverdlik) The company started transitioning to a uniform data center hardware strategy for its various product groups around the same time it joined OCP. The goal was to reduce cost by limiting the variety of hardware the groups’ infrastructure leads were allowed to use. And Microsoft decided it would make that hardware adhere to OCP standards. So far, Vaid likes the results he’s seen. Standardization has helped the company reduce hardware maintenance and support costs and recover from data center outages faster. A Microsoft data center technician no longer has to be acquainted with 10 to 20 different types of hardware before they can start changing hard drives or debugging systems on the data center floor. “It’s the same hardware, same motherboards, same chassis, same racks, same management system, it’s so much simpler,” Vaid said. “They spend less time to get the servicing done. It means fewer man hours, faster recovery times.” One Power Distribution Design, Anywhere in the World Project Olympus is the next step in Microsoft’s pursuit of a uniform data center infrastructure. One of the design’s key aspects is universal power distribution, which allows servers to be deployed in colocation data centers anywhere in the world, regardless of the local power specs, be they 30 Amp or 50 Amp, 380V, 415V, or 480V. The same type of rack with the same type of power distribution unit can be shipped for installation in Ashburn, London, Mumbai, or Beijing. The only thing that’s different for each region is the power adaptor. This helps Microsoft get its global hardware supply chain in tune with data center capacity planning, and few things have more bearing on the overall cost of running a hyper-scale cloud – and, as a function of cost, end-user pricing — than good capacity planning. The less time passes between the moment a server is manufactured and the moment it starts running customer workloads in a data center, the less capital is stranded, which is why it’s nice to have the ability to deliver capacity just in time, when it’s needed, as opposed to far in advance to avoid unexpected shortages. “Essentially we can build a rack one time, and after it’s built we can very late in the process decide which data center to send it to, without having to worry about disassembling it, putting in a new PDU,” Vaid said. “It all delays the deployment.” Taking Cost Control Away from Vendors If the Project Olympus design was 50 percent done in November, today it’s about 80 percent complete. Vaid wouldn’t say when Microsoft is expecting to start deploying the platform in production. The company still maintains a degree of secrecy around timing of deployment of its various technologies. He also had no comment on the report that surfaced earlier this month saying Hewlett Packard Enterprise was expecting Microsoft to cut back on the amount of data center hardware it would buy from the IT giant. The report was based on anonymous sources, and Vaid pointed to the fact that HPE was listed as one of the solution providers involved in Project Olympus. HPE of course was one of several on the list, along with Dell, ZT Systems, Taiwanese manufacturers Wiwynn and Quanta, and China’s Inspur. That’s one of the biggest reasons behind OCP to begin with. The hyper-scale data center users drive the design, while the suppliers compete for their massive hardware orders, leaving little room for suppliers to differentiate other than on price and the time it takes to deliver the goods, flipping the world upside down for companies like HPE and Dell, who until not too long ago were enjoying market dominance. “We have full control of the cost,” Vaid said. “We can take what we want, we can take out what we don’t want, and the solution providers are just doing the integration and shipping.” Previous Article Video: Watch AWS Try to Blow up Its Snowball Data Transfer Box Next Article Ascenty Secures $190M to Fund Data Center Construction in Latin America Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Image Credit: EPC The $330 billion silicon chip industry is the foundation of everything electronic. But it’s slowing down as it reaches a new level of maturity, which is prompting a bunch of mergers and acquisitions. That’s why Alex Lidow, an industry pioneer and the chief proponent of an alternative material to silicon — gallium nitride (GaN) — feels that his time has come. His company, Efficient Power Conversion (EPC), is unveiling a new generation of eGaN chips that are half the size of previous chips and have significantly higher performance. “The bright light that we talked about two years ago, GaN, is now burning a whole lot brighter against a field of gray that is the semiconductor industry,” Lidow said in an interview with VentureBeat. Above: Alex Lidow, CEO of Efficient Power Conversion Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Lidow’s company is today introducing its enhancement mode eGaN transistors and integrated circuits that will be the heart of things like sensors for self-driving cars, components in wireless power tech that eliminates power cords, highly efficient data center chips, and new kinds of medical devices you can swallow that will diagnose your innards. Last year, EPC doubled its revenues, and Lidow believes the company will triple its revenues this year. “Gallium nitride offers probably the best performance versus cost of any power semiconductor material available today,” said Richard Eden, senior analyst for power semiconductors at market researcher IHS Markit Technology, in an email to VentureBeat. “The new EPC Gen5 devices released this week mark another major step forward, improving the power switching performance, efficiency, power density, cost, and size over the previous Gen4 products launched in 2014.” Above: GaN technology is advancing quickly in its quest to overtake silicon. Image Credit: EPC As we noted a couple of years ago, GaN chips have arrived at a time when Moore’s Law — the prediction by Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore that chips would double the number of transistors every two years — is slowing down. If GaN can stay on course, it could be a huge disruption for the industry and benefit consumers in a very big way. Lidow changed the chip industry once before in the late 1970s with power MOSFET chips. Those chips resulted in a 15 percent decrease in the global cost of energy. Efficient home appliances, air conditioners, energy-efficient lighting, and high fuel economy cars all use MOSFET technology. The new GaN chips (now in their fifth generation) are now about 15 times smaller than equivalently rated silicon MOSFET chips, which means they are much cheaper for the performance they deliver — three times the performance of the previous generation. “That’s initiating a virtuous cycle,” Lidow said. “At half the size of the previous generation and three times the performance, the smaller we get, the better it is. The better it is, the more people want it, and the better it gets adopted.” The products and development boards are available for immediate delivery at Digi-Key. “When you have a big leap, new applications come out of the woodwork,” Lidow said. One of the big ones is open compute dense servers, where companies like Facebook and Google put more and more servers in their data centers to deal with ever-increasing internet demand. EPC partner Texas Instruments is targeting a new series of products for big data center owners. Another market is for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, or remote systems that can sense the environment around them, akin to radar, by illuminating an area with a laser and analyzing the reflected light. These sensors are used in autonomous cars. Velodyne has announced a partnership with EPC to create low-cost $50 LiDAR systems. Just two years ago, the sensors were $75,000. Above: LiDAR sensors atop a self-driving car. Image Credit: EPC And within a year, Lidow believes we’ll see new laptops that use GaN technology from EPC. Those laptops will no longer have power cords and will receive charging currents via the USB-C port. Nobody is going to miss those power cords, Lidow said. Eden agreed that the future looks bright: “The 100-volt and 200-volt devices now offer even better performance and cost over the best, equivalent silicon MOSFETs. They should therefore accelerate adoption in a range of applications, such as AC-DC power suppliers and adapters, USB-C power transfer, server power supplies, 48-volt-load systems, LIDAR, and so on.” Lidow added, “We’re in volume shipments now. I’ve been flabbergasted at the progress of autonomous cars. The volume market is envelope tracking for 4G base stations, followed closely behind by LiDAR. Behind that is autonomous cars, and then DC-to-DC converters for servers.” Not bad for a company with just 42 employees. EPC has a partner in Taiwan that is making its chips. “This generates a vitality for the industry, generating billions of new stuff that consumers need to buy,” Lidow said. “As sure as the sun comes up, GaN will displace the majority of the silicon in the $30 billion power management chips market.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

On Tuesday, it introduced software to virtualize industrial applications at the edge of the network, letting enterprises gradually migrate from older M2M technology to modern systems that give them more flexibility. The platform, called Wind River Titanium Control, runs on commodity Xeon hardware and uses widely adopted cloud platforms such as OpenStack and KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). The company has validated hardware systems from major manufacturers to run Titanium Control and pre-validated virtual network applications through its Titanium Cloud Ecosystem, begun in 2014. Titanium Control is targeted at industries like manufacturing, energy and health care. Machines have been talking to other machines for decades, but before IoT, they used closed systems that couldn't take advantage of the internet or open-source development. IoT is designed to replace those vertical solutions with horizontal layers of technology available from multiple vendors. Virtualized cloud infrastructure could help companies make that transition. Some legacy M2M users are under pressure to do so because the older systems are starting to reach the end of their lives and demand difficult and expensive maintenance, Wind River says. Titanium Control is designed for on-premises cloud infrastructure that can operate alongside legacy industrial systems so enterprises can migrate old applications and services over time. In addition to OpenStack and KVM, it works with Linux and the Ceph distributed storage system. It also includes management tools for things like upgrading software and patching components without shutting down service, Wind River says. The platform can scale from two to more than 100 compute nodes. It can be used in architectures like fog computing that place processing at the edge of a network to minimize delays and network traffic, Wind River says. That serves one of Intel's other big goals in IoT, where it wants to sell chips into the potentially huge market of edge computing.

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS Search for: Google Pixel 2: Everything we know so far UPDATE 15:03: Codenames spotted – Can second time be the charm for Google’s flashy flagship? 15 March 2017 by Stuff Staff The Pixel was Google’s first internally-designed handset, and it got a lot of things right: the camera is amazing, it had the first crack at Android Nougat, and came with an Apple-like polish. Unfortunately, it also had an uninspired design, a very hefty price, and some component trade-offs compared to its top-end Android rivals. It was a strong first effort, though. Apple’s devices usually get significant improvements and refinements on the second go-round, and we’re expect much the same with Google’s iPhone-esque take on Android. Leaks and rumours are starting to trickle in ahead of an expected release later this year, and the upgrades sound promising. Here’s what we’ve heard so far. WHAT WE KNOW >>> Work is well underway Google doesn’t like to talk about upcoming hardware ahead of launch, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t clues to spot if you do some digging around online. The Android Open Source Project collaboration page is usually a good start, and has thrown up two codenames: “walleye” and “muskie”. Those are both fish, which match with Google’s choice of pre-release names for the Pixel and Pixel XL – Marlin and Sailfish. >>> It should be waterproof The iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 both embraced waterproofing, which is quickly becoming the standard for pricier flagships, but the Google Pixel opted not to implement it in the first model. Luckily, sources say that water and dust resistance are likely to be included with the Pixel 2. >>> The camera may improve The Pixel and Pixel XL already have one of the absolute best smartphone cameras on the market today, but unsurprisingly, Google plans to keep pushing the tech for the next round. A report claims that we won’t see a big megapixel bump (from 12.3MP), but that the Pixel 2 should have even better low-light performance and other feature enhancements. >>> It might cost more money This one’s a surprise, given the already-high price of the Pixel and some missing perks compared to other Android flagships, but 9to5Google says that Google expects the Pixel 2 to cost “at least” US$50 more than the original phone at launch (US$649 in the States). We had better see some significant feature additions to justify that jump. >>> Snapdragon-powered Google went with the top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 for the first Pixel, and it sounds like that trend may continue for the next one. A processor in the Snapdragon 830 line is expected, perhaps the powerful Snapdragon 835, although a report claims that Google has also tested out Intel chips, as well as custom chipsets. >>> No headphone jack? Surprise! Apple might not be the only big name looking to end the life of the humble headphone jack. Google could be planning a similar move, according to the latest leaked insider info. >>> Launching with Android O With the Pixel replacing the old Nexus line, the devices have become the vanguard for the latest and greatest versions of Android. And just as the Pixel was the first phone with the full release version of Android Nougat, we’ll probably see the Pixel 2 launch with Android O (8.0) out of the box. >>> There might be a cheaper one Remember the part above about the Pixel 2 being more expensive than the original? While that has been reported, so too has the existence of a cheaper, cut-rate Pixel. We’d expect something smaller and mid-range to compete with the likes of the OnePlus 3T, but unfortunately there aren’t any hard details at this point. Still, that’s a promising tidbit. >>> No word on the XL None of the reports so far mention a Pixel 2 XL to follow in the footsteps of the original plus-sized model, but we would be surprised to see Google drop it. The first Pixel XL has been consistently hard to find, and given the popularity of Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus as well, there’s definitely demand for bigger, feature-boosted options. >>> We’ll probably see it this autumn Google unveiled the first Pixel in early October 2016 and released it a couple weeks later, and there’s little reason to believe that the company will jump the gun with a sequel. Debuting it around the same time will give Google another chance to try and play off of the next iPhone announcement… and hopefully not look too much like a copy of it again. Senior VP of hardware Rick Osterloh confirmed as much at Mobile World Congress, saying that Google would be sticking to the mobile industry’s annual cycle for new releases. ALL THE LATEST NEWS >>> 15 March 2017 The Android Open Source Project collaboration page threw up two codenames, which are likely the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. Muskie and Walleye are both fish, which lines up with the old codenames for the Pixel and Pixel XL. That means Google is well and truly underway in developing their respective replacements. >>> 07 March 2017 A report from 9to5Google suggested that Google may be looking to follow in Apple’s footsteps and ditch the headphone jack with the Pixel 2. This would be a huge step, as few other Android phones (from big-name brands here in the UK, at least) have taken the leap. HTC has done it, though, and seeing how it was responsible for building the original Pixel, there could be a grain of truth here. >>> 02 March 2017 News filtered out of Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress show this week, with Google’s Senior VP of hardware Rick Osterloh confirming the Pixel 2 was real, and that it would be arriving at some point this year. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” AndroidPit also managed to get him to say that the Pixel’s successor would “stay premium”. >>> 26 January 2017 9to5Google has a big report out today, citing a previously reliable source who has purported leaked details on the Pixel 2. The source claims that waterproofing is on the table as a feature, that the camera will see low-light improvements (and maybe more), that a cheaper version is also in the works, and that the main model will probably see a price bump.

Search Driving Search Home News Reviews Road Tests Comparisons Buyer's Guide Special Sections Auto Shows Classic Cars Green Cars Lifestyle Motor Mouth New Car Deals Safety and Maintenance Supercars Car Comparison   Search HOME / Auto News / News / For Canada’s auto startup companies, financing is all relative Getty Images Being second to the U.S. in getting funded sounds great, but much work is left to be done by  Jared Lindzon  | 2 days ago Small Medium Large Technology trends research firm CB Insights recently reported that startup financing for automotive technology companies surpassed $1 billion worldwide in 2016, and that only the United States enjoyed a greater share than Canada. While this may seem like a big accomplishment for this country’s burgeoning automotive technology startups, however, it’s one that comes with a few asterisks. On the one hand, Canadian startups — such as LeddarTech in Quebec City, which develops high-end laser scanners and obstacle detectors for autonomous vehicles, or KeyFree in Toronto, which is replacing car keys with smartphones to support car sharing services — have out-fundraised companies in countries with longstanding automotive traditions in recent years, including Japan and Germany, while inching ahead of those with renowned startup ecosystems, such as France and Israel. But when you consider the fact that 68 per cent of all auto tech startup financing between 2012 and 2016 went to companies based in the United States, Canada’s second-place finishing share of 7 per cent seems a little less exciting. “Canada did have a solid showing in terms of deals going to Canada-based startups,” said CB Insights’ automotive trends analyst Kerry Wu. “However, it’s important to remember that this measure is just tracking financings going to private companies, and the balance of Canadian auto tech startups are still relatively young.”  RELATED Intel buys Mobileye, instantly becomes giant in autonomous car arena Wu explains that countries with well-established automotive industries, such as Germany, Japan and South Korea, “have large incumbents who are now plowing billions into internal research and development and have advanced their programs significantly,” as opposed to Canada’s more startup-based ecosystem.  Canada’s startups, however, do have some advantages in the world of automotive technology development, including its relative proximity to both Detroit automakers and Silicon Valley venture capitalists. “U.S. investors were involved in over a third of all 2016 seed-stage deals to Canadian VC-backed companies, and their participation increases for startups with greater capital needs at expansion and later stages,” said Wu, adding that instead of being an independent leader, Canada’s automotive technology startups are “playing a [smaller] part in a bigger picture.” Vancouver-based connected car technology startup Moj.io, for example, closed a $15 million series A investment round in 2016, and is backed by e-commerce giant Amazon, German telecommunications provider Deutsche Telekom, and Toronto-based VC firm Relay Ventures, among others. Over the past year the company has ballooned from less than 20 employees to 44, divided among their Vancouver, Palo Alto and Prague offices, and expects to come close to doubling again over the next 12 months. Moj.io provides a cloud-based connected car platform to utilize the onboard diagnostics port that exists in approximately 530 million cars in North American and Europe alone. The platform allows telecom companies to provide connected car services to customers, even if they didn’t sign up for those capabilities when they purchased their car. “When a customer signs up, for example, to the T-Mobile Sync Up Drive service, they get high-speed Wi-Fi in the car, they get safety and security knowing where the car is, if it’s safe to drive, if anybody has bumped, towed or stolen their car, and in the future they’ll get insurance discounts,” explained the company’s CEO, Kenny Hawk. Hawk says that it’s not just U.S. funds that are bolstering the country’s auto tech startups. The successes that they’ve enjoyed recently may also be built on the legacies of technology companies past. “You’ve got Blackberry, Nortel, a lot of research was done in the wireless sector in Canada, both in the West and the East,” he says. “Think about the size of those companies; all those people didn’t just disappear, they’re still around and have experience.” Another advantage Canada’s automotive tech startups enjoy are the government programs that support research and innovation for early stage companies. As CEO of the first company to receive funding through the BC Tech Fund — which dedicated $100 million in venture capital funds to invest in emerging technology companies throughout the province — Hawk praises the provincial and federal governments for taking proactive steps in transitioning the country away from old automotive economy. “It would be very easy to just focus on the natural resources, but we’ve seen the sort of swings that industry can have. It’s boom or bust. Technology is the future,” he said. “They’re making investments in the future, and I think it will accelerate under Justin Trudeau.” RELATED Autonomous cars don't make sense for the rest of us While Canadian CEOs in the automotive tech industry praise the federal government’s shift towards new technology, however, some still feel that more should be done in order to stay competitive with the United States. “I think what’s lacking is just more stimulation from the government to really inject money into this space, even more than they’re already doing,” said Karim Ali, cofounder of Algocian, a Toronto-based AI company developing camera sensor technology for autonomous vehicles. “I think they’re already doing a great job, but they need to do a better job. If you look at what the U.S. government does for startups, they have billions of dollars every year that go to innovation grants that any company can apply for and many companies rely on.”  Unlike other cloud-connected sensors and cameras that rely on Internet connectivity, Algocian is developing AI software that lives inside the camera, and can identify obstacles such as cars and pedestrians in any weather condition, with no additional hardware. Founded less than two years ago and currently housed in Ryerson University’s Digital Media Zone, the three-person operation raised a “small” undisclosed round this year combining government grants, angel investment and private capital from Detroit-based VC firm Fontinalis. The company also earned $120,000 and three months of accelerator mentoring through Ford Motor Company’s Techstars Mobility program.  For now, much of Canada’s automotive technology startups depend on funding from the government at its earliest stages, and support from U.S. investors as they mature, but maintain a relatively significant and growing role in the automotive technology ecosystem. “I don’t think anyone is self-sufficient. I don’t think the U.S. is self-sufficient. Everybody does their part, and in Canada, this report [by CB Insights] shows we are doing a good job,” said Ali. “There’s innovation here, there’s a talent pool here, and there’s a culture that is being developed around startups and innovation. I think we’re going of see more of that.”   You may also like...

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD maintains Windows 10 Scheduler is not limiting… AMD maintains Windows 10 Scheduler is not limiting Ryzen CPU performance By Jon Martindale — March 13, 2017 4:50 PM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here AMD Ryzen 7 1800X MSRP $499.99 DT Recommended Product Learn More Why it matters to you Ryzen CPU performance is likely to improve over the next few months, whether the Scheduler is to blame for problems or not. Some sources claim that AMD’s Ryzen CPUs could perform better in Windows 10 except for the way the operating system incorrectly handles Ryzen’s simultaneous multi-threading (SMT). We’re told that instead of leaving it to the smaller tasks, it lumps them right in with the main cores, which can result in a real dip in performance. However, not everyone agrees. Intel has been offering hyper-threading as one of its CPU features for a long time — that’s part of why it has maintained a performance lead over AMD for many years. Ryzen introduced SMT as its alternative multi-threading technology and it works well, but some research suggests that Windows 10’s Scheduler doesn’t seem to realize that those virtual cores aren’t as capable as the real ones, so when it doesn’t prioritize physical cores over the SMT ones, it is artificially holding Ryzen CPUs back. For some reason, the Scheduler also seems to think that Ryzen CPUs have as much as 136MB of cache, whereas in reality, they have 20MB of L2+L3 cache, according to WCCFTech. AMD is said to be aware of this issue. More: Ryzen proves the PC industry can no longer ignore AMD’s comeback PCPer, on the other hand, had provided some pretty solid evidence that the Scheduler is not to blame, and now AMD has officially commented on its own research. Simply put, AMD does not believe that Windows 10 has a thread scheduling problem that’s contributing to poor performance. It posted the following on its community site: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for ‘Zen,’ and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture. “As an extension of this investigation, we have also reviewed topology logs generated by the Sysinternals Coreinfo utility. We have determined that an outdated version of the application was responsible for originating the incorrect topology data that has been widely reported in the media. Coreinfo v3.31 (or later) will produce the correct results. “Finally, we have reviewed the limited available evidence concerning performance deltas between Windows 7 and Windows 10 on the AMD Ryzen CPU. We do not believe there is an issue with scheduling differences between the two versions of Windows. Any differences in performance can be more likely attributed to software architecture differences between these OSes.” While some are recommending that gamers use Windows 7, as that OS purportedly doesn’t suffer from the same issues as Windows 10 does when running the new hardware, AMD clearly does not agree. While the company doesn’t discount the possibility that Windows 10 could be performing different than Windows 7, it says a thread scheduler is not causing the issue. Note that if you do decide to run Windows 7, then make sure you confirm that your motherboard manufacturer has released Windows 7 compatible drivers for your board. While disabling SMT in the BIOS has been asserted to improve gaming performance under Windows 10, AMD’s statement would seem to refute that finding. Updated on 3-13-2017 by Mark Coppock: Added AMD statement that the Windows 10 scheduler is not causing Ryzen performance issues.

Business & Tech Pexels 9:43 15 Mar 2017 Joseph Conroy 1 day ago Recruitment firm Indeed has ranked Ireland’s top companies to work for, based on the employee reviews on its website. Dell has emerged as Ireland’s top company based on this analysis of employee posts reflecting their views of issues including pay, flexible working arrangements, training and opportunities for career progression. Top multinationals such as Apple, Google and Intel appear in the top ten on the list, but it also contains a significant number of retailers including Debenhams at number two. Argos, Centra, Penneys, Marks & Spencer, Super Valu and Centra all make the list - as well as fast food chain McDonald's in 21st place. Paul D’Arcy, Senior Vice President for Marketing at Indeed joined Vincent Wall on Breakfast Business to discuss the report. Pexels "We hear about flexibility even more than salaries," he told Newstalk - adding that this is one of the main perks sought by Irish workers who put a high value on a healthy work/life balance. Mr D'Arcy said that opportunities to develop a career path and the presence of inspirational characters in leadership positions also rank highly - along with the location of a position and the money on offer. He commented that the presence of retail firms next to cash-rich multinationals shows that, "creating a great workplace is, in many ways, a choice that organisations make. It is an investment available to anyone." Marie Moynihan, Senior Vice President of Global Talent Acquisition at Dell said: "We are delighted that through employee reviews Dell is being recognised as the best company to work for in Ireland by Indeed. Dell EMC sites across Limerick, Cork and Dublin support our whole business across EMEA and having highly engaged, motivated staff is a vital element of success. "As a company, we’re very focused on ensuring we create a fun, open environment where our employees can be themselves, innovate, enjoy their job and grow their capabilities and career at Dell. We provide flexible working options for employees to allow them to find a better balance between work and personal commitments.

As part of Arrow's vision of guiding and connecting innovators, entrepreneurs, customers and suppliers in the IoT design-to-production journey, the event attracted over 500 attendees from all sections of the IoT ecosystem in Hong Kong and China. According to "Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Hong Kong and Shenzhen Report 2016-17"1 released last month by the business school professors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University, the entrepreneurship in Hong Kong and Shenzhen was at a 206% and 284% increase from 2009 to 2016 respectively. The report findings indicated that both districts have the utmost potential to emerge as a key entrepreneurial innovation cluster hub. However, the incubation of some ideas lags behind due to the limited resources of engineering expertise, as well as large-scale yet affordable production capabilities in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, on the other side of the river, Shenzhen is not only a global mass-market electronics-manufacturing center, but also a vast electronics market for IoT consumer innovations and enterprises solutions. With its many years of experience in providing end-to-end IoT product lifecycle solutions in the APAC region, Arrow is bridging the two cities by creating a point of convergence for some of the brightest IoT startups, entrepreneurs and enterprises to advance IoT development. "Arrow has long supported technology innovation in Hong Kong and China. Our engineering expertise and IoT industry reputation, especially in the greater China area, can definitely assist IoT startups in removing key barriers and connecting them with the ecosystem players on their road to innovation entrepreneurship and social impact," said Simon Yu, president of Arrow's components business in the Asia-Pacific region. 1-http://www.cpr.cuhk.edu.hk/en/press_detail.php?1=1&id=2455 Arrow's IoT Innovations event provided an exchange platform for IoT businesses in China and Hong Kong to collaborate. In addition to startups and entrepreneurs, Arrow invited more than 50 local and international technology manufacturers of all sizes. IoT solution providers and systems integrators, design houses, and global technology suppliers included Analog Devices, Cypress, Honeywell, Infineon, Intel, Nexperia, NXP, ON Semiconductor, Qualcomm, and STMicroelectronics, among others. During the collaboration showcase session, leaders and specialists shared their opinions on the enhancement of over 100 products and solutions presented on site, such as Heartisans, Woofaa, and Cwlinux. Guiding IoT Startups Forward Heartisans, a startup producing life-saving wearable devices that monitor the heart conditions of heart disease patients, is among the first to partner with Arrow. "Our key innovations are a machine learning algorithm that is capable of determining the risk of a cardiac arrest five to 10 minutes in advance, and measuring blood pressure without an inflatable cuff with pulse transit time. Arrow's engineering expertise and consultation from proof-of concept, to hardware components selection to system integration enable us to significantly reduce product development cycle time and cost. A solution showcase like this is an incredible platform to connect us with exciting manufacturing capabilities in bringing our products to the hands of consumers," said Tim Lui the co-founder of Heartisans. Marc Chow, whose company Woofaa is developing an indoor electronic air quality monitor that can be a part of a sensor network for wireless real-time monitoring, control, and data analysis, also shared his views on the collaboration with Arrow: "I have a building engineering environmental background but I know very little about electronics engineering. Arrow gave us a lot of guidance on fields across wireless connectivity, sensing, systems integration, and data management and connected us with a vast network of IoT technology partners and resources. Their support has assisted us in overcoming hardware design challenges and accelerated our product development process. Arrow's event was an invaluable opportunity for us to engage face-to-face with some of the world's leading IoT experts and vendors and we look forward to collaborating with them on our next IoT idea," Chow showed the finished product during the presentation. End-to-end IoT Offerings Success in IoT takes more than innovative ideas and designs and remarkable production; it also requires a sound IoT ecosystem to further drive IoT development. "STMicroelectronics offers a unique portfolio of everything from analog and mixed-signal components, connectivity, microcontrollers, power and energy management, and sensors to help develop applications for IoT. Combined with Arrow's end-to-end IoT capabilities and solutions, we are well positioned to help tech companies and startups create the kind of smart IoT devices that bring us a greener, safer, more convenient and enjoyable lifestyle," said Salvatore Settinieri, STMicroelectronics' vice president of Distribution for Asia-Pacific region. Among the latest IoT solutions and tools on showcase is Arrow-built DragonBoard™ 410c, which is based on the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 410 processor. It is a high-performance and low-cost development board designed to support rapid software development and prototyping. It is ideal for creating embedded computing and IoT products, including next-generation robotics, cameras, medical devices, vending machines, smart buildings, digital signage and gaming consoles, among others. With the addition of IBM's Watson IoT Platform, DragonBoard 410c developers can quickly create, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud--without having to deal with any complicated, underlying infrastructure.

By Austin Wright and Seung Min Kim 03/15/17 12:35 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Lindsey Graham lacks the resources and access that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have to investigate Russia’s meddling in the presidential election. But his Senate Judiciary subcommittee has something the intelligence panels don’t: a Republican chairman viewed not as a Donald Trump ally but as a fierce critic, who has no qualms with bucking party leaders to unravel the mystery of Russia’s interference in the election. Story Continued Below Graham and his Democratic partner, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, will seize the spotlight Wednesday during a public hearing on Russia’s election interference, to be held by Graham’s Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which has jurisdiction over the FBI. Graham and Whitehouse plan to use their perch to help ensure the public gets a full accounting of Russia’s intrusion and any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The bipartisan duo already has its first target: getting the FBI to clear up Trump’s claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower in the run-up to the 2016 election. They sent a letter last week to the Justice Department asking it to turn over information that would confirm or refute Trump’s accusation — including warrant applications and court orders. The House Intelligence Committee is seeking the same information and so far neither has been able to shake it loose. Politics Why Trump's prosecutor purge could haunt the GOP By Daniel Strauss Graham suggested Tuesday there would be consequences if the FBI continues stonewalling Congress — and said he plans to make an announcement at the start of the hearing on Wednesday warning the bureau to comply. “If they don't honor this request and give us an answer, then I would say that we need a joint select committee because the regular order is not working,” Graham told reporters. “They’re about to screw up big time if they keep running to the Intel Committee and not answer that letter.” Whitehouse appears more optimistic that he and Graham will get answers. In an interview with POLITICO, he said the senators got some clarity on the FBI probe after meeting with Comey privately earlier this month — the same day Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he was recusing from any investigations involving Russia and the 2016 presidential campaign. “We said look, we’re going to go ahead with our hearing on the 15th, just let us know by then,” Whitehouse said, recalling the March 2 meeting with Comey. “I think he implicitly confirmed that they are looking at this and he said he’d get us a clearer explanation by [the Wednesday hearing]. That was satisfactory to both of us.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated Tuesday he would not object if Graham’s panel decides to issue subpoenas to force the FBI to turn over the requested information. “Graham is involved in an investigation of this effort, and I would not try to direct him how to do that,” McConnell said. “The core of the investigation, as you know, and we’ve said repeatedly, is being done by the Intelligence Committee. I think they will pursue whatever angles they need to pursue to get to a conclusion.” In an interview, Whitehouse said there are key advantages to his joint investigation with Graham, more limited though it may be. For one, their subcommittee can operate in public, freed from the constraints of dealing with classified information. And the scope of their investigation is broader than it may appear at first blush, considering the FBI’s central role in federal probes looking into Russian connections. “I do think it’s important that there be a public effort so that people can understand that Congress is in fact doing its job, and there is a forum where an investigation or information that can be discussed publicly has its day,” Whitehouse said. “We have oversight over the FBI and the FBI is all over this. So wherever they can go, we can go.” Congress House investigators on a Trump-Russia 'collision course' By Austin Wright Graham, meanwhile, said the subcommittee investigation is “going to find out all things Russia,” noting that he and Whitehouse are both former prosecutors. “I couldn’t have a better partner than Sen. Whitehouse," he said. “We’re trying to build a case,” Graham added. “So, this is what Russia's doing in other places. Then we're going to dig into what they did here.” Graham said the probe would focus “on what laws may have been broken by the Russians and if we don't have laws to protect from this kind of stuff, we're going to need to create some.” The South Carolina senator has emerged as one of Trump’s top GOP critics on Capitol Hill, along with his close friend, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.). Running against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, Graham called the real estate mogul a “jackass.” Since then, he has criticized Trump’s original travel ban executive order, blasted his overtures to Russia and slammed the administration’s proposed cuts to the State Department. At the same time, Graham praised Trump after having lunch with him last week and has backed Trump’s call for increased defense spending. Regardless, Graham is not up for reelection again until 2020, so he has no need to fear a primary challenge any time soon. His willingness to buck Trump has also won him plaudits from Democrats, who view him as more independent than the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.). Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

He knows how legal proceedings work and is very adept.” The intelligence panels are conducting their own wide-ranging investigations into Russia’s election meddling, and Graham acknowledged these committees have more resources and much greater access to classified information. But the intelligence committee investigations are also viewed with suspicion by Democrats. Nunes and Burr were staunch Trump backers during the presidential campaign and agreed to White House requests last month to call reporters to rebut news reports alleging frequent contacts between Trump associates and Moscow. "I’m more confident in Lindsey's approach," Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, said in an interview. "I hope that Richard Burr proves me wrong, but Sen. Graham has been outspoken on many of these issues and I’ve worked with him closely so I have a lot of confidence in him." For his part, McCain said he has a lot of trust in Graham and is glad Graham will have a role in investigating Russia’s election meddling. “I know that these kinds of — if the word is right, scandal — these kinds of investigations always lead to more information,” McCain said. “I just think there are more questions out there that haven't been answered.” Elana Schor contributed to this report.

The MyKronoz ZeTime, one of our top picks from Mobile World Congress, features physical hands built into a standard smartwatch. Now, Tag Heuer has unveiled a wearable that can be both digital and mechanical: the Connected Modular 45. Rumors surfaced last month that the luxury watchmaker would be releasing a follow-up to last year’s $1500 Connected device. As predicted, CEO Jean-Claude Biver announced the $1600 Android Wear 2.0 watch today, which, as the name suggests, is incredibly customizable; you can even swap out the smart module and replace it with a traditional, mechanical head – either the Calibre Heuer 02T or the Calibre 5. The Connected Modular 45 comes with GPS, NFC, and is water-resistant up to 50 meters. There are 56 variations of the watch available, with customization options that include aluminum, ceramic, rose gold, diamonds, and steel finishes for the digital face, along with various types of buckles, bracelets, and lugs. No word yet on how many of them come with the base version of the device, though. "For the choice of strap alone, there are no fewer than 18 references available, made from rubber, natural leather or anthracite gray leather, titanium or ceramic," said TAG. The Connected Modular 45’s 1.39-inch AMOLED touchscreen is powered by Intel’s AtomZ34XX processor, a chip designed for smartphones and tablets. All that processing power will come in use when Intel adds AI features to the watch later this year through some new apps. It also features Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, and 4GB of internal storage. You'l get around 30 hours’ battery life and, thanks to Android Wear 2.0, it can be used with an iPhone. Despite being an expensive luxury, high demand for the first Connected Watch forced Tag Heuer to increase production. It may be $100 more expensive, but the customization options, ability to switch between digital and mechanical faces, and the high-end hardware contained within could make the Connected Modular 45 an extremely sought after wearable.

Junko Yoshida, EETimes 3/15/2017 00:01 AM EDT PARIS -- Intel’s Mobileye acquisition Monday has stirred mixed emotions and contrasting reviews among those who cover the industry. Excitement, puzzlement, surprise, fear, confidence and some disappointment. One of the most scathing comments came from Semiconductor Advisors LLC, financial and strategic advisory services: Even though Intel tried to suggest a strong link to Intel's data center business we find little to no synergy as there is no direct uplift of the data center business. This suggests that Intel is taking a leap of faith to go very far outside its core business franchise. This can also be viewed as an admission that the core Semi business is not likely getting significantly better any time soon and that the company needs something new to jumpstart growth.

The survey is based on thousands of employee reviews listed on Indeed, with tech firms and international retailers making up the bulk of the top 25. Apple, Google and Intel are listed in the top ten, as is Debenhams, Oxfam, Next, Argos and Marks and Spencers. Penneys is the highest ranking Irish-headquartered firm, coming in at number ten. Paul D’Arcy, Senior Vice President for Marketing at Indeed, said that while salary is a major factor in determining workplace satisfaction, it is only one of a number of criteria on which employees judge their employer.  "Increasingly we see that the modern workforce optimises for happiness. Offering part-time and flexible hours, or even remote working, helps staff to achieve a better work/life balance," Mr D'Arcy said. "Our data also spotlights a positive company environment and good management as key factors in making a company a great place to work," he added.
