Qudos Arena is the venue for Australia’s first Extreme Masters eGaming tournament. Brands such as Intel, St George, Budweiser, Telstra and Virgin, Velocity, Dolby and even sports car manufacturer McLaren are now looking to the world of eGaming as a path into a connected audience, passionate about games. The strength of the market is being tested in Sydney this weekend with the first ever eGaming stadium event expected to draw thousands of game lovers to Sydney’s Olympic park to watch professional gamers fight it out for a six figure prize package. Tim McGregor, managing director of promoter TEG Live, which has brought the Intel Extreme Masters to Australia for the first time – hoping to replicate the model that sees tens of thousands of fans attend events in the US, Asia Europe and Asia, while hundreds of thousands more tune into tournaments through broadcast platforms such as Twitch. “Our intent is to position it as a legitimate sport,” McGregor told Mumbrella “Once that happens in this country it transcends into something which is of mainstream interest because sport lovers in thins country, if they know that they are watching the world’s best, and even better if the world’s best happens to include some Australians, then they gravitate towards it.” Promoter Tim McGregor says Australian sponsors interested in eSports. McGregor said building on the existing audience would create opportunities for brands to get involved. “Pretty much everyone we have spoken to has a strong interest in getting involved and so what we are looking to do is to put together some long-term partnerships and how this might flesh out over the journey,” he said. “It’s going to be a really interesting process because they know there is a large audience of 18-24-year-old males – one of the hardest demographics to reach – they certainly are very interested to see how the event is delivered.” One of the earliest major sponsors to tap into eGaming was Intel, which uses the sport to drive sales of its processors to gamers who use high end computers. Intel marketing director says brand hopes to make games a permanent event in Australia. Marketing manager Anna Torres said on the back of the popularity of broadcasts of eGames – with more than 700,000 views from Australia of a major tournament in Europe last year – the local market was ready for investment from sponsors. “The Australian market is just massively growing in numbers,” Torres said. “It’s a very natural extension for Australia bringing  the Intel Extreme Masters. The event is a massive halo over the brand.” Jonathan Simpson-Bint, founder of IGN.com and now chief commercial officer for gaming streaming platform Twitch, said that streaming of live games and events was opening the door to a very hard to reach demographic. Twitch has evolved into a media platform where players can stream their games live, create content such as game guides, and where major tournaments are also broadcast. “We live in a world of human attention. Not just now people in the media, people in business, we are all competing for slices of an ever-more difficult, ever more rarified piece of human attention,” Simpson-Bint told Mumbrella. Twitch’s Jonathan Simpson-Bint sees huge Australian audiences on the platform. “Twitch has got 120m globals users, every month and the average Twitch user spends 106 minutes per day on Twitch. That is a huge slice out of that attention pool.” He said that the finite pie of attention was being sliced ever thinner. “When I was a kid back in the 80s the pizza pie of my attention was four slices – it was school, homework, soccer and TV and that was about it.” “But the teenagers living in my house today, their pizza pie is cut up into probably two dozen little slivers – TV, school, homework, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Netflix, Hulu – you name it. I live in the same house as these kids and its virtually impossible to get their attention.” The platform has evolved as a conduit for millennials and Simpson-Bint said advertisers looking to connect were getting involved. “The biggest categories of advertisers we have had have been games companies, obviously, entertainment businesses such as movie studios, cable channels,” he said. Other categories include quick service restaurants. St George Bank represents a new partnership in the Australian market with the banks supporting a competitive gaming league. “One of the things that appeals to people about Twitch and appeals to big brands is they have this opportunity to do something for the community so a lot of big brands do cool things with us, they don’t just come along and whack people over the head with a message, they try and do things such as sponsor tournaments, sponsor streamers and sponsor influencers.” Mumbrella will be tackling a range of sports marketing issues including the future of sports broadcasting at the Mumbrella Sports Marketing Summit on July 21.

Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 5/5/2017 00:01 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the "heterogeneous integration of different technologies" to push economic growth. The Intel people might as well keep insisting that Moore’s Law isn’t dead, and that their 14-nm chip can pack more transistors than their rivals.  That’s Intel being Intel, with a narrative that serves its purpose. But this story doesn’t necessarily apply to other chip companies looking for a better valuation. Node names have become meaningless. The death of Moore’s Law has been greatly exaggerated, leaving no clear alternative law for chip designers to believe and blindly follow. The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the “heterogeneous integration of different technologies” to push economic growth, according to Nicky Lu,  chairman, CEO and founder of Etron Technology. In short, it’s time to stop using Moore’s Law as a security blanket.   Late last month when I saw Lu in Taipei, he launched a long disquisition on how Moore’s Law “has already gone virtual,” with Intel’s introduction of a “non-planar” transistor structure for its 22nm technology. Niky Lu (Pohto: EE Times) Lu suspects that Intel wouldn’t appreciate him calling Moore’s Law “virtual.” But Moore’s Law, in his opinion, long ago stopped serving chip engineers as a technology guide. Instead, Moore’s Law has been serving the investment community as “an economic law that justifies return on investment,” he explained. As long as investors use it as a yardstick for the semiconductor industry’s growth, chip vendors feel they can’t afford to acknowledge the obsolescence of Moore’s Law. Even Lu doesn’t exactly declare Moore’s repeal. But it’s important for the semiconductor industry to acknowledge that the industry “changed the rules of the game” when Intel -- followed by TSMC and Samsung -- opted for a tri-gate structure [known as FinFET], Lu noted. “The semiconductor industry replaced line scaling (transistor size) with area scaling (miniaturizing the unit area),” thus fundamentally changing the very nature of Moore’s Law, Lu said.  In Lu’s view, it’s critical to recognize that the semiconductor industry is no longer following the original template. Moore’s Law survived not by the shrinkage of the traditional transistor, but by riding variety of techniques -- including advancements in packaging.

Self-Driving Cars Feel Like Death Traps - Can We Be Convinced Otherwise? Kristen V. Brown May 5, 2017, 2:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  automotive autonomous cars intel self-driving cars technology Share Since we're all friends here on the internet, I'll let you in on a little secret: I hate driving. I drive too slowly, lurch violently when I change lanes, and the thought of having to merge onto a speeding California highway makes my heart speed up a little even as I write this. I'm no good at driving and never have been. Delphi's autonomous car outfitted with Intel technology. Image: Intel All of this should probably make me an enthusiastic supporter of emergent self-driving car technology. And yet, as I sat in the backseat of an autonomous Audi outfitted with the latest tech from Intel and Delphi for a test-drive, I was instead overwhelmed by mistrust and suspicion. Had my driver been a human, I probably would have marvelled jealously at the fact that the car maintained perfect speed and actually signalled before every turn. Instead, when it changed lanes too abruptly before a right turn once, I remarked to my tour guide that the ride was just a tad too bumpy. The car was definitely a much better driver than I will ever be. But for the price of putting my trust in a machine, that still didn't seem quite good enough. On Wednesday, at Intel's San Jose headquarters, the company opened the doors to its new research centre for autonomous vehicles to the press, and showed off the first of 40 BMW 7 Series self-driving cars that any day now will join the fleets of autonomous vehicles on the Bay Area's roads. Intel is building the computing platforms for cars in partnership with the car technology company Delphi and Mobileye, which makes vision systems for self-driving cars. Intel wants to be the brains inside every single autonomous vehicle out there. At the event, it showcased its latest attempts to overcome the many technical hurdles to getting autonomous vehicles on the road, including efforts to develop a bonafide 5G wireless network that moves massive amounts of car sensor data between cars and the cloud, to make a power-efficient deep learning system and maps that change in real time to give cars the ability to see more than just its sensors allow. As complicated as all that sounds though, people like me may present an even bigger hurdle to the widespread adoption of the technology. I'm a technology reporter, I know the numbers. More than 30,000 people die on the road every year in the US, and a majority of those deaths are attributed to human error. Unlike a computer, we can't help but fiddle with the radio or sneak a peek at a text. And yet, when I realised that the driver who had piloted that autonomous Audi out of the parking lot had taken her hands off the wheel, I freaked out. Every jerk of the car was a surefire signal that I was on my way to meet an untimely death at the hands of an invisible operator. Most of those 30,000 some-odd roadside deaths don't make the papers. But every one of the handful of incidents involving autonomous vehicles has — even when the self-driving car was not at fault. "The industry has a lot of technological problems to solve," Matt Yurdana, the creative director for Intel's Internet of Things Experiences Group, told me. "But just as important are the interactions with people. How do people feel comfortable, psychologically, in one of these cars?" In other words, if you're going to get into a car, you're going to have to trust it first. Like so many fears, our fears of self-driving cars are probably illogical. They're still there. You may have seen a self-driving car from Google or Uber before. They look weird, with all kinds of protruding sensors and often more junk taking up a whole lot of space in the trunk. The autonomous Audi I rode in had none of that. Its 26 sensors were all fashioned so that you probably wouldn't notice them unless you were looking for them. Its trunk was free of computational junk. And, most importantly, in place of your everyday GPS display was a screen that showed you exactly what the car was seeing. Outlined was its trajectory, so you could see where it planned to go on the road. If the car planned to turn right, a blinker appeared on the screen's right-hand side. If it was stopped at a light, the traffic light appeared on screen, along with others in its field of vision in a more transparent relief behind it, so that you could have confidence it was reading the right light. The Delphi Autonomous Audi. Image: Intel The idea here was to make the car's actions more transparent — turning it from a mysterious, opaque machine into something consumers understand. Uber's pilot project has taken a similar approach, testing how much information about the car consumers need to feel safe. Other self-driving cars, instead, seem to hope that the magic of the technology will dazzle you enough to win you over. The minimalist interior of Google's prototype car doesn't even have a steering wheel, let alone a neat user interface to let you in on what the computer is up to. Unsurprisingly, Google has since abandoned that vision and is instead now piloting more normal-looking vehicles, because getting its vision of weird toy cars out of the workshop and onto the road was just too difficult. Intel isn't actually interested in designing consumer-facing user interfaces for vehicles. But, Yurdana told me, it does want to understand how to make the best human-machine interfaces so that it can build the technologies to support it. Yurdana's group is focused on researching and prototyping different human-machine interfaces to help its partners address issues of consumer trust. I told him about my experience in the autonomous Audi, where I felt less safe than I had when I'm driving, even though the car was certainly a more skilled driver. "That's because you didn't have control," he said. Making consumers feel comfortable, he said, will be in part rooted in giving them some control. He demonstrated for me a prototype of a hypothetical app for hailing an autonomous Uber or Lyft. From the app, the car allowed me to select if I wanted it to do things like flash its headlights so I could see it better on a crowded street. When it pulled up, it flashed my name on the window and prompted me to unlock the door from a phone. Once I was in, I had to enter a pin code and then hold down a button that said "Go" for four seconds. Once the ride started, the car kept me abreast of the route and any changes to it not just on the phone screen, but also on two other screens within the car. It was all about communication — allowing the car to communicate its actions to me, and then giving me options for communicating back to it. The interface for a hypothetical autonomous ride-hailing app. Image: Intel Yurdana said that redundant communication systems will be vital for getting people on board. The car should let the passenger know everything that its doing in multiple ways across multiple screens. The company plans to test the system soon on people to gather feedback on what made them feel most comfortable. Image: Intel Given all the thought that seemed to have been put into making these autonomous cars people-friendly, I asked Delphi CEO Glen De Vos about my bumpy ride. The aggressiveness of the car, he said, was all part of the car's personality. "Two years ago, it drove like my grandma, and that was even more aggravating," he said. "The ride quality has to feel natural, and like we expect." In different places, he said, cars might be "tuned" to drive differently or consumers might even be able to change their driving behaviour themselves. In California, our reputation for aggressive on-road behaviour seems to have made its way into our self-driving cars. In the end, De Vos said nothing will probably do more to create consumer confidence in cars than exposure. By way of explanation, he pointed to the example of the elevator. Initially, elevators were considered such complicated pieces of technology that they required operators. In 1900, a company created the first-ever driverless elevator. But for decades after, they never caught on. "People had visions of things like the driverless elevators chopping them in half," said De Vos. It took an elevator operator strike that nearly shut down New York City in 1945 before people were willing to fully embrace the driverless lift. By that example, it may be an awfully long time before we're willing to turn over the wheel to a computer. I had taken an Uber from Oakland to Intel's San Jose headquarters, in part because of my aforementioned hatred of the road. On the way back, my driver was awful. He got lost en route to the freeway, despite the fact that his phone had turn-by-turn navigation. He merged onto the highway at a horrifying 65km/h, inviting a chorus of angry honks. He was a worse driver than me. Had I instead hailed one of Uber's pilot autonomous vehicles, I'm certain it would have been a smoother, faster ride. And yet, as he swerved across two lanes of traffic as he tried to answer a call, I was still more relaxed than I had been in the back of the autonomous Audi a few hours earlier.

It's also not looking like an all-in, or all-out decision. If I want a self-driving vehicle and my neighbour doesn't, so be it! Considering Waymo have an almost commercial operation going in Phoenix, it doesn't matter what any of us think anymore, it's here.

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started. Microsoft's Surface Laptop: The Gizmodo Hands On Alex Cranz 03 May 2017 12:30 PM The Surface Laptop might not have turned many heads if it had been the first mobile computer from Microsoft. It's not as radical and influential as the Surface Pro or as crazy looking as the Surface Book. From afar the silver Surface Laptop looks like something as easily made by Apple or Asus as by Microsoft. It feels like that too, with the same heft as a powerful premium laptop like the 2016 MacBook Pro or the exceptional Asus ZenBook 3. Despite being a good looking hunk of hardware, the Surface Laptop is remarkable for how perfectly mundane it in light of recent Microsoft computer products. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why the Bears Might Be Right About Intel Corporation Stock Intel faces tough questions about its long-term growth. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 4, 2017 at 7:03PM Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell more than 3% on April 28 after the chipmaker posted a mixed first quarter earnings report. Revenue rose 7% annually to $14.79 billion, narrowly missing expectations by about $20 million. Earnings grew 22% to $0.66 per share, beating estimates by a penny. Those headline numbers weren't terrible, but several troubling headwinds likely gave the bears enough reasons to bet against the stock, which has stayed flat since the beginning of the year. Let's examine four reasons why the bears could be right about Intel's future. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Image source: Intel. 1. AMD strikes back Intel's Client Computing revenue rose 6% annually to $8 billion thanks to rebounding sales of PCs. However, the arrival of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) next-gen Ryzen chip in early March represents a dangerous new threat to Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors. AMD's benchmarks claim that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches the 8-core Intel Core i7-6900K in terms of single-threaded performance and beats it by 9% in terms of multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. Since the Ryzen is arriving at a time when PC sales are gradually recovering, many desktop owners might upgrade to systems powered by AMD's processors instead of Intel's. Intel plans to launch its new Coffee Lake processors later this year, but it's unclear if those chips -- built with the same 14nm manufacturing process as Kaby Lake and Ryzen -- can effectively compete against AMD's chips. Intel's next-gen 10nm Cannonlake chips are expected to arrive by the end of 2017, but their actual specs remain sketchy. To top it all off, AMD will soon launch its Naples server processor -- which has more cores and memory channels than Intel's Purley CPU -- to challenge Intel's dominance of the data center market. 2. Qualcomm's big moves AMD isn't the only chipmaker causing headaches for Intel. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) also recently collaborated with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make Windows 10 compatible with its top-tier Snapdragon processors, which indicates that more Snapdragon-powered PCs and 2-in-1s could hit the market soon. Qualcomm also recently launched Centriq 2400, a 64-bit ARM-based processor for servers. Once again, Microsoft lent a helping hand by porting Windows Server to the chip. This development is significant, since the Centriq is a 10nm chip. Intel's 10nm Xeon server chips aren't expected to arrive until next year. Unlike older ARM-based server chips, which specialized in niche tasks instead of directly competing against Intel's powerhouse Xeons, Qualcomm believes that the Centriq can go toe-to-toe with Intel's flagship server chips. 3. Data center blues The fresh competition from AMD and Qualcomm cast a spotlight on the worst figure from Intel's first quarter report -- its Data Center revenues rose just 6% annually to $4.2 billion, missing analyst expectations of $4.35 billion. That's also well below the double-digit annual sales growth which the company claimed that it could achieve back in late 2015. To make matters worse, the Data Center Group's operating margin fell about nine percentage points annually to 35.1% for the quarter, due to increased investments in developing new 10nm manufacturing processes. Intel expects that dip to be temporary, and it expects operating margin for the group to remain between 40%-45% for the year, but that still represents a reduction from its previous forecast of 45%-50%. Those slumping revenues and declining margins could put Intel in a tough spot as AMD, Qualcomm, and others smell blood. 4. Overpaying for Mobileye Intel recently agreed to buy Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), the world's leading maker of ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), for over $15 billion. That price was painfully steep, since the company generated just $358 million in sales last year. Intel bought Mobileye because it was clearly falling behind in the connected car market. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tegra had established a first-mover's advantage in connected cars, which served as a foundation for launching its Drive PX driverless platform. Qualcomm, meanwhile, will soon become the world's biggest maker of automotive chips after its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) closes. Intel previously launched Atom Automotive chips for cars, but those chips never gained as much traction as NVIDIA's  or NXP's chips. While it can be argued that Intel needed to buy Mobileye, the all-cash deal will drain its overseas cash (nearly $14 billion at the end of 2016) and greatly reduce its free cash flow ($11.3 billion over the past 12 months). Furthermore, there's no guarantee that buying Mobileye will help Intel counter NVIDIA, which gained Tesla as a Drive PX 2 customer after a fatal crash involving a Mobileye-powered Autopilot platform. The key takeaways Intel probably won't nosedive in the near future, but it probably also won't rally. The company is seemingly slipping behind the tech curve with the ongoing delays of its "tick tock" launch schedule, and it seems ill-prepared to fend off ambitious challengers like AMD and Qualcomm. Therefore, Intel might look like a safe mature tech play with a decent 3% yield, but investors should be wary of the tough headwinds it faces.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Intel Partners With BMW on Self-Driving Car System The company expects this foray into autonomous driving to leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths. by Ethan Baron, The Mercury News / May 4, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- SAN JOSE — Semiconductor titan Intel has officially jumped into the self-driving car frenzy, throwing itself into battle with Google spinoff Waymo, Apple and a host of other firms. “That is an arms race going on,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University focused on autonomous driving. “I don’t think they are late, but they have to execute, of course.” In an event for press and analysts Wednesday at its “Innovation Campus” in San Jose, Intel unveiled a sleek silver BMW sedan showcasing Intel’s partnership with the German automaker and the computer vision company Mobileye that Intel is buying. RELATEDIntel to Break into Virtual Reality, Autonomous VehiclesIntel Acquires Mobileye, Makes $15 Billion Bet on Self-Driving VehiclesColorado Taps Intel Exec to Lead State Broadband Office The partnership is intended to let Intel develop a “base functionality platform” for self-driving cars that it would license to car makers, said Intel spokeswoman Marcie Miller. The Santa Clara firm’s move comes as its business has been on the upswing after it missed the mobile-computing revolution and saw PC sales falter before it pivoted toward cloud computing and development of 5G wireless networks. Autonomous cars represent another new frontier in technology markets. “It’s very wise for them to diversify,” Rajkumar said. Intel’s semiconductor chips would act as the “brains” for an autonomous-driving system, Miller said. The chips would process data from vehicles’ sensors within the vehicle, as well as in Intel’s self-driving system, and for processing autonomous-vehicle data in the cloud, Miller said. The foray into autonomous driving will leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths, including its data centers, its work on 5G networks, and its processors, said Kathy Winter, vice-president of the firm’s Automated Driving Group. “It plays well to all of the things that we are already doing, and it’s another way to extend those businesses,” Winter said. Or, as AutoPacific analyst George Peterson said, “it’s a way to sell chips.” Intel’s gambit puts it up against companies from a variety of technology sector, analysts said. “One of their primary competitors is going to be Waymo, of course, they’re well ahead,” Peterson said. Another rival will be Apple, which probably won’t build a car but instead produce autonomous-driving software and possibly some hardware modules, Peterson said. In an additional arena of competition, Intel will do battle with companies like Bosch making components for self-driving systems, and in yet another competitive realm, Intel will strive against companies with expertise in mapping — including Google, Magellan and TomTom — that’s crucial to autonomous driving systems, Peterson said. Car makers like Ford and GM also represent competition for Intel’s self-driving efforts, along with Uber, which is testing autonomous vehicles, and smaller firms such as Aurora Innovation, co-founded by Google’s former self-driving project head Chris Urmson, Rajkumar said. Another chipmaker, Santa Clara’s NVIDIA, will put additional competitive pressure on Intel, via NVIDIA processors used within autonomous cars — including all Teslas sold in the last six months — and for processing self-driving vehicle data in the cloud, said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. Whether a dominant autonomous-driving player will emerge with a widely used platform, or whether car makers will pull technology from a variety of sources remains to be seen, Peterson said. The BMW 740i showcased Wednesday is a prototype for the “iNext” electric car that BMW plans to put on the market in 2021, with self-driving capabilities falling somewhere between mostly driving itself but needing human backup, and full autonomy, said BMW advanced technology engineer Kyle Moy. Intel in November announced a partnership with Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, and in March, it announced it was buying the company for about $15 billion. It is Mobileye’s machine-vision technology that will act as the “eyes” of the BMW prototype. Intel, by its own admission, missed the mobile revolution. And with the company netting more than half its sales from shipment of PCs as of 2016, five straight years of falling PC sales led Intel last year to announce it would cut 12,000 jobs and focus on chips for the cloud and Internet-connected devices. However, Intel’s fortunes have swung upward of late, with CEO Brian Krzanich in the company’s latest earnings report highlighting record first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, and looking toward self-driving car technology. ©2017 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)

Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone.   Microsoft Corp., a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday.  The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market—and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience—including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype—little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices—to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus.  The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes.  Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.”  The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware—a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store.  “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state.  The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch—and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better.  Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Intel DC P4600 and P4500 SSDs give datacenters a little TLC by Eric Born  4:00 PM on May 3, 2017 Intel's Optane devices made their entrance into consumer and datacenter markets this spring, but don't think for a second that the company is neglecting its other lineups of memory products. Not only is Intel expanding its production of 3D TLC NAND, it's also releasing two new lines of datacenter solid-state drives: the DC P4500 and DC P4600 series. Between the P4500 series and P4600 series, Intel is releasing a total of six new drives. All the models pack Intel's TLC NAND and an all-new controller developed internally. As expected of datacenter drives, these SSDs use PCI express connectivity and the NVMe protocol. All models will be available as half-height, half-length add-in cards, and some higher-capacity variants be offered as U.2 2.5" drives. The drives in the P4600 series are the most powerful of the bunch, particularly when it comes to write speeds. According to Intel, the highest-capacity 4TB model provides sequential read speeds up to 3270 MB/s, while sequential writes can go as far as 2100 MB/s. For random operations, the P4600 drives can reach 694K IOPS on reads and are capable of 228K IOPS when writing. Available capacities are 1.6TB, 2TB, and 4TB. As for the P4500 series, Intel reports that the drives provide read performance on par with their P4600 brethren. The 4TB P4500 drive, for example, posts sequential read speeds up to 3270 MB/s and random read speeds up to 687K IOPS. The drives fall behind the higher-end models when it comes to writes, however, offering sequential writes up to 1860 MB/s and random writes up to 62K IOPS. The P4500 series drives will be available with 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4TB of storage space. Intel plans a second quarter launch for all of these drives, so we'd expect them to hit the shelves sooner than later. The company hasn't announced pricing, though it noted that will offer five-year warranty coverage. Tags: Storage Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

"This is the best time, I think, in history to go out and buy a PC or be in the PC business because the innovation is tremendous," Krzanich told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Thursday. The CEO admitted that his bearishness on the PC business came about because customers are buying fewer PCs, but he remained enthusiastic about Intel's wide reach in the market. "There are other places that people are spending their dollars, so I can't come in to you and say, 'This is a revenue growth engine,'" Krzanich said. "But we've been able to grow profitability and we've been driving innovation with our partners, Microsoft, HP, Dell, Lenovo." Watch the full segment here: show chapters Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says this is the best time in history to buy a PC    8 Hours Ago | 09:27 As Intel has restructured its operations over the last several years, other areas have outshone the PC business, Krzanich added. What the CEO called Intel's "growth businesses," which include the Internet of Things and data centers, now make up nearly 50 percent of the company's revenue and over 50 percent of its profits, he said. "The products you're going to see over the next couple of years are going to just wow you," he told Cramer. Moreover, Krzanich said the company's recently announced purchase of the Israeli-based autonomous car company Mobileye will give Intel a leg up in the fast-growing self-driving vehicle space. "Mobileye was a big stake around autonomous vehicles, and those are going to be cars, [and] within our lifetimes, it's going to be things that fly," the CEO said, adding that Intel would achieve those goals by making each vehicle a complete technological platform. As Intel continues to reinvent itself with initiatives like an ad campaign featuring basketball sensation LeBron James, Krzanich hopes that federal policy will support the profit-driving changes. With talk of repatriation measures and lower corporate tax rates growing louder in Washington, the CEO said the additional cash would be put to use for the benefit of the country, not just Intel. "We're going to go reinvest that money and it's going to be reinvested in factories like we just announced, it's going to be in stock buybacks, it's going to be in all kinds of applications," Krzanich told Cramer. "All of those will be job-creating and wealth-creating for the U.S." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

And it looks as if it will soon surpass another US firm at the top of a different market: Samsung could displace Intel as the world’s biggest chip company later this year. In 1993, through the popularity of its 386 and 486 processors and the release of the first Pentium CPU, Intel took the top position in the semiconductor industry. It’s stayed there ever since, but the tech giant’s 25-year reign could come to an end in the coming quarter, thanks to the increasing price and demand for memory chips. According to IC insights, the massive rise in DRAM and NAND is bringing in huge revenue for Samsung. In Q1 2017, DRAM ASPs were 45 percent higher compared to Q1 2016, while NAND ASPs were up 40 percent from the same period a year ago. If the predictions are correct, Samsung’s semiconductor sales will reach $14.9 billion by the second quarter, whereas Intel’s will be $14.4 billion. “If memory market prices continue to hold or increase through the second quarter and the balance of this year, Samsung could charge into the top spot and displace Intel, which has held the No. 1 ranking since 1993,” said Bill McClean, president of IC Insights. However, Samsung’s victory could be short-lived. “With the memory market still cyclical, this could indeed be a one-year event,” added McClean. Memory chip prices are expected to fall in the second half of this year, which could see Intel replace Samsung at the top.

Twitter Facebook Intel Xeon chips rebranded to sound like credit cards You will soon be able to buy Xeon Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 05 May, 2017 07:02 - - - - print email Comments After about half a decade, Intel is wiping the confusing E5 and E7 monikers off its Xeon chips and rebranding them to bring more clarity about the performance and features that come with the processors. Xeon chips are used in servers and workstations like Mac Pro. Xeon chips being released mid-year will be broken down into Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze processors. The naming scheme -- derived from metals -- is a mix of Olympic medals and branding of credit cards from companies like Delta. A person familiar with Intel's plans earlier said the chips will likely be widely referred to as Xeon-P, Xeon-G, Xeon-S, and Xeon-B, with the P for Platinum, G for Gold, etc. The more valuable the metal, the more performance you get with the chip. The Platinum chip is the fastest chip and will deliver the performance similar to that of the high-end E7 chips, an Intel spokesman said. The Bronze processor is aimed at low-end serversÂ and will deliver the performance similar to the E5. The new branding will start with the server chips based on the enhanced Skylake architecture coming mid-year. Earlier this year, Intel released low-end E3 server and workstation chips based on the Kaby Lake architecture, and those chips will hang on to the old moniker. With Xeon Platinum, you will also get "hardware-enhanced security," Intel said. The chipmaker is putting additional hardware layers on its Skylake chips to provide data security. That feature is valuable in fault-tolerant, high-uptime servers used in financial and retail organizations that run high volumes of transactions. These servers have ECC memory and RAS (reliability, availability, and serviceability) features. The Xeon Gold tier of processors will add "enhanced performance, fast memory, more interconnect/accelerator engines, and advanced reliability." That would make Gold tier chips for applications like machine learning. Intel will hook up FPGAs and deep-learning chips from Nervana alongside the processors to carry out tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. Outside of servers, these chips could also go into car IT systems. Intel is also introducing the high-bandwidth OmniPath interconnect -- so far only available with its Xeon Phi supercomputing chips -- with its Skylake chips. That feature could be available with Xeon Gold. The Xeon Silver will provide "efficient performance at low power," while Xeon Bronze will be aimed at entry-level servers. There are many new features that will be available on most Skylake server chips. One is AVX-512, a package of vector extensions to speed up high-performance computing. Servers with the new chips also have as a feature called Intel Volume Management Device so SSDs like the super fast Optane DC P4800X and 3D NAND-based DC P4600 can be hot swapped. Intel is reorganizing its business to focus more on data centers, especially with a stagnant PC market.Â Network Professionals Survey with Computerworld Australia More from Computerworld Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced Wednesday that Diane Bryant, the executive in charge of Intel’s Data Center Group, is taking a six-to-eight-month leave of absence due to a “personal family matter.” Bryant will be replaced by Navin Shenoy, who currently leads Intel’s Client Computing Group. Her division has been probably the best-performing division at the company over the last few years, although it fell short of revenue expectations in the last quarter. It sounds like Bryant will be moved into a different role upon her return to the company, based on Krzanich’s email; she was Intel’s CIO prior to assuming this role. Intel made a number of significant changes during her tenure, including the embrace of a more flexible style of processor design that cloud computing giants like Amazon Web Services were demanding for newer workloads. Shenoy inherits a group that controls virtually all of the market share for chips going into commercial servers and the homegrown equipment used by cloud providers.

LG’s new light laptop was made for you Brendan Nystedt , Reviewed.com 4:21 p.m. ET May 4, 2017 7 Shares LG Gram 13 (2017) Laptop Review  (Photo: Reviewed.com) — Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives. It's been while since you had to buy a thick, heavy laptop. Unless you need gobs of power for gaming, the average laptop is light compared to the norm even 10 years ago. What hasn't been so easy is finding a thin and light laptop that didn't compromise in any other area. Recently, Apple sacrificed its keyboards and ports, and it annoyed the heck out of me when I tried the company's latest MacBook and MacBook Pro. Even though LG hasn't been making laptops for that long, the company has found a comfortable niche with its LG Gram 13 (MSRP $999, $1,099 as tested). This ultrabook looks a lot like what you'd buy from Dell or HP but they have a hidden ability that doesn't make itself known until you pick one up—these LG laptops are really lightweight. Even though this laptop isn't my favorite, if you need a long-lasting laptop that's so light you feel like you've forgotten it at home, this a surprisingly good option—unless you have the money to spring for the business-grade Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. About the LG Gram (2017) LG Gram 13 - Buy now for $1,099.00 The second-generation LG Gram adds the newest 7th generation Intel processors and an improved design, all while retaining its namesake 1kg (2.2 lbs) weight. The $1,099 13-inch version we tested has the following specs: •Intel Core i5-7200u dual-core processor •8 GB RAM •256 GB M.2 SATA SSD •FHD (1920 x 1080) touchscreen with thin bezels •Intel HD Graphics 620 •WiFi AC/Bluetooth 4.1 •Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader •60 Whr built-in battery If you like the look of this well-rounded package but want to spend less, there's a version in white that ditches the touchscreen and fingerprint reader for only $999. What We Like It's light, but doesn't feel too flimsy The LG Gram gets its name from its weight, since it's only one kilogram. Even though LG has shaved every extraneous ounce from the Gram, it still manages to feel rigid and well-engineered. Trimming the fat could have left this LG feeling like a wet noodle, but it's a surefooted ultrabook design. The Gram's appealing light weight is hard to appreciate until you pick it up.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) Trust me: the 2.2 lb weight might not seem like a big deal on paper, but it can make a drastic difference. Even the fantastic Dell XPS 13 weights in at 2.9 lbs. But pick up the LG Gram, and it's stunningly light. I almost gave myself a heart attack thinking I had left the LG at home instead of putting it in my bag—it's that light. Ports-a-plenty Most thin-and-light designs we've seen jettison ports to make tiny gains in other areas. For instance, Apple's 12-inch MacBook famously only has one data and charging port. In its 13-inch guise, the light LG gives you three USB 3 ports, one of which uses the new USB-C connector and a real HDMI. With the Gram, you get both USB-A and USB-C.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) The Gram also has an SD card slot, though unfortunately, it's of the micro variety. While I love seeing a microSD option on tablets, I think a full-sized SD card slot would be more useful on this laptop. As a photographer, I love being able to take cards from my cameras and put them into my computer without an adapter, and even though many of the cards I have are microSD, these smaller cards are a hassle to handle when you're swapping them in and out frequently. Awesome battery life One thing that disappointed us about last year's LG Gram was its middling battery life. This year's fixes that, and more. It seems that LG has spent a lot of time fine-tuning this Gram and it aced our battery life test while handling day-to-day tasks. In our intensive PCMark 8 Home test, the LG Gram made it to 8.5 hours, which is better than any comparable 13-inch ultrabook we've tested. What We Don't Like Thin bezels are nice, but the webcam suffers Definitely my worst angle.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) This is a tradeoff we've noticed with most thin-bezeled displays such as that on the Dell XPS 13. without having a bigger top edge on a screen, there's no place for a webcam in the normal spot. So, LG has put the Gram 13's webcam into the hinge instead, pointing up at you. Let's get one thing clear—nobody looks their best with a camera looking up at them. But, if you don't use a webcam that often, this isn't so bad. You get a very thin frame on the beautiful LG display, and our version was touch-friendly to boot. This LCD is nice to look at, and has the thin bezels that many premium shoppers expect.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) This plasticky trackpad isn't up to snuff The three things for me that make a great laptop are the keyboard, screen, and trackpad. Nail those basics and the rest tends to fall into place. Well, LG didn't exactly mess up here, but the trackpad leave a lot to be desired. Now, this isn't a bad trackpad, but it's frustratingly rough to the touch. For a cheaper notebook, this wouldn't be a problem. But at this price? It's not as nearly as good as the silky-smooth glass trackpads you'll find in the Dell XPS 13, the Lenovo Yoga 920, or the MacBook Air. Responsiveness isn't a huge problem, but LG still hasn't implemented the reliable Microsoft Precision drivers, instead relying on the slightly inferior Synaptics software instead. While the trackpad was okay, its rough texture made it feel worse than the competition.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) The best thing I can say about the trackpad is that the $1,099 version we tried had an embedded fingerprint scanner for Windows Hello logins was fast and accurate. This trackpad scrolls, taps, and clicks well enough, but it's not to the standard we expect in a premium laptop. Should You Buy It? Yes, if you need a light, long-lasting laptop Last year's Gram wasn't that impressive when compared to the other computers out there like the Dell XPS 13 or the HP Spectre X360. This version of the Gram has finally caught up in most ways, but it still falls short. Having used the HP, Dell, and now this LG, I'd be hesitant to fully recommend the Gram. For around $1,000 there's so much choice that this LG can't help but feel like an also-ran to me. It's not the best-ever in any one category, but the LG Gram surprised me by sustaining impressive battery life. The blend of longevity, power, and weight is what I found most exciting. The problem is that like thinness, lightness is an attribute only a few picky shoppers truly covet. I can't blame anyone for feeling like having an extra-light laptop is a less useful feature than a 360-degree hinge like the Lenovo Yoga, for instance. For around $1,000 there's so much choice that this LG can't help but feel like an also-ran. The LG Gram is a competent laptop that puts mobility first and foremost. Aside from maybe the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon, there are few notebooks that successfully trim the fat like this. But, then again, the Dell, Lenovo, and HP options are nicer to use, prettier, and are built from more luxurious materials...and, in the scheme of things, they're pretty light, too.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 4, 2017 6:00 AM PT Credit: SiFive/CrowdSupply More like this Why the time is right for open source to meet hardware Windows Server on ARM is for Azure only Smartphone CPUs put desktops to shame Video Reality check on the Internet of Things If you're buying a PC or server, you've likely considered chips based on x86 or, perhaps less often, the ARM architecture. But like Linux in software, an open-source chip project is out to break the dominance of proprietary chips offered by Intel, AMD, and ARM. The RISC-V open-source architecture, created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2010, is open to all who want to use it. The RISC-V design can be modified for PCs, servers, smartphones, wearables, and other devices. [ 8 tips for building a cost-effective IoT sensor network ] A startup called SiFive is the first to make a business out of the RISC-V architecture. The company is also the first to convert the RISC-V instruction set architecture into actual silicon. The company on Thursday announced it has created two new chip designs that can be licensed. RISC-V shares the ethos of open-source software, with the community working together to share, advance, and modify the architecture. Since the project's inception, the interest in RISC-V has ballooned, with some of the big IT companies showing interest in the architecture. The RISC-V Foundation -- which manages and promotes the architecture -- counts Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, AMD, Huawei, and others among its 60 members. Nvidia is expected to use the microcontroller-style RISC-V designs in its chips, Companies like Google are developing chips in-house and could tweak RISC-V for servers, which could save them from buying Intel's expensive chips. SiFive's new 32-bit E31 Coreplex processor design is targeted at IoT devices, wearables, and low-power devices. The 64-bit CorePlex E51 could be used in servers, network processors, storage devices, and edge computing devices.  Like many Linux and open-source vendors, the goal of SiFive is to monetize the RISC-V design but at a modest cost. The new chip designs can be licensed for a fixed price from SiFive, but the company will not charge royalties. That makes it attractive alternative compared to chip designs from ARM and Imagination Technologies, which charge licensing fees and royalties. There's a lot of excitement around RISC-V, and licensing chip designs like CorePlex will help spread its adoption, said Krste Asanovic, a co-founder and chief architect at SiFive. He is one of the inventors of RISC-V. SiFive will also make chips starting later this year. The company earlier released the HiFive1 low-power board based on its RISC-V chip. The boards sold in the thousands. The company didn't provide the licensing prices for the CorePlex designs, but ordering them will be straightforward, SiFive officials said. Users can go on the SiFive website and get a direct quote. The RISC-V chip design is already a big hit in the academic circuits with many working groups discussing advances. The design was initially founded for academic purposes but was turned into a practical chip design by SiFive.  Some other open-source chips like OpenSPARC have lingered around but are based on old designs. The RISC-V Foundation has aggressively promoted the architecture, especially at Hot Chips, an annual gathering of semiconductor professionals. The RISC-V architecture has a different design than the highly integrated x86, Power, and to an extent, the ARM designs. It's modular, meaning that independent co-processing circuits can be attached to the central RISC-V design. For example, a security or networking coprocessor can be tacked onto the core design. That makes the RISC-V highly flexible, Asanovic said. SiFive is working on vector extensions, which will be helpful for high-performance computing. The core RISC-V design being promoted by RISC-V Foundation will remain constant, but SiFive has forked its own design and will keep advancing it. There's a shift to modular chip designs as integrating components becomes challenging. Moore's Law is also lapsing, creating new opportunities in chip design.  Integrating a CPU, GPU, and other circuits in one chip, like with Intel's and AMD's chips, has its own advantages, but questions remain on how long could this continue as manufacturing challenges mount. Intel is already relying on co-processors like Altera FPGAs and Nervana deep-learning chips to take on new tasks like machine learning and computing in autonomous cars.  The CorePlex IP allows the chips to be made using different manufacturing technologies, Asanovic said. For those that want to test RISC-V, it can be tested on FPGAs. A fork of Linux for RISC-V has also been created, meaning software support is growing, Asanovic said.

Navin Shenoy, senior vice president and general manager for the Intel Client Computing Group (CCG), will step in as general manager of the unit while Bryant attends to an undisclosed personal matter. “Given the extended duration, an interim leader for the Data Center Group (DCG) is not possible,” Krzanich wrote. Bryant, president of Intel’s Data Center Group, is one of Intel’s most high-profile execs and the highest-ranked woman since Renee James stepped down as president two years ago. She is regular speaker at tech industry events, where she pushes the use of Intel technology in data center servers and other gear. She was also on Fortune‘s Most Powerful Women list for 2016. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. At Intel, Bryant led a highly strategic effort to push the chip giant beyond the PC chips that fed its growth for decades. Intel faces new challenges amid the age of cloud computing as tons of processing power is aggregated in massive data centers run by , Facebook , Google , and Microsoft .

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Samsung may take Intel’s spot as the world’s biggest chip maker this year Samsung may take Intel’s spot as the world’s biggest chip maker this year Matthew Wilson 13 hours ago CPU, Featured Tech News Samsung has been battling it out against Apple for the number one spot in the smartphone market for years and now, it looks like the company will begin taking on another major US company. It turns out that Samsung’s semiconductor business is now successful enough to rival Intel, meaning Samsung may soon become the biggest chip maker in the world. Intel has held its place at the top of the pile in the semiconductor industry for 25 years now. However, analysts are predicting that the rise in DRAM and NAND sales could give Samsung the edge this quarter. If the predictions made by IC Insights are correct, then Samsung will reach $14.9 billion in sales from its semiconductor, while Intel is predicted to hit $14.4 billion. In its own report, IC Insights explained its train of thought: “If memory market prices continue to hold or increase through 2Q17 and the balance of this year, Samsung could charge into the top spot and displace Intel, which has held the #1 ranking since 1993. Using the mid range sales guidance set by Intel for 2Q17, and a modest, yet typical, 2Q sales increase of 7.5% for Samsung, the South Korean supplier would unseat Intel as the world’s leading semiconductor supplier in 2Q17”. To support this analysis, we need only look at the huge rise in DRAM and NAND flash, which has sparked big gains for Samsung. This could be a short-lived reign for Samsung though, as NAND and DRAM pricing is expected to settle down again towards the latter half of this year. With that in mind, Intel may well reclaim its place before the end of the year. KitGuru Says: Many companies have come close to beating Intel’s semiconductor sales but for the last 25 years, none have quite managed it. It would certainly be interesting to see that change in 2017, even if it does end up just being a brief win for Samsung. However, it is important to note that this is all based on analyst predictions, nothing is set in stone just yet.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags CPU Intel news samsung semiconductor Previous Qualcomm apparently wants the US to block Apple from importing any more iPhones Next Bethesda/Zenimax lawyers have forced an indie studio to change the title of their game Check Also Core i7-7700K temperature spikes enrage users Reports are circulating that Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K CPUs are hitting temperature spikes of 90ºC … Chris Nguyen Yeah, Samsung has a bunch of products, including smart phones, solid state drives, monitors, notebooks, tablets, memory RAM, TVs and so many other countless appliances and electronics to compliment all their products. Intel just has CPUs for desk/laptops and tablets/smartphones, chipsets, wireless adapters, server related businesses, communication, and other computer related technologies. So I think samsung succeeding over Intel is no surprise to any of us, especially when you consider the diversity of samsung’s portfolio. Polls Does your main rig have an M.2 slot?

The lab's grand opening was more than just a ribbon cutting ceremony. Kathy Winter, Intel's automated driving division vice president, used the opportunity to unveil the first of 40 highly-autonomous BMW 7-Series test cars.

Of those 4 terabytes recorded every hour and a half, Intel says that most of it is processed and subsequently analyzed by its computers inside the vehicle but that some will be transmitted to its laboratory for map updates and enhanced data models.  At the event, Intel and Ericsson also showed off a live demonstration of their 5G wireless network that will eventually transmit data from vehicles to the cloud in a much faster manner than existing 4G LTE networks. While that technology is still a couple years away at least, it could be ready by the time those fully autonomous cars are ready in 2021. _______________________________________ Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Market Intel will provide timely market intelligence on the agricultural economy for farmers, ranchers, lawmakers and consumers, according to AFBF. “Soybeans Trumping Corn in 18 States” by AFBF’s Dr. John Newton, was the first Market Intel report in the new series. It featured insights on the implications of the Agriculture Department’s just-released Prospective Plantings and Grain Stocks reports. “Our aim with Market Intel is to analyze current events in agriculture — related to both crops and livestock — through an economic lens,” said Newton, AFBF’s director of market intelligence. “The timely market intelligence on the agricultural economy that we provide will be useful for farmers, lawmakers and consumers. Farmers and ranchers will find Market Intel to be a useful decision-making resource for marketing and planting.” Led by AFBF Chief Economist Dr. Bob Young, a trio of economists at AFBF will share the latest on agricultural market intelligence through regular Market Intel updates. Newton earned his doctorate in agricultural economics at The Ohio State University and focuses on agricultural commodity markets, risk management and farm bill programs. Economist Katelyn McCullock holds a master’s in agricultural economics from Colorado State University and specializes in economic analysis of animal health and welfare, organic standards for livestock, and livestock and dairy markets. Economist Veronica Nigh holds a master’s in economics from American University and analyzes how shifts in policy related to international trade, environmental issues, transportation, labor, food safety and taxes affect the agricultural economy.

White | lwhite@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 4, 2017 at 9:07 am | UPDATED: May 4, 2017 at 12:28 pm DANVILLE — Pam Montana — vibrant, sharp, articulate and outgoing — does not match the popular image of someone living with Alzheimer’s disease. And she thinks that’s a problem. Despite the stigma attached to Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia, the 62-year-old former Intel executive wants to become the face of the cognitive disorder. “My whole job and purpose now is to raise awareness and visibility,” said Montana, who was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer’s in July. “Tell them this is what Alzheimer’s looks like.” Although most of the estimated 5.5 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s are 65 and older, the disease also affects about 200,000 younger people, including some who are in their 40s and 50s, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Symptoms include disruptive memory loss, difficulty planning or solving problems, poor judgment, behavior changes, disorientation and confusion with time or place. Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. “There is no cure and there is no getting better,” Montana said. “It’s a progressive disease.” Montana first noticed changes in 2012 when she began having difficulty learning new systems at Intel, where she managed an inside sales team. Three years later, Montana was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which affects memory and the ability to think clearly. During a two-week Hawaii vacation after her MCI diagnosis, Montana’s husband, Bob Linscheid, was alarmed when Montana repeatedly asked him the same question in the span of five minutes. The couple pushed her doctor for a referral to the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center, where Montana endured a battery of cognitive tests as well as multiple brain scans. Gathered with a team of doctors and researchers in a UCSF conference room last July, the couple and Montana’s daughters learned that she has Alzheimer’s. Although the diagnosis was devastating, finally knowing the truth was a relief, she said. Sylvia Echazarreta was at Montana’s home when the family returned from San Francisco. “It was really sad. It was like somebody died; hearts were broken,” said Echazarreta, who has known Montana for more than 25 years. “She was trying to be strong and saying ‘I’m OK right now’ but we were all going to the future, thinking ahead.” Unable to sleep that night, Montana lay awake planning her funeral. The next morning, she resolved to join the fight for a cure. “I’ve totally accepted it. It is part of my life,” she said. “Everyday I try to do something to help the cause or help myself.” Montana is a volunteer peer mentor with the Alzheimer’s Association Northern California and Northern Nevada chapter. Last year, she and Linscheid participated in four of the association’s fundraising walks, pulling in $50,000 for research, according to Montana. She also has applied for a seat on the association’s national advocacy board (“Funny thing is, I applied twice because I forgot,” she said). In March she joined advocates from across the country who lobbied Congress for more funding for Alzheimer’s research through the National Institutes of Health. During her testimony before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Maria Shriver introduced Montana, who was in the audience. In an upcoming PBS special Montana will share her experience living with the disease. She urges her peers to pay close attention to how they’re feeling and to push for diagnostic testing if they experience any Alzheimer’s symptoms, even if their doctor is hesitant to do so. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, an early diagnosis and medication may slow memory loss and behavioral changes. Montana, who is taking prescription medication to treat moderate Alzheimer’s symptoms, hopes to be selected for a multiyear clinical drug trial. “She has just kind of thrown herself into it as a passion and she tells me this is her job now — ‘My job is to make a difference while I can’ — so I’d say that mindset is unique,” said Judy Filippoff, director of early-stage services for the Alzheimer’s Association Northern California and Northern Nevada chapter. With her outgoing nature and positive outlook, Montana inspires other Alzheimer’s patients and donors, Filippoff said. “She’s one of those people that I’m so grateful I got to meet,” she added. “I’m sorry for the reason she’s involved in this, and yet we’re so lucky to have her.” On good days, Montana keeps busy with volunteer work, joins friends for lunch, writes in her journal, updates her blog, exercises and knits — a hobby she took up again recently to challenge her brain. On bad days, she is exhausted and has little appetite. “Sometimes I’m just emotional, I just cry easily,” said Montana, eyes welling with tears. “It’s definitely hard, it’s not fun. It’s not what I wanted for myself.” Montana has had to make adjustments. She still drives, but only to places she’s been before. She no longer rides BART alone after getting confused and she brings someone with her to medical appointments. After a year on short-term disability, she reluctantly retired last month. Montana draws on her faith and her family for support. Her daughters, with whom she has strong relationships, plan to move closer so they can help when the time comes when she can no longer care for herself. And her husband of five years has been by her side at every turn. “We’ve chosen to get busy living,” said Linscheid. “To me it’s not about me helping Pam with this disease, it’s about us fighting it together.” Tags:  Health Lisa P.

Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Which lightweight notebook is best? by Joe Roberts 15 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: The MacBook Air has been the go-to lightweight laptop of choice for many, but Microsoft has a new challenger in the form of the Surface Book. Here's how the two compare. Microsoft recently launched the new Windows 10 S alongside a shiny new device on which to show off the software: The Surface Laptop. At around the £1000 mark, this isn't a cheap laptop by any means, but there's no denying the sleek design and effort that's seemingly gone into making this a premium product. Of course, the price point and attention to aesthetics puts it in direct competition with Apple's dated MacBook Air. So, we thought we'd see how the two machines compare. Here's all you need to know: Related: Surface Laptop vs Surface Book Surface Laptop MacBook Air Processors Dual-core 7th-gen Core i5 or i7 Dual-core 5th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 Graphics Intel HD 620 or 640 Intel HD Graphics 6000 Memory 4-16GB 8GB Storage 128-512GB SSD 128GB-512GB SSD Weight 1.25kg 1.35kg Thickness 14.5mm 17mm Screen 13.5-inch 2256x1504-pixel touch screen 13.3-inch 1440x900-pixel display Ports USB 3.0, 3.5mm audio, mini DisplayPort MagSafe 2, 2x USB 3, 3.5mm audio, Thunderbolt 2, SDXC card Price £979-2149 £949-1099 Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air – Design Microsoft might just be able to give Apple a run for its money with this latest device. There's no screws, joins, or hinges visible on the new laptop, and the company has also managed to pack the speakers below the keyboard, in order to hide the speaker grilles and project audio directly at you from behind the keys. Of course, you also won't be seeing much in the way of screws, hinges, or speaker grilles on Apple's famously sleek laptop, unless you closely inspect the base of the thing. The important thing to note is that both these laptops look great and convey the attention to detail both companies have put into their respective designs. One area where Microsoft has Apple beat, however, is portability. The Surface Laptop measures 9.9mm at the front and 14.47mm at the back, thanks to its tapered design. Meanwhile, the MacBook Air comes in at 17mm, though at its edges it reduces to about 3mm. It's also slightly heavier than the Surface Laptop. Microsoft's machine weighs 1.25kg, while the Air weighs 1.35kg. These are small differences, but there's no doubt Microsoft's machine is the more slight and portable offering. Related: Surface Laptop vs Chromebook Pixel Microsoft has provided several colour options for its laptop: Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. Apple's machine comes in either Space Grey or Silver. Both feature backlit keys but Microsoft has taken the liberty of outfitting the Surface Laptop with Alcantara fabric on the area surrounding the keys. There's no fuzzy keyboard tray on the MacBook Air, but whether that's an issue will come down to your personal preferences. We're yet to test out the keyboard mechanism on the Surface Laptop, but we found the keys on the Air to have a crisp, clean and light action, despite being slightly shallow. On the sides of the Surface Laptop you'll find a USB port, Surface power connector, and a mini DisplayPort – no USB Type-C connection this time, unfortunately. Things are slightly more comprehensive on the Air. Apple's provided a MagSafe 2 power port, 2x USB 3 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, Thunderbolt 2 port, and SDXC card slot. Related: Windows 10 S laptops Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air – Hardware and Performance With the Surface Laptop, Microsoft has provided a 7th-generation Intel Core processor (i5 and i7 options available), along with either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, which can be expanded if you pay more. It's a decent set of specs, though not quite top-end stuff. It should provide speedy performance, especially if you opt for the 8GB RAM version with any of the processor upgrades. All the various configurations can be slightly confusing, so here's a table of all the different setups available and how much they cost: Microsoft Surface Laptop: Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 Option 4 Processor Intel Core i5 Intel Core i5 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i7 Storage 128GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD 512GB SSD RAM 4GB 8GB 8GB 16GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Colour Platinum Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue, Graphite Gold Platinum Platinum Price £979 / $999 £1,249 / $1,299 £1,549 / $1,599 £2,149 / $2,199 So, how does the MacBook Air stack up? Well, you'll also find a dual-core Intel Core i5 or i7 depending on whether you want to upgrade. However the processors used in this laptop are 5th generation Intel chips, as opposed to the much newer 7th generation processors used in the Surface Laptop. This means they're both less powerful and less efficient, and this becomes very obvious when you push the MacBook Air hard: the fans fire up to a cacophony and it gets very hot. The Air comes equipped with 8GB of RAM as standard (topping the standard 4GB on the Surface Laptop) and flash storage of either 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB depending on how much you want to pay. What with 8GB of RAM and flash storage, you should be getting a nice, fluid user experience on the MacBook Air, especially since the hardware was designed with MacOS in mind. Related: 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016) review Aside from newer processors, The Surface Laptop also has an edge on the MacBook with its stylus support. You'll be able to use Microsoft's Surface Pen to doodle on your display and make notes if you feel inclined. And that display isn't too bad either. Microsoft has provided a 13.5-inch, 3.4 million-pixel LCD touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio and 2256 x 1504 resolution. That resolution on a 13-inch display should make for a sharp image, and we're expecting it to be vibrant, too. Apple, for its part, has kitted out the MacBook Air with a 13.3-inch LED-backlit screen featuring a 1440 x 900 resolution. That's a significantly lower resolution than the Surface Laptop, and in this day and age is well below par, both in terms of resolution and colour coverage. It's the weakest part of the MacBook Air and puts it well behind not just the Surface Laptop, but also most other premium Windows 10 machines. Related: Best laptops On the software side, you'll find Microsoft's new Windows 10 S running the show on the Surface Laptop. What is it? You can read our full guide to the new operating system here, but essentially, it's Microsoft's attempt to provide a stripped-down version of the WIndows 10 OS. With a simplified, redesigned home screen, the new version of Windows only allows users to install applications from the Windows Store. It's a more locked down version of the full OS that's designed to give teachers and administrators more control over the system. Naturally, the MacBook Air runs Apple's own macOS Sierra. The latest version of the operating system, macOS Sierra, is a great iteration of the software, with a load of new features such as iCloud Desktop synchronisation, Siri integration, Apple Pay support built into Safari, and a load of other neat touches that make the OS a pleasure to use. Related: WWDC 2017 Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air – Price and release date You can pre-order the Surface Laptop right now, with the device set to ship and hit stores on June 15. The basic configuration is priced at £979 in the UK and $999 in the US, while more expensive models will run you up to £2149 in the UK and $2199 in the states. Pre-order: Surface Laptop from £979 Apple's machine is ever so slightly more affordable. The MacBook Air starts at £949 in the UK and $999 in the US, but could run you as much as £1409 ($1549) if you want the top-spec version. Apple seems to have abandoned the Air entirely, so don't expect a new version to arrive any time soon. Surface Laptop or MacBook Pro, which is best?

The company’s sales were 40% greater than Samsung’s last year, but are now only slightly ahead of its South Korean competitor. According to research from IC Insights, Samsung will overtake Intel in the second quarter of 2017 if market prices continue to hold or increase. This forecast was calculated using the mid-range sales guidance set by Intel for the second quarter of 2017 and a projected sales increase of 7.5% for Samsung. IC Insights said Samsung’s sales increase can be attributed to a rise in DRAM and NAND flash average selling prices, which are expected to even out in the second half of 2017. The research predicts a further 39% growth for the 2017 DRAM market and 25% growth in the NAND flash market.

The latest additions to the Intel SSD Family for Data Center have been designed from the ground up for cloud storage solutions, including software defined storage and converged infrastructure. The Intel SSD DC P4500 Series, optimized for reads, enables data centers to get more value out of servers and store more data.

Vehicle tech supplier Delphi, a mainstay in the automotive manufacturing world, brought along its latest self-driving prototype to Intel’s Autonomous Vehicle Showcase in its new San Jose, CA facility, and offered to take me for a spin. Funnily enough, what’s most special, you can’t actually see. Think of a driverless vehicle today, and you’re probably imagining a big sedan or SUV topped with an array of spinning laser scanners and dotted with cameras. Delphi’s goal with this new prototype was to put the sensors into places where they’d be suitable for production. So, there are Mobileye cameras behind the windshield, but no vast LIDAR turret on the top. Side cameras are fared in, unlike on most jury-rigged prototype cars I’ve seen. The goal, Delphi explained to me, was to make this particular Audi Q5S as close to a regular car as possible. No cabin full of displays and extra controls; no bristling with oddly-shaped sensors. Just a virtual driver that can navigate you from A to B with no further instructions than the destination. What’s interesting is that the driving style of the autonomous car evolved over the course of the day. Delphi started out with fairly conservative settings, the prototype leaving extra space around it, slowing earlier for turns, and generally behaving more cautiously. However, as the day went on, the engineers cranked up its enthusiasm. By mid-afternoon, and the time I was strapped into the back seat of the heavily-modified Q5S, you could describe the AI as eager. Delphi’s engineer navigated us out of the parking lot manually, but once on the open road the car’s systems took over. This was no reticent chauffeur, afraid of either the gas or the brakes: it nipped from lane to lane swiftly to prepare for turns, and enthusiastically kept pace with the traffic around it. That autonomous caution, you see, is all down to programming and not technical limitation. As we already saw several years ago, driverless vehicles left near-unfettered can already best human drivers on race tracks. The talents of the machine aren’t the limiting factor: it’s us, the meat inside. Most people don’t quite trust the machine, and certainly not in their first few outings in driverless vehicles. Think of the mild concern you had when you first tried adaptive cruise control, and had to retrain your brain from slamming on the brakes as the traffic ahead slowed. On a pragmatic level you know the computers are talented; on a more instinctive one, though, it’s enough to turn what should be a relaxing aid into a stressful one. Delphi envisages two ways of dealing with that. The first is fairly obvious, with a digital display in the center console effectively showing those inside the car what the various sensors have spotted. Other vehicles, parked or in motion, are translucent grey blobs; there are road markings, and traffic signals, and signage. When the car is about to make a turn, a big flashing green arrow alerts you to where it plans to go. I suspect that most people will leave it on for their first handful of journeys, but then find that they switch it over to something else: Netflix, maybe, or a web browser. In that familiarization phase, though – before they learn that the car can, indeed, be trusted – it’s a great way to keep on top of what the vehicle has seen and answer the nagging “does it know there’s a dump-truck there?” paranoia. Delphi’s other strategy is more complex. The company’s thinking now is that, for any self-driving car system to be accepted, the style in which it operates will need to be customizable. Much as the engineers changed the aggression of the prototype I rode in, users of production cars built on similar technology will be able to set their vehicle to the appropriate level to match their own comfort. It’s not the first company to think along those lines. Back in 2014, in fact, mapping company HERE – subsequently invested in by Audi, BMW, Daimler AG, and most recently Intel – argued that autonomous cars needed to model human drivers if they weren’t to cause havoc on the roads. Working too much like a computer wouldn’t be reassuring, HERE argued, it would only serve to highlight just how different the AI is from the rest of us. We’re still a fair way from having a dial that runs from “pensioner” through to “boy racer” on the dashboard of our driverless vehicle. One of the big issues, Delphi told me, was the high-definition mapping its cars rely upon for details of things like curb levels and which lane markings are where. In the absence of a comprehensive commercial map to buy, its been doing its own mapping. It’s a prerequisite that severely curtails where the cars can actually go. Nonetheless that, without the Delphi wrap, you could easily mistake the exterior of the car for a regular Audi SUV is a triumph in itself. Autonomous vehicles are finally passed the “can they work?” stage and is now firmly in the “how can we make this market-acceptable?” phase.

London is hiring a Chief Digital Officer 6 Business Policy Poor old Intel. No flash profits for you Chipzilla's SSD tech is solid, but can't seem to shake losses 4 May 2017 at 15:02, Chris Mellor Analysis Intel is a formidable competitor in the enterprise and consumer SSD business but it has yet to stop losing money. The key to that looks to be increasing SSD sales volume and making XPoint a success. In its latest quarterly results and among the record quarter news there were these information nuggets: Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue of $866m, up 55 per cent year-on-year from $557m That revenues was up 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter from $816m NVM Solutions Group operating losses; First quarter 2017 - $129m Fourth quarter 2016 -$91m First quarter 2016 - $95m That's pretty poor. Stifel analyst Aaron Rakers said: "The company noted that demand outpaced supply during the quarter (no surprise)." And it still made a whopping loss: "Losses were driven by the company’s ongoing investments in 3D NAND and its 3D XPoint development." But: "However, the company expects to run at breakeven for the core business in 2H2017 and be profitable for the entire non-volatile memory business near the end of 2018." Rakers has charted Intel's NVM quarterly revenue performance. It's not that great since 2011 but did see a 2016 revenue boost: We think that revenue boost has to continue this year for the NVM business unit to move into profit. But, again, costs are going up: "Intel reiterated 2017 CAPEX at $11.5-$12.5 billion, up $2.5 billion y/y due to increased investments in 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. The company reiterated that it expects CAPEX will likely increase in 2018 as the company continues to build out its memory fabs." So there have to be increased product sales, and better margin, if it is to move its NVM business into profit. P4000 class SSDs The product development status is good, with a new P4000 class Data Centre set of SSDs. The previous P3000 class products looked like this in overview: Technology - 20nm MLC (2bits/cell) DC P3100 M.2 128GB - 1TB - 114,000/10,000 R.W IOPS - 1.8/0.175GB/sec R/W bandwidth 2.5-inch form factor; DC P3500 - 400GB - 2TB capacity - 450,000/35,000 R/W IOPS - 2.5/1.7GB/sec R/W bandwidth DC P3600 - 1TB - 2TB capacity - 470,000/70,000 R/W IOPS - 2.6/1.7GB/sec R/W bandwidth DC P3700 - 400GB - 2TB capacity - 460,000/175,000 R/W IOPS - 2.1/1.5GB/sec R/W bandwidth We see up to 2TB capacity, 460,000 read IOPS and 2.5 GB/sec read bandwidth as take-away characteristics. The latest P4000 class, with an NVMe interface like the P3000s, has new technology and impressively improved performance: Technology - 3D NAND TLC (3 bits/cell) DC P4500 - 1TB - 4TB capacity - 710,000/68,000 R/W IOPS - 3.29/1.89 GB/sec R/W bandwidth DC P4600 - 1.6TB - 4TB capacity - 702,500/257,000 R/W IOPS - 3.28/2.1 GB/sec R/W bandwidth Optane 3D XPoint DC P4800X - 550,000 Read IOPS The DC P4600 comes in either U.2 or Add-in-Card (AIC) format and the capacities vary; U.2 - 1.6TB, 2TB, and 3.2TB 2TB and 4TB in AIC Intel P4500 SSD P4800X and P4500/4600 performance Intel doesn't directly compare the P4800X with the P3000 and other P4000 products, saying it's a new class of non-volatile device and media. It has higher endurance than the NAND P4000s, better, we assume, low queue depth performance, can be used as quasi-memory with DRAM, and is limited to a 375GB to (a coming) 1.5TB capacity range. All these points make it harder for customers to choose between the P4800X, with its glamorous XPoint media, and standard SSDs. We would think tbat Intel doesn't want the P4800X to cannibalise its existing NAND SSD sales and so its performance is characterised in a non-NAND way. It is difficult to estimate P4800X sales volumes as the application area is, we think, ill-defined and not well understood, and new as well. It will likely take some time to show if it is a useful device or not. We think that P4800X SSD sales in 2017 will be relatively low because of this. Turning back to NAND, in general we can think of P4000 SSDs as having up to 4TB capacity, 700,000+ read IOPS and 3.3GB/sec read bandwidth which compares very well indeed with the P3000's 2TB capacity, 460,000 read IOPS and 2.5 GB/sec read bandwidth. These are significant improvements. Intel has engineered new controllers and written its own firmware for the P4000 NAND SSD controllers and these must contribute to the performance boost. If Intel is to move its NVM business unit into profit then, we think, the P4000 NAND SSDs will play a crucial role, and their eye-catching performance numbers will help them do it. Whether that's enough, given the high level of SSD supplier competition and Intel's CAPAX needs, is another matter. Our bet is on another operating loss this time next year.® Bootnote Get a DC P4500 brief PDF here and the P4600 equivalent here .

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Roofline Model Boosts Manycore Code Optimization Efforts A software toolkit developed at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) to better understand supercomputer performance is now being used to boost application performance for researchers running codes at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and other supercomputing facilities. This work, spearheaded by computer scientists in Berkeley Lab’s Computational Research Division (CRD), is helping to address the growing gap between processor performance and memory performance—the “memory wall”—that can limit how well many scientific applications perform. Even with the fastest processors, if data gets bogged down moving in and out of memory, the processors end up waiting for data to process, which slows overall performance. With the popularity of manycore processors—such as the Intel Knights Landing processors in Cori, NERSC’s new 30-petaflop system—and the diversity of computing architectures, supercomputers are increasingly complex, making it difficult for users to achieve sustained application performance across different architectures. But understanding memory bandwidth limits can help explain the gap between theoretical and observed performance. Thus performance models and tools that aid users’ understanding of bandwidth limits for a particular application are crucial. Samuel Williams Visualizing Performance Potential Toward this end, in 2005 Sam Williams—then a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley and now a staff scientist in CRD’s Performance Algorithms Research Group —began sketching out a model that could estimate performance on a variety of kernels common to high performance computing. “As the HPC community transitioned from single-core to multicore architectures, it became clear we needed some means of visualizing the performance potential of various HPC kernels on the zoo of emerging manycore architectures,” Williams said, “At the time there was a great deal of buzz around IBM’s forthcoming Cell processor and interest in quantifying its performance on HPC codes. Unfortunately, as neither hardware nor simulators were yet available, we could not directly run benchmarks on the platform.” Williams’ initial model, which used bound and bottleneck analysis, was applied to the Cell processor, and in 2006 the performance results were published in a UC Berkeley Tech Report and in a well-received Computing Frontiers paper. He then began working to visualize the performance bottlenecks. After several iterations, the resulting model—dubbed “Roofline” by David Patterson, William’s thesis advisor at UC Berkeley—was published in Communications of the ACM in 2009. A Team Effort The Roofline Model is designed to enable users to assess the quality of attained performance of an application by combining data locality (how much data needs to move in and out of the processor), bandwidth (the speed at which that data can be moved) and different parallelization paradigms into a single performance figure, yielding a two-dimensional graph that clearly plots the bandwidth bottlenecks that must be eliminated to speed up the application. “The idea of Roofline is two-fold,” said Lenny Oliker, a computer senior scientist in CRD’s Performance Algorithms Research Group who has worked closely with Williams to refine and expand Roofline’s capabilities. “First, we need to understand the underlying hardware architecture (of the supercomputer), its capabilities and the performance of real codes running on it. Then we want to characterize actual applications and graph them onto the Roofline chart.” In practice, the Roofline model is a graph with an x and y axis where the x axis is the arithmetic intensity—a measure of flops per byte, explained Jack Deslippe, acting group lead for NERSC’s Application Performance Group who is working with Williams and other Berkeley Lab colleagues to extend the model and its applications. “In computer code what this means is how many floating point operations (FLOPs) do you do for every byte of data that you have to bring in from memory,” Deslippe said. “What the Roofline curve tells you is what performance you can expect from the system given the characteristics of your application or a subroutine of the application.” In the Roofline Model, the starting point for assessing performance is the peak computation rate, which is represented by a horizontal line showing the highest possible performance and resembles the top roofline of a building. The sloped part of the roof is determined by peak bandwidth between the memory where the data is stored and the processor where it is used to perform operations. The third pieces of the Rrofline structure are the upright, vertical “posts” indicating the arithmetic intensity—the ratio of the number of flops performed to the total number of bytes of data moved. The higher this ratio, the better the overall performance of the application. Since its initial development, what is now known as the Empirical Roofline Toolkit (ERT) has benefitted from contributions by several Berkeley Lab staff. In 2013, CRD’s Terry Ligocki developed a benchmark that could automatically characterize CPU and GPU architectures; this became the ERT. And in 2015 NERSC’s Matt Cordery created the toolkit’s initial instrumentation technology. Along the way, HPC users who write scientific applications for manycore systems have been able to apply the toolkit to their applications and see how changing parameters of their code can improve performance. Extending Functionality While the Roofline model has been used for a number of years to characterize supercomputing systems and architectures, over the past year it has been expanded to both visualize and guide application optimization, and new tools have been developed to support this, according to Deslippe. As part of this effort, NERSC’s Doug Doerfler has extended and applied the technology to the Knights Landing processors in the Cori KNL system. “We are using this model to frame the conversation with users about where their application stands,” Deslippe said. “It’s a good way to communicate with users about what they need to work on with a given application or subroutine. It takes a little of the mystery out of code optimization.” In addition, through a collaboration with Intel, the Roofline team has been working to incorporate Roofline into Intel’s Vector Advisor Tool, a vectorization optimization and shared memory threading assistance tool. The resulting Intel Advisor Roofline Tool allows users to collect Roofline performance data, including accurate FLOPs counts that correctly consider different vector registers and masks using Intel’s PIN tool, as well as accurate data traffic from various levels of the cache memory hierarchy. By determining the total number of FLOPs that will be performed and the amount of data that will be moved, plus the amount of time it will take to complete the job, users can plot the performance of their code on the Roofline graph. They can then use this plot to see how adjustments to how the code is set up can increase the performance. “In the past we were using Roofline to characterize the HPC systems themselves,” said Deslippe. “In the last year, we have gone to using Roofline not just for this but as a way to guide the optimization process for applications. There are all these new, novel parts of the Intel Knights Landing (KNL) hardware—very fast memory right on the chip, bigger vector units, manycores…—and they all sound impressive to the user, but how do they know which one is important for their application? This is where Roofline comes in.” Roofline Use Case: XGC1 code Over the past year, the Roofline team has been introducing NERSC users, including those involved in the NERSC Exascale Science Applications Program (NESAP), to the Roofline model to help them gauge performance improvements. For example, Tuomas Koskela, a NERSC postdoc who joined the center in 2016 to work on XGC1 (a fusion particle-in-cell code) as part of a NESAP project, has been using Roofline to improve the code’s performance on Cori. “We started talking about using Roofline last spring,” Koskela said. “It was interesting to me because I had a problem with my code that we didn’t understand why it wasn’t getting very good performance.” After using Roofline via Intel Advisor to optimize the performance of kernels of the XGC1 code for the KNL architecture, Koskela was able to dramatically improve the code’s performance on Cori. “This demonstrates an effective optimization strategy that has enabled this science application to achieve up to 4.6x speed-up and prepare it for future exascale architectures,” Koskela said. “The Roofline model is a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of applications with respect to the theoretical peak achievable on a given computer architecture.” NERSC is a DOE Office of Science User Facility.

Intel have unveiled a new Advanced Vehicle Lab in Silicon Valley, which is designed to further the company’s research into self driving and highly automated vehicles. The announcement was made at this year’s inaugural Autonomous Driving Workshop in San Jose. The new San Jose Vehicle lab is the fourth and largest vehicle research centre opened by Intel, with other labs situated in Arizona, Oregon, and Berlin. Intel says that every 90 minutes autonomous cars will produce roughly 4 terabytes of data, most of which will be processed and analysed within the vehicle itself. These labs are designed to assist this by coming up with new ways to address the data challenges present within the self driving vehicles. Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Group (ADG), Intel, said in a blog post: “Intel technology is in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles on the roads today. Not all carmakers are talking about who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets. But the fact is many of them are using Intel.” “I encourage you to open their trunks, boots or hatchbacks and see which tech company they are relying on the most to provide the brains for their development vehicles.” Intel stated that the theme of this workshop was “the data-driven journey” and how the challenges of data will affect every aspect of the future of autonomous vehicles, from design, to manufacture, to driving on real world roads. The company spoke of how they are working with Ericsson to provide a speedy and stable Intel, Ericsson 5G service that will be capable of handling this data, with a live demonstration of how 5G will carry autonomous driving data from the car to the cloud. During the Autonomous Driving Workshop, Intel also displayed one of the first of the planned 40 highly automated vehicles that had been produced as part of a partnership between BMW, Intel, and Mobileye. Last year, the three companies announced that they would bring autonomous vehicles into full series production by 2021.

Twitter Facebook Open-source chip mimics Linux's path to take on closed x86, ARM CPUs The RISC-V chip design can be licensed from SiFive Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 04 May, 2017 23:00 - - - - print email Comments If you're buying a PC or server, you've likely considered chips based on x86 or, perhaps less often, the ARM architecture. But like Linux in software, an open-source chip project is out to break the dominance of proprietary chips offered by Intel, AMD, and ARM. The RISC-V open-source architecture, created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2010, is open to all who want to use it. The RISC-V design can be modified for PCs, servers, smartphones, wearables, and other devices. A startup called SiFive is the first to make a business out of the RISC-V architecture. The company is also the first to convert the RISC-V instruction set architecture into actual silicon. The company on Thursday announced it has created two new chip designs that can be licensed. RISC-V shares the ethos of open-source software, with the community working together to share, advance, and modify the architecture. Since the project's inception, the interest in RISC-V has ballooned, with some of the big IT companies showing interest in the architecture. The RISC-V Foundation -- which manages and promotes the architecture -- counts Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, AMD, Huawei, and others among its 60 members. Nvidia is expected to use the microcontroller-style RISC-V designs in its chips, Companies like Google are developing chips in-house and could tweak RISC-V for servers, which could save them from buying Intel's expensive chips. SiFive's new 32-bit E31 Coreplex processor design is targeted at IoT devices, wearables, and low-power devices. The 64-bit CorePlex E51 could be used in servers, network processors, storage devices, and edge computing devices.  Like many Linux and open-source vendors, the goal of SiFive is to monetize the RISC-V design but at a modest cost. The new chip designs can be licensed for a fixed price from SiFive, but the company will not charge royalties. That makes it attractive alternative compared to chip designs from ARM and Imagination Technologies, which charge licensing fees and royalties. There's a lot of excitement around RISC-V, and licensing chip designs like CorePlex will help spread its adoption, said Krste Asanovic, a co-founder and chief architect at SiFive. He is one of the inventors of RISC-V. SiFive will also make chips starting later this year. The company earlier released the HiFive1 low-power board based on its RISC-V chip. The boards sold in the thousands. The company didn't provide the licensing prices for the CorePlex designs, but ordering them will be straightforward, SiFive officials said. Users can go on the SiFive website and get a direct quote. The RISC-V chip design is already a big hit in the academic circuits with many working groups discussing advances. The design was initially founded for academic purposes but was turned into a practical chip design by SiFive.  Some other open-source chips like OpenSPARC have lingered around but are based on old designs. The RISC-V Foundation has aggressively promoted the architecture, especially at Hot Chips, an annual gathering of semiconductor professionals. The RISC-V architecture has a different design than the highly integrated x86, Power, and to an extent, the ARM designs. It's modular, meaning that independent co-processing circuits can be attached to the central RISC-V design. For example, a security or networking coprocessor can be tacked onto the core design. That makes the RISC-V highly flexible, Asanovic said. SiFive is working on vector extensions, which will be helpful for high-performance computing. The core RISC-V design being promoted by RISC-V Foundation will remain constant, but SiFive has forked its own design and will keep advancing it. There's a shift to modular chip designs as integrating components becomes challenging. Moore's Law is also lapsing, creating new opportunities in chip design.  Integrating a CPU, GPU, and other circuits in one chip, like with Intel's and AMD's chips, has its own advantages, but questions remain on how long could this continue as manufacturing challenges mount. Intel is already relying on co-processors like Altera FPGAs and Nervana deep-learning chips to take on new tasks like machine learning and computing in autonomous cars.  The CorePlex IP allows the chips to be made using different manufacturing technologies, Asanovic said. For those that want to test RISC-V, it can be tested on FPGAs. A fork of Linux for RISC-V has also been created, meaning software support is growing, Asanovic said.

Yet as we begin to enter the era of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and especially self-driving trucks, this “proprietary approach,” whereby each OEM comes up with its own unique solution, may undergo some serious change – mirroring what occurred in the personal computer (PC) market several decades ago, according to Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of the automated driving group (ADG) at Intel Corp. “Autonomous driving will accelerate when the industry comes together to align on common platforms and technologies. That enables developers to go quickly and in volume while still differentiating their solutions in software,” he explained in a recent opinion column. Popular Now SCR or EGR? BYD showcases battery-electric trucks, buses at ACT Expo SmartDrive, McLeod integrate to offer streamlined TMS functionality “How do I know this? Let’s look at the PC and server industries as examples. Before 1980, the computer industry was highly proprietary, serving primarily researchers, big companies and hobbyists,” Davis noted. “This changed a few years later when IBM built the first personal computer using mostly off-the-shelf parts and an outsourced operating system.” Those early PCs were the base for a “standardized approach” to computer design that led to faster evolution of technology and 150-times growth for the PC industry in a just two decades, he stressed. “The data center is similar. After mainframes came microcomputers, [and they] enabled some flexibility and cost-effectiveness,” Davis pointed out. “But it was the adaptation of PC technology that allowed data centers to evolve quickly to handle the data that came with the Internet,” he said. “[Research firm] IDC reported there were 1.8 zettabytes of data generated in 2011, and now it estimates we will generate over 40 zettabytes by 2020. Only through standardized solutions have we been able to grow the industry fast enough to keep up.” And managing that huge volume of data will be critical to making AVs work properly – something both Davis and his Intel colleague Kathy Winter cannot emphasize enough. “The single most important factor in autonomous driving is data – how best to process it, manage it, move it, store it, share it and learn from it,” Davis stressed. “As we move down the road toward autonomous cars, the data challenge will become much more complex and require new ways to work with data inside the vehicle, throughout the network and across the cloud.” To ensure that the transportation industry and the system developers supporting it put “the absolute right strategy” in place to handle that massive data challenge, Davis said Intel has installed the first of several planned data centers dedicated to autonomous driving. “These unique labs will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as for understanding the special infrastructure needs for autonomous driving data movement and storage,” he explained. “Researchers will continually feed information from Intel’s test cars into these data centers to train neural networks and improve machine learning algorithms,” he noted. Which brings him to artificial intelligence (AI); the linchpin on which self-driving cars will either succeed or fail. “Mastering AI both inside the car and in the data center will be essential to the autonomous driving data challenge,” Davis said. “Here it’s important to remember that autonomous driving isn’t a game. When cars are thinking and acting without human intervention, they must be able to do so in a safe and trustworthy way.” He added that the “artificial intelligence” needed to make all of that happen isn’t just “computer vision,” either. “Think voice, decision-making, personalization and preferences,” Davis emphasized. “Each of those AI workloads needs a different set of algorithms and likely different kind of processing for optimum performance. If all we needed was a supercomputer to handle the autonomous driving data challenge, our work would be done. This brings him back to AVs and to whether they will become a reality or end up as just another science-fiction pipe dream. “There are plenty of naysayers,” Davis said. “There are plenty in the automotive industry who don’t understand how open collaboration can enable differentiation and innovation. I understand the skepticism, but from years of experience, I know that technology solves problems best when it’s organized around common platforms and predictable interfaces. Without a doubt, that’s the fastest way forward on our autonomous journey.” Davis also doesn’t think that society as a whole can afford to continue down a proprietary path where AVs are concerned. “The cost in time, money and human lives is too great,” he explained. “The faster we can deliver autonomous driving technology and take humans out of the driver’s seat, the faster we can save lives. It’s that simple – and that important.” That’s one view, at least, of what’s driving the development of AVs and driverless trucks forward. We’ll see how much headway this particular philosophy gets in the trucking industry.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 4, 2017 6:22 AM PT Credit: SiFive/CrowdSupply More like this ARM steps up chip performance to catch Intel, AMD Open source 25-core processor can be stringed into a 200,000-core computer As computing changes, Intel takes a fresh approach to chip design Video Windows 10 S hands-on If you’re buying a PC or server, you’ve likely considered chips based on x86 or, perhaps less often, the ARM architecture. But like Linux in software, an open-source chip project is out to break the dominance of proprietary chips offered by Intel, AMD, and ARM. The RISC-V open-source architecture, created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2010, is open to all who want to use it. The RISC-V design can be modified for PCs, servers, smartphones, wearables, and other devices. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ] A startup called SiFive is the first to make a business out of the RISC-V architecture. The company is also the first to convert the RISC-V instruction set architecture into actual silicon. The company on Thursday announced it has created two new chip designs that can be licensed. RISC-V shares the ethos of open-source software, with the community working together to share, advance, and modify the architecture. Since the project’s inception, the interest in RISC-V has ballooned, with some of the big IT companies showing interest in the architecture. The RISC-V Foundation—which manages and promotes the architecture—counts Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, AMD, Huawei, and others among its 60 members. Nvidia is expected to use the microcontroller-style RISC-V designs in its chips, Companies like Google are developing chips in-house and could tweak RISC-V for servers, which could save them from buying Intel’s expensive chips. SiFive’s new 32-bit E31 Coreplex processor design is targeted at IoT devices, wearables, and low-power devices. The 64-bit CorePlex E51 could be used in servers, network processors, storage devices, and edge computing devices.  Like many Linux and open-source vendors, the goal of SiFive is to monetize the RISC-V design but at a modest cost. The new chip designs can be licensed for a fixed price from SiFive, but the company will not charge royalties. That makes it attractive alternative compared to chip designs from ARM and Imagination Technologies, which charge licensing fees and royalties. There’s a lot of excitement around RISC-V, and licensing chip designs like CorePlex will help spread its adoption, said Krste Asanovic, a co-founder and chief architect at SiFive. He is one of the inventors of RISC-V. SiFive will also make chips starting later this year. The company earlier released the HiFive1 low-power board based on its RISC-V chip. The boards sold in the thousands. The company didn’t provide the licensing prices for the CorePlex designs, but ordering them will be straightforward, SiFive officials said. Users can go on the SiFive website and get a direct quote. The RISC-V chip design is already a big hit in the academic circuits with many working groups discussing advances. The design was initially founded for academic purposes but was turned into a practical chip design by SiFive.  Some other open-source chips like OpenSPARC have lingered around but are based on old designs. The RISC-V Foundation has aggressively promoted the architecture, especially at Hot Chips, an annual gathering of semiconductor professionals. The RISC-V architecture has a different design than the highly integrated x86, Power, and to an extent, the ARM designs. It’s modular, meaning that independent co-processing circuits can be attached to the central RISC-V design. For example, a security or networking coprocessor can be tacked onto the core design. That makes the RISC-V highly flexible, Asanovic said. SiFive is working on vector extensions, which will be helpful for high-performance computing. The core RISC-V design being promoted by RISC-V Foundation will remain constant, but SiFive has forked its own design and will keep advancing it. There’s a shift to modular chip designs as integrating components becomes challenging. Moore’s Law is also lapsing, creating new opportunities in chip design.  Integrating a CPU, GPU, and other circuits in one chip, like with Intel’s and AMD’s chips, has its own advantages, but questions remain on how long could this continue as manufacturing challenges mount. Intel is already relying on co-processors like Altera FPGAs and Nervana deep-learning chips to take on new tasks like machine learning and computing in autonomous cars.  The CorePlex IP allows the chips to be made using different manufacturing technologies, Asanovic said. For those that want to test RISC-V, it can be tested on FPGAs. A fork of Linux for RISC-V has also been created, meaning software support is growing, Asanovic said.

By the end of the year, BMW and Intel intend on having 40 prototypes on the streets and while they won’t be fully-autonomous, they will be advanced enough to operate without human intervention under many driving conditions. The vehicles combine a world class Intel processor with sensors and cameras provided by Mobileye, which was recently purchased for $15.3 billion by Intel. The companies first announced their partnership in July 2016 and intend on launching highly and fully automated driving systems by the year 2021. Speaking about this collaboration between the three companies, member of the board of management of BMW AG for development, Klaus Frolich said earlier this year that “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye. This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles.” PHOTO GALLERY CategoriesAutonomousBMWBMW 7-SeriesReportsTech Recommended ❬❬ Prev Next ❭❭ Home Top 3 All-New 2018 BMW X4 Spied White Tesla Model 3 Spotted In Traffic VW Golf R Performance Sounds Like A Baby Rally Car Trending Now New Mercedes-AMG E63 S Sprints To 300 Km/h Like It's Nothing The new Mercedes-AMG E63 S is absolutely ferocious.

London is hiring a Chief Digital Officer 8 Data Centre Intel gives Xeon a makeover to bring us colour-coded clouds Any Chipzilla kit for data centres are now members of the 'Xeon Scalable Family' Meet the family - the "Xeon Scalable Family" 4 May 2017 at 12:01, Simon Sharwood Intel's giving its Xeon CPUs a makeover. Details of enhancements to the chips' architecture will be revealed soon – we think in early June – ahead of a "mid-year" launch, which is about when it's assumed Skylake Xeons will land with a 14nm manufacturing process. The Register doesn't think Kaby Lake silicon, or its successor Cannon Lake, is what will emerge in mid-2017. We are being told the new Xeons will include a “brand new core, cache, on-die interconnects, memory controller and more.” The new CPUs will also offer “optimized features for compute, storage, and network”. Before the details emerge, we get a re-branding exercise that will see the Xeon E5 and E7 become part of a new “Xeon Scalable Family” that “Represents [a] new foundation for scalability” and covers CPUs destined for multi-socketed servers. The family will give its member CPUs metallic names: there will be Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum models, with more expensive metals denoting higher performance. Intel branding will tell us there's “Xeon Platinum Inside” and so on. Chipzilla also wants that branding to reach the names that clouds apply to their servers-for-hire so that users can more easily understand the performance offered by different cloudy VMs. Also in the "scalable family" will be Intel's solid state disks, including Optane. Chipzilla's Ethernet will be there too, alongside the Omni-Path fabric architecture, Xeon Phi, silicon photonics, the Nervana range and Xeons with field-programmable gate arrays. Keen-eyed Reg readers will by now have noticed we've not mentioned the Xeon E3 and Xeon D. Neither has made it into the "family" because they're intended for use in single-socket machines which isn't Intel's idea of scalable. Both are also being cut loose from the main Xeon development process and release cadence. Why is Intel suddenly all about scalability? We know that AMD is about to return to the server CPU market with its Naples silicon and that ARM-powered server silicon is breeding like rabbits, even tempting Microsoft to give them a run powering Azure. Intel's famous paranoia will be keen to nip those uprisings in the bud. Chipzilla also wants to remind buyers that no matter how impressive silicon looks on paper it takes time for an ecosystem to deliver all the pieces of big rigs that can handle big workloads. Intel has just an ecosystem in place in the form of its "Builders" program of folks who build compute at scale. Data centre products contributed US$4bn to Intel's bottom line last quarter alone. The "scalable family" is therefore also about scaling sales and revenue in one of the few markets that is both growing and dominated by Intel, as the company knows PC sales won't save it, that it missed the million-CPUs-a-year mobility market and is in for a fight to carve out a slice of the internet of things caper. ® Tips and corrections 8 Comments MORE Intel Xeon Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register AMD does an Italian job on Intel, unveils 32-core, 64-thread 'Naples' CPU Claims to be two times faster than Chipzilla's latest data centre processor 59 Comments Microsoft raises pistol, pulls the trigger on Windows 7, 8 updates for new Intel, AMD chips Don't want to use Windows 10?

In that list, we learned that the processors will have a new naming scheme, and we saw Gold and Platinum processors based on the LGA3647 socket having a wide range of numbers, but no core counts or clock speeds. Today’s unveiling is minor, but an official approach to the new platform. Due to the way that Intel is expanding its reach from processors to networking to FPGAs and beyond, it has been decided that a new naming scheme needs to be in place. Thus the Xeon E/EP/EX naming regime is being reintegrated into what is now called the ‘Xeon Scalable Processor Family’, of which the first set of products will be based on the Skylake microarchitecture. This is where the ‘SP’ in ‘Skylake-SP’ comes from, as the other abbreviations are now retired. The core of Intel’s unveiling today revolves around the different processor levels they will be offering, and where the new integrated options will fit in the new stack. In the slide above, Intel lists three integrated options: Omni-Path, Networking, and Accelerators. Integrated Omni-Path options have already been seen in Xeon Phi based products from the Knights Landing family, which occupy the same LGA3647 socket, so it is perhaps not surprising that it looks like Intel will offer some Skylake-SP Xeons with Omni-Path also integrated. Integrated Networking (asides from OmniPath) would suggest that Intel is looking towards deeper 1000Base-T (gigabit) options and even perhaps a nod to 10G, although this would most likely be provided by additional options on the chipset rather than on the processor (and stems from system integrator leaks we have already seen. As for integrated accelerators, here Intel mentions Intel QuickAssist (QAT) and AVX-512. AVX-512 is the next advancement in AVX instructions and we already see them in use with Xeon Phi, and we expect there to be the capabilities in silicon to run AVX-512 natively in Skylake-SP. Intel’s QAT is something we’ve seen in standalone PCIe cards before, so it would seem that Intel is also integrating this into the platform. After speaking with users familiar with QAT, due to what is needed to get QAT running at full speed, it would suggest that QAT will be chipset derived and platform dependent rather than purely on the processor. On the right hand of this slide, Intel mentions FPGA, Nervana, Xeon Phi and Silicon Photonics. The acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 put FPGA integration firmly on the roadmap for Intel’s Xeon product line, however Intel has not officially stated how these will be provided with the new Xeon-SP platforms. The fact that it isn’t listed under the integrated options suggests that Intel will only offer FPGAs as add-in cards (or add-in processors, like Xeon Phi, for dual socket systems) at this time. Intel is also working on new optimized frameworks for the hardware, particularly math and AI libraries. So along with the Gold and Platinum processors we saw last week, Intel will also be introducing Bronze and Silver grades as well. The Bronze group is aimed at entry performance, which sounds like the older low core count E5 parts, while the Silver parts seem aimed at lower power and will probably be low base frequency parts. The Xeon Gold family is aimed at accelerators and interconnects, which suggests they will be for multi-GPU or multi-socket platforms, while the Xeon Platinum will be the cream. Despite this potential correlation, we were told in our briefing, given by Lisa Spelman, VP and GM of the Data Center Group, that the previous E5/E7 naming split due to potential socket configurations goes away and now we should expect to see various CPUs in all segments correlating to a variety of socket configurations. One of the reasons for this is that sometimes a customer could take advantage of an 8-socket variant processor (due to high cache per core, for example), but would never consider it because the customer only needed a two-socket configuration. One of the reasons given for the naming is to alleviate this issue. It also means that we might see a lot more product SKUs coming to market, each with different configurations, naming, and capabilities depending on the accelerators. Typically Intel produces three dies for each Xeon generation – a low core count (LCC), a medium/high core count (MCC/HCC), and an extreme core count (XCC) version, and we see a variance up and down the stack depending on what dies fit in where: e.g. LCC were for single socket. With the new Scalable Processor Family naming scheme, we were told that Intel is trying to move away from this differentiation and just provide what the customer needs in the right segment. Not so much integration through obfuscation, but I kindly requested that when the official announcements are made, that the differentiations were made clear. Given the Gold/Platinum processor lists last week, it was unclear exactly what the numbering schemes represented, so in order to make the transition, it needs to be crystal clear. We were told that as this is the first generation of the Xeon-SP naming scheme, the generation is omitted from the name, but future product lines (Kaby Lake-SP) will have a generational marker to denote the difference. This may be in the form of v2/v3, but this isn't clarified at this time. Intel isn’t announcing any products today. This is more of an opportunity to take hold of the news that already exists, and perhaps get a step up ahead of the upcoming conference season. We were told to expect a launch in the middle of the year, and were told that Intel is still on track for that.

Last time I checked AMD didn't have remote execution attack vectors existing in a decade's worth of their CPUs, so AMD's pretty much more secure by default. Reply ddriver - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link That's the thing about backdoors. When they become public, it is a "flaw" or a "vulnerability", naturally, 100% accidental and unintended. And they scatter to patch it, because we cannot have anyone other than US affiliated spying agencies use those backdoors, and it goes without saying, each "patch" for the compromised backdoor implements a new one. But to be fair, AMD being a US company as well, it most likely comes with backdoors too, otherwise it will be a "national security threat" and "the choice of hackers, terrorists and generic devil worshipers". This pretty much applies to every western company, as the US sadly has the entire western world in its pocket. And pretty soon, when China offers its general purpose processors on the market, they will come with backdoors too, because if the US is doing it, then everyone else has to, or it puts them at a disadvantage. Its like the arms race, the nuclear arms race... you name it. Same old stupidity, pioneered by the same old criminal gang. Reply ImSpartacus - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link Fuck Yeah, America!

Colin Johnson 5/4/2017 08:00 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAKE WALES, Fla. ‐ Intel plans to add a super-scalable new Xeon processor family of supercomputer caliber central processing units sometime around the middle of this year. Intel's highest end processor in its new scalable Xeon processor family. (Source: Intel) The effort is called "re-architecting the data center with the Intel's Xeon-processor scalable family," said Lisa Spelman, vice president and general manager of the Intel Xeon Products and Data Center Marketing Group. The bottom line is that the whole group of Xeon models will be joined into a single family that allows easy scalability for top to bottom, instead of just marketing a mis-mash of Xeon E5 and E7 SKUs (stock keeping units). More like a super-SoC, the new scalable Xeon processor family has optical fabric, networking, accelerators and solid-state disk interfaces on-chip plus high-speed connections to its FPGAs, Nirvana deep learning, multi-processing Xeon Phi and silicon photonics. (Source: Intel) Like super-SoCs, the entire family will work together with Intel's other on-chip technologies, including its optical fabric, networking, accelerators and solid-state disk interfaces plus high-speed connections to its Altera FPGAs, its Nirvana deep-learning neural-network chips, its multi-processing Xeon Phi chips and it advanced silicon photonics. Details are scant, but Spelman cites IDC as predicting that 50 percent of Forbes' Global 2000 will be creating digitally enhanced products by 2020. Spelman also cites Gartner's prediction of an 80 percent increase in the "digital revenue" among large organization is coming by 2020, and PWC's prediction that 50 percent of the workforce will be Millennials by 2020. Intel has merged its E5 and E7 monikers, plus added hardware glue to each, creating a seamless family of scalable Xeon processors graded from bronze to silver to gold to platinum. (Source: Intel) As a result, datacenters will have to deal with an onslaught of data from virtual/artificial reality, autonomous cars, 5G connectivity, personalized medicine, genomic analysis, wearables, realtime inventory, smart agriculture and realtime pricing. Intel's re-architected, seamless, scalable family of new Xeon processor is designed to meet the performance, security and agility needs of this next decade of challenges, so says Spelman. — R.

By Lucas Mearian Senior Reporter, Computerworld | May 4, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Intel More like this NRAM set to spark a 'holy war' among memory technologies This new 3D XPoint memory could last forever What Aerospike learned from testing Intel's superfast Optane SSDs Video CW@50: 50 years of storage As the first new non-volatile, mass-marketed storage technology since NAND flash, 3D XPoint made a huge splash when it was first announced in 2015 by development partners Intel and Micron. It was touted as being 1,000 times faster than NAND flash with up to 1,000 times the endurance. In reality, the performance claims were only true on paper; 3D XPoint turned out to be about 10 times faster than NAND, which requires existing data to be erased before new data is written. The new solid-state memory, however, is likely to find a place in the data center since it is about half the price of DRAM (though still costlier than NAND). That's because it works with conventional memory technologies to boost performance. Intel Intel's PC module acts as a type of cache to accelerate the performance of computers with SATA-attacked storage. With the growth of transactional data, cloud computing, data analytics and  next-generation workloads will require higher performance storage. Enter, 3D XPoint. "This is an important technology that is going to have big implications for data center usage and to a lesser degree on the PC side," said Joseph Unsworth, Gartner's research vice president for semiconductors and NAND flash. "Whether it's your hyperscale data center, cloud service provider or traditional enterprise storage customers, they're all very interested in the technology." While 3D XPoint won't convince companies to rip and replace all of their server DRAM, it will allow IT managers to cut costs by replacing some of it -- while also augmenting the performance of their NAND flash-based SSDs. What is 3D XPoint? Simply put, it's a new form of non-volatile, solid-state storage with vastly greater performance and endurance than NAND flash. Price-wise, it lies between DRAM and NAND. DRAM currently costs a little north of $5 per gigabyte; NAND comes in around 25 cents per gig. 3D XPoint is expected to land at around $2.40 per gig for large volume purchases, according to Gartner. And it's expected to be much more costly than NAND through at least 2021. While neither Intel nor Micron have detailed what 3D XPoint is, they have said it's not based on the storage of electrons, as is the case for flash memory and DRAM, and it doesn't use transistors. They've also said it's not resistive RAM (ReRAM) or memristor -- two emerging non-volatile memory technologies considered possible future rivals to NAND. The process of elimination (backed by storage experts) leaves 3D XPoint as a type of phase-change memory, as Micron previously developed the technology and its properties closely resemble it. Intel Experts have postulated 3D XPoint is a type of phase-change memory, as Micron previously developed the technology and its properties closely resemble it. PCM is a form of nonvolatile memory based on using electrical charges to change areas on a glassy material -- called chalcogenide -- back and forth from a crystalline to a random state. That description matches up with what Russ Meyer, Micron's director of process integration, has said publicly: "The memory element itself is simply moving between two differentresistence states." [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] In PCM, the amorphous state's high resistance is read as a binary 0; the lower-resistance crystalline state is a 1. 3D XPoint's architecture is akin to a stack of submicroscopic window screens, and where wires cross there are pillars of chalcogenide material that includes a switch allowing access to stored bits of data. "Unlike traditional DRAM that stores its information in electrons on a capacitor or NAND memory that stores electrons trapped on a floating gate, this uses a bulk material property change of the material itself to store whether [a bit] is a zero or a one," said Rob Crook, GM of Intel's non-volatile memory solutions group. "That enables us to scale to small dimensions and that enables a new class of memory." Why is 3D XPoint getting so much attention? Because 3D XPoint technology delivers up to 10x more performance of NAND flash across a PCIe/NVMe interface, and has up to 1,000 times the endurance. One thousand times the endurance of NAND flash would be more than a million write cycles, meaning the new memory would last, well, pretty much forever. By comparison, today's NAND flash lasts for between 3,000 and 10,000 erase-write cycles. With wear-leveling and error correction software, those cycles can be improved, but they still don't get anywhere near one million write cycles. It's 3D XPoint's low latency -- 1,000th that of NAND flash and ten times the latency of DRAM -- that makes it shine, particularly for its ability to deliver on high input/output operations, such as those required by transactional data. The combo allows 3D XPoint to fill a gap in the data center storage hierarchy that includes SRAM on the processor, DRAM, NAND flash (SSDs), hard disk drives and magnetic tape or optical discs. It would fit between volatile DRAM and non-volatile NAND flash solid state storage. Intel Intel's first enterprise-class SSD based on 3D XPoint technology, the DC P4800X uses a PCIe NVMe 3.0 x4 (four-lane) interface. So why is it good for some data centers? James Myers, director of NVM Solutions Architecture for the Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group at Intel, said 3D XPoint is aimed at servicing random, transactional data sets not optimized for in-memory processing. (Intel calls its version of the technology Optane memory.) "Optane is going to be servicing the highest end of warm and part of the hot tier in terms of storage for architectures that aren't optimized [for in-memory processing]...or even to extend the memory size or space within that hottest tier," Myers said. "Those are very much random transactions." For example, it could be used to perform limited real-time analytics on current data sets or store and update records in real time. Conversely, NAND flash will grow in its use for storing near-line data for batch-based, overnight processing -- performing analytics with column-oriented database management systems. That will require queue depths of 32 outstanding read/write operations or greater. "Not a lot of people are willing to pay a lot of extra money for higher sequential throughput. A lot of those analytics ... can get done between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. when no one is transacting much business," Myers said. Intel's first 3D XPoint SSD - the P4800X -- can perform up to 550,000 read input/output operations per second (IOPS) and 500,000 write IOPS at queue depths of 16 or fewer. While Intel's top-tier NAND-flash based SSDs can achieve 400,000 IOPS or better, they only do so with deeper queue depths. Like DRAM, 3D XPoint can be byte addressable, meaning each memory cell has a unique location. Unlike block-level NAND, there's no overhead when an application goes searching for data. "This isn't flash and it's not DRAM, it's something in between, and that's where the ecosystem support's going to be important to be able to exploit the technology," Unsworth said. "We've not seen any [non-volatile] DIMM deployed yet. So it's still an area being worked on." The introduction of 3D XPoint as a new storage tier, according to IDC, is also one of the first major technology transitions to occur since the emergence of large cloud and hyperscale data centers as dominating forces in technology. When will 3D XPoint be available? Intel has carved out its own path separate from that of Micron for 3D XPoint technology. Intel describes its Optane brand as suited for both data centers and desktops, saying it strikes the perfect balance of accelerating access to data while affordably maintaining mega storage capacities. Intel The Optane memory PC accelerator module uses a PCIe/NVMe interface, getting Intel's 3D XPoint memory closer to the processor and with less overhead than a SATA-attached device. Micron sees its QuantX SSDs as best suited for data centers. But at least one executive alluded to the possibility of a consumer-class SSD down the road. In 2015, limited production of 3D XPoint wafers began at IM Flash Technologies, Intel and Micron's joint fabrication venture based in Lehi, Utah. Mass production began last year. Last month, Intel started shipping its first products with the new technology: the Intel Optane memory PC accelerator module for PCs (16GB/MSRP $44) and (32GB/$77); and the data center-class 375GB Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, ($1,520) expansion card. The DC P4800X uses a PCIe NVMe 3.0 x4 (four-lane) interface. The Optane memory PC accelerator module can be used to accelerate any SATA-attached storage device installed in a 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processor-based platform designated as "Intel Optane memory ready." The Optane add-in memory module acts as a type of cache to increase performance in laptops and desktops. While the DC P4800 is the first 3D XPoint-based data center SSD to be made available, Intel has said more will be coming soon, including an enterprise Optane SSD with 750GB in the second quarter of this year, as well as a 1.5TB SSD that's expected to ship in the second half of this year. Those SSDs will also be modules usable in PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots, which means they could be used in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Intel is also planning to ship Optane in the form of DRAM-style DIMM modules next year. Currently, Micron expects its first sales of a QuantX product in the second half of 2017, with 2018 being a "bigger year," and 2019 being the "break-out" revenue year. How will 3D XPoint impact computer performance? Intel claims its Optane add-in module cuts PC boot-up time in half, boosts overall system performance by 28% and loads games 65% faster. The DC P4800 performs best in random read/write environments where it can augment server DRAM. Optane lights up when running random reads and writes, which are common in servers and high-end PCs. Optane's random writes are up to 10 times the speed of conventional SSDs, with reads around three times faster. (For sequential operations, Intel still recommends NAND flash-based SSDs.) For example, the 375GB DC P4800 SSD retails for about $4.05/GB of capacity, with a random read rate of up to 550,000 IOPS using 4K blocks at a queue depth of 16. It has a sequential read/write rate of up to 2.4GB/s and 2GB/s, respectively. By comparison, an Intel NAND flash-based data center SSD such as the 400GB DC P3700 retails for $645 or about $1.61/GB. From a performance perspective, the  P3700 SSD delivers 4K random read rate of up to 450,000 IOPS at higher queue depth -- up to 128 -- with sequential reads/writes topping out at up to 2.8GB/s and 1.9GB/s, respectively. Intel How Intel's 3D XPoint Optane SSD compares with its data center-class NAND flash-based SSD. In addition, the new DC P4800 SSD is specified with read/write latency of under 10 microseconds, which is a lot lower than many NAND flash-based SSDs that sport read/write latency in the 30 to 100 microsecond range, according to IDC. The DC 3700, for example, has an average latency of 20 microseconds, twice that of the DC P4800. "The read and write latency of the P4800X is approximately the same, unlike flash memory-based SSDs, which feature faster writes versus reads," IDC stated in a research paper. Will 3D XPoint eventually kill NAND flash? Probably not. Both Intel and Micron have said that 3D XPoint-based SSDs are complimentary to NAND, filling the gap between it and DRAM. However, as sales of new 3D XPoint SSDs pick up and economies of scale grow, analysts believe it could eventually challenge existing memory technology -- not NAND, but DRAM. Gartner predicts that 3D XPoint technology will start seeing significant uptake in data centers in the late 2018. "It's gotten a lot of attention from a lot of key customers -- and not just servers, storage, hyperscale data centers or cloud customers, but also software customers," Unsworth said. "Because if you're able to cost effectively analyze databases, data warehouses, data lakes far faster and cost effectively, that becomes very appealing for the end user to be able analyze more data and do that in real time. "So we do believe this is a transformational technology," he added. That transformation, however, will take time. The data center ecosystem will have to adjust to adopt the new memory, including the new processor chipsets and third-party applications that support it. Additionally, there are currently only two providers: Intel and Micron. Longer term, the technology may be produced by others, Unsworth said. But there are other kinds of memory coming? There are --  namely, competing technologies such as Resistive RAM (ReRAM) and memrisor. But neither one has been produced in high capacities or shipped in large volume. Last fall, Samsung debuted its new Z-NAND memory, an obvious competitor to 3D XPoint. The yet-to-be released Z-NAND SSDs were purported to sport four times faster latency and 1.6 times better sequential reading than 3D NAND flash. Samsung expects its Z-NAND to be released this year. OK, so does this mean NAND is dead? Not by a long shot. While other non-volatile technologies may eventually challenge 3D XPoint, conventional NAND flash still has a long development road map ahead of it. It's likely to see at least another three rev cycles that will take it through at least 2025, according to Gartner. While the latest versions of 3D or vertical NAND stacks up to 64 layers of flash cells atop one another for more dense memory than traditional planar NAND, makers already see stacks exceeding 96 layers beginning next year and more than 128 layers in years to come. Additionally, current 3-bit per cell triple-level cell (TLC) NAND is expected to move to 4-bit per cell quadruple level cell (QLC) technology, further increasing density and driving down manufacturing costs. "This is a very resilient industry in which we have some of the biggest semiconductor vendors in the world...and China. China wouldn't be getting into the NAND flash industry with billions of dollars if they thought it wouldn't last more than three or four or five years," Unsworth said. "I see 3D NAND slowing down, but I don't see it hitting a wall."

Site Intel Group quoting Afriqiyah Media, a media group that publishes information regarding insurgents, as stating that the group’s Shura (Council) is conducting a study over the possible allegiance to the IS under the leadership of Abu Bakar Albaghdadi. Led by Abdubakar Shekau, Boko Haram a terrorist group came into existence in 2002 in west Africa’s Nigeria but spread to the neighboring Chad, Niger and Cameroon countries. The group has killed thousands of people in West Africa with at least 2, 000 killed during a single attack in Nigeria in 2014. The group has also carried out several other deadly attacks in Nigeria and is blamed for also using kids in their attacks. Yesterday a seven years old girl carried out a suicide attack in a market area in the town of Potiskum in Nigerial killing herself and five others. Officials blamed Boko Haram for the attack as the group has previously used children in their attacks. Boko Haram has also kidnapped at least 500 girls and women during raids in Nigerian towns and villages. During one attack in April 2014 the militant group kidnapped more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok town of Borno state in Nigeria and later claimed that all of the girls have converted to Islam and are married to the group’s fighters.

The announcement was made during the company’s first Autonomous Driving Workshop held in San Jose, California. At this workshop, Intel—together with BMW, Delphi, Ericsson and HERE—demonstrated progress toward autonomy. The theme of the day was “the data-driven journey”. The company’s Silicon Valley Lab joins Intel’s other labs in Arizona, Germany and Oregon. They have been created specifically to explore and better understand the various requirements related to self-driving vehicles and the future of transportation, including sensing, in-vehicle computing, artificial intelligence (AI), connectivity, and supporting cloud technologies and services. With the slew of information captured by cameras, LiDAR, radar and other sensors, autonomous cars are expected to generate approximately 4 terabytes of data every 90 minutes of operation. Most of this data will be processed, filtered, and analyzed in the car, while the most valuable data will be moved to the data center to update maps, enhance data models and more. Intel’s Autonomous Garage Labs work with customers and partners to come up with new ways of addressing the data challenge inside the vehicle, across the network and in the data center. Engineers at the labs use a variety of tools to advance and test in these areas, including vehicles equipped with Intel-based computing systems and different kinds of sensors that help gather data; autonomous test vehicles that practice real-world driving; partner vehicles and teams that are collaborating with Intel’s research efforts; and dedicated autonomous driving data centers.

The new solid-state memory fills a growing niche in the data center for processing transactional data Lucas Mearian (Computerworld (US)) 04 May, 2017 20:00 - - - - print email Comments As the first new non-volatile, mass-marketed storage technology since NAND flash, 3D XPoint made a huge splash when it was first announced in 2015 by development partners Intel and Micron. It was touted as being 1,000 times faster than NAND flash with up to 1,000 times the endurance. In reality, the performance claims were only true on paper; 3D XPoint turned out to be about 10 times faster than NAND, which requires existing data to be erased before new data is written. The new solid-state memory, however, is likely to find a place in the data center since it is about half the price of DRAM (though still costlier than NAND). That's because it works with conventional memory technologies to boost performance. Intel Intel's PC module acts as a type of cache to accelerate the performance of computers with SATA-attacked storage. With the growth of transactional data, cloud computing, data analytics and  next-generation workloads will require higher performance storage. Enter, 3D XPoint. "This is an important technology that is going to have big implications for data center usage and to a lesser degree on the PC side," said Joseph Unsworth, Gartner's research vice president for semiconductors and NAND flash. "Whether it's your hyperscale data center, cloud service provider or traditional enterprise storage customers, they're all very interested in the technology." While 3D XPoint won't convince companies to rip and replace all of their server DRAM, it will allow IT managers to cut costs by replacing some of it -- while also augmenting the performance of their NAND flash-based SSDs. What is 3D XPoint? Simply put, it's a new form of non-volatile, solid-state storage with vastly greater performance and endurance than NAND flash. Price-wise, it lies between DRAM and NAND. DRAM currently costs a little north of $5 per gigabyte; NAND comes in around 25 cents per gig. 3D XPoint is expected to land at around $2.40 per gig for large volume purchases, according to Gartner. And it's expected to be much more costly than NAND through at least 2021. While neither Intel nor Micron have detailed what 3D XPoint is, they have said it's not based on the storage of electrons, as is the case for flash memory and DRAM, and it doesn't use transistors. They've also said it's not resistive RAM (ReRAM) or memristor -- two emerging non-volatile memory technologies considered possible future rivals to NAND. The process of elimination (backed by storage experts) leaves 3D XPoint as a type of phase-change memory, as Micron previously developed the technology and its properties closely resemble it. Intel Experts have postulated 3D XPoint is a type of phase-change memory, as Micron previously developed the technology and its properties closely resemble it. PCM is a form of nonvolatile memory based on using electrical charges to change areas on a glassy material -- called chalcogenide -- back and forth from a crystalline to a random state. That description matches up with what Russ Meyer, Micron's director of process integration, has said publicly: "The memory element itself is simply moving between two different resistence states." In PCM, the amorphous state's high resistance is read as a binary 0; the lower-resistance crystalline state is a 1. 3D XPoint's architecture is akin to a stack of submicroscopic window screens, and where wires cross there are pillars of chalcogenide material that includes a switch allowing access to stored bits of data. "Unlike traditional DRAM that stores its information in electrons on a capacitor or NAND memory that stores electrons trapped on a floating gate, this uses a bulk material property change of the material itself to store whether [a bit] is a zero or a one," said Rob Crook, GM of Intel's non-volatile memory solutions group. "That enables us to scale to small dimensions and that enables a new class of memory." Why is 3D XPoint getting so much attention? Because 3D XPoint technology delivers up to 10x more performance of NAND flash across a PCIe/NVMe interface, and has up to 1,000 times the endurance. One thousand times the endurance of NAND flash would be more than a million write cycles, meaning the new memory would last, well, pretty much forever. By comparison, today's NAND flash lasts for between 3,000 and 10,000 erase-write cycles. With wear-leveling and error correction software, those cycles can be improved, but they still don't get anywhere near one million write cycles. It's 3D XPoint's low latency -- 1,000th that of NAND flash and ten times the latency of DRAM -- that makes it shine, particularly for its ability to deliver on high input/output operations, such as those required by transactional data. The combo allows 3D XPoint to fill a gap in the data center storage hierarchy that includes SRAM on the processor, DRAM, NAND flash (SSDs), hard disk drives and magnetic tape or optical discs. It would fit between volatile DRAM and non-volatile NAND flash solid state storage. Intel Intel's first enterprise-class SSD based on 3D XPoint technology, the DC P4800X uses a PCIe NVMe 3.0 x4 (four-lane) interface. So why is it good for some data centers? James Myers, director of NVM Solutions Architecture for the Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group at Intel, said 3D XPoint is aimed at servicing random, transactional data sets not optimized for in-memory processing. (Intel calls its version of the technology Optane memory.) "Optane is going to be servicing the highest end of warm and part of the hot tier in terms of storage for architectures that aren't optimized [for in-memory processing]...or even to extend the memory size or space within that hottest tier," Myers said. "Those are very much random transactions." For example, it could be used to perform limited real-time analytics on current data sets or store and update records in real time. Conversely, NAND flash will grow in its use for storing near-line data for batch-based, overnight processing -- performing analytics with column-oriented database management systems. That will require queue depths of 32 outstanding read/write operations or greater. "Not a lot of people are willing to pay a lot of extra money for higher sequential throughput. A lot of those analytics ... can get done between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. when no one is transacting much business," Myers said. Intel's first 3D XPoint SSD - the P4800X -- can perform up to 550,000 read input/output operations per second (IOPS) and 500,000 write IOPS at queue depths of 16 or fewer. While Intel's top-tier NAND-flash based SSDs can achieve 400,000 IOPS or better, they only do so with deeper queue depths. Like DRAM, 3D XPoint can be byte addressable, meaning each memory cell has a unique location. Unlike block-level NAND, there's no overhead when an application goes searching for data. "This isn't flash and it's not DRAM, it's something in between, and that's where the ecosystem support's going to be important to be able to exploit the technology," Unsworth said. "We've not seen any [non-volatile] DIMM deployed yet. So it's still an area being worked on." The introduction of 3D XPoint as a new storage tier, according to IDC, is also one of the first major technology transitions to occur since the emergence of large cloud and hyperscale data centers as dominating forces in technology. When will 3D XPoint be available? Intel has carved out its own path separate from that of Micron for 3D XPoint technology. Intel describes its Optane brand as suited for both data centers and desktops, saying it strikes the perfect balance of accelerating access to data while affordably maintaining mega storage capacities. Intel The Optane memory PC accelerator module uses a PCIe/NVMe interface, getting Intel's 3D XPoint memory closer to the processor and with less overhead than a SATA-attached device. Micron sees its QuantX SSDs as best suited for data centers. But at least one executive alluded to the possibility of a consumer-class SSD down the road. In 2015, limited production of 3D XPoint wafers began at IM Flash Technologies, Intel and Micron's joint fabrication venture based in Lehi, Utah. Mass production began last year. Last month, Intel started shipping its first products with the new technology: the Intel Optane memory PC accelerator module for PCs (16GB/MSRP $44) and (32GB/$77); and the data center-class 375GB Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, ($1,520) expansion card. The DC P4800X uses a PCIe NVMe 3.0 x4 (four-lane) interface. The Optane memory PC accelerator module can be used to accelerate any SATA-attached storage device installed in a 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processor-based platform designated as "Intel Optane memory ready." The Optane add-in memory module acts as a type of cache to increase performance in laptops and desktops. While the DC P4800 is the first 3D XPoint-based data center SSD to be made available, Intel has said more will be coming soon, including an enterprise Optane SSD with 750GB in the second quarter of this year, as well as a 1.5TB SSD that's expected to ship in the second half of this year. Those SSDs will also be modules usable in PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots, which means they could be used in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Intel is also planning to ship Optane in the form of DRAM-style DIMM modules next year. Currently, Micron expects its first sales of a QuantX product in the second half of 2017, with 2018 being a "bigger year," and 2019 being the "break-out" revenue year. How will 3D XPoint impact computer performance? Intel claims its Optane add-in module cuts PC boot-up time in half, boosts overall system performance by 28% and loads games 65% faster. The DC P4800 performs best in random read/write environments where it can augment server DRAM. Optane lights up when running random reads and writes, which are common in servers and high-end PCs. Optane's random writes are up to 10 times the speed of conventional SSDs, with reads around three times faster. (For sequential operations, Intel still recommends NAND flash-based SSDs.) For example, the 375GB DC P4800 SSD retails for about $4.05/GB of capacity, with a random read rate of up to 550,000 IOPS using 4K blocks at a queue depth of 16. It has a sequential read/write rate of up to 2.4GB/s and 2GB/s, respectively. By comparison, an Intel NAND flash-based data center SSD such as the 400GB DC P3700 retails for $645 or about $1.61/GB. From a performance perspective, the  P3700 SSD delivers 4K random read rate of up to 450,000 IOPS at higher queue depth -- up to 128 -- with sequential reads/writes topping out at up to 2.8GB/s and 1.9GB/s, respectively. Intel How Intel's 3D XPoint Optane SSD compares with its data center-class NAND flash-based SSD. In addition, the new DC P4800 SSD is specified with read/write latency of under 10 microseconds, which is a lot lower than many NAND flash-based SSDs that sport read/write latency in the 30 to 100 microsecond range, according to IDC. The DC 3700, for example, has an average latency of 20 microseconds, twice that of the DC P4800. "The read and write latency of the P4800X is approximately the same, unlike flash memory-based SSDs, which feature faster writes versus reads," IDC stated in a research paper. Will 3D XPoint eventually kill NAND flash? Probably not. Both Intel and Micron have said that 3D XPoint-based SSDs are complimentary to NAND, filling the gap between it and DRAM. However, as sales of new 3D XPoint SSDs pick up and economies of scale grow, analysts believe it could eventually challenge existing memory technology -- not NAND, but DRAM. Gartner predicts that 3D XPoint technology will start seeing significant uptake in data centers in the late 2018. "It's gotten a lot of attention from a lot of key customers -- and not just servers, storage, hyperscale data centers or cloud customers, but also software customers," Unsworth said. "Because if you're able to cost effectively analyze databases, data warehouses, data lakes far faster and cost effectively, that becomes very appealing for the end user to be able analyze more data and do that in real time. "So we do believe this is a transformational technology," he added. That transformation, however, will take time. The data center ecosystem will have to adjust to adopt the new memory, including the new processor chipsets and third-party applications that support it. Additionally, there are currently only two providers: Intel and Micron. Longer term, the technology may be produced by others, Unsworth said. But there are other kinds of memory coming? There are --  namely, competing technologies such as Resistive RAM (ReRAM) and memrisor. But neither one has been produced in high capacities or shipped in large volume. Last fall, Samsung debuted its new Z-NAND memory, an obvious competitor to 3D XPoint. The yet-to-be released Z-NAND SSDs were purported to sport four times faster latency and 1.6 times better sequential reading than 3D NAND flash. Samsung expects its Z-NAND to be released this year. OK, so does this mean NAND is dead? Not by a long shot. While other non-volatile technologies may eventually challenge 3D XPoint, conventional NAND flash still has a long development road map ahead of it. It's likely to see at least another three rev cycles that will take it through at least 2025, according to Gartner. While the latest versions of 3D or vertical NAND stacks up to 64 layers of flash cells atop one another for more dense memory than traditional planar NAND, makers already see stacks exceeding 96 layers beginning next year and more than 128 layers in years to come. Additionally, current 3-bit per cell triple-level cell (TLC) NAND is expected to move to 4-bit per cell quadruple level cell (QLC) technology, further increasing density and driving down manufacturing costs. "This is a very resilient industry in which we have some of the biggest semiconductor vendors in the world...and China. China wouldn't be getting into the NAND flash industry with billions of dollars if they thought it wouldn't last more than three or four or five years," Unsworth said. "I see 3D NAND slowing down, but I don't see it hitting a wall." Network Professionals Survey with Computerworld Australia More from Computerworld Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Jesse Jackson and his PUSHTech2020 initiative raised $42,500 to support scholarships and CS-Tech programs in the Oakland Unified School District. “I am extremely proud and honored to present this contribution to Oakland’s students,” Rev. Jackson said. “Nobody is more deserving.  If their minds can conceive it, their hearts can believe it, I know they can achieve anything in the world.  Keep PUSHing for success and excellence.” Speaking at the Oakland Public Schools Computer Science Showcase at Oakland Technical High School on Thursday, April 20, Rev. Jackson appealed to technology companies to partner with the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) to expand their computer science programs . Responding to the call, Microsoft, Intel and 11 West Partners all stepped up to match the $10,000 Rainbow PUSH contribution; Comcast contributed $2,500. One hundred percent of the $42,500 raised by PUSHTech2020 will go directly to support scholarships and CS-Tech programs in OUSD. The district’s tech-CS program and future strategy was on full display, brilliantly articulated by district manager of Computer Science, Claire Shorall. She said, by 2020, “the Oakland Unified School district will ensure that all students PK-12 have access to rigorous computer science education in the classroom and beyond.” Existing tech partners from Intel, Salesforce and SAP participated in a panel discussion on their work, moderated by Oakland Public Education director Brian Stanley. Intel’s partnership with Oakland Technical High School and McClymonds High School brings $5 million in computer science funding to these schools and creates internship and career pathway opportunities.   Salesforce has invested $2.5 million to support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education in six Oakland middle schools. Acting superintendent Devon Dillon provided remarks, touting Oakland’s dramatic expansion of computer science instruction. Over the past two years, the number of OUSD students taking computer science classes has increased 1,000 percent. Of students enrolled in computer science, 45 percent are young women, 29 percent identify as African American, and 38 percent identify as Latino, in line with the district’s overall student population —an important step toward tech equity. “Because OUSD is located in the technology capital of the world, we know how much tech firms need highly qualified computer programmers and engineers,” said Interim Superintendent Devin Dillon. “We are on the right track in exposing an exponentially growing number of our students to computer science, and we are confident that some OUSD students will be the tech leaders of tomorrow.” Rev. Jackson applauded the work of OUSD and its tech partners, and appealed for the broader tech community to align with Oakland public education students.  “Tech companies can’t look past Oakland looking for talent.  There is a wealth of talent and creativity among Oakland’s youth.  There are hidden geniuses everywhere.  We can build a a pipeline of talent from Oakland to Silicon Valley and the tech industry… not just India or China. The event was being organized by a partnership including the Oakland Unified School District, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition/PUSH Tech 2020, and the Oakland Public Education Fund.Rev Jesse Jackson Touts Computer Science with  OUSD – $42,500 Raised Scholarships and CS-Tech Programs.           source: Butch Wing and Pastor Joseph Bryant [email protected]   Share this: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr jesse jacksonPUSHTech2020 initiativescience program Previous ArticleTHE (05-04-17) EURweb Free-4-All Page Next ArticleLA’s Leading Activists, Business Execs and Influencers Pay Tribute to 'Magic' and Cookie Johnson Show/Hide Comments Speak your Mind Cancel reply Follow Us Recent Videos Top Views THE (05-05-17) EURweb Free-4-All Page May 5, 2017 ‘Leveraging/Branding the Skateboarding Culture’: An Entrepreneurial Meet ‘N Greet at GCC May 4, 2017 Are Lonzo Ball & Beyonce Overcharging a Struggling Black America?

Image: Alexander Tolstykh/Shutterstock Revised development proposal will enable Intel in Leixlip to compete for $4bn chip manufacturing facility. Intel Ireland has reportedly been granted planning permission for a revised manufacturing facility in Leixlip that will help it to bid for a major investment, generating 850 new jobs. Intel is competing against other sites around the world, including in the US and Israel, for a next-generation chip manufacturing project. ‘This planning permission now ensures that Intel Ireland can bid for the tender, which, if successful, will create 3,000 construction jobs and in excess of 850 full-time jobs once developed’ – ALLAN SHINE The company’s Irish facility currently supplies half of the world’s 14-nanometre chips. Intel Leixlip is key to big bets on future technology Intel came to Ireland in 1989 and has grown to employ more than 4,000 people. The operations have deftly manoeuvred to account for every major technological shift, from supplying a large portion of the world’s Pentium chips during the PC age, to becoming a powerhouse for big bets on cloud, mobile and internet of things innovations. According to The Irish Times, Intel’s application for a two-storey development to provide 90,000 sq m of additional space has been approved by Kildare County Council. Intel already had a 10-year planning permission granted in 2013, but subsequently revised its plans for a smaller facility and submitted a new proposal to Kildare County Council, which has now been given the green light by authorities. “This planning permission now ensures that Intel Ireland can bid for the tender, which, if successful, will create 3,000 construction jobs and in excess of 850 full-time jobs once developed,” said the CEO of County Kildare Chamber, Allan Shine. “This is great news for Kildare and further demonstrates that Kildare is the location of choice for existing and potential business enterprises. “I am confident that Intel Ireland will be successful in this bid as Kildare is primed for further development,” added Shine. The revised plan will contain a number of new structures, including buildings for water treatment, purification and electrical. It also includes proposals to widen the R148 road, which skirts the facility, as well as adjustments to internal roads at the giant operation. Intel stand at the recent CeBIT 2017 event in Hanover.

By Tas Bindi | May 4, 2017 -- 01:56 GMT (18:56 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel has shuffled its executive ranks again, announcing that long-time executive Diane Bryant is stepping down from her role as GM of the Data Center Group (DCG). Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an email to employees that Bryant would be stepping away for six to eight months to tend to a personal family matter. Navin Shenoy, formerly GM of the Client Computing Group (CCG), will be heading up the DCG, which is Intel's second-largest business unit in terms of revenue behind the CCG. In the latest quarter, the DCG reported revenue of about $4.2 billion, more than a quarter of Intel's total quarterly revenue and representing a 6 percent year-on-year increase. "DCG is a central part of our transformation and corporate strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution," CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. Bryant was appointed leader of the DCG in 2012 after four years as Intel's CIO. In the email, Krzanich credited Bryant for transforming DCG "from a server-centric group to a business that spans servers, network, and storage across all end-user segments, and with product lines and business models that extend beyond the traditional." Intel is hoping DCG will become a bigger revenue driver than the CCG, which deals in PCs. The goal is to put more server chips and equipment in datacentres as computing moves into the cloud and as the Internet of Things market grows. Shenoy will have one month to work with Bryant before she hands over leadership and begins her leave of absence. Bryant will be given a new position upon return. "Management changes can be distracting, but it is critical that we all give Navin, Diane, and the CCG leadership team our full support during this transition and focus on delivering leadership products and executing flawlessly," Krzanich wrote to employees. Meanwhile, Doug Davis, the chip giant's SVP and GM of the Autonomous Driving Group, wrote an article saying the reason he decided to postpone his retirement from the company in which he spent more than 30 years is because of Intel's potential in the autonomous driving sector. Davis believes Intel is not getting enough credit for its role in autonomous driving technology, saying that many autonomous vehicle carmakers are not talking about "who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets". In the article, Davis said that he firmly believes Intel is best equipped to address the data challenge associated with autonomous driving technology. According to Intel, autonomous cars will generate about 4TB of data -- from cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, and other sensors -- every 90 minutes of operation. To prepare for this, Davis said the company has set up the first of several planned datacentres dedicated to autonomous driving, which will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as understanding the infrastructure required for autonomous driving data movement and storage. At an event in San Jose, California, Intel and BMW also unveiled the first of approximately 40 autonomous cars built on the 7 Series platform that it will be testing on the road. The vehicles will include technologies such as cameras for road scanning from Israeli company Mobileye, which Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in March. Under its partnership with Intel, BMW will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, component integration, and evaluation of functional safety including setting up a high-performance simulation engine. All the cars are expected to be on the road by the end of the year. Intel also unveiled on Wednesday its Advanced Vehicle Lab in Silicon Valley, which it said will explore artificial intelligence, connectivity, in-vehicle computing, sensing, and other technologies required to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. It joins the company's other labs in Arizona, Oregon, and Germany. Intel is among a growing cohort of tech companies looking to capitalise on autonomous driving technology, including Apple, Baidu, BlackBerry, Google, Lyft, Nvidia, and Uber. what's hot on zdnet The death of the smartphone and the birth of the next big thing The new Surface Laptop is no Chromebook C3 IoT CEO Tom Siebel: CEO, boards driving IoT, digital transformation deals Hundreds of privacy-invading apps are using ultrasonic sounds to track you Related Topics Innovation, CXO, Tech Industry, Tech and Work, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Innovation Microsoft to open up about its Cortana Skills Kit at Build Innovation Affordable driverless cars: How Bosch is quietly stepping up its AI drive with new lab Innovation ​Curtin University deploying sensors and analytics to create 'smart campus' Mobility Connected vehicle trial expanding to Sydney × Thank You Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription I agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

(KGO-TV) Wednesday, May 03, 2017 09:45PM SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Intel took the wraps off a new garage Wednesday where engineers will tinker with the cars of the future as self-driving cars inch closer to your driveway than ever before. While the ribbon cutting was quiet, the innovation inside will echo around the world. "It's looking around to see if there's a safe distance and changing lanes," Intel representative Anthony said. Anthony may be in the driver's seat, but really, he's just along for the ride. The cars have sensors and cameras pointed in every direction, allowing the car to generate so much data that within a week, the trunk would be filled with hard drives. The trick is how to use all that data, and then quickly make room for more. Intel is teaching the cars to drive in different countries. "In the U.S. we have left freeway exits, we have right turns on red," BMW Engineer Grant Mahler said. With no human to talk to, designers have to figure out how you'll interact with the car, from how long you need to hold the button down to how the car will convince you to trust it. "People obviously want to feel safe, they want to feel comfortable; physically comfortable yes, but more importantly psychologically comfortable," Intel Internet of Things Creative Director Matt Yurdan said. An autonomous BMW could hit the market by 2021. Related Topics: technologyintelself driving carcardriver Email share share tweet email Load Comments Please enable JavaScript to view comments.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: Yates testimony could come within 'weeks' Overnight Cyber: FBI, NSA chiefs brief House Intel behind closed doors | DHS warns Congress on phone security Comey, NSA chief brief House panel amid Russia probe MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates could testify before the panel within "weeks." “We're in consultation with the counsel for Sally Yates, Directors Clapper and Brennan – we're trying to see if we can get that on calendar in the couple weeks following this recess and I'm confident that we will,” Schiff said on MSNBC's “Rachel Maddow Show," referring to the former Director of National Intelligence and former CIA director, respectively. Schiff referred to next week's upcoming recess when House lawmakers are set to return to their home districts to get face time with constituents. They will resume work in Washington on May 16, according to the House calendar. ADVERTISEMENT FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency head Adm. Michael Rogers briefed the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session earlier Thursday. The panel is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. While details of Thursday's session are classified, Schiff signaled the investigation is advancing under the leadership of Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who took over the probe amid a deteriorating relationship between Schiff and committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). “I think today it went very well. And we are making progress,” he said. “Mike Conaway and I have worked together in the last several weeks that we've been tasked with doing this jointly in a very nonpartisan, very matter of fact way. We're back to scheduling our witnesses. We're back to getting our hearing on track,” Schiff told MSNBC. Conaway replaced Nunes, who recused himself from the investigation in March shortly before the House Ethics Committee announced its own investigation into Nunes over possible "unauthorized disclosures of classified information." Much of the acrimony on the House panel stemmed from an appearance by Yates that was scheduled in March but canceled at the last minute by Nunes. Reports have indicated Yates was likely to offer testimony contradicting that of Trump administration officials. Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) 3 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE San Jose, Calif. — The numbers didn’t add up for Intel Corp. to stay heavily involved in the auto industry in the 1990s. But nearly two decades later, billions in potential revenues add up just fine and have the chipmaking giant back in the auto game in a big way. Driving the company’s return in recent years is the lure of Big Data — the information that connected vehicles can sense, collect, sort, package and send to the Cloud, and eventually sell to all kinds of customers. One estimate puts the value of data collected by cars at $750 billion by 2030. That’s too much money for any tech company to ignore. And it’s why the leading seller of computer chips over the past 20 years, once a supplier of micro-controllers in selected cars and trucks, has aligned itself with several partners to offer a turnkey driverless car system, capable of harnessing the data and monetizing it. “Hopefully at the end of the day, you’ll believe... in this partner and collaboration strategy,” said Kathy Winter, vice president of Intel’s Automated Driving Group, welcoming press to the company’s new San Jose Innovation Center this week. “And that you’ll believe that Intel is well-positioned to build on not only the in-car compute, but also this connectivity and network experience, and then finally thinking about the data center... when you put all of that together into a single solution.” The highlight so far of Intel’s bid to get into the autonomous game was its March announcement the company would shell out $15.3 billion for Israel-based Mobileye NV, maker of on-board cameras and sensors for autonomous driving. “At 4 terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3,000 people,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote employees in an e-mail explaining the acquisition. “Put just 1 million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population.” That move has been bolstered by partnerships with others like Delphi Automotive PLC, BMW AG and Ericsson AB, each emerging as key players in the push to help automakers develop cars that drive themselves and on-board tools that capture data. “The only way we’re going to solve this problem across the industry is not by ourselves but through working and picking the right players and partners,” Winter said. Even Intel’s Innovation Center, based here in San Jose, was planned with an eye toward luring in more collaborators. Winter described it as “a place where “we can be close to potential partners, potential start-ups (and) close to OEM partners that have a presence out here in (Silicon Valley).” In the 1990s, Intel officials were less optimistic about their place in the industry. For a company on the cutting edge of computer chip technology, it was all about new developments and constantly increasing processing speeds. Automakers, however, needed technology that would be in their vehicles for a decade or more. Intel was faced with having to continue providing outdated technology over the lifetime of those vehicles and, ultimately, decided that was not going to be profitable. Today, the prospect of improving vehicle technology is far simpler with the development of over-the-air software updating. And Intel isn’t the only chipmaker to notice. Samsung, which is now challenging Intel as the global leader in chip sales, received approval this week to begin testing its own self-driving car in South Korea. Nvidia’s technology is currently being utilized by the likes of Tesla Inc. and Volvo Cars Ltd. And Qualcomm, already working with Volkswagen AG and Panasonic, awaits finalization of its $47 billion acquisition of semiconductor maker NXP. “That acquisition is still in progress, but we expect to close in the second half of this year, likely in the fourth quarter of this year,” said Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm’s vice president of product management. “NXP is the number one automotive semiconductor (manufacturer).” A March headline at Forbes.com had Intel “playing catchup with Nvidia and Qualcomm...” But it’s hardly playtime for the chip industry these days. Two years of declining global PC sales have companies looking for new revenue streams. And the urge to wind up on top of the autonomous-and-connected vehicle game has forced many tech and auto companies to crack open their wallets. A year ago, General Motors Co. ponied up $1 billion for San Francisco-based Cruise Automation. And last month the automaker announced it would invest another $14 million in the start-up’s operations there. Not to be outdone, Ford Motor Co. announced in February it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI over the next half-decade. The Pittsburgh company will help develop the brains of Ford’s self-driving cars. Richard Wallace, director of the transportation systems analysis group at Ann Arbor’s Center for Automotive Research, described the positioning among companies as “interesting to watch.” “Certainly, Intel paying 60 times earnings for Mobileye just strikes some as ridiculous,” he said. “And a billion dollars for Cruise Automation — a company that had no customers yet? “We can’t even judge which one is worth it or not yet. The market is not even responding to objective fact. It’s responding to these gut instincts in some ways and peoples’ feelings about technology versus their feelings about more tangible items, about brakes and steering wheels.” JLynch@detroitnews.com 3 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2pbTwi3 TOP VIDEOS Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47 Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

Instead of E3, E5, and E7 branding, the chips would be given metallic names, from Bronze at the bottom-end through Silver and Gold to Platinum at the top. Today, the company made this new branding official as part of a larger shake-up of its Xeon platform. The next generation of Xeons, due to arrive this summer, will make up what Intel calls the "Xeon Scalable Processor Family." This explains the change in core naming that is accompanying the new branding; the SP suffix is replacing the E, EP, and EX suffixes used in previous-generation Xeons.

Skylake will hit datacenters as Xeon Processor Scalable family by Jeff Kampman  7:53 AM on May 4, 2017 Intel's Skylake Xeons are among the most anticipated tech that will launch this year. This morning, the company confirmed the naming scheme it'll be using when those processors come to market. Skylake datacenter parts will launch under the "Xeon Processor Scalable" umbrella, and that lineup will comprise chips in "Platinum," "Gold," "Silver," and "Bronze" sub-families. The logic behind this branding will be immediately obvious to anybody who's ever watched the Olympics. Intel says the Scalable lineup will replace its Broadwell Xeon E5 and Xeon E7 CPUs. Today's announcement is largely about branding, but the company did confirm several new features coming to at least some Xeon PS chips. The biggest new feature in these chips might be the introduction of the Advanced Vector Extensions 512, or AVX-512, instruction set outside parts in the Xeon Phi family. Xeon PS parts will also introduce a technology called Volume Management Device, or VMD, that the company says will allow for hot-plugging of NVMe devices and minimal service disruptions during those hot-plug operations. According to briefing slides from Anandtech, Intel will also be offering Xeon PS customers parts with integrated controllers for the company's Omni-Path HPC fabric, Ethernet, and QuickAssist software-defined infrastructure accelerators. Those slides suggest that the Altera FPGA tech and Nervana deep-learning tech that Intel has acquired of late will remain complementary accelerator cards instead of on-die integrations. Intel says the Xeon Processor Scalable family will arrive in "mid-2017." Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Mike Conaway and California Rep. Adam Schiff said Thursday. The lawmakers issued a statement announcing the development following a closed-door classified briefing with FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. “We are currently sending out invitations for witnesses to testify and requests for pertinent documents,” the lawmakers said. They provided no names, though several former Trump campaign advisers have offered to testify in front of the panel. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort has offered to speak with the committee. Advisers Carter Page and Roger Stone have offered to testify in an open hearing. Conaway and Schiff praised Thursday’s hearing, saying that it provided a “valuable opportunity” to follow up on testimony Comey and Rogers gave in an open hearing in March. During that hearing, Comey acknowledged for the first time the the FBI is investigating Russia’s meddling in the election, including whether Trump campaign advisers colluded with Kremlin operatives. The committee is also looking into whether the Obama administration illegally leaked classified information about Trump advisers. Conaway and Schiff also said they hope to hold an open hearing with former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Director John Brennan. The three Obama appointees were scheduled to appear at a hearing last month. Those plans were scrapped at the last minute by committee chairman Devin Nunes. Nunes, a California Republican, has since recused himself from the investigation. Conaway is now overseeing the probe. Yates and Clapper are slated to testify next week at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing. Yates, who was fired by President Trump at the end of January, reportedly plans to testify that she warned the White House about former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s inconsistent statements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. Flynn has offered to talk to the committee in exchange for immunity.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Core i7-7700K temperature spikes enrage users Core i7-7700K temperature spikes enrage users Paul Taylor 12 hours ago CPU Reports are circulating that Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K CPUs are hitting temperature spikes of 90ºC (194ºF) for no apparent reason, even on non-overclocked builds. If micro-stuttering complaints weren’t already widely known, according to a reader on The Register who goes by the name Bastard-Wizard, the flagship Intel chips will, for no reason at all, kick themselves into overdrive and start heating up like crazy, reaching a temperature well beyond what you’d accept for an internal component. The spikes are even affecting systems with more advanced cooling systems, like closed-circuit liquid coolers. While Intel rates the Tjunction maximum temp of the Core i7-7700K as 100ºC (212ºF), users are livid with the thought their hard-earned cash is going towards global warming, while their radiator/fans rev up into an annoying whine, or simply feel cheated by the fact they feel there is no real reason for it to happen. It seems users have also been begging Intel for a fix, ever since the issue was first detected shortly after its launch, but Intel has fallen short of a satisfactory answer. In a forum post, the chipmaker is attributing the temperature spikes to normal computing peaks, like when you load up an app on your PC, although, arguably, it would take a very heavy task to drive up the temperature like that. KitGuru Says: What has been your experience with the Core i7-7700K? Have you tripped on the same issue, or is the prevalence ‘few and far between’?

The Taiwanese technology titan has their fingers in a number of different product categories, so it’s only appropriate that they’ve sent us a technology sampler of sorts with products from three of their major categories: video cards, networking gear, and of course, motherboards. All told we have AMD and NVIDIA video cards, AMD and Intel motherboards, a router, and a WiFi adapter to give away this afternoon. So we have a number of prizes to give away to our lucky winners. ASUS ROG STRIX Radeon RX 580 Gaming OC Edition (RX-580-O8G) ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 OC Edition 6GB 9Gbps (1060-O6G-9) ASUS RT-AC1900P Dual-Band Wireless-AC1900 Gigabit Router ASUS PCE-AC88 4x4 802.11ac AC3100 PCIe WiFi Adapter ASUS Prime X370 motherboard ASUS Prime Z270-A motherboard The AnandTech 20th Anniversary Celebration – Asus Giveaway ASUS ROG STRIX Radeon RX 580 Gaming OC Edition Starting things off is ASUS’s ROG STRIX Radeon RX 580 Gaming OC Edition video card. Part of the company’s high-end ROG imprint, the Strix RX 580 is their factory overclocked Radeon RX 580 card, featuring a default 1360MHz clockspeed. ASUS ROG Strix RX 580 Specifications   ASUS ROG Strix RX 580 AMD Radeon RX 580 (Reference) Boost Clock 1360MHz 1340MHz Memory Clock 8Gbps 8Gbps VRAM 8GB 8GB TDP N/A 185W Power Connectors 8pin 8pin Length 11.73" N/A Width 2.5 Slot N/A Cooler Type Open Air N/A ASUS classifies this as a 2.5 slot card, and between that and the 11.73” length, this is a sizable beast of a card. Putting that space to good use, the card is equipped with a trio of the company’s “wing-blade” fans, which also support zero fan speed idling. Meanwhile as you’d expect for a high-end video card, this is built on a custom ASUS PCB, equipped with a 7+1 phase power delivery system built from ASUS’s Super Alloy Power II components. Rounding out the package is a full RGB lighting system built into the shroud, courtesy of ASUS’s Aura Sync lighting technology. ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 OC Edition Our second video card from ASUS’s collection is their GeForce GTX 1060 OC Edition. While not a high-end card like the ROG Strix, the GeForce card features its own set of tricks. In particular, this factory overclocked card is one of the first GTX 1060 cards on the market to feature 9Gbps GDDR5 memory, which NVIDIA only recently started offering on factory OC cards. Coupled with that is 100MHz GPU frequency bump, making for a sizable boost over the reference GTX 1060. ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 OC 9Gbps Specifications   ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 OC 9Gbps NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB (Reference) Boost Clock 1809MHz 1709MHz Memory Clock 9Gbps 8Gbps VRAM 6GB 6GB TDP N/A 120W Power Connectors 6pin 6pin Length 8.6" 9.75" Width Double Slot Double Slot Cooler Type Open Air Blower ASUS’s GTX 1060 is equipped with their DirectCU II cooler – a dual fan open air cooler – which like its ROG counterpart, also implements their “wing-blade” fans and zero fan speed idling. The card’s PCB is also equipped with ASUS’s Super Alloy Power II components to further set it apart from other cards. ASUS RT-AC1900P Dual-Band Wireless-AC1900 Gigabit Router Third up is one of ASUS’s routers, the RT-AC1900P. This is a dual-band, 3 antenna router supporting 3x3 MIMO on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. With the addition of support for Broadcom’s proprietary TurboQAM feature, this means the router can hit 600Mbps on 2.4GHz and 1300Mbps on 5GHz. In terms of wired connectivity, the RT-1900 features a quarter of GigE ports, along with another GigE uplink port. A USB 3.0 port and a USB 2.0 port are provided to take advantage of the router’s significant OS capabilities, including network share hosting, cellular modem connectivity, and network printer hosting. Internally, the router is powered by a dual-core 1.4GHz processor, though ASUS doesn’t specify the exact make. ASUS PCE-AC88 4x4 802.11ac AC3100 PCIe WiFi Adapter Meanwhile if you need wireless connectivity on the client side of matters, ASUS has also sent over one of their PCE-AC88 WiFi adapters. This PCIe card based adapter offers 4x4 MIMO streams and the latest-generation MCS-11 (1024-QAM) modulation modes, allowing it to transfer up to 2167Mbps on the 5GHz band. The adapter also uses an external antenna pod with adjustable antennas, to allow for the best antenna positioning. ASUS Prime X370 Motherboard Getting to our motherboards, we also have ASUS’s Prime X370 motherboard. The AM4 motherboard sports 3 PCIe x16 slots (2x 3.0, and 1x 2.0), 3 PCIe x1 slots, and a single full-feature M.2 slot. In terms of third party controllers, we’re looking at an ASMedia controller for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) support, a Realtek ALC S1220A for audio, and an Intel I211-AT GigE LAN controller. And as this is a Prime board, ASUS hasn’t skimped on the features either. The board features ASUS’s “5X” hardware protection, including their reinforced “SafeSlot” PCIe slots. And on the BIOS side the board features their usual high-end BIOS features – including one-click overclocking and CrashFree BIOS 3. ASUS Prime Z270-A Motherboard Last but certainly not least, we have ASUS’s Intel motherboard, the Prime Z270-A. This full ATX LGA 1151 board offers 3 PCIe x16 slots and another 4 PCIe x1 slots. The board also features a pair of M.2 slots – one pure PCIe and the other offering both SATA and PCIe. ASUS has also added several third-party controllers to the board, including an ASMedia USB 3.1 (Gen 2) controller, an Intel I219V controller for GigE networking, and a Realtek ALC S1220A for audio. Otherwise like its AMD counterpart, ASUS has similarly equipped it in terms of features, including the 5X hardware protection and high-end BIOS features. The board also features a dedicated clock generator (which ASUS dubs Pro Clock) for improved overclocking, and the company is even embracing customization via 3D Printing, publishing the blueprints for a few accessories that can be printed for the board. Finally, as with our other giveaways, this afternoon’s giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so be sure to enter soon. However please note that for legal reasons, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. Good luck to everyone! And be sure to check in tomorrow for our next giveaway.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough.

Hey it was that or something pithy about how it looks no different. So droll and on trend. Sadly my poor pc won’t run it whatever, so don’t even get to try. Boo! Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah! When you’re as old as I am and remember having had to tweak config.sys and autoexec.bat files in DOS to free memory at boot, editing a small confil file is no big deal! :)) Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 08:51 Mister eX says: It’s by no means a big deal, but not every game allows that kind of outside tweaking – like an optional “user.cfg” file with the Frostbite engine – where you can change stuff that’s not available in the game’s or config util’s settings, or in the default settings file. You have to do research on what kinds of parameters you can put in there, etc… 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 10:26 BlueTemplar says: The Surface Pro 3 has a native resolution of 2160×1440 (3:2 or 13.5:9), which is _way_ too high in pixel density (216 ppi) for a 12.0 inches (30 cm) screen. You have to run it with scaling, which causes all sorts of issues with older software and additional screens – annoying for what is supposed to be a “Pro” device. So recently I settled on running it directly at 1440×900 (16:10), with no scaling. It’s the native horizontal resolution of 2160 divided by 1.5, so the blurriness is minimized, it has a pixel density of a bit more than 140 ppi, which feels not too dense, and the integrated graphics can better withstand games at that resolution. This also means I can run some games windowed at 1280×720. Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 19:06 Nolenthar says: Fun times.

I had an Atom based tablet for a little while, and it was perfectly content running games like Rise of Nations, an absolutely fantastic yet by todays standards ancient game and it ran it great. we just cannot expect devs to cater for every single hardware combo out there, and you would buy hardware for a particular use case. Its like buying photoshop for your ZX Spectrum and complaining to adobe that it won’t work. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

By Hayden Dingman Games Reporter, PCWorld | May 4, 2017 9:25 AM PT Credit: PC Gaming Show More like this January's powerful new PC hardware: Next-gen chips, wild cases, exotic... Ryzen 7 1800X and Radeon Fury X: Building the water-cooled, fire-breathing... Ryzen review: AMD is back Video You should play: Everything Third time’s the charm, hopefully. After a marathon three-hour debut at E3 2015 and then being bullied out of its time slot by Ubisoft for E3 2016, PC Gamer's PC Gaming Show is back for a hopefully drama-free E3 2017—though a change in sponsors adds a juicy bit of intrigue of its own. This year’s iteration of the PC Gaming Show will take place on Monday, June 12 at 10 a.m. Pacific. In the past that would’ve put them in conflict with Microsoft’s conference, but Microsoft’s pulled a Bethesda and shuffled off to Sunday afternoon instead, leaving the PC Gaming Show, Ubisoft, and Sony to hold down Monday. The first two PC Gaming Shows were funded primarily by AMD, but this year it’s “powered by Intel.” I’m not sure whether AMD bowed out amicably or Intel outbid, but either way it’s an interesting shake-up. AMD’s shown off new Radeon hardware at the show the last two years, and we might’ve expected to see the hotly anticipated Radeon Vega graphics cards make an appearance for 2017. Will Intel use the show as a forum for new hardware? Harder to say. [ Further reading: These 20 absorbing PC games will eat days of your life ] That’s mostly behind-the-scenes politicking though. Up front the show will be much the same as always, though presumably a bit more polished as it goes into its third year. Sean Plott a.k.a. Day9 will host again, and expect the same flood of trailers from PC-centric publishers like Bohemia, Tripwire, Nexon, and more. If you’re in the Los Angeles area June 12 and want to swing by the Ace Hotel, you’re also welcome to attend the show in person. Tickets are available on the site free of charge, though I expect they’ll be gone before long. Best of luck, and see you in 39 days.

Peter Bright - May 4, 2017 4:42 pm UTC reader comments 45 Share this story Further ReadingNext-generation Xeons to come in “Gold” and “Platinum” versionsLast month, Intel's new naming scheme for its Xeon processors leaked. Instead of E3, E5, and E7 branding, the chips would be given metallic names, from Bronze at the bottom-end through Silver and Gold to Platinum at the top. Today, the company made this new branding official as part of a larger shake-up of its Xeon platform. The next generation of Xeons, due to arrive this summer, will make up what Intel calls the "Xeon Scalable Processor Family." This explains the change in core naming that is accompanying the new branding; the SP suffix is replacing the E, EP, and EX suffixes used in previous-generation Xeons. Enlarge Intel The change is motivated by the increased diversity in what Intel actually sells. Processors aren't just processors any more; integrated Ethernet networking is already commonplace, and, with the Xeon-SP platform, Intel plans to integrate its QuickAssist accelerators (currently available as PCIe cards that accelerate cryptography and compression workloads), the AVX512 vector instruction extensions, and its Omni-Path interconnect. Intel also sells more than just processors and is positioning its Optane memory, FPGAs, Xeon Phi many-core accelerators, and silicon photonics products as broader parts of the platform. Under the old branding scheme, multiple elements of processor design were conflated. Intel built three iterations of each core: low core count (LCC), medium/high core count (MCC/HCC), and extreme core count (XCC). Their primary differentiator was their core count and cache size, but these variations were also tied to the E3/E5/E7 family. Under this system, certain needs were left poorly addressed. For example, an 8-socket E7-branded XCC processor might be a good fit for a particular workload because of its large cache, but a customer might only want to use it in a 1- or 2-socket configuration, and hence wouldn't consider it. Enlarge Intel The new scheme should be more flexible. The metal will imply the range of features integrated, with Bronze representing basic processors, Silver low power, Gold adding different options for advanced interconnects and integrated accelerators, and Platinum offering the widest range of capabilities. It seems as if Intel will be able to offer, for example, an LCC design with Platinum features for workloads with a strong dependence on the accelerators and add-in cards (or add-in processors) like Xeon Phi, or an XCC part with Bronze features for workloads that can use lots of cores and cache but don't need any of the more exotic capabilities that Intel offers. However, the exact configurations are at present a complete unknown. Although the Gold and Platinum leak last month revealed many, many different model numbers, there's no indication yet of what those model numbers actually mean. As such, we still don't know exactly what combinations of core count, socket count, and features will be offered, and so we don't know how much of a change the new platform truly represents. That information won't arrive until nearer to the launch of the actual processors. Listing image by Intel Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Intel and Delphi’s self-driving car handles Silicon Valley traffic just fine Dean Takahashi@deantak May 4, 2017 9:30 AM I took my first ride in a self-driving car yesterday. It was during the grand opening of Intel’s Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif. Automotive supplier Delphi used some Intel electronics and other tech to retrofit an Audi SUV into an autonomous vehicle. I piled into the back with a couple of other journalists and we took a two-mile drive through real Silicon Valley traffic. We had a safety driver who could take over the car in case of emergency. But once we were out on the road, the driver pressed a button and the self-driving software took over. The car’s display showed what the vehicle’s artificial intelligence and vision system could see, based on data coming in from 26 different sensors. I could see other cars as gray objects and possible routes in green. The sensors can generate 45 terabits of data per hour, and they help the car generate its “world view,” or the area around it. The sensors included cameras on all sides, Lidar (light detection and ranging), and radar. The Lidar shows you what’s around the immediate vicinity, and the sensed objects, such as cars or pedestrians, show up on the screen. On the screen, you can also see the color of the traffic signal, even if it happens to be obscured from your view. That’s because the traffic lights on the test route were outfitted with dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), which allow the signal to wireless broadcast the status of the signal to the sensors in the car. Above: One of the cameras on the Delphi car. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The car took off just like one controlled by a human driver would. It made decisions quickly, and it pulled off a perfect lane change a couple of times, though it actually moved into the right turn lane more quickly than I would have done. When we turned into a street that had no lane markers the car wasn’t confused about where the lanes were. Overall, it was a fairly complex route, with plenty of signals and traffic. Not once did the car make me worry about my safety. The car picked up speed limit changes on the signs, and it adjusted its speed accordingly. All the processing took place in the vehicle, and our driver never had to put his hands on the wheel. The route wasn’t preprogrammed, though the car did have a couple of waypoints it had to reach. Beyond that, it figured out the best route on its own. The autonomous car wasn’t overly cautious, and it felt very human in that way. The demo was flawless. Intel is testing a bunch of cars in the lab in San Jose. Jack Weast, chief systems architect for autonomous driving solutions at Intel, said that the multiple redundant sensors are necessary because you need to have the right tool for the job. You can’t build a house with just a hammer, and you need multiple sensors and a variety of processors to handle the tasks of a self-driving car. Above: Intel’s Jack Weast, system architect for self-driving cars. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi “It’s quite an interesting data challenge because there are lots of different kind of sensors with different kinds of processing,” Weast said. A fully autonomous car could require 10 cameras, five Lidars, and 10 radars. With all those sensors, a single autonomous car can generate 4 terabytes a day of data, Weast said. You can connect to cellular or Bluetooth networks. Over time, Intel wants to bring 5G wireless networking into the car. That could bring tremendous speeds of multiple gigabits per second into the car. That kind of bandwidth is necessary in the future as you bring additional data into the car, such as high-definition maps. And the car computer eventually goes outside the car to the cloud for additional processing power, said Rick Topol, general manager of 5G business and technology at Intel. Above: Intel executives (left to right) Kathy Winter, Doug Davis, and Patricia Robb dedicate their new Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The AI in the car is a lot more than just computer vision. It has to be able to process voice commands and it has to learn how driving in your particular neighborhood will be different from driving in New York City, Weast said. That AI has to be very smart to be smarter than a human, who, on average, trains about 100 hours before getting a license. And the car has to be able to make a variety of decisions. Some split-second emergencies have to be dealt with in a matter of milliseconds, or a thousandth of a second. Some decisions take a few seconds, and some are longer-term decisions, said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer at Delphi. In the future, cars are going to need around 15 to 20 teraflops, or 10 to 20 times the computing power that is in cars today. I can imagine a world where we have zero drivers distracted by smartphones on the road. Zero drivers who are tired or drowsy. Zero drivers who have very little experience driving. That’s the promise of self-driving cars, said Jeff McVeigh, vice president and general manager for visual computing products at Intel. Above: Yep, that’s a server in the trunk. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Yesterday was hot, and as I stood in the middle of the garage, I heard a humming noise. I thought it was an air conditioner, or the sound of a motor running. In fact, it was the sound of a big server running in the trunk of a car. As I looked at it, analyst Jack Gold came over and said these things are going to use a huge amount of power. Intel also showed off some other technologies that still have to be developed. One of them is a subsystem that helps build trust with the passenger. If a passenger is totally nervous about whether the car is going to crash, it won’t be a fun ride. So Intel has added things like a display in the passenger window. If you use your smartphone to order your self-driving car to come pick you up, how will you know if you have the right car when a driverless vehicle drives up? The display will have your name in the window to greet you. Above: Intel’s self-driving car lab. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi And once you get in the car, you’ll see a display in the middle panel. You have to enter a pin code into the display, since you wouldn’t want someone to be able to steal your phone and go joy riding. You then press a “Go” button on the display for a long time, since you want the car to be sure you really want to start moving. The display will show you what the car sees ahead of it. If there are a bunch of cones blocking off a lane, you don’t have to worry. The display will say, “lane closed ahead” so you don’t have to freak out that the car hasn’t seen it. It’s all part of making you free relaxed as a passenger. Intel will be testing the trust software in its Lincoln MKZ test car in the next month. Intel executive Doug Davis said that Intel technology powers more than 30 models of cars, and 100 million vehicles use its Wind River operating system. Intel is engaged with 33 “tier 1” carmakers. “While Intel didn’t show anything new at their workshop event they hadn’t shown at their numerous global events, they did pull everything together into one time and place,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “Intel’s strategy is an end to end one that comprehends the data center, network, the wireless area network (WAN), and the car, and they’re the only company who can offer this combination. Intel showed off this combination, and this was impressive. I believe Intel is more successful inside the car for compute than anyone gives them credit for, and it will be interesting when the disclosures are done how many designs have Intel inside.”

Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Allegion, Arecont Vision, Assa Abloy, Axis Communications, Boon Edam, Byremote, Digitus Biometrics, EMKA, Exacq Technologies, FutureNet Security Solutions, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Hurricane Fence Company, MOXA, and Perimeter Protective System. Commenting on the report : “One trend in market is increase in the use of Docker container technology. Docker containers aid in the deployment of distributed applications easily. Many enterprises are adopting Docker container technologies by moving their applications from VMs. Several CSPs, managed hosting services, and Linux vendors are supporting container technology as an alternative to virtualization.These containers use shared operating systems instead of virtualizing hardware, which is proving to be more efficient than hypervisors with regard to the use of the system’s resources. The increased use of container technologies is also compelling vendors to focus on providing better security. As many CSPs and managed hosting services facilitate the move to Docker container technology, the need for security by the vendors will be a major revenue booster for the market.” Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global data center security market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the adoption of both physical and logical security solutions to calculate the market size. The market is divided into the following segments based on geography: Americas APAC EMEA According to the report, one driver in market is growing construction of data center facilities. There is a trend among enterprises to adopt cloud-based services for at least one of the operational needs of their businesses. In terms of cloud infrastructure, the CSPs are rapidly expanding their availability zones to come closer to the customer to reduce network latency and facilitate high-availability services. The major CSPs involved in the construction of data centers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Aliyun (Alibaba Group). These CSPs are involved in the construction of mega data center facilities that can operate thousands of IT infrastructures. In 2016, Amazon Web Services added 11 availability zones out of which five were in the Americas, two in EMEA, and four in APAC. In 2016, Google opened two data centers in Oregon (US) and Japan. Microsoft opened data centers in the UK and Germany. It is also attempting to operate data centers under water on a trial basis. IBM opened data centers in the Nordic region and South Africa. Aliyun opened four data center in Australia, Dubai, Germany, and Japan. REQUEST a sample of Global Data Center Security Market Report @ www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/256271 Further, the report states that one challenge in market is growing complexity of cyber attacks. Most of the applications belonging to organizations are vulnerable to attacks by cyber criminals due to the rapid adoption of cloud-based services, big data analytics, and IoT. The application layer is prone to more security risks as the number of connected devices increases. The open infrastructure of the Internet has increased privacy and security risks. Cyber attacks are leading to the loss of critical business data and also damaging the physical infrastructure of the data center. Many data center are identifying several attempts from hackers to gain access to critical information. This is also shooting up the OPEX that accounts for the resources needed to recover from such security breaches.

London is hiring a Chief Digital Officer 55 Personal Tech Gamers red hot with fury over Intel Core i7-7700 temperature spikes High-end CPUs prone to randomly running near thermal limit 4 May 2017 at 07:02, Shaun Nichols Owners of Intel's new i7-7700 processors say the chips have been randomly revving up to extremely high temperatures, and Chipzilla won't give the issue so much as a second look. Reg reader Bastard-Wizard says that he and many other i7-7700 owners are finding that the chips will occasionally kick themselves into overdrive, running at temperatures as high as 90°C (194°F) at times. Intel says the i7-7700 will run at temperatures up to 100°C (212°F). "My own chip suffers from it, (without any overclocking) which is quite an annoyance," our tipster writes. "This despite a delid modification and a proper water loop, resulting in the fans ramping up and down very frequently, and the temperature appearing to frequently spike near the danger zone." The users note that these temperatures are even being seen in high-end gaming rigs with liquid cooling setups with the chips running at fairly low voltages. "At this point though, with the temps most people are seeing, even good chips capable of hitting high clocks at low voltage still have very little headroom due to the thermal spikes these chips are displaying at even stock settings," notes user mrobscura. "It's ridiculous that previous gen chips run cooler at equal or higher clocks despite needing to pump much higher voltage through them to obtain said clocks." Making things worse, the users say, is that after more than three months of asking for a fix or even an explanation from Intel, the only response from Chipzilla has been a forum post more or less shrugging off the matter. "The reported behavior of the 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700K Processor, showing momentary temperature changes from the idle temperature, is normal while completing a task (like opening a browser or an application or a program)," an Intel rep told the customers. "In our internal investigation, we did not observe temperature variation outside of the expected behavior and recommended specifications." Even if the high temperatures don't pose a risk to the health of the chip itself, the effect of constant spikes will wear on the nerves of PC owners who see their cooling fans constantly spinning up to top speed, only to rev back down seconds later and repeat when the next temperature spike hits. El Reg has asked Intel for comment on the matter, and the chip giant is sticking with the "it's a feature, not a bug" line. "For the i7-7700K, momentary temperature changes from the idle temperature are normal while completing certain tasks like opening a browser or an application," a spokesperson said. "We've looked into the reports and have not seen any unexpected behavior or indication of performance impact." For those annoyed by the constant on-and-off frenzy of cooling fans, Intel suggests you set the speed control so that the whirring kicks up gradually, rather than all at once. We're sure customers will find that recommendation to be wholly satisfying and adequate for their concerns.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Group of Google veterans starts self-driving tech firm 2017-05-05 07:32 - Alex Webb, Bloomberg News Post a comment 0 share: An Uber self-driving car drives down 5th Street in San Francisco, California. Cars in Uber's self-driving cars are back on the roads after the program was temporarily halted following a crash in Tempe, Arizona in March. (Pic: Justin Sullivan, AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case Driverless cars finally steer near showrooms Honda in talks with Google on self-drive tech Washington - A mile away from where Google builds the maps used by people around the world, a 25-person startup is trying to do something similar for robots. DeepMap, which was founded by mapping veterans of Alphabet, is building systems enabling self-driving cars to steer through complex cityscapes. DeepMap plans to license its map-building software to automakers and technology companies looking to teach cars how to drive. The company recently raised a $25m funding round led by Accel, adding to the $7m it raised last year. In the chase to secure the investment, the firm penned an 80-page white paper on DeepMap's technology. Investors are eager to grab a piece of self-driving cars after big startup deals, such as General Motors' acquisition of Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies' purchase of Otto. But new entrants face sizable competition, whether in autonomous technology or mapping. In addition to Silicon Valley juggernauts Alphabet, Apple and Uber, Amsterdam's TomTom is building its own 3-D maps, as is HERE, a project jointly owned by several automotive giants and Intel. Andreessen Horowitz and GSR Ventures also invested in DeepMap. Martin Casado, the lead Andreessen partner on DeepMap, said startups can compete with much larger companies because their businesses have fewer conflicts. This enables them to work with just about anybody and focus on the software, which typically has higher profit margins. "DeepMap isn't bound to a particular application like ride-sharing, and they're not bound to a particular company," Casado said. DeepMap fuses images from digital cameras with data collected using a laser device known as lidar to build detailed 3-D maps. It can identify street signs, billboards and the height of a curb. The 3-D maps complement the sensors by giving the cars a detailed awareness of the environment outside the car's view. James Wu, who started the company with his former Google Maps colleague Mark Wheeler, said he hopes to have three customers by the end of the year, while generating as much as $10m in revenue. "Having the map lets us define for the robot the rules of the world," said Wu, who has also worked on mapping projects at Apple and Baidu. "It's very easy to make a prototype car that can make a few decisions around a few blocks, but it's harder when you get out into the world." A diaspora of autonomous driving entrepreneurs from Google has spread throughout Silicon Valley. Google X founder Sebastian Thrun just spun an autonomous car startup out of his online learning company Udacity. Top engineers Chris Urmson and Bryan Salesky have set up companies called Aurora Innovation and Argo AI, respectively. Another engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is the focus of an embittered legal battle between his former employer Alphabet and Uber over allegations that he stole intellectual property from the search giant when he left to form his startup, Otto.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: self-driving cars  |  mapping share: More In This Category US opens criminal investigation into Uber Tracking innovation helps community combat crime New TV service launched to rival Netflix, Showmax WhatsApp restored after two-hour blackout Most Popular Read New smartphone player quietly enters SA with cheap devices WhatsApp restored after two-hour blackout New TV service launched to rival Netflix, Showmax Apple's dilemma: what to do with $256bn cash pile Tracking innovation helps community combat crime Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

Getting it back, and gaining access to all it offers, is as easy as installing a plugin. by Erich Styger · May. 05, 17 · IoT Zone Free Resource Like (2) Comment (0) Save Tweet {{ articles[0].views | formatCount}} Views Edit Delete {{ articles[0].isLocked ?

Join For Free One great thing with Eclipse compared to proprietary IDEs are the thousands of available plugins. Yes, not every plugin is probably on the ‘must have’ list, though I have listed some in a series starting with 5 Best Eclipse Plugins: #1 (Eclox with Doxygen, Graphviz, and Mscgen). The ‘traditional’ approach to installing Eclipse plugins is using the menu Help > Install New Software. Using that approach, I have to use or enter an Eclipse update site. An easier way is to use the Eclipse Marketplace plugin, which allows me to search and browse for plugins and simplifies installation of it. But as this one does not come installed by default with MCUXpresso. Still, it is my preferred way to browse and install plugins into Eclipse: Eclipse Marketplace under Eclipse Neon and MCUXpresso IDE This article is part of a series to get up to speed using the new NXP MCUXpresso IDE. Published so far are: MCUXpresso IDE: Unified Eclipse IDE for NXPs ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers MCUXpresso IDE: S-Record, Intel Hex, and Binary Files MCUXpresso IDE: Importing Kinetis Design Studio Projects MCUXpresso IDE: Installing Processor Expert into Eclipse Neon Outline This article is part of a series of articles about the MCUXpresso IDE. The NXP MCUXpresso IDE v10.0 is Eclipse Neon (4.6)-based, but does not come with the Marketplace plugin installed. In this article, I’m showing how to install the Eclipse Marketplace into Eclipse Neon. The Eclipse Marketplace is a plugin inside Eclipse which I can use to search, browse and install extra Eclipse plugins. To install the client, use the menu Help > Install new Software and use the update site.  If using a different Eclipse version (e.g. kepler or mars), make sure use the corresponding update site. Filter for ‘market’ and you should see the Marketplace Client: Installing Eclipse Marketplace Client into Eclipse Neon Select it and go through the installation process, with a restart of Eclipse at the end. Using the Market Place After installation, I have a new menu item: Eclipse Marketplace menu Using it, I can browse and install the plugins which are listed on the marketplace. For example, I can search for a plugin like added color themes: Eclipse Marketplace under Eclipse Neon and MCUXpresso IDE For example, I can select and install the above plugin (Darkest Dark theme), which gives Eclipse a new look: Darkest theme If an Eclipse distribution does not include the Eclipse Marketplace client, it is easy to install it. After installation, I have a convenient way to get access to all the plugins available on the marketplace. Another usage of the Eclipse Market Place plugin is to install additional software that helps to use legacy Kinetis Design Studio projects in MCUXpresso IDE, which is the subject of the next article.

Right on the heels of my last review covering the newest iterations of the LIVA series, comes the Z Plus model which packs a punch for a device no wider than a Compact-Disc. The LIVA Z Plus comes in a variety of configurations that either comes with Windows 10 pre-installed or as a barebones unit giving the buyer the option to install any OS they choose. With everything all said and done, ECS has provided me with the i5 7300U version for review, so let's get to it.   ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U) Video Review: Below is a direct video link to our Overclockersclub YouTube Channel. If you are like me and don't always have time to read on the go, I have you covered. The video review talks about everything in this article. If you still need a refresher on the topic in more detail you can always read the full review at a later time. As always, video reviews are still fairly new and we are always trying to improve, so please leave a comment to help us make our videos better and help the community grow!   ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U) Closer Look: So here it is, back to the ECS LIVA Z, specifically the Plus model as indicated in the bottom left. The box itself is what you come to expect from any company; a picture and a bit of information on the side. Once the slip cover is removed and the box is opened it is apparent how small the actual device is. That is considering the rest of the box houses the power brick and wires. Not much more to talk about, ECS did its job of keeping the device secure to avoid damages in shipping. Not that much could happen, but it still nice to see they put the effort into it.     Moving on to the exterior you can see from the pictures that ECS has included the major types of ports found on computers today. Similar to the LIVA Z, the Plus has the same layout externally, and subsequently internally (mostly). It saves time and money to only have to drop in a different PCB board or SoC CPU, memory, and SSD. That being said, if you do not like the layout or see a potential problem for your particular setup, then move on to a different brand. ECS may be the first to the market using the newest Intel technology, but will not be the only ones by the end of this year. Once past this discrepancy I can talk about the many connections themselves. The front consists of three USB 3.0 Gen1 Type-A Ports and a USB-C port with transfer rates up to 5 Gbit/s. Similar to the LIVA Z, these are not USB 3.1 Gen2. It gets even more complicated by the fact that USB names have changed over time. Whereas it used to be called USB 3.0 with SuperSpeed USB transfer rate, now it is named USB 3.1 Gen 1. It is important to understand the difference, because Gen 2 supports 10 Gbit/s which is known for USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 3.1 (Gen 2). This unit only has a standard USB port in C-Port form, not the ultra highspeed 10 Gbit/s ports. Whether it is named USB 3.0 or 3.1, if it claims to have transfer speeds of 5 Gbit/s then it falls under the 3.1 Gen1 category. This isn't a bad thing and I don't blame ECS for this, but it is getting harder to distinguish between names that do in fact use the same underlying data protocols.   Flipping the unit around to the backside it gets less complicated, but stranger at the same time. The Plus model shares many of the same issues I identified in the review of the LIVA Z. I'm still not sure why ECS included two Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back without having any USB ports. I believe the intent of the ECS R&D team was for the user to take of advantage of the built-in Bluetooth support for Mouse and Keyboard. At the same time, it would have been really nice to include at least one USB port on the back for those that don't have that kind of setup.   For size comparison I put a Blu-Ray on top of the unit to showcase the sheer technological marvel of being able to cram an entire computer into a small form factor like this. The LIVA Z Plus is 2" tall (33mm) and roughly 4" wide (117mm) for those who like raw numbers more than pictures. The specifications page covers everything in detail, but I'll cover the basics. ECS made opening and upgrading it as easy as possible. It just takes four Philips head screws to remove the bottom cover. Once inside, you can see the WiFi 802.11ac & Bluetooth 4.0 card which is hidden below a M.2 2242 slot. On the other side are two slots for laptop memory. This particular model uses DDR4 memory. Finally, below the memory slots are mini SATA and Comms ports, neither of which is used on this unit. Unlike the LIVA Z base model, the Plus does not include any eMMC memory, but instead populates the M.2 slot with multiple configurations. The unit I received came with a 128GB M.2 SSD. CystalMarks speed test provided insight into the type of performance to expect. Speeds were very reasonable, topping out around 500MB/s for sequential read and 200MB/s for write. It closely resembles most modern SSD with ACHI in M.2 or 2.5" form factor. Having an NVME M.2 drive would be impractical for this type of device.     Last up is the VESA mounting plate, which is a nice bonus ECS has included with its' LIVA Z Plus. For those who are new to mounting TVs, VESA mounts are essential for any display if you want it off the stand. It has four screws that go through the mounting plate and into the monitor. I don't have much more to say about this because it's straight forward. However, the wire situation I talked about earlier becomes a factor here. It will become an ugly mess unless you have an attack plan ahead of time. I suggest Bluetooth Keyboard / Mouse and Wi-Fi to avoid filling up all the ports with unnecessarily long wires hanging off the back.   --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Introduction & Closer Look2 » ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Specifications3 » ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Testing & Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Introduction & Closer Look ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Specifications ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Testing & Conclusion Related Products ECS LIVA Z Plus Review Recent Articles ECS LIVA Z Plus Review Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion - Producer Interview XFX Radeon RX 580 8GB GTS Black Edition Review MSI GTX 1080 Ti Armor 11G Review XFX RX 460 4GB Slim Single Review PowerColor Radeon Red Devil RX 580 8GB Golden Sample Review AMD Ryzen 5 1600X & 1500X Processor Review NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition Review RAIDMAX Monster II Review Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Review » all reviews Forum Posts ECS LIVA Z Plus Reviewed OCC Twitch Stream Finally upgraded entire system [WTS] Gigabyte r9 290 4GB Galactic Civilizations III: Crusade Expansion Released Latest News Galactic Civilizations III: Crusade Expansion Released GLAIVE RGB Mouse Released by Corsair Hardware Roundup: Thursday, May 4, 2017, Edition Microsoft Plans to Add Office to Windows Store Mid-Tower Carbide Series SPEC-04 Cases Launched by Corsair Hardware Roundup: Wednesday, May 3, 2017, Edition Intel Fixes Remote Vulnerability That Goes Back to 2008 Darksiders III Announced for 2018 Hardware Roundup: Tuesday, May 2, 2017, Edition Random Pic Click to enlarge Most Popular Articles MSI GTX 1080 Ti Armor 11G Review PowerColor Radeon Red Devil RX 580 8GB Golden Sample Review AMD Ryzen 5 1600X & 1500X Processor Review XFX Radeon RX 580 8GB GTS Black Edition Review XFX RX 460 4GB Slim Single Review Latest Comments Firefox Gets a 64-bit Version for Windows [6] Repairing Nerves with 3D Printed Guides [1] Valve Announces the Vive VR Headset, Built by HTC [1] Sony Announces Premium Sound Memory Card [1] NVIDIA Hit With Class Action Lawsuit Over GTX 970 Memory Issue [1] Predicting the Past in Quantum Mechanics [1] Equation Group Spying Software Found on Hard Drives Across the World [3] Super Bowl Halftime Show Powered by MAINGEAR System with Four GeForce GTX Titan Z GPUs [3] Fake Facebook Porn Links Infect Over 110,000 Users with Trojan in Just Two Days [1] ContactReview RequestsForumsAdvertiseOCC Logos and Banners © 2001-2017 Overclockers Club ® Privacy Policy Elapsed: 0.0379819870   (xlweb1)

The US-based chipmaker seeks to cash in on a segment that is still seeing high growth, especially the high-end gaming computer market, which has defied the overall continuous drop of the PC market. "After years in development to enhance performance and reduce power consumption, we came up with our new central processing unit (CPU) called Ryzen," said Ryan Sim, channel sales director for Asia and India of AMD Far East. AMD is ready to compete in the market, especially challenging Intel, he said. Despite the flat or negative growth of the local desktop computer market, the gaming desktop market has continued its high growth. Custom-made gaming desktops accounted for half of total desktops sales, said Mr Sim. Mr Sim said computers sales in Thailand will stay at 2 million units in 2017, the same as last year. Jirawat Nuntapramote, channel sales manager of AMD Far East's Thailand branch office, said the company aims to increase its share in the local processor market to 28% this year, up from 20% in 2016. AMD has also widened its server processor products for data centres and cloud computing platform, which are also high-growth areas. "We aim to regain our market share in chips for the server processor field, where the company has enjoyed up to a 20% market share in the past," said Mr Jirawat. Sasiprapa Sutheerapat, business development manager of AMD's Thailand branch office, said at least five major international notebook makers are scheduled to roll out their notebooks equipped with AMD Ryzen notebook processors in the second half of this year. AMD earlier focused on making processors for traditional notebooks priced below 15,000 baht. "The new generation of high performance Ryzen processor enables us to tap into gaming notebooks priced over 22,000 baht," she said. "We aim for our market share for notebook processors in Thailand to reach 15% in 2017, up from 11% last year," said Ms Sasiprapa.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 4, 2017 at 6:40PM Chipmakers Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) both fared well over the past 12 months, with the former's 160% rally and the latter's 60% gain outpacing the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index's 50% growth. But after those big gains, does either stock have more room to run this year? Let's take a closer look at their business models, growth trajectories, challenges, and valuations to find out. Image source: Getty Images. What do Micron and Cypress do? Micron is the third largest mobile DRAM maker and fourth largest NAND manufacturer in the world. However, the company is often considered the best "pure play" on the memory-chip market, since bigger rivals such as Samsung and Western Digital have more diversified businesses. To keep pace with the technological advances of those bigger competitors, Micron is developing next-gen memory technologies such as 3D NAND and 3DXPoint with Intel. It's also been beefing up by acquiring smaller memory-chip makers. Cypress produces programmable semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, home-automation, medical-device, and consumer-electronics markets. It relies heavily on acquisitions to expand its portfolio -- that's why it merged with embedded-chip maker Spansion in 2015, and then acquired Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Internet of Things (IoT) business in 2016. Cypress also benefited from the shift across the mobile market toward USB-C connectors, since the company is a leading producer of USB-C power delivery chips. Some analysts believe that Apple may switch to the USB-C standard for the iPhone 8, but those rumors are unconfirmed. How fast are Micron and Cypress growing? Micron posted double-digit annual sales growth over the past two quarters, which broke a six-quarter streak of consecutive declines. That reversal was attributed to tightening memory-chip supplies across the market, which caused prices -- which had slumped for about two years -- to rise again. That's why Wall Street expects Micron's revenue to rise 58% to $19.6 billion this year, compared with a 23% decline in 2016. Its earnings are expected to surge from $0.06 in 2016 to $4.28 per share. That growth is expected to continue, with 8% sales growth and 20% earnings growth in 2018. Cypress, which serves a less cyclical market than Micron, posted positive year-over-year sales growth for 10 straight quarters. Much of that growth can be attributed to its acquisitions, but its core business has also been bolstered by its robust growth in microcontroller and connectivity division revenue, as well as strong demand in China and Japan. Analysts expect Cypress' revenue to rise 13% to $2.2 billion this year, compared with 19% growth last year. Its non-GAAP earnings, which more than doubled last year, are expected to rise another 43% this year. That momentum is expected to continue, albeit at a slightly slower pace, with 6% sales growth and 46% non-GAAP earnings growth next year. Cypress is unprofitable on a GAAP basis because of its aforementioned acquisitions. The headwinds and tailwinds Micron is riding high on rising memory prices, but it faces two main challenges. First, bigger memory-chip makers such as Samsung have superior scale and R&D capabilities -- which could force Micron to spend more heavily to keep pace. Second, Micron previously warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the market with cheaper memory chips in the near future -- which would cause global prices to plunge. Cypress has benefited from the growth of the connected-car and industrial sectors. Those two markets accounted for 55% of the company's revenue in 2016, compared with just 30% in 2011. Buying Broadcom's IoT business also boosted its content share per connected car by 26% and helps the company address the connectivity needs of the growing IoT market. The main threat for Cypress is that other bigger chipmakers, such as Texas Instruments, are also expanding into the same markets. That competition could force Cypress to spend more heavily on R&D and acquisitions to remain competitive. Unlike Micron, which doesn't pay a dividend, Cypress pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 3.1%. The valuations and the verdict Micron trades at 48 times earnings, which matches the industry average. Cypress trades at 29 times non-GAAP earnings, which is slightly higher than its industry average of 28. Both companies have comparable P/S ratios -- Micron trades at 2 times sales, while Cypress trades at 2.4 times sales. It's a close call in the end, but I think Cypress is a slightly better pick than Micron at current prices. Its business is less cyclical, its competitive threats seem lighter, its valuation seems more reasonable, and it pays a decent dividend. Micron is still a good growth stock, but it might be too volatile for many investors.    Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

DeepMap Inc., which was founded by mapping veterans of Alphabet Inc., is building systems enabling self-driving cars to steer through complex cityscapes. DeepMap plans to license its map-building software to automakers and technology companies looking to teach cars how to drive. The company recently raised a $25 million funding round led by Accel, adding to the $7 million it raised last year. In the chase to secure the investment, the firm penned an 80-page white paper on DeepMap's technology. Investors are eager to grab a piece of self-driving cars after big startup deals, such as General Motors Co.'s acquisition of Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc.'s purchase of Otto. But new entrants face sizable competition, whether in autonomous technology or mapping. In addition to Silicon Valley juggernauts Alphabet, Apple Inc. and Uber, Amsterdam's TomTom NV is building its own 3-D maps, as is HERE, a project jointly owned by several automotive giants and Intel Corp. Andreessen Horowitz and GSR Ventures also invested in DeepMap. Martin Casado, the lead Andreessen partner on DeepMap, said startups can compete with much larger companies because their businesses have fewer conflicts. This enables them to work with just about anybody and focus on the software, which typically has higher profit margins. "DeepMap isn't bound to a particular application like ride-sharing, and they're not bound to a particular company," Casado said. DeepMap fuses images from digital cameras with data collected using a laser device known as lidar to build detailed 3-D maps. It can identify street signs, billboards and the height of a curb. The 3-D maps complement the sensors by giving the cars a detailed awareness of the environment outside the car's view. James Wu, who started the company with his former Google Maps colleague Mark Wheeler, said he hopes to have three customers by the end of the year, while generating as much as $10 million in revenue. "Having the map lets us define for the robot the rules of the world," said Wu, who has also worked on mapping projects at Apple and Baidu. "It's very easy to make a prototype car that can make a few decisions around a few blocks, but it's harder when you get out into the world." A diaspora of autonomous driving entrepreneurs from Google has spread throughout Silicon Valley. Google X founder Sebastian Thrun just spun an autonomous car startup out of his online learning company Udacity. Top engineers Chris Urmson and Bryan Salesky have set up companies called Aurora Innovation and Argo AI, respectively. Another engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is the focus of an embittered legal battle between his former employer Alphabet and Uber over allegations that he stole intellectual property from the search giant when he left to form his startup, Otto.

We will recommend several other schools in high risk areas to install the system,” he said. “Parents, however, should not be alarmed as we are only trying to enhance security in schools,” he said after launching the campaign at Sime Darby Convention Centre here. The schools will also get one set of Titanus Intel-Embedded Network Video Recorder (NVR) with a four terabyte hard disk drive for video recordings and one unit of 21” full high-definition Light Emitting Diode (LED) monitor complete with wiring, surge protection and installation.  The company’s managing director Wan Yat Hon, who is a father of two, said he understands how parents want to guarantee their children’s safety in school.  “My daughters go to Chong Hwa Chinese Primary School and I am also the vice-chairman of the Parent-Teacher Association there. Whenever we hear of news about crime taking place near schools, we get extremely worried,” he said. “We are trying our best to play our part in reducing criminal activities near schools,” he said. Wan added the high-tech cameras were different from CCTVs used in some schools as they were able to capture high-resolution footages and have top notch facial-recognition features. “Unlike normal CCTVs which can only capture silhouettes or shadows, our cameras will be able to capture facial features of a person and read out number plates which will be helpful in solving cases,” he said, adding the project cost the company over RM1 million. He said schools will have full control of the system as it concerned the issue of privacy. “We will assign teachers to be in-charge and we will only guide them on how to operate the system,” he said. Wan said the system also had a panic button which will be installed at the school’s guard post. “If something happens in the middle of the night, the security guards can alert the school’s top management with a click of the button. The authorities will then be notified.”  He, however, said the enhanced security would not eradicate the root cause of the problem and crime prevention still played a big role.  Wan said the system had been installed in 10 schools in the Klang Valley.                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Najib: Selangor government unstable, imagine if this happened at federal level Megadeth frontman thanks PAS for no protest JJPTR founder pledges to return RM1.7b to ‘investors’ Jawi admits nabbing married couple for khalwat, but denies wrongdoing After just a year, local publisher Fixi to stop translating DC Comics into BM It’s Melaka, not Malacca from now on Tahfiz school ignores angry netizens over student’s death Under fire, chess tourney director says never saw girl or 'seductive' dress Increase minimum wage to RM1,500, Putrajaya told Megadeth frontman thanks PAS for no protest Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Twin sisters give birth to boys on same day Reuters Video: Hawn, Russell honoured with twin Walk of Fame stars Reuters Video: VR to help patients suffering from balance problems Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles Sabah is sensitive to the needs of its schools, CM says Teach for Malaysia co-founder: Pay teachers well so we can get better students Teachers reminded not to bash government on social media Teachers, PTAs must be aware of school surroundings, says education minister 402 ‘hotspot’ schools identified for disciplinary cases, says Education D-G Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

A pirate copy of the Smurfs 2, 4K UHD Blu-ray has appeared on torrent site UltraHDclub and IPT. According to Torrent Freak (TF), the 53.3GB download does work, but at present there are few seeders so it is slow going. The torrent is headed “The Smurfs 2 (2013) 2160p UHD Blu-ray HEVC Atmos 7.1-THRONE.” TF says this suggests the AACS 2.0 encryption has been cracked – if not perfect, then acceptable it says. AACS encryption  is owned by a group of movie studios and technology partners including Disney, Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Warner Bros., IBM, Toshiba and Sony that have put a lot of effort into making the technology secure. The cracking of the encryption comes just days after exclusive Netflix content “Orange is the new black” season five was made available on pirate sites. iTWire’s article is here. Netflix refused to pay a ransom and it did so on both practical and moral grounds. It is a subscription service so its members get access to all its content.   HOW TOP MANAGERS MOTIVATE, ENERGISE EMPLOYEES Download an in-depth guide to managing a healthy, motivated and energetic workforce without breaking the bank.

(TSLA) Stock From Anyone Crazy Enough to Sell It View All Posts Since March 6, shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have risen as much as 12.6%, reaching $110 on March 30. Why is this significant for NVDA stock? It was then  — on March 6 — I told you Nvidia stock has bottomed. And with some patience, NVDA stock should reach $130 to $135 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 25% to 30% returns in 2017. Source: Shutterstock There have been questions about the value of the company, considering the increased competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). NVDA stock, which entered 2017 red hot, gaining almost 300% by end of December 2016, has lost tons of momentum. The shares have struggled so far this year, falling 2.6% year-to-date, including almost 7% declines in the past three months. And based on Friday’s close, the shares have fallen 13.5% since reaching a 52-week high of $120.70 on Feb. 10. Reasons to Like NVDA Stock Once traded at a forward price-earnings of 41, Nvidia will report first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results on May 9. The price-earnings has since fallen to 30 based in fiscal 2018 estimates of the $3.38 per share. Nvidia now needs fundamentals to drive NVDA stock higher. And that’s not a bad thing, considering that Nvidia not only crushed Wall Street’s fourth-quarter estimates on almost every metric, the company also raised full-year guidance. Led by its market-leading graphic processing chips (GPUs), Nvidia continue to enjoy a leadership positions in some of tech’s most important growth markets, including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and PC gaming. The company’s GPU business, which produced 82% of its 2016 revenue of $6.9 billion, generated a whopping $2.1 billion in operating profit. What’s more, in the fourth quarter, the company dispelled competitive fears from Intel by producing Datacenter revenue that surged 205% year-over-year. And based in the company’s first-quarter revenue guidance of $1.90 billion, higher than consensus estimates of $1.87 billion, Nvidia sees no signs of slowing down. To that end, the company’s first-quarter earnings to begin its march of NVDA stock back above $110 on its way toward $130. For the three month that ended March, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 67 cents per share on revenue of $1.91 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 103% and 46%, respectively. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 12% to $2.88 per share, while revenue of $8.04 billion would rise 16.3% year-over-year. Bottom Line for NVDA Stock Nvidia, which has been the subject of multiple analyst downgrades this year, has become a victim of its own success. But with fiscal 2018 earnings still projected to grow at roughly 20%, combined with rising cash flow and long-term addressable market opportunity projected to rise to over $62 billion, now’s the time to add to your NVDA position. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Here’s why By Hedrick Smith Special to The Bee WASHINGTON When President Donald Trump flew to Wisconsin recently to tout his “Buy American, Hire American” mantra, he was greeted by a worker carrying a sign that betrayed frustration among his political base: “Wall Street Got Theirs. Where’s MY infrastructure JOB?”   A surprising answer came days later from Infosys, an Indian staffing firm that was among those accused by candidate Donald Trump in 2016 of “job theft” for taking good knowledge economy jobs away from American college graduates by putting low-cost Indian engineers, software programmers and accountants into U.S. high tech firms and banks. Evidently trying to head off retribution from President Trump, Infosys promised to hire up to 10,000 Americans in the coming years. The Indian gesture bore echoes of Trump’s jawboning the CEOs at Carrier air conditioning and Ford Motor Co. last November into promising to keep some jobs in America instead of moving them to Mexico. Trump got massive media coverage for saving about 1,500-2,000 jobs, though that did not stem the outflow of other jobs, and it was a mere fraction of the 5 million American manufacturing jobs that economists reckon were moved overseas by U.S. multinationals since the 1990s. Since November, Trump has not done much for his middle- and working-class voters. After running as a political rebel with an anti-establishment, blue-collar populist pitch, he has packed his cabinet with billionaires, invited CEOs to tell him which government regulations they wanted killed, and floated a tax scheme offering a financial bonanza for himself and America’s super-rich. And where he has put down his policy markers, as in his proposed 2018 budget, he has slashed safety net programs that keep 12 million working-class Americans out of poverty and cut funding for the Labor Department that enforces worker safety rules, and protects overtime and retirement benefits. His job-creating infrastructure plan is now on hold. But Trump is right in calling for smarter rules and tighter enforcement of the H-1B visa program that has enabled some 500,000 foreigners, mostly from India, to fill hot knowledge economy jobs where American college graduates could be earning good pay. Since the 1990s, tech giants like Google, Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Microsoft, Facebook and multinationals like Pfizer and Disney have used H-1B visas to bring in foreign computer programmers, engineers, systems analysts and back office accountants. “It’s a disaster,” candidate Trump thundered. “It legalizes job theft. It gives companies the legal right to pass over Americans, displace Americans, or directly replace Americans for good-paying middle class jobs. More than 80 percent of these H-1Bs (foreign workers) are paid less than the average wage.” Legendary free-market economist Milton Friedman castigated the H-1B program as an unjustified “subsidy” to Corporate America by “enabling them (employers) to get workers at a lower wage.” How? Because the program sets so-called “local prevailing” wage levels for foreigners well below average U.S. wages for similar skills, allowing U.S. companies to legally hire foreigners at below-market wages. The H-1B program in 1990 was born from intense lobbying by America’s high tech giants insisting that they needed foreigners because not enough Americans were graduating from college with STEM skills – degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, among others, told Congress that the U.S. needed a quota of foreign H-1B visas for “specialty” workers, to bring the world’s best brains to America. Currently, the H-1B program allows 85,000 visas a year, each renewable for up to six years. In addition, an unlimited number of foreign graduates from U.S. universities are permitted to take industrial internships, under the OPT program, which gets around the cap on H-1B visas. And still, industry is clamoring for higher quotas. Independent studies counter business claims of skill shortages. One by the nonpartisan Urban institute declared that “the education system produces qualified graduates far in excess of demand. … Each year there are more than three times as many S&E (science and engineering) four-year college graduates as S&E job openings.” Professor Norman Matloff of UC Davis, reports that the U.S. generates such a “surplus of computer science PhDs (that) 11 percent of them are involuntarily working in a non-computer science field.” Matloff suggests that companies create paper shortages by gaming the system, posting some jobs as needing only 3-5 years of experience, discarding older job applicants as overqualified. “The H-1B program is an enabler of rampant age discrimination in the tech industry,” Matloff asserts, “and we are talking about 35 as being ‘old’ here, not 55.” What’s more, most H-1B visa-holders working for American firms come mostly from the two lowest paid, lowest skill tiers, belying industry’s claim that H-1B visas are for recruiting “the best and the brightest.” Three Indian staffing firms, Infosys, Tata Consulting and Wipro, are among the worst offenders, purveying the lowest-paid entry-level tech workers. For Trump, H-1B is a key test. In Wisconsin, he used a visit to Snap-on, the Kenosha tool-maker, to proclaim that a new executive order would “enforce Hire American rules” that will “end these (H-1B) visa abuses” and ensure that “they should never, ever be used to replace Americans.” Problem was that this Trump order, like others, was short on specifics. It did not put teeth into the H-1B program to protect American jobs. It did not explicitly ban the firing of Americans and replacing them with foreigners. It did not require employers to canvas all available qualified Americans for job openings. It did not raise wage levels. But it bowed to industry's lobbying, by declining to lower the quota on H-1B visas or to put a cap on OPT internships. Trump merely asked several agencies “as soon as practicable” (no deadline) “to suggest reforms to help ensure that H-1B visa are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid … beneficiaries.” Legislation in Congress is already well ahead of the president. Two senators, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin have jointly proposed bills to bar companies from laying off American employees and replacing them with foreigners and to require American companies to live up to their own rhetoric by awarding H-1B visas first to the most highly skilled, highest paid foreigners, instead of the current practice of awarding 70 percent of H-1B visas to the lowest-qualified, lowest paid. In a tart letter to the president, Durbin noted that companies owned by Trump himself “have sought to import at least 1,000 foreign guest workers while turning away hundreds of qualified American workers.” It is time, Durban declared, for the president to get tough and carry out his campaign promise to “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.” Hedrick Smith is former Washington bureau chief of The New York Times, author of “Who Stole the American Dream?” and executive editor of reclaimtheamericandream.org.

 The Pentagon just pulled the top secret clearance of a Trump White House aide Bill Gertz, The Washington Free Beacon May 4, 2017, 3:02 PM 23,710 facebook linkedin twitter email print Official White House Photo by Pete Souza The Pentagon this week suspended the security clearance of a White House National Security Council analyst that U.S. officials say was the target of political retribution by government bureaucrats opposed to President Trump's appointees. Adam S. Lovinger, a 12-year strategic affairs analyst with the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment (ONA), has been on loan to the NSC since January when he was picked for the position by then-National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn. Lovinger was notified in a letter from the Pentagon on Monday that his Top-Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) clearance had been suspended and that he had to return to the Pentagon. The letter cited unspecified outside activities by Lovinger. The notice said the suspension was approved by Kevin Sweeney, chief of staff for Defense Secretary James Mattis. One official said Lovinger was targeted by Trump opponents because of his conservative views and ties to Flynn, specifically his past association with the Flynn Intel Group, Inc., a consulting business. Flynn was forced out as national security adviser in February after top-secret intelligence communications intercepts were disclosed to the press revealing he had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Disclosure of the clearance suspension followed a report in the Washington Free Beacon Monday stating the security clearance process at the White House has been politicized by government officials opposed to Trump and his advisers. Suspending or revoking clearances is a frequent tactic used by government officials to sideline officials whose views and policies they oppose. Documents disclosed last year revealed the FBI in 2009 had rejected issuing an interim security clearance for Ben Rhodes, who eventually would be granted access to top-secret intelligence as former President Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. Lovinger is the second NSC staff official under Trump to lose his clearance. In February, Robin Townley, an African affairs specialist on the NSC staff, was denied a TS/SCI clearance by the CIA. Townley, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, had worked with Flynn in the past. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. James Brindle denied that the security clearance was suspended as a result of political retribution. "This is a personnel matter that we do not discuss," he said. Spokesmen for the NSC did not return emails seeking comment. Lovinger could not be reached for comment. Lovinger, a lawyer, is expected to challenge the clearance suspension. But the process is expected to take months and could prevent him from continuing to work on the NSC staff. Officials familiar with the matter said Lovinger's clearance was suspended after he wrote several memos criticizing the director of the Office of Net Assessment, James H. Baker. According to the officials, the clearance dispute appears to involve a bureaucratic turf battle, as well as a larger, behind-the-scenes effort by anti-Trump officials in the national security bureaucracy to neutralize key Trump aides. Lovinger is senior director for strategic assessments at the NSC. In that position, he has proposed shifting the Office of Net Assessment from the Pentagon to the White House, where it was located when established during the Nixon administration. Lovinger wrote a memo to current National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on the need for a net assessment capability within the NSC. Net assessments are highly classified reports that assess foreign threats and U.S. capabilities. Unlike intelligence estimates that are focused solely on foreign targets, assessments include details of U.S. strategic vulnerabilities. The assessments are used by national security leaders for strategic planning. Lovinger, who holds a doctorate in law, also has been an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy and McDonough School of Business. At ONA, Lovinger specialized in issues related to U.S.-India relations, the Persian Gulf, and sub-Saharan Africa. He also worked as a Pentagon general counsel focusing on reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to his Georgetown biography. Other aides on the NSC staff said to be targeted by anti-Trump officials include Lovinger's supervisor, Kevin Harrington, deputy assistant to the president for strategic planning, and Ezra Cohen-Watnick, senior director for intelligence programs. Cohen-Watnick was present during the recent review of intelligence documents at the White House by Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Nunes has charged the intelligence documents exposed improper electronic surveillance of Trump and members of his transition team by the Obama administration. Baker has come under fire from critics for his role in managing ONA, until recently headed for several decades by Andrew Marshall, who was considered one of the U.S. government's premier strategic thinkers. Emails made public from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private server revealed last fall that Clinton had arranged meetings in 2009 between senior State and Pentagon officials and Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, a close friend of Chelsea Clinton and long-time contractor for ONA. Deal is head of the defense consulting group Long Term Strategy Group and has received millions of dollars in contracts from ONA for studies such as "On the Nature of Americans as a Warlike People." Another study the group completed for ONA was called "War and the Intellectuals." It concluded that American elites hold stronger anti-war attitudes than the general public. The Pentagon has defended the Long Term Strategy Group's studies for ONA. The group's work "has consistently informed ONA's internal analysis and they continue to be a responsive vendor," ONA said in an October statement. "The firm, however, is just one of 90 sources that ONA has commissioned work from over the past decade." Read the original article on The Washington Free Beacon. Copyright 2017.

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / JETNET Demonstrating New Intelligence Features at EBACE 2017 JETNET Demonstrating New Intelligence Features at EBACE 2017 Posted on May 4, 2017 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. JETNET LLC, the world leader in aviation market intelligence, will demonstrate a series of new releases and features in their aircraft research service lineup at EBACE2017 at the Geneva Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland. Utica, NY (PRWEB) May 04, 2017 JETNET LLC, the world leader in aviation market intelligence, will demonstrate a series of new releases and features in their aircraft research service lineup at EBACE2017 at the Geneva Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland. Highlights this year include: Aerodex Elite, a new product that combines owner/operator data with the FAA’s Traffic Flow Management System in near real time; a mobile implementation of JETNET Aerodex; a new, in-depth intelligence feature dubbed INTEL, including a new Utilization option; JETNET Values, with Reported Sold Prices Program, previewed last year and now is setting new standards for aircraft resale reporting; their YachtSpot product line; and JETNET’s admission into the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA). JETNET’s full suite of services will be available for review at the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition, May 22nd-24th, at booth # X129. “This year, we’ve put our resources behind developing new services, while enhancing our existing products,” said Tony Esposito, JETNET Vice President. “Our clients have been amazed at the depth of intelligence and level of detail the new features give them. We’re keeping them two steps ahead of their competition.” Aerodex Elite Aerodex Elite is a new JETNET product that combines a strong owner/operator database with a new application to manage the FAA’s Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) in near real time. The product includes live access to current and historical utilization reports at the aircraft serial number level, for customers and prospects on the ground and in the air. Subscribers can investigate and understand the activities of aircraft within the FAA airspace, and the airports and companies that charter, manage, operate, refuel, and service these assets. Clients also receive detailed current and historical analysis and summaries by individual aircraft, or fleets across operator(s), airport(s), and management companies, with fuel uplift details and more. Aerodex Mobile JETNET’s popular Aerodex service has now been implemented as a mobile platform and made available to subscribers of Aerodex Elite and standard Aerodex. This mobile platform version makes vital data available on a handheld device. The service is a version of Aerodex and Aerodex Elite tailored specifically for FBOs, MROs, and other service providers who need accurate and timely information on aircraft owners and operators worldwide. Clients now have access to the full capability through any mobile device. JETNET INTEL INTEL (Intelligence) is JETNET’s new shortcut tool, providing one-click access to comprehensive single-page summaries about utilization, and extensive portfolio data on each aircraft, company, operator, airport, and more. Available to all Evolution Marketplace and Aerodex Elite customers, INTEL maximizes search effectiveness, especially for LIVE subscribers. INTEL pulls together and presents data accurately, easily, and with customized exporting capabilities. When a company details page is displayed, an additional INTEL menu will appear for companies that have additional intelligence to be displayed. When an aircraft details page is displayed, an additional INTEL menu may appear for aircraft that have additional intelligence to be displayed. A Utilization option on the INTEL menu will summarize utilization for an airport, aircraft, company, or operator. Intel is already allowing customers to see how Utilization views can better inform their understanding of aircraft workloads by individual airframe, or by fleet. JETNET Values Subscriptions to JETNET Values, announced just last year, have grown rapidly, with wide acceptance of the program across the aviation industry. A single-source solution designed by JETNET, Values provides reported sold prices, combined with data assessment tools that aviation professionals can use to make informed decisions relating to finance, insurance, valuation, appraisals, and more. Values is offered as an optional add-on component to the JETNET Marketplace program, and includes a database of reported aircraft sales prices with tools to predict and summarize trends. New sales prices are voluntarily provided to JETNET daily by reputable sources from among its network of subscribers. JETNET reports that Values is now populated with more than 2,600 sales prices for more than 225 different aircraft models—most of which pertain to transactions having occurred within the last 18 months—from more than 275 independent sources. The firm has also built a host of tools in its Marketplace Manager customer relationship manager (CRM) for those users to maintain their own proprietary database of sales prices alongside those gathered by JETNET. They have also announced a new incentive program through which new subscribers to JETNET Values in 2017 will receive complimentary 12-month use of Marketplace Manager at no additional charge. “Values was launched in response to what we detected as desperation of our customers to better understand the current and unprecedented trend in aircraft residual values,” said Paul Cardarelli, JETNET Vice President of Sales. “We know this is a sensitive area—that the resale markets generally hold such intelligence in a very guarded manner—and we respect that. But reliable information is what we are tasked to provide our customers, and we believe that ultimately it makes for a market that performs in optimal fashion. One year after the launch of Values, we are gratified to have received a high level of interest and cooperation for this initiative.” YachtSpot The YachtSpot database continues to penetrate the worldwide luxury fleet, expanding to nearly 7,000 vessels at or greater than 24 meters. Of increasing importance to both the yacht and aircraft industries, YachtSpot is the only database providing detailed information about those individuals and businesses with relationships to both on a worldwide basis. Within one platform, OEMs, dealers and brokers, and shipyards can examine the YachtSpot ranking of top performers in yacht and aircraft resale and charter. Rapidly becoming the most in-depth collection of fleet information by hundreds of metrics, YachtSpot brings clarity to the assets with key contacts about resale or charter opportunities, classification, flagged countries, amenities, pedigree, and more. YachtSpot is the only database designed to introduce professionals from aviation and yacht industries to each other, and to opportunities for collaboration in resale, charter, referrals, insurance, finance, and more. EBAA Membership In February JETNET was admitted as a member of the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA). They were also selected to participate as a member of EBAA’s Associate Member Council (AMAC), specifically, the subcommittee for Aircraft Sales and Acquisitions. “We are delighted to join EBAA and to have the opportunity it affords us to shape the future of business aviation in Europe,” said Karim Derbala, JETNET Managing Director of Global Sales. “JETNET has long regarded Europe as a major player in our industry. Today the continent represents 10% of the fixed wing—and 22% of the rotary wing—global fleet, generating nearly E$20B in annual revenue, and employing some 164,000 people. Business aviation is a true economic powerhouse here, and EBAA is its true advocate.” JETNET Reach Among JETNET’s clientele are leading manufacturers, suppliers, and government and advocacy groups for business and commercial aviation worldwide. JETNET’s database of in-operation aircraft exceeds 100,000 airframes, which includes business jets, business turboprops, commercial airliners (both jets and turboprops), and helicopters (both turbine and piston). “2017 marks JETNET's sixteenth consecutive appearance at EBACE,” added Tony Esposito. “This has always been an excellent venue for us, one where we have learned much about the highly important European component of the global business aviation market. And while the last eight years have been a challenge for us all, today there is an undeniable optimism for the future. It’s evident in North America—and even more so throughout Europe—so we are delighted to return to Geneva with so many wonderful new tools to better serve this great industry.” The JETNET database includes comprehensive details on aircraft airframes, engines, avionics, and cabin amenities, as well as aircraft owners and operators, lessors and lessees, fractional owners, and a host of other entities associated with aircraft. Also included are transaction histories on aircraft dating back more than 25 years, monthly aircraft market summary reports, and a variety of other tools for assessing the global fleet and aircraft marketplace. JETNET invites attendees to see all of their new product and service offerings at this year’s EBACE, May 22nd-24th, at booth # X129. Additionally, on Monday, May 22nd at 11am in Salle R, they will conduct their annual JETNET iQ European State of the Business Jet Market briefing. All business aviation professionals and press are invited to attend. Since 1988, JETNET has delivered the most comprehensive and reliable business aircraft research to its exclusive clientele of aviation professionals worldwide. JETNET is the ultimate source for information and intelligence on the worldwide business, commercial, and helicopter aircraft fleet and marketplace, comprised of some 100,000 airframes.

(Bloomberg) -- A mile away from where Google builds the maps used by people around the world, a 25-person startup is trying to do something similar for robots. DeepMap Inc., which was founded by mapping veterans of Alphabet Inc., is building systems enabling self-driving cars to steer through complex cityscapes. DeepMap plans to license its map-building software to automakers and technology companies looking to teach cars how to drive. The company recently raised a $25 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, with contributions from Accel and GSR Ventures. In the chase to secure the investment, Accel penned an 80-page white paper on DeepMap's technology. Investors are eager to grab a piece of self-driving cars after big startup deals, such as General Motors Co.'s acquisition of Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc.'s purchase of Otto. But new entrants face sizable competition, whether in autonomous technology or mapping. In addition to Silicon Valley juggernauts Alphabet, Apple Inc. and Uber, Amsterdam's TomTom NV is building its own 3-D maps, as is HERE, a project jointly owned by several automotive giants and Intel Corp. Martin Casado, the Andreessen Horowitz partner who led the DeepMap investment, said startups can compete with much larger companies because their businesses have fewer conflicts. This enables them to work with just about anybody and focus on the software, which typically has higher profit margins. "DeepMap isn't bound to a particular application like ride-sharing, and they're not bound to a particular company," Casado said. DeepMap fuses images from digital cameras with data collected using a laser device known as lidar to build detailed 3-D maps. It can identify street signs, billboards and the height of a curb. The 3-D maps complement the sensors by giving the cars a detailed awareness of the environment outside the car's view. James Wu, who started the company with his former Google Maps colleague Mark Wheeler, said he hopes to have three customers by the end of the year, while generating as much as $10 million in revenue. "Having the map lets us define for the robot the rules of the world," Wu said. "It's very easy to make a prototype car that can make a few decisions around a few blocks, but it's harder when you get out into the world." A diaspora of autonomous driving entrepreneurs from Google has spread throughout Silicon Valley. Google X founder Sebastian Thrun just spun an autonomous car startup out of his online learning company Udacity. Top engineers Chris Urmson and Bryan Salesky have set up companies called Aurora Innovation and Argo AI, respectively. Another engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is the focus of an embittered legal battle between his former employer Alphabet and Uber over allegations that he stole intellectual property from the search giant when he left to form his startup, Otto.

The new Captain EX RGB cooling systems offer the same cooling performance as the already available Captain EX products, but offer a new look that can be controlled by appropriate software shipped with motherboards from different manufacturers. The Deepcool Captain 120EX RGB and the Deepcool Captain 240EX RGB devices resemble the company’s Captain 120EX/240EX cooling systems with 120- and 240-mm radiators (respectively) as well as one or two 120 mm fans. The products are compatible with all modern processors from AMD (including AM4) and Intel (including LGA2011-v3 and LGA1151). As for performance, both parts are rated for CPUs with TDP of up to 150 W.

The lighting of the Deepcool Captain EX RGB coolers can be controlled using the included wired controller, or the RGB LED-controlling software (such as the ASUS Aura) supplied with appropriate motherboards. The addition of the Captain EX RGB coolers into the Deepcool lineup emphasizes the importance of customizable LED lighting for high-end PC hardware for enthusiasts. Nowadays a lot of people demand to have an option to build a computer that looks exactly how they want and customizable RGB lighting is an easy and relatively inexpensive way to do it. In speaking to companies like Corsair, despite the negativity surrounding RGB lighting, it tends to make up a significant portion of sales, especially on high-end products, when both plain versions and RGB versions is available. The Captain 120EX RGB and the Captain 240EX RGB from Deepcool will be available starting next month for $99.99 and $129.99, respectively.

USA TODAY LOS ANGELES - It's World Password Day, a marketing gimmick dreamed up by chipmaker Intel and supported by many organizations, including Amazon and Dell, designed to get you to beef up your online security. Don't let the hype get in the way of a good message — hackers have never been busier — as witnessed by the big Google Docs hack attempt this week. So today is as good as any to stop, take a minute and update your online security. Emmanuel Schalit, the founder of password manager Dashlane  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) The most common password used, even to this day, is "password" and 123456. Security experts recommend a strong mix of letters, numbers and symbols, preferably ones that make no sense, says Emmanual Schalit, the founder of Dashlane, a popular password manager, which automatically generates tough ones. (Dashlane is free on one device, or $39.99 yearly on multiple devices.) Having the same password on multiple sites is like "giving the keys to your home to everyone who delivers a package," he says. "If you share the same password to multiple sites, when one becomes breached, the hacker will use the same password to all your websites." Schalit joined us on the #TalkingTech podcast to talk all things passwords, and how in a perfect world, he'd like to see them changed every five minutes or so. (Relax — he actually changes his every three months, using an automated feature of the Dashlane app to create hard to crack passwords.) Password managers remember your passwords so you won't have to — you sign in with one master password, which you have to remember. The apps don't store it for you, they say, to keep them away from hackers. A big question many folks have about password managers like Dashlane, Lastpass, Zoho Vault and others. What if the hacker gets to your master password? The managers send out e-mails when you log in from a new device requesting authentication, and the hacker would have to know both your e-mail and master password. It's for situations like this why Schalit recommends two-factor authentication on all your accounts. This requires you to sign in with your password, and then sign in again, usually with a code sent via text message. This makes it harder for hackers to get to you — so they move onto to the easier targets. Schalit admits that few people use two-factor. "It's in the low single digits because it's too complicated for people," he says. "One thing you'll see change in the next two years, you'll see a move to make two factor more accessible to people." He doesn't like getting two-factor texts, because texts are easy to hack — he prefers using an app, like Google's Authenticator or Authy. Click the link below to listen to our interview.

Friday, May 5, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2017/05/01/san-jose-may-day-march-expected-to-draw-10000/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News Updated: Thousands Turn Out for May Day March in San Jose By Jennifer Wadsworth @jennwadsworth / May 1, 2017 10 Thousands of people have turned out for the May Day march in San Jose, and it’s safe to say not everyone is a fan of President Donald Trump. (Photo by Greg Ramar) At Silicon Valley’s march for International Workers Day, activists echoed a recurring theme: that the concerns of laborers overlap with those of all marginalized people. Organizers of San Jose’s May Day rally said Monday’s event also took on greater urgency because of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric and attacks on civil rights. “Trump showed us that it’s so easy to play people against each other,” said Huy Tran, a 34-year-old attorney for the Justice at Work Law Group. “But I think this movement is a way to show that we’re all part of a bigger struggle.” Huy joined activists who marched from the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose’s East Side to the SAP Center in downtown. Before the procession took off down Alum Rock Avenue, people cheered and clapped as speakers, poets and dancers took turns on the stage. The crowd responded periodically by chanting in unison. “Get up, get down, there’s a migrant movement in our town,” they shouted. “When our immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” “The people united will never be defeated.” Aztec dancers elaborately adorned in feathers led the way from the East Side to the heart of the city. Trailing behind them, a parade of hundreds that swelled into a conflux of about 3,000 as the evening wore on. One group of marchers carried a huge puppet-like effigy of Trump—orange face distorted in a wrinkled grimace, garish yellow hair, abnormally long red tie. Outside City Hall, activists took bats to “walls of alternative facts,” paper banners scrawled with falsehoods uttered by the Trump administration. Throughout the day, protest signs, costumes and homemade T-shirts inspired countless selfies and snapshots. Twenty-seven-year-old Jayden Lee wore the transgender pride flag as a cape. A woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty raised a torch in her right hand and in her left, a sign declaring that “no human being is illegal.” Students from the Roberto Cruz High School Leadership Academy held up bright and bold-lettered handmade signs. “Something smells bad in the White House,” one read. “We should flush it.” “Yes, he Klans!” “We didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us!!” “We are not immigrants, we are the original Americans.” Roberto Cruz High Principal Yesenia Marquez said a lot of her students were too afraid to show up to class after the November election. But the school held a town hall and a know-your-rights training that empowered the students to act. “Supporting our community means supporting immigrants,”Marquez said. Elsewhere, a poster took a shot at a tone-deaf commercial that tried to co-opt political resistance movements to sell soda. “We need papers, not Pepsi,” it read. “Justice is the opposite of just ICE,” quipped another sign, referencing Trump’s orders to ramp up U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations. Rabbi Melanie Aron’s sign bore a phrase oft-repeated at the march, “No human being is illegal.” She said she attended with two other rabbis on behalf of a Jewish social justice organization called Bend the Arc. “For Jews, supporting immigrant rights comes partly from an identification with our history,” she said. “As a people, we have been refugees, we have been displaced and persecuted. But this is also about basic issues of justice.” People should have the right to keep their families intact, she said, as well as the right to housing and health care, to a dignified job and the chance to build healthy, stable lives. “For some of us, it was a struggle just to be here,” said Maria Guerrero, a 28-year-old barista at Intel. “Some people were scared to take the day off work.” Major tech companies that allowed employees to take the day off to protest had to be pressured to extend that commitment to vendors as well. Dozens of lawyers across the country—including Ruth Silver-Taube, of the Silicon Valley Wage Theft Coalition—offered to represent pro bono workers whose employers retaliate against them for taking the day off to protest. “Some people are still at risk,” Guerrero said. “Subcontractors are seen as less valuable.” At least Guerrero had reason to celebrate, she said. Her union, Unite Here Local 19, ratified a contract two weeks ago that raised the wage floor to $15 an hour and included protections for immigrant workers. The labor deal marked the culmination of nearly 20 months of organizing. Michael Sanchez, a Tesla worker on disability leave, said there’s a lot of fight left before he sees similar resolution at his workplace. Five years of 12-hour days installing underbody batteries at Tesla’s Fremont factory herniated two discs in his neck, leaving him in constant pain but with enough time to rally for stronger worker protections. But attempts to unionize 6,000 workers at the company’s East Bay facility have been met with intimidation and harassment, according the United Automobile Workers, which filed four complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board. “We’re trying to build a union, but there’s that fear factor,” Sanchez said. “People are afraid to speak up.” Jeff Powers, 73, said working conditions have deteriorated in the past two decades. When he became a passenger train conductor for Amtrak 20 years ago, he said, the crews were bigger and enjoyed more institutional support. “The loss of worker protections have led to understaffing in the railroad industry,” he said. “Crews have shrunk, which follows the trends in other industries to require fewer people to do more work.” Maricela Gutierrez, head of immigrant advocacy nonprofit SIREN, noted that South Bay labor activists have long championed immigration reform. But she said the coalition behind this year’s May Day demonstrations has never been more diverse, representing queer and transgender communities, religious and ethnic minorities, feminists, students, renters and every imaginable cross-section of the working class. Supporting each one of those groups means resisting federal policies that exclude refugees and target undocumented immigrants, said Rev. Rowan Fairgrove, a member of the activist group Rise Up for Justice. It also means pushing for laws that protect tenants from eviction and make health care a basic right, said Tom Linebarger, a retired painter and affordable housing advocate.  “This community belongs to all of us,” Gutierrez added, “and we must band together in this political climate to push back against harmful policies from the federal administration that promote hate and fear.” Nassim Nouri, a member of the Santa Clara County Green Party, said the same goes for environmental justice. She pointed to her sign, which named the party’s four core principles: social justice, ecology, democracy and peace. “We can’t stand for one of these without the other,” she said. “We stand for democracy, so we can have peace, so we can protect our ecology and promote social justice.” SJI May Day - 1 Thousands of people have turned out for the May Day march in San Jose, and it’s safe to say not everyone is a fan of President Donald Trump.

It’s a C-list rock concert. The question is, what freebies did they have to give out to get these losers to show up? Reply TAXPAYER May 1, 2017 @ 12:25 pm “Businesses that have agreed to close their doors in solidarity are listed online, so people can thank them with their patronage at a later date.” None listed when I checked the organizer’s website. “coalition of marchers from groups representing immigrants, women, the LGBTQ community, teachers, Muslims and other religious affiliations, students and more.” Yet the march isn’t listed on DeFrank (LGBT), SBIA, SABA, or any other Muslim group I checked. South Bay Labor Council is MIA too. Would be interesting if SJI reported SIREN’s parade permit and costs for SJPD staffing and VTA impacts. Or a gift of public funds?

Intel's Clear Linux Switches Over To GCC 7 Compiler Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 4 May 2017. Page 1 of 1. 6 Comments Just two days ago GCC 7.1 was released as the first stable release of GCC 7 as the annual update to this GNU code compiler. If you are looking for a Linux rolling-release distribution already using GCC 7 by default, Intel's open-source Clear Linux appears to be one of the first. Today the Clear Linux team has switched over to using GCC 7.1 as their default system compiler, replacing GCC 6.3.0. LLVM Clang 4.0 also remains present on the system. They just aren't shipping GCC 7.1 as a new compiler option but have also begun rebuilding all of their packages (bundles) under GCC7. I ran some before/after benchmarks of their GCC 6.3 to GCC 7.1 switchover. There isn't any big changes in performance, at least with the Intel Xeon E3-1260L v5 + ASRock E3V5 W5 Skylake system used for testing. With our other early GCC 7 benchmarking, we haven't seen much in the way of jaw-dropping performance changes when testing at least with current-generation Intel CPUs. But the good news is there aren't any major regressions nor with the Clear Linux testing today I haven't encountered any breakage with the upgrade. For the most part, the performance on GCC 7.1 is roughly the same as GCC 6.3 with this Intel Xeon E3 v5 box. One of the few regressions was with C-Ray. Those wanting to dig through more of this benchmark data can see this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. More data should be available with tomorrow's LinuxBenchmarking.com Clear Linux tracker when the data gets out there for this updated GCC7 build.

The Sixers join 16 other teams, including the Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics in the endeavor, which was announced in February 2017 by the NBA and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. NBA 2K is currently the highest-rated and highest-revenue-generating sports title in North America and the second-highest sports game globally. Team play within the league will consist of five players utilizing original avatars; additional details on player selection, team branding and league structure will be announced in the coming months. To support its NBA 2K league team, the Sixers will draw upon the success of its eSports franchise, Team Dignitas, which fields six teams in five of eSports most popular games, including League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm. In September 2016, the Sixers became the first professional sports team in North America to acquire and manage an eSports franchise, Team Dignitas. In a few short months, the Sixers and Team Dignitas have made a sizable impact on the eSports industry, including a recent announcement that Team Dignitas would become the first eSports team in North America to live stream to Facebook’s audience of 1.86 million as well as Twitch. In February 2017, Team Dignitas signed the first all-women’s team in their 13-year history. Team Dignitas’ women’s Counter Strike: Global Offensive team quickly established their place as one of the most elite and sought-after squads in the world; achieving a second-place finish at the 2016 Intel Challenge Katowice in Poland. “Under the Philadelphia 76ers leadership and guidance, Team Dignitas has solidified its place as one of the most accessible and compelling brands in the eSports space today,” said Team Dignitas CEO Jonathan Kemp. “With the announcement of the NBA 2K league, forward-thinking franchises, like the Sixers, further cement their position as true innovators and leaders in the sports industry. The NBA, the Philadelphia 76ers, Team Dignitas and NBA 2K are storied, global brands with massive international fanbases eager for player access, original content, live events and more. When you combine that industry experience and desire to grow the game of basketball with the eSport fan’s insatiable appetite for content and access, the result will be a league of epic proportions for fan, players, brands and the league.” “Our experience with Team Dignitas over the past few months gives us an incredible advantage as we launch this new league. Our ability to pull eSports expertise and industry acumen from our Team Dignitas executives and best practices in organizational infrastructure, branding and marketing, corporate partnerships and fan engagement from our Sixers front office makes this league a perfect pairing,” said Philadelphia 76ers Senior Vice President of Corporate Partnership and Activation Chad Biggs. “We’ve created strong relationships with game developers, come to a better understanding of the training and development needs of the eSports athletes, and generated corporate partnerships that give brands a direct portal into this burgeoning market. In addition to the new live streaming opportunities our Facebook partnership will provide fans and partners, we look forward to announcing three new corporate partnerships with dynamic activation elements in the next four months.” “In working closely with the Philadelphia 76ers for the past eight years, I can attest to its reputation as a fearless, innovative organization,” said NBA 2K eSports league Managing Director Brendan Donohue. “Its existing investment in the eSports space with Team Dignitas will enable them to share tremendous insight and experience across our league as we take the NBA 2K global phenomenon to even greater heights.” The complete list of NBA teams participating in the league is as follows: Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Dallas Mavericks, Detroit Pistons, Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards.

Don’t drop your guard when you’re on the road by Kate Bevan 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Your daily round-up of some of the other stories in the news UHD Blu-ray turns up on torrent site Encrypted copy protection on UHD Blu-rays have apparently been cracked for the first time and the content has appeared online – but don’t get too excited, as the disc that’s been cracked isn’t a hot Hollywood blockbuster. It’s The Smurfs 2. UHD Blu-rays are protected by AACS 2.0 encryption, which was developed and is used by IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, Walt Disney and Warner Bros to protect their content, and has generally been described as impossible  to crack. Does this mean the torrent sites will soon be packed with ultra high-definition content? Not so fast: apparently the file size on the cracked version of The Smurfs 2.0 is a meaty 53GB, and the version of the film you get if you go poking about those dodgy corners of the web has some issues, including problems with the colour. Oh, and if you do go looking for it – which of course we wouldn’t recommend – there are very few seeders, so it would take a long time to download. There’s no documentation of how the encryption was broken, so we’d also advise holding fire before accepting the claim that it has indeed been cracked. What’s up, WhatsApp? WhatsApp’s billion-plus users couldn’t use the encrypted messaging platform for several hours on Wednesday, with the peak of the problems hitting between 20:00GMT and 22:00GMT yesterday, according to data from service-monitoring websites including outage.report. Users reported that they couldn’t send or receive messages as WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, scrambled to fix the problem. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More There was some speculation that the outage was due to a cyberattack, but by Thursday afternoon no evidence had surfaced to confirm that. WhatsApp itself didn’t have anything to say about the cause of the outage, confining itself to apologising, but Dave Anderson at Dynatrace told the BBC he reckoned the outage was down to an update that went wrong. Said Anderson: “WhatsApp send a new version of the app to the stores every few days and they’re likely to be pushing code changes every hour to get ready for that. It only takes one line of code and the app will fail.” Google steps up phishing protection Hard on the heels of what seemed to be an extensive phishing attack masquerading as a Google Doc, Google has pushed out a new security feature for Gmail that aims to protect Android users from clicking on dodgy links designed to steal your details. Writing on the G Suite Updates blog, Google explained that the feature will roll out shortly in the Android email app. Once it’s arrived, if you click on a suspicious link, you’ll be shown a warning saying: “The site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery, intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information”. Of course, you shouldn’t drop your guard and expect a warning to keep you safe: you’ll have to remain vigilant and keep an eye out for those dodgy emails. Here’s just one of our guides on how to keep yourself safe from the phishermen (and women).

That changes today with the announcement that the Maximus IX Extreme is now widely available at leading resellers in both Canada and the United States. Built for gaming and liquid cooling enthusiasts, the Maximus IX Extreme represents the pinnacle of ASUS' engineering expertise. ASUS has also collaborated with Bitspower in order to develop the factory-installed monoblock water cooling solution that is clearly the model's most distinguishing feature over other motherboards. The monoblock is so large that it is likely the main factor behind this model's price. Designed to cool the CPU and the associated power delivery components, this monoblock incorporates flow rate, water leak, and inlet/outlet temperature sensors, all of which can be monitored and controlled from within the UEFI or the Fan Xpert IV utility. There is also ubiquitous RGB LED lighting built-in, which can be controlled by the AURA utility along with the LEDs integrated into the I/O cover, PCH heatsink, and any light strip attached to the 5050 RGB header. Speaking of headers, this motherboard has a lot of them. There are 12 fan headers, which includes 8 radiator fan headers and 2 water pump headers, and a number of additional flow rate and temperature sensor headers. Overall, this should not only negate the need for any additional fan controllers, but also reduce wiring complexity. All of these headers can be fully configured from within the UEFI or Fan Xpert IV utility. There is also a separate heatsink included to cool the topmost M.2 drive. While it is not part of the monoblock, it does make contact with it and thus should receive some level of passive cooling. Not to be ignored, the secondary M.2 drive can be cooled with the M.2 cover that is integrated into the PCH heatsink. Both of these M.2 connectors support SATA and PCI-E 3.0 x4 NVMe SSDs, as well as Intel Optane Memory, but only the secondary connector supports longer 22110-type drives. The remaining drive storage needs are handled by eight SATA 6Gb/s ports. In addition, the mainboard supports eight USB 3.0 ports (six rear, one header), four USB 2.0 ports (via two headers), one USB 3.1 type-A port, one USB 3.1 type-C port that supports Thunderbolt 3, and a rare USB 3.1 front-panel connector. Rounding out the connectivity is one gigabit LAN port powered by an Intel I219-V controller, onboard 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO that is based on Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174A chip, as well as HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2 video outputs. Since this is a high-end gamer-oriented motherboard, it is no surprise to see ROG SupremeFX onboard audio. This 8-channel audio solution is designed around the Realtek ALC1220A codec, but also features a Texas Instruments RC4580 op-amp, ESS ES9023P digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for the front-panel output, shielded audio circuits, impedance sensing for the front and rear headphone outputs, and color-coded and LED-illuminated 3.5mm audio connectors. Given the pedigree of the Extreme model name, overclockers have not been overlooked either. There is a plethora of ASUS-specific features that are designed with overclocking in mind, such as the ProbeIT voltage read points, Q_Code LED, an LN2 Mode jumper, a Slow Mode Switch, an RSVD switch, a ReTry button, a Safe Boot button, a MemOK! button, a DRAM channel jumper, and the ROG Extension connector. There are also diagnostic LEDs throughout the motherboard. Last but not least, the board features a standard complement of four DDR4 slots (which support overclocked memory speeds up to DDR4-4133), two strengthened PCIe x16 slots for graphics purposes (PCIe 3.0 x16 or x8/x8), one PCIe 3.0 x4 slot from the chipset, and one full length PCIe slot that operates at PCIe 3.0 x4. These last two slots get their bandwidth from the PCH, and there are SATA limitations that you need to research if you plan to use the mechanical PCIe x4 slot. As mentioned in the introduction, the ASUS Maximus IX Extreme is now widely available in North America and carries a suggested MSRP of $629 USD. As a result of that price point, it supplants its predecessor, the Maximus VIII Extreme, as the most expensive LGA1151 motherboard on the market.

Reply ddriver - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link Kudos to them engineers, they sure know how to make it look silly. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link Kind of an interesting value proposition. For a high end-enthusiast that would've been buying a high end motherboard anyways AND a separate cpu monoblock, the two are sold here, along with extra watercooling add-ons, like plenty of onboard fan-pinouts, etc, for potentially lower price than buying all those other components separately. Reply ddriver - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link Curious about where did you see the "value" part? Because 400$ for a water block ain't exactly a good bargain. Reply Shadowmaster625 - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link $629, and it doesnt come with a CPU? Puff puff pass mofo, u smokin way too much. Reply DanNeely - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link Is that another new header type I spot below the 24pin power header for the single front panel 3.1 port? If so, I have to ask what's wrong with the existing USB3 header; AFAIK 3.1g2 doesn't use any more pins, so there doesn't seem to be any need for a new connector. And also, like USB3 a new connector is going to need several years to get a decent availability in new cases while rendering most existing ones little more than over priced scrap metal. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link I don't believe it's another header type, it's literally a USB 3.1 type C port on the motherboard which you can run an extension cable for a front panel USB 3.1 type C connection. Reply DanNeely - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link If that's what it is (from the quality of the pictures I'm not convinced either way); it's marginally less awful. But putting the most modern port behind the most brain-damaged short term implemented kludge until we have a proper header way of connecting a front panel port is idiotic. Just offer a proper USB3 header with 2 port support and if the paucity of cases with C ports on the front to consume it is still low enough to be problematic include a bay device with 2 of them on it. (It's not like this product needs to worry about keeping price in check afterall.) Reply HomeworldFound - Thursday, May 04, 2017 - link It's just a port to make life easier, the board will still have headers. Mine has a type C there instead. I think the idea is to allow you to have a thumb-drive inside your case or maybe a controller dongle so when you move your computer you don't snap it off.

Investopedia Prableen Bajpai 14 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 7 reasons you could get less Social Security The 10 most counterfeited products in America With its ability to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything, Ethereum​ has created a lot of buzz since its 2015 launch. It was quick to move up the ladder in terms of market capitalization, leaving behind a trail of 700 odd cryptocurrencies. Its recent rally has been unprecedented, an increase of 900% in 2017, growing from about $8 at the beginning of the year to beyond $80 in early May. Here’s a close look at Ethereum and an attempt to understand the factors that are fueling its spectacular rise. Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 68.81 -0.27 -0.39% ING Groep NV ING ▲ 16.98 +0.31 +1.86% Ethan Allen Interiors Inc ETH ▼ 30.65 -0.25 -0.81% Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK ▲ 47.61 +0.21 +0.44% Ethereum, launched on July 30, 2015, is a Ethereum​ platform. It is a form of payment made by clients for operating on the Ethereum platform and thus acts like an incentive for developers looking to develop and run applications within. One of the natural consequences of its popularity has been its constant comparison to Bitcoin. The two differ in their basic purposes. Unlike Bitcoin, the primary purpose of Ethereum is not to establish itself as a payment alternative. It goal is to facilitate and monetize the working of Ethereum to enable developers to build and run ĐApps. However, on the trading platform, Ether rises as a staunch competitor to all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. (Related reading, see: Bitcoin Vs Ethereum: Driven by Different Purposes) Why Is It Rising? Over the eight years of its existence, Bitcoin has taught few lessons and helped generate the confidence among people to plunge into the world of Virtual Currencies. Bitcoin, backed by a stream of positive news is trading at a life-time high. This has spread a positive sentiment about cryptocurrencies in general, and Ethereum is benefitting from the same, just like the rest. Further, Ethereum (ETH) on its own has been generating excitement with big names such as JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Intel, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), Microsoft, ING Group (ING), UBS, Wipro, British Petroleum, Santander and Credit Suisse endorsing it by joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance that “connects Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics, and technology vendors with Ethereum subject matter experts.” Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has been offering Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure since November 2015, in collaboration with ConsenSys, “so Enterprise clients and developers can have a single click cloud based blockchain developer environment.” Given the fact that Ethereum is not just a platform but also a programming language (Turing complete) running on a blockchain, helping developers to build, publish distributed applications and run programs, it is being explored the most for enterprise use. (Related reading, see: The First-Ever Ethereum IRA is a Game-Changer) Chris Kline, COO of BitcoinIRA (the first SEC-approved Bitcoin-based IRA) told Investopedia, “Smart contracts are not only disruptive, they are logical. Whether it's government, global corporations or small business, these will inevitably be a part of everyday life. As that realization grows, so too will Ethereum.” In early April, Blockchain​ Capital, a venture capital firm investing in cryptocurrency ecosystem, successfully raised $10 million in record time (6 hours) for its first digital liquid venture fund, called Blockchain Capital III Digital Liquid Venture Fund, LP. The fund, registered in Singapore raised funds via a digital token build on the Ethereum platform. (Related reading, see: SingularDTV Creating Entertainment On The Ethereum Blockchain) Load Error Not just corporates and private institutions, but even global organizations such as the United Nations are looking to harness the Ethereum blockchain to deliver humanitarian assistance, such as the World Food Programme. “What started with a Proof-of-Concept in Pakistan in early January this year, has been transformed in a fully functional Blockchain pilot being rolled out in Jordan in May 2017.” The Bottom Line With great enthusiasm around Ethereum, its price has risen, too fast too soon, and thus the current rally may not be sustainable for too long. This is natural and thus investors must tread carefully at this stage. However, any correction in the near to medium term shouldn't undermine its potential. The rising awareness and confidence among the masses about cryptocurrencies coupled with the immense possibilities offered by Ethereum will eventually power its journey going forward.

This comes as an additional hit from Qualcomm, after the San Diego-based enterprise launched a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that it made its chips look inferior to Intel's. Up until the iPhone 7, Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modems for all Apple phones. The latest devices though started using a mixture of Intel and Qualcomm hardware. The Free Trade Commission also jumped in with a lawsuit, claiming that Qualcomm extorts smartphone manufacturers to pay royalties even if they are using other companies components.

If you already grabbed the new version you will have noticed it contains an updated and revised benchmark. That new benchmark shows lower Ryzen scores, actually lowers AMD scores overall. It's a bit of weird move to make for any developer. In the information below the break you can see an explanation as to why an how CPUID deems this as a qualified move to make. The developper of CPU-Z claims that up-to Ryzen the benchmark methodology introduced in 2015 was valid, however with the introduction of Ryzen a thing or two have changed.  Why are the scores much lower than the previous version, and can they be compared ? At the time the first benchmark was released in 2015, only a few parts included 8 cores (like the 5960X). In the meantime, Ryzen was introduced, and therefore 6 and 8-cores processors will become more and more prevalent. As a result, more models with 10, 12 and 16 cores are soon to be released. More cores mean higher multi-threaded scores, and a lower scale makes the comparisons easier. The new benchmark uses a new algorithm, and its scores can not be compared with the previous version. Why do the Ryzen performance decrease in comparison to the Intel processors with the new benchmark ? When the 1st version of the benchmark was released in 2015, it was tested on all existing architectures to check the relevancy of the scores. Almsot two years later, Ryzen was introduced, and scored - core for core and clock for clock - almost 30% higher than Intel Skylake. After a deep investigation, we found out that the code of the benchmark felt into a special case on Ryzen microarchitecture because of an unexpected sequence of integer instructions. These operations added a noticeable but similar delay in all existing microarchitectures at the time the previous benchmark was developed. When Ryzen was released, we found out that their ALUs executed this unexpected sequence in a much more efficient way, leading to results that mismatch the average performance of that new architecture. We reviewed many software and synthetics benchmarks without being able to find a single case where such a performance boost occurs. We're now convinced that this special case is very unlikely to happen in real-world applications. Our new algorithm described below does not exhibit this behaviour. What algorithm does the benchmark use, and what instruction set is used ? The new benchmark computes a 2-dimensional noise function, that could typically be used in a game to generate a procedural map. The code is written in C++, and compiled with Visual C++ 2008. No special instruction set is used, but the x64 version uses scalar SSE/SSE2 instructions to achieve floating point operations, whereas the 32-bit version keeps using the legacy x87 instructions, resulting in almost half of the x64 performance. When will the benchmark pages be updated with the new benchmark results ? The new benchmark was released 10 days ago, and thousands of scores were recorded in the meantime, We're curently building a new database with these results and plan to put it online during this week. We have Ryzen 5 1400 and 1600 reviews in the works (non-x models) and we'll be sure to add updated benchmarks cores. The scores and benchmark test have been completely overhauled, rendering all older results invalid. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Why would the Ryzen architecture process something efficiently if it was meaningless? I'm quite sure there are things the Intel core architecture is also good at. In fact, many current game engines prove that, making the core architecture still the best for gamers today. This is the same as saying that since a Porsche engine allows faster acceleration than a Ford engine, the acceleration factor must be disregarded if those two cars are ever compared. Sorry, CPU-Z developer, but I won't buy this explanation, which sounds totally random.

They argued the lower numbers are for comparison sake, as more cpu's with multiple cores will come out and would be difficult to read the high numbers. It's fine by me, but everything needs to be benchmarked again...

Cplifj Newbie Posts: 2 Joined: 2017-05-02 #5427892 Posted on: 05/04/2017 01:11 PM so they found out ryzen was actually very good at something and they just had to obscure that fact in favor of intel. I hope intel payed well enough to manipulate the markets yet again. There, someone had to say it. Because most of us allready know it or everything that happens just points in that direction allways. Everybody knows marketing is lies , but they keep selling em despite.

I hope the CPU-Z developer has bought a few lottery tickets if he has a unique 1 in a trillion luck. A more plausible explanation is that there's real value in processing it faster and thus the architecture does it. The CPU-Z developer simply didn't like it for his own reasons, so he used his natural privilege as the tool developer to change it to something else, to serve his own ends. It's his right, so it's okay, but he would be more respectable by not trying to invent fancy excuses for doing it. 4 pages 1 2 3 4 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

The leak detection sensor is capable of turning the system off in the event of a leak or spill. With dedicated sensors feeding information straight into ROG’s intuitive Fan Xpert 4 utility, it’s easy for users to configure the optimum RPM fan curve for each radiator or fan plus shutdown timing and alerts.  Onboard fan connectors are also intelligently located for water-cooling radiators, with eight headers divided between the top and lower edges of the board. At the mid-board location, there are two fan headers, conveniently placed for chassis fans. Two additional headers are placed at the lower edge of the board for water pumps although they can also be configured to control fans. That brings the total number of fan headers to an unparalleled, twelve. There are also options to attach additional flow rate and temperature sensors for a secondary loop. Should that not be enough, you can also use the bundled ASUS Fan Extension card, which adds three more fan headers and a complimentary array of thermal probe connectors to the mix. Comprehensive Options Based on the latest Intel® Z270 chipset and ready for 7th Generation Intel Core™ processors, ROG’s latest gaming powerhouse also includes ASUS Aura Sync illumination, support for ultra-fast DDR4 4133MHz memory, and SupremeFX audio technology. Featuring the SupremeFX S1220 codec, an ESS® Sabre Hi-Fi ES9023P digital-to-analog (DAC) converter for superior front-panel output, and a Texas Instruments® RC 4580 op-amp for high gain with low distortion — it all adds up to audio that envelops the listener as never before. For easier identification in any lighting condition, Maximus IX Extreme even features color-coded and LED-illuminated 3.5mm audio connectors.  Loaded with comprehensive safeguards, including pre-mounted I/O shield, strengthened SafeSlot PCI Express® slots, SafeDIMM memory slots and a copper-plated PCB edge, Maximus IX Extreme is built with long term reliability in mind and to perform in the most frenetic of gaming sessions. It’s also engineered with the latest and fastest connectivity, including dual M.2 PCIe® 3.0 x4 slots, a USB 3.1 front-panel connector, 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO, Intel Gigabit Ethernet and 40Gbps Thunderbolt™ 3 support. The board is selling at 625 Euros / 599 USD. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Around AOTF × News Reviews Articles Videos Guides Rumors Platforms Xbox PlayStation PC/MAC Nintendo Mobile More Contact Us Ethics Privacy Attack of the Fanboy News Reviews Guides Originals Xbox PlayStation PC Gaming Nintendo The PC Gaming Show Returns for E3 2017 Share Tweet by Kyle Hanson | @Konman72 | on May 4, 2017 E3 announcements are really starting to roll in. Yesterday we got the full details on the PlayStation press conference, and we already had info for Xbox. Now we have official confirmation that the PC Gaming Show will return for E3 2017. This year’s show will be sponsored by Intel, moving away from AMD, who ran things last year. This is the third iteration of the PC Gaming Show, taking place at The Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles on Monday, June 12 at 10am Pacific. “Celebrating PC gaming, which is enjoyed by 1.2 billion players worldwide, the PC Gaming Show brings together the best and brightest in the fastest-growing segment of the gaming industry,” reads the press release. “PC Gaming Show’s online viewership has increased each year since the show’s debut in 2015, and the show will reflect innovations across the industry with increased VR and esports content.” If you’ll be in the area and would like to attend the PC Gaming Show you can get tickets right here. It will also be livestreamed on Twitch, for those who won’t be in the LA area for E3 2017. The PC Gaming Show has been an interesting development to watch over the last couple of years. It’s not the biggest or best that E3 has to offer, lacking a lot of the huge announcements that we usually see from these conferences. Still, for a platform as diverse and fractured as the PC, it’s good to see it get its own presser. It’s especially important as we’ve seen a lot of big movement in the PC gaming space. Gamers are still hooked on their consoles, but the PC platform has definitely become a bigger and bigger part of the gaming space. Hopefully E3 2017 marks another big year for games, both on PC and on other consoles.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MacXDVD Announced World’s No.1 Fast Disc-to-Digital Conversion Solution Chengdu, Sichuan — (SBWIRE) — 05/04/2017 — Statistics indicate that the needs for DVD digitizing are looming large: the sales of digital streaming videos surged almost 23% to $6.23bn, exceeding DVDs which fell to $5.49bn last year for the first time. That being said, the average DVD household has hundreds or thousands of titles in its collection. Clearly that converting DVDs seems to be absurdly cumbersome. To allow users to build a high-quality streaming library from massive DVD collections in a faster way, MacXDVD Software is proud to announce the release of newly-upgraded MacXDVD Ripper Pro, the world’s No.1 fast DVD to digital files solution till now. Convert Any Disc to Digital Formats in No.1 Speed MacX DVD Ripper Pro significantly reduces the full-length DVD ripping from quarters to 5 minutes by pioneering Intel’s QSV hardware acceleration tech! Users have experienced a 70% to 80% increase of DVD-to-digital conversion speed compared with HandBrake, which tops out at 90 to 130 frames per second during conversion, while MacXDVD Ripper Pro maintains a processing speed that generally hovers between 300-400 FPS. Revealed by internal tests, for a 2hr DVD transcoding, Handbrake (20min) took four times as long as that of MacXDVD Ripper Pro (5.8min) under the same settings. Before the advent of the latest-upgraded version, digitizing DVD collection is arguably a time-consuming manual effort because it takes nearly an hour to turn a DVD movie into video files, not to mention the conversion frozen problems that some DVD rippers may have when dealing with new movie titles. With the latest upgrade of the best DVD ripper, a 5x faster DVD ripping will be guaranteed. In addition to the speed improvement, this DVD ripper makes any disc to digital files conversion an easy job. Equipped with a revamped title-identifying mechanism, it will correctly find the main title of the latest released movies, 99-title DVD, TV shows disc, workout/exercise DVD or Japanese disc. Users are allowed to rip DVD to MP4, MP3, MOV, AVI, MKV, WMV, 3GP, iPhone, iPad and Android, almost all the popular mobile devices and common digital formats having been taken care of. „MacXDVD Ripper Pro has earned high overall satisfaction and high adoption and engagement rates among customers. People struggling with issues being unable to digitize DVD movies are increasingly turning to MacXDVD’s solution for its powerful DVD decrypting capabilities, wide digital formats, fastest speed and reliable performance.” said Jack Han, CEO of MacXDVD Software, „Our software has been optimized to digitalize discs for streaming on players, smart TVs, mobiles or webs, with top scores among other rivals, according to feedbacks from our customers.” Pricing and Availability Feedback for the newly-upgraded MacXDVD Ripper Pro has been incredibly positive. The newest version of MacXDVD Ripper Pro that supports any DVD discs and promises No.1 fast speed, normally priced at $59.95, is half off at MacXDVD Ripper Pro official promo page. About MacXDVD Software, Inc. MacXDVD Software is a multimedia software developer dedicated to providing a range of trusted and innovative products across Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, including MacX Video Converter, MacX DVD Ripper, MacX MediaTrans, DVD Author, DVD backup tools, etc, series of apps for Apple video player, iPad iPhone manager, and iOS-based 2D and 3D video games.

Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg A mile away from where Google builds the maps used by people around the world, a 25-person startup is trying to do something similar for robots. DeepMap Inc., which was founded by mapping veterans of Alphabet Inc., is building systems enabling self-driving cars to steer through complex cityscapes. DeepMap plans to license its map-building software to automakers and technology companies looking to teach cars how to drive. The company recently raised a $25 million funding round led by Accel, adding to the $7 million it raised last year. In the chase to secure the investment, the firm penned an 80-page white paper on DeepMap's technology. DeepMap co-founders CTO Mark Wheeler, left, and CEO James Wu, in front of their mapping car. Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg Investors are eager to grab a piece of self-driving cars after big startup deals, such as General Motors Co.'s acquisition of Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc.'s purchase of Otto. But new entrants face sizable competition, whether in autonomous technology or mapping. In addition to Silicon Valley juggernauts Alphabet, Apple Inc. and Uber, Amsterdam's TomTom NV is building its own 3-D maps, as is HERE, a project jointly owned by several automotive giants and Intel Corp. Andreessen Horowitz and GSR Ventures also invested in DeepMap. Martin Casado, the lead Andreessen partner on DeepMap, said startups can compete with much larger companies because their businesses have fewer conflicts. This enables them to work with just about anybody and focus on the software, which typically has higher profit margins. "DeepMap isn't bound to a particular application like ride-sharing, and they're not bound to a particular company," Casado said. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up DeepMap fuses images from digital cameras with data collected using a laser device known as lidar to build detailed 3-D maps. It can identify street signs, billboards and the height of a curb. The 3-D maps complement the sensors by giving the cars a detailed awareness of the environment outside the car's view. James Wu, who started the company with his former Google Maps colleague Mark Wheeler, said he hopes to have three customers by the end of the year, while generating as much as $10 million in revenue. Software engineer's work on mapping and writing code at DeepMap's offices. Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg "Having the map lets us define for the robot the rules of the world," said Wu, who has also worked on mapping projects at Apple and Baidu. "It's very easy to make a prototype car that can make a few decisions around a few blocks, but it's harder when you get out into the world." A diaspora of autonomous driving entrepreneurs from Google has spread throughout Silicon Valley. Google X founder Sebastian Thrun just spun an autonomous car startup out of his online learning company Udacity. Top engineers Chris Urmson and Bryan Salesky have set up companies called Aurora Innovation and Argo AI, respectively. Another engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is the focus of an embittered legal battle between his former employer Alphabet and Uber over allegations that he stole intellectual property from the search giant when he left to form his startup, Otto.

New Atlas - New Technology & Science News Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops Microsoft Surface Laptop vs. Surface Pro 4 Emily Ferron May 4, 2017 View gallery - 26 images Microsoft announced a new addition to its Surface line at an education-focused event earlier this week. Here's how the specs and features on the Surface Laptop compare to those of the Surface Pro 4, a related device at a similar price point. Form factor NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Form factor is a major differentiator between these two machines. The Surface Laptop is a notebook in a classic clamshell form. The Surface Pro 4 is a large tablet that can double as a laptop thanks to its built-in kickstand and optional Type Cover add-on. The Type Cover is sold separately, however. There are a few variants, but it starts at US$130. Size The Surface Laptop is larger (about 10-percent taller and 5-percent wider) but keep in mind it's an all-in-one device. The dimensions shown here for the Surface Pro 4 are for the tablet only, without accessories. Weight Again, the Laptop is about 38-percent heavier than the lightest Pro 4 tablet. For reference's sake, the basic Type Cover for the Pro 4 adds another 0.31 kg. Build materials In the Surface Laptop, Microsoft made a departure from other Surfaces and opted for an aluminum body instead of a magnesium alloy build. For more about the Alcantara fabric keyboard, see "Keyboard" below. Colors The Surface Laptop is available in four colors – two metallics, plus more colorful burgundy and blue options. The Pro 4 tablet only comes in silver, but you can get your color fix from the Type Cover, which comes in several colors/styles. Display size The 12.3-inch Pro 4 has 83-percent of the Surface Laptop's overall screen area. Touchscreen Both devices have touchscreens. Display resolution The Pro 4 tablet has a sharper, more pixel-dense display than the Surface Laptop. But since the Laptop has no tablet mode, it will typically sit farther from your eyes – and possibly have a similar effect, despite the lower PPI. Keyboard The keyboard that is built into the Surface Laptop is backlit and has an Alcantara fabric covering (often found in auto accessories) for a soft feel that's also easy-care. The entry level Type Cover for the Pro 4 is plastic, but there is also a Signature edition (for $30 more) made of a similar fabric material. Fingerprint sensor There's no fingerprint sensor on either the Surface Laptop or Pro 4 tablet. However, you can buy a Type Cover with fingerprint sensor for the Pro 4 if you don't mind shelling out an extra $30. Face recognition Both devices offer a secure facial recognition login option, thanks to Windows Hello. Surface Pen included Both devices support the Surface Pen stylus, which is not included with the Surface Laptop. In most cases, the Surface Pen comes with the Pro 4. Be careful during the checkout process, though – it is possible to buy one without it. Processor The Pro 4 has sixth-generation Intel core processors, ranging from the m3 entry-level processor to the significantly more capable i5 and i7 chips. The Surface Laptop has seventh-generation Intel core i5 or i7 processors. We're still waiting on clock speeds for those, but the entry level i5 chip on the Surface Laptop likely trounces the m3 base model of the Pro 4. Graphics Since the Laptop's processors are a generation newer, they have improved embedded graphics. RAM You can buy either device with 4, 8 or 16 GB of RAM. Storage Either device is available with 128, 256 or 512 GB of built-in storage. There's also a 1 TB option on the Pro 4. Microsoft VP of Devices Panos Panoy mentioned a 1 TB option at the Surface Laptop's launch event, but we've yet to see it reflected on the Microsoft product page. Perhaps it will be added later or available as a special configuration. Ports Both machines have one legacy USB 3.0 and a mini DisplayPort. We're surprised that the newly unveiled laptop did not get a USB Type C port, which is a newer standard. MicroSD slot Of these, only the Pro 4 tablet has a microSD slot. Dedicated charging port Both machines have a Surface Connect port for charging. Headphone jack Laptop makers may be streamlining their I/O ports, but the headphone jack is sticking around. Speakers The Surface Laptop has "omnisonic" speakers which are built into the keyboard, while the Pro 4 keeps things simple with standard stereo speakers. Both machines have Dolby Audio Premium, which should indicate a certain level of audio quality. Battery Microsoft makes some impressive claims about the Surface Laptop's battery, which we'll put to the test when we conduct a review. We're still waiting for product breakdowns to confirm the actual battery capacity. Camera The Laptop has a 720p webcam, while the Pro 4 has an 8 MP rear and 5 MP front camera, which is more consistent with the types of cameras usually seen in tablets and phones. Software The Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S, Microsoft's newly announced walled operating system. From what we can tell so far, it looks and acts very much like Windows 10 – except it adds some education-focused features and only runs apps from the Windows Store, similar to how Chrome OS works with the Chrome Web Store. If that sounds insufficient, Surface Laptop buyers can opt for a full version of Windows for free until the end of the year (after that, the upgrade price is expected to be $50). Alternatively, the Surface Pro 4 instead comes with Windows 10 Pro from the get-go. Release The Surface Laptop was announced earlier this week to start shipping and hitting shelves in mid-June. The Surface Pro 4 has been around since October 2015 – and many of us had expected to see a follow-up by now. Starting price If you buy an entry-level Surface Pro 4 ($849) and the basic model of Type Cover ($130) you'll pay around $979, though we have seen these prices fluctuate as Microsoft runs promotions. You'll pay slightly less than you would for the base model of the Surface Laptop, but you'll also have a weaker processor. On the plus side, you can enjoy greater flexibility and mobility with the Pro 4's 2-in-1 form factor. Stay tuned for a review of the Surface Laptop in the coming months. In the meantime, check out our full-length review of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.

With the world's fastest DVD ripper, now users can free movies and TV shows trapped on those physical platters to build their own streaming service with enormous amount of time saved. Statistics indicate that the needs for DVD digitizing are looming large: the sales of digital streaming videos surged almost 23% to $6.23bn, exceeding DVDs which fell to $5.49bn last year for the first time. That being said, the average DVD household has hundreds or thousands of titles in its collection. Clearly that converting DVDs seems to be absurdly cumbersome. To allow users to build a high-quality streaming library from massive DVD collections in a faster way, MacXDVD Software is proud to announce the release of newly-upgraded MacXDVD Ripper Pro, the world's No.1 fast DVD to digital files solution till now. Convert Any Disc to Digital Formats in No.1 Speed: MacX DVD Ripper Pro significantly reduces the full-length DVD ripping from quarters to 5 minutes by pioneering Intel's QSV hardware acceleration tech! Users have experienced a 70% to 80% increase of DVD-to-digital conversion speed compared with HandBrake, which tops out at 90 to 130 frames per second during conversion, while MacXDVD Ripper Pro maintains a processing speed that generally hovers between 300-400 FPS. Revealed by internal tests, for a 2hr DVD transcoding, Handbrake (20min) took four times as long as that of MacXDVD Ripper Pro (5.8min) under the same settings. Before the advent of the latest-upgraded version, digitizing DVD collection is arguably a time-consuming manual effort because it takes nearly an hour to turn a DVD movie into video files, not to mention the conversion frozen problems that some DVD rippers may have when dealing with new movie titles. With the latest upgrade of the best DVD ripper, a 5x faster DVD ripping will be guaranteed. In addition to the speed improvement, this DVD ripper makes any disc to digital files conversion an easy job. Equipped with a revamped title-identifying mechanism, it will correctly find the main title of the latest released movies, 99-title DVD, TV shows disc, workout/exercise DVD or Japanese disc. Users are allowed to rip DVD to MP4, MP3, MOV, AVI, MKV, WMV, 3GP, iPhone, iPad and Android, almost all the popular mobile devices and common digital formats having been taken care of. "MacXDVD Ripper Pro has earned high overall satisfaction and high adoption and engagement rates among customers. People struggling with issues being unable to digitize DVD movies are increasingly turning to MacXDVD's solution for its powerful DVD decrypting capabilities, wide digital formats, fastest speed and reliable performance." said Jack Han, CEO of MacXDVD Software, "Our software has been optimized to digitalize discs for streaming on players, smart TVs, mobiles or webs, with top scores among other rivals, according to feedbacks from our customers." Pricing and Availability Feedback for the newly-upgraded MacXDVD Ripper Pro has been incredibly positive. The newest version of MacXDVD Ripper Pro that supports any DVD discs and promises No.1 fast speed, normally priced at $59.95 (USD), is half off on MacX DVD Ripper Pro official promo page. MacX DVD Ripper Pro 5.5.0 Official Promo MacXDVD Software is a division of Digiarty Software Company, owns a professional multimedia software development team, providing a range of products for Macintosh Computer users, including MacX Video Converter, MacX DVD Ripper, DVD Author, DVD backup tools, etc, series of apps for Apple video player, and iPhone, iPad 2D and 3D video games.

Many respected cybersecurity experts from around the world will be participating in the 2017 ETSI Security Week, which will take place from 12-16 June at the organization’s headquarters in Sophia Antipolis, southern France. This is the third year in succession that ETSI has staged the Security Week. This year’s event will see representatives from a broad range of sectors involved in the presentations and panel discussions. Among these will be BNP Paribas, Bosch, Deutsche Telecom, Ericsson, Ernst & Young, Gemalto, Huawei, Intel, ISO, NEC, Nokia Bell Labs, NTT Docomo, and Thales. The agenda will cover the numerous preventative measures that need to be taken and detail sophisticated mechanisms which must be put in place to protect valuable data from cybercrime and industrial espionage. Much of the activity will focus on addressing issues that are being raised by the latest technological advances - such as the expected massive increase in the number of connected devices and how security procedures will be impacted by the roll-out of 5G mobile technology. A particular focus will be given to the new types of threats made possible by the virtualization of network functions with the adoption of NFV, and the means to mitigate them. Attention will then turn to the pivotal role that standardization is going to have in supporting international legislative guidelines and interoperability. There will also be an opportunity to share experiences one year after the eIDAS regulation has entered force. “Building on the success of the previous two gatherings, in 2015 and 2016, the core objective of the ETSI Security Week will be to provide a platform for detailed dialogue on how best to safeguard the telecom and data communication networks of the future from security breaches. The event underlines the proactive stance being taken by ETSI in this area and how our vision of a standards-based structural framework will help encourage collaboration and alleviate the financial impact that cyberattacks have on the digital economy,” states Charles Brookson, chairman of ETSI TC CYBER. “It offers an ideal opportunity for attendees to converse with leading authorities in cybersecurity, exchange ideas and gain real insight into the challenges that lie ahead – and their potential solutions.” Each of the workshops, panel discussions and seminars that make up ETSI Security Week will be free of charge to attend and open to all upon registration.

(Everysight via Bloomberg/File) Elbit Systems Ltd., the Israeli drone maker, is gearing up to sell its first consumer product in nearly a quarter-century -- augmented reality goggles for bicycle riders, equipped with technology developed for fighter-pilot helmets. Made by Everysight, an Elbit spinoff, the glasses have a map-projection overlay that helps riders navigate new terrain, gives real-time performance metrics and allows cyclists to receive notifications, calls and text messages. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Gaspar said the solution is similar to obstacle-avoidance technology for autonomous cars developed by Mobileye NV, an Israeli company that Intel Corp. bought in March for $14.7 billion. “A part of our strategy is to take technologies from the defense market and look for applications in the commercial market, part of which is consumer,” Chief Executive Officer Bezhalel Machlis said in an interview. Israel’s largest publicly traded defense company, Elbit sells air, land, naval and cyber security products, and saw its annual revenue grow nearly 5 percent last year. In the past six months the Haifa-based company’s shares have jumped 16 percent, more than the average of its global peers. Still, the company’s five-year average sales growth of 3 percent lags its peer average of more than 5 percent, and its three-year Ebitda margin is 12.7 percent, compared with its peer average of 13.4 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The cost will be comparable to smartphones and other devices, the company said, without elaborating. “Do they need to create more revenue? If you already have a technology and you can put it to another use, then it makes sense to monetize it any way you can,” Citi analyst Michael Klahr said. Google Glass The goggles’ heads up display.(Everysight/File) Gilad Alper, head of foreign equity research at Excellence Nessuah Brokerage Ltd. in Petach Tikva, Israel, said defense companies don’t always do a great job transforming military technologies into commercial products, as the markets are so different.  “There are a lot of reasons to be skeptical, but that doesn’t preclude them succeeding,” Alper said. Everysight said in an e-mail that it expects its device to do better than Google Glass -- Google’s connected eyewear that struggled to attract customers -- in part because its goggles are based on decades of Elbit experience in vision systems and augmented reality.

These technologies, when developed and ultimately divested, created revenue for Elbit, as with MediGuide, an intrabody navigation system sold to St. Jude Medical Inc. in 2008 for $283 million.   Everysight could also be divested at the appropriate time, Machlis said.  “This is not the core activity of the company,” he said.

(Reuters/Ammar Awad) With its forces vastly outnumbered by Arab armies, Israel's victory in the 1948 War of Independence was widely considered a modern-day miracle. The Jewish state shocked the world again in 1967 by significantly expanding its borders and reunifying Jerusalem during the Six-Day War. In 2017, the perceived miracles keep coming. Ahead of the 69th Israeli Independence Day (Yom Haatzmaut), JNS.org recounts five of Israel's latest crowning achievements. Baseball Fever Team Israel far surpassed expectations at the World Baseball Classic (WBC) in March, starting the international tournament with a four-game winning streak—including victories over baseball powerhouses South Korea, Taiwan and Cuba—before losses to the Netherlands and Japan ended its run. Israel's squad, comprised of Jewish-Americans who are eligible for Israeli citizenship, garnered significant attention from major mainstream media outlets. ESPN ran a feature article dubbing Israel's the "Jamaican bobsled team of the WBC," given its current underdog story. The New York Times ran with the headline, "With Mirth and a Mensch, Israel Upsets South Korea in WBC," referring to the team's mascot, the popular plush Hanukkah toy Mensch on a Bench. Israel has experienced decades of bias and disproportionate criticism from the United Nations, but the nascent Trump administration—under the leadership of ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley—is vowing to chart a new course for the world body's culture on the Jewish state. During her speech at March's AIPAC policy conference, Haley described herself as the U.N.'s "new sheriff in town" and declared "the days of Israel-bashing are over." Haley, who in April assumed the U.N. Security Council's rotating monthly presidency, has promised to refocus the council away from Israel. "The incredibly destructive nature of Iranian and Hezbollah activities throughout the Middle East demands much more of our attention. It should become this council's priority in the region," she said. Start-Up Nation's $15 Billion Bombshell In the latest and largest coup for Israel's "start-up nation" reputation, the American high-tech giant Intel in March agreed to buy Israeli vision technology developer Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Intel hopes the acquisition helps it rise to the forefront of the rapidly expanding self-driving car market. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1781147026" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1781147026" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Intel-Mobileye deal would lead to the creation of "thousands of additional jobs" in Israel. Economy 'Defying Gravity' A nearly nonexistent inflation rate and low unemployment helped propel Israel to the No. 3 spot on a list of the world's most stable and promising economies for 2016, published by the Bloomberg financial news agency this month. Also this month, a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch deemed the Israeli economy "on a robust recovery path with growth rates running at 3 to 4 percent levels," noting that the Bank of Israel was "defying gravity" by checking the appreciation of the shekel against the dollar. The number of foreign tourists visiting Israel, meanwhile, reached an all-time high of 739,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Israeli Tourism Ministry officials hope 2013's record number of 3.54 million tourists visiting Israel will be surpassed this year. Energy Independence Day? What says "independence" more than energy independence? Government ministers from Israel, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and the European Union this month agreed to advance the creation of the world's longest gas pipeline, running 1,200 miles undersea between Israel and Italy. The pipeline—which will cost upwards of $5.5 billion and is slated for completion by 2025—is expected to significantly increase Israel's natural gas export potential and strengthen the Jewish state's position as an emerging energy powerhouse in the Mediterranean.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement You can ALREADY buy a $189 laptop… with Windows 10 Pro 05/03/2017 at 12:50 PM by Brad Linder 8 Comments When Microsoft announced Windows 10 S this week, the company revealed that you’d soon be able to buy laptops powered by the operating system for as little as $189. But you don’t actually have to wait: you can already buy a Windows laptop for that price… and get Windows 10 Pro instead of Windows 10 S. CDW is selling the HP Stream Pro 11 G3 laptop with Windows 10 Pro for $189, and what’s kind of funny is that this is a laptop that will eventually be available with Windows 10 S, likely for the same price. The laptop has an Intel Celeron N3060 dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and an 11.6 inch, 1366 x 768 pixel TN display. Want to know how I’m sure this is the same model that will be available with Windows 10 S in the future? Because the listing for the HP Stream 11 Pro on the Microsoft website leads to the CDW listing. Newegg and Walmart are also selling the same laptop, but the prices are a few bucks higher at those stores. Windows 10 S does have some of the business and education-friendly features available in Windows 10 Pro, such as support for Bitlocker encryption, Windows Update for Business, Windows Store for Business, and mobile device management. But users can only install apps downloaded from the Windows Store, and you cannot change the default web browser or search engine. Microsoft does let users upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro for just $49… but since you can already buy an HP Stream Pro 11 G3 with Windows 10 Pro, the only reason to opt for the Windows 10 S model is if you’d prefer an operating system that’s more locked down in terms of functionality (in hopes of getting better security and performance). It’s unclear if HP will continue to offer its $189 laptop with Windows 10 Pro after the Windows 10 S model becomes available. CDW is also selling an HP ProBook x360 11G1 convertible notebook with Windows 10 Pro, a Celeron N3350 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage for $300 (the same price as the upcoming Windows 10 Pro model), and an Acer Travelmate B118 Spin convertible with a full HD display, pen support, and a Celeron N3450 processor for $300.

Works very, very well with an excellent keyboard. $ 189 seems out of line for me for such a basic machine.

Win10Pro does not have the school setup features or intune cloud management that Win10S does, these are what makes Win10S appealing to school IT shops. Furthermore as this has to be hammered home into old school PC user mindsets the openness of Win10Pro is a liability not an asset in a school environment.

(April 10) AP Trump prepares to "make good" on religious freedom promise President Trump looks set to fulfill a controversial campaign promise Thursday and sign a religious freedom executive order. The executive order is expected to be building on a 1993 law protecting religious freedom that restored a requirement for the government to prove a compelling interest for any law that violates someone’s religious belief. Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign have already said that they plan to immediately file legal challenges against the order if it is as broad as a draft that leaked earlier this year. They are concerned Trump's actions will enable discrimination against gays and religious minorities, and allow many employers to deny birth control services in the health care plans they offer to workers.

Israeli collision avoidance sensor developer Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) founder and chairman Prof. Amnon Shahua has told "Reuters" that people should not expect autonomous cars to completely eliminate accidents and fatalities. He said, "If the expectation is for zero accidents that isn't realistic." "Reuters" added that Shashua believes society would accept fatalities that are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than with people-driven cars, meaning a decline to as few as 35 fatalities annually in the US from around 35,000 today. Once autonomous driving cars are ready, there will be a period of several years where drivers will still be needed for monitoring purposes, Shashua added. RELATED ARTICLES Intel confirms $15b acquisition of Mobileye The Mobileye billionaires In March, Intel Corp. announced that it is acquiring Mobileye for $15.3 billion and that Shashua would head its newly formed global autonomous driving organization based in Jerusalem. Shashua told "Reuters" that fully automated cars are not expected until at least 2021 but he sees income being generated in the immediate future from semi-autonomous driving features, which will nevertheless require drivers to remain alert. "We can enable hands-free driving to levels that are much higher than with any sensor," he said. Current systems will be enhanced by Mobileye's mapping technology. The Israeli company's "Roadbook" high-definition maps will be built into cars and will crowdsource data, presumably like Waze, in order to provide real-time traffic updates. Mobileye has already agreed mapping technology deals with Nissan, Volkswagen and BMW and Shashua told "Reuters" that four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program. "We hope to have the majority of these four signed by the end of 2017," he said. "Only car manufacturers can contribute ... because they have the cars. This is something that truly separates the car industry from the tech players." Shashua expects "meaningful" revenue from "Roadbook" although he declined to speculate on numbers.

Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it. Megan Squire, Professor of Computing Sciences, Elon University This article was originally published on The Conversation.

The new Aero 15 features a 15.6-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS anti-glare LCD with slim 5mm bezels although there is an option to bump that up to a 4K UHD screen for a bit more coin. Powering the show is Intel’s 7th generation Core i7-7700HQ clocked at 2.8GHz alongside up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card with 6GB of memory. The machine can accommodate up to two M.2 SSDs and has a full complement of connectivity ports including a USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, SD card reader, combo audio jack and more. It also includes 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, a Kensington lock slot and a full-size backlit keyboard with your choice of Windows 10 or Windows 10 Pro. Despite its slim size (14.0 (W) x 9.8 (D) x 0.78 (H) inches and 4.62 pounds), Gigabyte still managed to cram in a 94.2Wh battery that’s reportedly good for up to 10 hours of use between charges (expect that figure to drop when gaming, of course). The Gigabyte Aero 15 is currently available for $1,899 over on Newegg which includes 16GB of memory and a 512GB solid state drive in your choice of black, green or orange color schemes.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Qualcomm reportedly may try to block iPhone imports into the U.S. Aaron Pressman, Fortune May 3, 2017 8:12 PM Above: The back of the iPhone SE. The Apple logo is cast in stainless steel. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat The escalating legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm may hit U.S. consumers next. Qualcomm is preparing to ask the agency that polices U.S. imports to block iPhones from entering the country, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source. The International Trade Commission has the authority to restrict imports of goods that violate intellectual property rights. Apple had some older Samsung phones blocked by the agency in 2013, for example, over alleged infringement of two patents. Although the iPhone is designed by Apple, it is manufactured in Asia and must be imported to reach U.S. consumers. Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. The dispute between the two titans of the mobile business broke out after Apple started using modem chips from Intel in about half of new iPhones last year, instead of buying all its chips from Qualcomm. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, saying Qualcomm’s royalties, imposed on iPhones both with and without Qualcomm’s chip set, were excessive. Qualcomm counter-sued on April 10, accusing Apple of harming its business and breaching deals between the two companies. If Qualcomm seeks to have iPhone imports stopped, the move would follow Apple’s decision to completely stop paying royalties to Qualcomm for the wireless technologies included in the device. Qualcomm disclosed last week that Apple was withholding the disputed fees, which total about $500 million for the second quarter. Over the previous three quarters, Apple had withheld only a portion of the fees, totaling $1 billion. Shares of Qualcomm have lost 16% so far this year, as the dispute with Apple and various regulators around the world have threatened the company’s business. Qualcomm invented many core technologies over decades that are now used in wireless networks and smartphones. The chip maker charges royalties for a portion of the value of every phone sold, whether it contains communications microprocessor chips made by the company or by its rivals, arguing that some of its inventions must be referenced in every chip. But Apple and regulators claim Qualcomm is abusing a dominant market position to extract excessive payments. Qualcomm’s royalty agreements are with Apple’s contract manufacturers like Foxconn, not directly with Apple. Apple has said it had been trying unsuccessfully to negotiate a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years. During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained Apple’s reasoning for withholding the royalties. “You can’t pay something when there’s a dispute about the amount–you don’t know how much to pay,” Cook said. “I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,” he also noted, referring to the possibility that Qualcomm might seek to have iPhone sales blocked. “I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

Now, it seems like Microsoft is about to challenge the market that Google once had with the Surface Laptop. When one hears of Chromebooks, the next thing that comes to mind is its cost. Many would know by now that for a struggling student, the Chromebook is the most viable option for a laptop for school use. But now that Microsoft has entered the fray, students will now be able to make a choice on which system to get. But perhaps the main question is, “which one is better?” Cost In terms of cost, Google Chromebooks do come cheap. Some manufacturers even go as low as $199 for a brand new unit. Of course, with that price, one cannot expect a top-notch performance. However, there are some Chromebooks out there that has far superior hardware capabilities but still keep the cost under $500. On the other hand, the Surface Laptop starts at $999. For anyone looking for more “oomph factor,” the specs can be boosted for a few hundred dollars more. Operating system Anyone who has been using a computer for a long time will know that switching operating systems can sometimes be a pain. There is the uncomfortable adjustment period that one has trying to re-learn the nooks and crannies of a new operating system. This is why when choosing a device, it is one of the first considerations that one includes in the list. Microsoft Surface Laptop (via microsoftstore.com) The Surface Laptop and the Chromebook have something in common, they both use a lightweight operating system. These operating systems, while behaving in the completely opposite sides of the spectrum, do share one commonality: they are both tied to an app store. The Windows 10 S is reliant on the Windows Store for all the apps that can be run on the Surface Laptop. If an app is not available in the Windows Store, there is no chance at all to run the application in question without upgrading to a Windows 10 Pro. Meanwhile, the same thing applies for the Chromebook. However, the only good thing about the Chromebook, is that it can also run Android apps that normally run on a mobile phone. Performance When it comes to performance, the Surface Laptop is here to represent. This is due to the fact that the base specs start with an Intel i5 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128 of flash storage. Meanwhile, a Chromebook normally comes with an M series Intel processor with the same amount of RAM and storage. However, there are some Chromebooks that sport an Intel i5 chip like the Acer Chromebook 15 but still keep the cost to well under $500. Acre Chromebook 15 (via acer.com) As mentioned, the Surface Laptop price starts at $999. The top-tier version of the laptop can set anyone back $2,699. But it should be noted that this configuration includes an Intel i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of flash storage. When it comes to choosing between a Chromebook and the Surface Laptop, the first thing to be considered is the budget. If one wants a cheap and cheerful system, then the Google Chromebook is the obvious choice. However, for top-draw performance, the Surface Laptop is the best option.

CDT May 03, 2017 Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, visits an Apple store where third grade children from PS 57 James Weldon Johnson Leadership Academy are learning how to code through Apple's 'Hour of Code' workshop in New York City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple CEO Tim Cook says his company will invest $1 billion in a U.S. manufacturing fund to boost American jobs, the latest Silicon Valley company to attempt to build bridges to the new administration by responding to President Trump's call to put America first. Trump criticized Apple during the presidential election for manufacturing the iPhone and other products overseas. Amazon pledged to create 100,000 U.S. jobs over the next two years. Intel said it would invest $7 billion in an Arizona chip-making plant. Cook told CNBC in an interview Wednesday that the new fund’s first investment would be in a U.S. venture later this month. He did not name the venture. "By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond. Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them," Cook said. The investment would be the first of several to come from Apple this year, which include increasing the size of Apple's U.S. employee base by thousands and propelling the creation of more mobile apps by teaching people to code, Cook said. Earlier this year Apple said it was investing $1 billion in the SoftBank Vision Fund,  a new fund that will work on developing new, strategically important, technologies. "I think with each administration in every country in the world, there are things you disagree and things you agree, and you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don't," he said. "If you don't show up, I think that's the worst scenario because then you're quiet and this doesn't do your cause any good or your point of view any good." During the interview with CNBC, Cook also urged the Trump administration to hand tax breaks to companies that repatriate cash from overseas. Apple currently has $239 billion overseas.

Deep state openly wars with Trump administration Posted on May 5, 2017May 4, 2017 by Sam Rolley Views: 3 0 Shares Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. Reports indicate that government bureaucrats are using the security clearance process to block key members of the Trump administration from accessing sensitive national security information. The politicization of the security process is a signal that unelected government insiders, not the appointees chosen by the elected Trump government, are ultimately in charge of the nation’s military. Earlier this year in The Washington Times, intelligence expert Angelo Codevilla wrote that the CIA was insulting the president by blocking security credentials for Trump appointees. From his piece: The CIA has denied a security clearance to Trump National Security Council (NSC) official Robin Townley without any allegation, much less evidence of disloyalty to the United States. Quite simply, it is because the CIA disapproves of Mr. Townley’s attitude toward the agency, and this is unprecedented. President Trump appointed Mr. Townley to coordinate Africa policy at the NSC. The CIA did not want to deal with him. Hence, it used the power to grant security clearances to tell the president to choose someone acceptable to the agency, though not so much to him. This opens a larger issue: Since no one can take part in the formulation or execution of foreign or defense policy without a high-level security clearance, vetoing the president’s people by denying them clearances trumps the president. Hence, if Mr. Trump does not fire forthwith the persons who thus took for themselves the prerogative that the American people had entrusted to him at the ballot box, chances are 100 percent that they will use that prerogative ever more frequently with regard to anyone else whom they regard as standing in the way of their preferred policies, as a threat to their reputation, or simply as partisan opponents. If Mr. Trump lets this happen, he will have undermined nothing less than the self-evident heart of the Constitution’s Article II: The president is the executive branch. All of its employees draw their powers from him and answer to him, not the other way around. Evidently, the president didn’t get rid of those responsible. The Washington Free Beacon reported Thursday that officials within the intelligence machine have again made a decision about security clearance based not on the nation’s best interest but on bureaucrats’ desire to damage the president’s ability to lead effectively. From the piece: Adam S. Lovinger, a 12-year strategic affairs analyst with the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment (ONA), has been on loan to the NSC since January when he was picked for the position by then-National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn. Lovinger was notified in a letter from the Pentagon on Monday that his Top-Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) clearance had been suspended and that he had to return to the Pentagon. The letter cited unspecified outside activities by Lovinger. The notice said the suspension was approved by Kevin Sweeney, chief of staff for Defense Secretary James Mattis. One official said Lovinger was targeted by Trump opponents because of his conservative views and ties to Flynn, specifically his past association with the Flynn Intel Group, Inc., a consulting business. The report comes on the heels of a Monday revelation from the outlet that politics are increasingly playing a role in the intelligence community’s decision making process. Free Beacon reported: The blocking of security clearances under Trump contrasts with the handling of clearances during the Obama administration when a key liberal adviser with a questionable security background was given a high-level clearance. Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser for strategic communications under Obama, was denied an interim TS/SCI clearance by the FBI in October 2008, according to an email obtained from John Podesta last year. The email stated that Rhodes was the only White House official out of 187 prospective White House aides to be denied the interim TS/SCI clearance. Yet, despite the denial, Rhodes would later be granted access to some of the most secret U.S. intelligence information and emerge as one Obama’s closest aides who boasted of a “mind-meld” with the president on various issues. Rhodes became one of the most active originators and shapers of key American foreign and national security policies under Obama. The push-back Trump is openly getting from intelligence insiders helps to explain his total reversal on many foreign policy promises since the election. This entry was posted in Bell Ringer.

According to a report by Bloomberg, Qualcomm is preparing an appeal asking the United States International Trade Commission (ITA) to block iPhone imports into the country. The past couple of years have been tough for Qualcomm, legally speaking. In February of 2015, the chipmaker paid 900 million dollars to settle an anti-trust dispute in China, in December it paid 800-million-dollars to settle an anti-trust dispute in South Korea, and in January the FTC sued it for bullying the industry. The root of Apple and Qualcomm’s feud can be found with Qualcomm’s cellular communications technology patents that licensees acquire for a hefty royalty fee that Apple recently decided to withhold. Why is Apple withholding Qualcomm’s royalty fees? An investor asked Apple CEO Tim Cook the same question at Apple's earnings call this week, and he responded: Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That’s both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don’t believe that a – I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we’re withholding royalties, you can’t pay something when there’s a dispute about the amount. You don’t know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn’t been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we’re depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we’re pursuing this is that Qualcomm’s trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it’s one small part of what an iPhone is. It’s not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don’t think that’s right, and so we’re taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we’re in the right, and I’m sure they believe that they are. And that’s what courts are for. And so we’ll let it go with that. Apple, with the iPhone 7, also started using Intel’s modems, but didn’t abandon Qualcomm entirely. In tests, iPhones with Qualcomm’s modems were not only establishing a stronger LTE connection but also provided an overall 30% increase in performance. Just days after FTC sued Qualcomm, Apple followed with three lawsuits, first in the US, then in China, and finally in the UK. In March, Qualcomm countersued Apple, alleging that the iPhone-maker misrepresented its chips’ performance against Intel. The USITC may seem like the next logical step after these recent court disputes, but it remains unconfirmed at the time of this writing. In an email to Mashable, USITC Public Affairs Officer Peg O’Laughlin said that "no complaint has been filed with the Commission at this time.” Qualcomm and Apple’s feud is a convoluted mess, but it has only just started to unfold.

GOP lawmakers in Hillary Clinton districts McClatchy The New Republican Health-Care Plan Is Single-Payer for Dummies The New Republic. Interesting article, but one gets tired of liberals deploying the “stupid” trope, given that Republicans are so stupid they now control all three branches of government. The Daily 202: How Nancy Pelosi kept Democrats united behind Obamacare WaPo: Pelosi, first elected to the House in 1987, acknowledged being frustrated during the health fight of 2009-10 that outside groups didn’t give her more air cover. She praised them for mobilizing in a constructive way this time: “That was very important because lots of time the outside will say, ‘While we’re at it, why don’t we go for single payer?’ I’m like, ‘Save that for another day! Because you’re not going to get anything unless we kill this bill. And the only way we’re going to kill this bill is going to be to focus on what it does.'” “Once they take repeal off the table,” Pelosi promises that Democrats will happily work with the GOP to “find common ground” to fix problems that she agrees exist with the law. “But if you’re a deconstructionist, then there’s just almost no common ground,” she said. “[H]appily work with the GOP.” Shorter: Once the liberals have exploited left energy, they’ll throw the left under the bus, as usual, and work with conservatives (exactly as in 2006, when the Democrats took back both houses of Congress on left mobilization, and Pelosi instantly took impeaching Bush off the table — and Bush should have been impeached for his criminal program of warrantless surveillance, which Obama voted to retroactively legalize in July 2008). Pelosi is also shamelessly rewriting history when she whinges about lack of air cover: Career “progressives” imposed a news blackout on single payer advocates, censored them, banned them, and the Democrat establishment didn’t include them in hearings and had them arrested when they protested. People who were there — and that includes Pelosi — know all this. I really don’t know what more “outside groups” could have done, other than have single payer advocates publicly whipped.

But everybody knows all people of color are Clintonite liberals. What’s wrong with these people? Ro Khanna Wants to Give Working-Class Households $1 Trillion The Atlantic (UserFriendly). Interestingly, a shout-out from Khanna to Stephanie Kelton. This paragraph caught my eye: People want to be useful. I think it would be very patronizing to go to folks who are coal miners and say, “Look, here’s your check because all the productive work is going to be done on the coasts.” These are hard-working people who believe they’ve contributed to the country, whose dignity and sense of self-esteem is linked to work and productive work. I think a better argument is to say, “Look, we’re going to help prepare these areas for diversification, so they can succeed economically.” Then boost wages through the EITC. Khanna, it seems to me, is really arguing for a jobs guarantee, as opposed to a basic income guarantee or tax credits.

High Ground Is Becoming Hot Property as Sea Level Rises Scientific American Antidote du jour (via): See yesterday’s Links and Antidote du Jour here. 00210 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Links on May 4, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Its rise to preeminence ostensibly occurred despite the inclinations of the American people who viewed the outside world with suspicion and disdain and who wanted nothing more than to keep to themselves. Williams argued otherwise, crediting American statesmen with having pursued a sophisticated, if opportunistic strategy of expansionism. Over the course of nearly two centuries, the United States had sought power and had succeeded spectacularly in acquiring it. Furthermore, Williams dared to suggest that this longstanding penchant for expansionism was essential to understanding the ongoing Cold War. =========================================================== How many times have I said it? If you studied studiously in high school, your view of the FACTS of history is probably very, very misinformed…. Reply ↓ James Levy May 4, 2017 at 8:01 am Tooze argues in his book The Deluge that the whole “isolationist” meme viz. the 1920s is completely off. The Americans worked very hard to influence global affairs via dollar diplomacy, not wide-scale intervention (although they did intervene in Nicaragua in 1925). The Americans functioned a bit like the Germans today inside the EU. The US walled off their economy and made it difficult to earn dollars. Since people needed what the Americans produced (oil and food) they had to take out loans, which the US government could then use as leverage over those countries. But it was a one-way street, and eventually the US pushed too many loans that foreign governments could not repay (part of the chaos of 1929-31 was a global debt crisis which is not talked about the way the stock market crash always is). Smoot-Hawley made it virtually impossible to earn dollars. So the system collapsed. American international clout only waned for a while after the defaults and when America itself was too poor to export capital (1931-1940). But the will to dominate remained (at least among the Eastern Establishment, which really existed back then). NOTE: countries could use Sterling instead of dollars, which the Americans would take (along with gold), but to shore up the pound at its too high peg of $4.86 (thanks Churchill) Britain could not flood the market with pounds, and going back on the gold standard made this worse, so nations most times did have to earn dollars to trade with the US (making Washington happy and powerful).

Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers May 4, 2017 at 7:10 am Thank you, Lambert. With regard to the French election links, this phrase, “just hanging on”, caught my eye. There is a UK equivalent which has just come into fashion, “just about managing (JAM)”. Ed Miliband had a similar phrase, which I can’t recall, when he led Labour. The concept is not new. In the 1990s, Will Hutton coined the term society of thirds in The State We’re In. Hutton talked about the third at the botton, the third JAM and staring at the abyss, and the third doing well. In the book, he quoted a stat showing the UK having a quarter of the then EU’s poor. The seeds of Brexit were being sowed then. I watched the first half of the debate on TV5 last night. Macron chucked in some identity politics with regard to gays, just as Ian Welsh writes about. I don’t think that Macron dominated as the BBC and Grauniad reported. Reply ↓ David May 4, 2017 at 8:10 am You stuck it out longer than I did. I gave up after an hour or so – couldn’t stand the shouting. The format was partly to blame, with the two contenders sitting head to head staring at each other, and the poor journalists, who completely lost control, off to one side. (Apparently one viewer emailed FR2 to ask if the journalists were being held hostage and needed to be rescued). I think Macron probably “won” in the sense that his performance had improved, and he was often technically correct on the detail of disputed points. Whether this will impress the electorate remains to be seen. But he’s still vulnerable because of his record. When he said that France was the only country in Europe with massive unemployment (which even Le Monde felt it had to correct), Le Pen snapped back that he’d been in charge of French economic policy for years – what had he done about it? I suspect that Le Pen may not, in the end, be terribly worried about winning on Sunday. She’s young enough to have another go, and in any event, a narrow victory, a weak President and a Parliament hopelessly divided after the June elections would suit her very well. If the parcel is going to blow up, you want somebody else to be holding it. She can come along later and save the nation. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers May 4, 2017 at 9:34 am Thank you, David. I agree with you about Macron winning in that sense. I thought that Le Pen missed a trick by not explaining that Macron had written la loi El Khomry and foisted it on the hapless ministre maghrebinne. That would have shown how Macron and Hollande operated, including exploiting a neophyte woman and Arab minister, shoving their identity politics back in their faces. I also agree with you about Le Pen being young enough. As the Front National is a family business, Marion Marechal Le Pen will have several chances, too. I don’t know if you pay attention to Swiss politics. If I was an FN strategist, I would build on the alliance with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan and transform the FN into a French SVP / UDC, much as I detest the SVP and the Blocher family, or something softer enough to peel off some Republicains. I can imagine une rentree chaude from September, so also agree with you about June and beyond. The “fun” starts after elections to the National Assembly. I am visiting France in late August, mid-September and early December, so looking forward to these interesting times. One thing that I can’t understand, having worked with the firm and observed the family at the races, using a former employee like Macron seems so direct and unsubtle. The link is just too obvious. The family is usually much more discrete. Reply ↓ EmilianoZ May 4, 2017 at 10:24 am In 2002, there was not even a debate between Chirac and Le Pen pere. A debate would have been seen as “normalizing” the Front National. Maybe Le Pen fille considers it already a victory that a debate took place at all. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers May 4, 2017 at 10:45 am Thank you, EZ. Further to an exchange between us some weeks ago, I wonder if my distant cousin, JMG Le Clezio, will have to hand in his French passport next week. He has been threatening that for a couple of years.

Reply ↓ paul May 4, 2017 at 8:13 am ‘The squeezed middle’ was, I think, Milliband’s tin eared phrase. Almost as bad as Cleggski’s ‘Alarm clock Britain’.

I did enjoy le pen’s crack about France being ruled by a woman whoever won; Le Pen or Merkel. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers May 4, 2017 at 9:41 am Thank you, Paul. I had not heard Clegg’s quip. Clegg is the worst sort of hypocrite. He lives with his family in south west London, but represents a northern seat, well to do Sheffield Hallam. He refuses to live up there, citing family commitments, but thinks HS2 (a proposed railway for those outside the UK) good for people to commute from the north to London. For those not familiar with the UK, this commute would take 2 – 3 hours each way and cost at least USD10k pa. Le Pen was right. Fingers crossed for Gorgeous George in Manchester Gorton today. US readers may remember him as the UK politician who gave the neo-cons both barrels at a Capitol Hill hearing about the Iraq War.

What do readers think of Laurits’ proposed structure? Most fundamentally, the 20th century income distribution system has collapsed. The share of income going to profits has rocketed and will continue to rise, the share going to rent will rise even more. Real wages will continue to stagnate. In pursuit of competitiveness, governments have implemented policies of labor flexibility, making labor more insecure, leaving millions without health care, pensions or other benefits. Governments have turned to means-tested social assistance and to workfare. The welfare state has withered. Meanwhile, a global class structure has been taking shape, superimposed on national structures. At the top is a tiny plutocracy, many with criminal backgrounds. Their economic and political power is awesome; they have no responsibility to any nation state. ====================================================== Just returned from a trip from San Diego – a friend of a friend died, but it was a chance to see east coast friends. What was elucidating is that the friend had too (and two) well educated sons….very well educated, as both went back to college after getting their first degrees (and these were not basket weaving degrees) because even with their education, jobs prospects were poor. What is interesting is just as the American Conservative article points out the bullsh*t that pervades American mythology with regard to foreign affairs, I think more and more people are seeing (and EXPERIENCING) the fact that the economic system is carefully crafted and designed to exploit them – and that this is not some random attribute of nature. IT IS a zero sum game, and it is gamed by the rich to get ALL the resources… Reply ↓ Jane May 4, 2017 at 8:54 am The gig-economy is finally driving home, to those in Western democracies, Bertrand Russell’s point that “Nature is raw material; so is that part of the human race which does not effectively participate in government.” History of Western Philosophy Chapter 21. The truth of this has been clear for years re: Latin Americ and Asia but we’ve thought ourselves otherwise as we believe we do participate in government. I think we focus too much on the structure of the 99% — it’s the structure of the 1% that needs to be fully rooted out and forced into the fold of the commons. Before that can happen though, the salaried need to realize that they are not an exceptional 10% but just another part of the 99%. Sadly, it might take global warming to do the trick. Reply ↓ Eureka Springs May 4, 2017 at 9:21 am Progressives wanted and needed Obama. They were his biggest enablers and he was their biggest distraction from who they are and what they do. All are Democrats through and through. No accountability. No actual representation. Just take a look at the recently published ‘peoples budget’ by the prog caucus. It’s doesn’t demand nor budget Single Payer, specifically H.R. 676, it gives more federal lip service to a public option from the get go. It doesn’t promote or budget debt free college and trade school education. Tax measures still protect the rich rather than define the breadth of disparity allowed. It doesn’t end wars or dramatically cut defense. Nearly everything one hopes progs are supposedly FOR is compromised from the get go into neoliberal oblivion or half measures at best. Prog people need to look at themselves and their so-called reps first. Side note: I noticed Pelosi is no longer on the prog membership roll, and Sanders is now listed as the only Senate member. Reply ↓ dontknowitall May 4, 2017 at 9:53 am This makes me think Sanders is just a fig leaf in this progressive caucus exercise, otherwise HR676 and the other policy choices would be prominently in evidence.

Reply ↓ hemeantwell May 4, 2017 at 9:33 am Re whether Standing’s class structure map is useful, I hold the usual reservations. Standing nods in passing to the objection that the lives of proletarians have tended to be precarious — after all, Marx himself stressed that an industrial reserve army was integral to capitalism. That some proles could obtain long-term stable employment could be seen as a feature of a “Fordist” phase of capitalism that is now over and so it’s back to the norm. What’s more interesting in his piece but remains undeveloped is the emergence of an identifiable transnational, or supranational, elite. Not only are they something like Beasts of No Nation, they are also seen as parasitic, living off hot money flows like a strange form of bacteria instead of organizing production. Instead of ideologically fortified captains of industry, we see pirates and their hirelings. As the reserve army grows and as the austerians savage the state-supported safety net, supranational elite networks will be relatively easier to organize against. The outcry against supposed Russian influence in the Trump administration, with Tillerson as one anchor point of the criticism, is an example of what will become more frequent. Reply ↓ jrs May 4, 2017 at 9:43 am What if it’s cause and effect and the reason this is so is because labor has less power, and one follows the other? The amount of income a class gets directly follows the power it has. That’s pretty far from mainstream economics isn’t it? If so “progressive” Obama supporters are fairly irrelevant to anything, they are mostly a distraction in every sense. They surely aren’t the solution, but they aren’t the cause, the cause is the lack of labor bargaining plus political power. Reply ↓ Eureka Springs May 4, 2017 at 10:04 am How does one or many bargain when their so-called prog reps don’t even begin bargaining from a point they say they want? In my small tourist town there are about 80 restaurants. Among the most lucrative service jobs service staff get at most 4 bucks an hour plus tips. The best (professional, attractive, work every double they can get with no mention ever of OT) pull in less than 30 k gross. Most of these peeps are in their 40’s. The amount of taxation on their income is among their greatest stress, followed quickly by rent and the financial impossibility of playing by the ACA mandate. Out here in flyover deplorable-ville they don’t dare bargain for more… when even a couple missed shifts in protest would be disastrous. This problem is systemic and far more than just labor need representation.

At the time, Weiner was married to Huma Abedin, who was a senior aide to Clinton. Agents were looking at Weiner’s laptop because he was under investigation for possibly inappropriate communications with a minor. –“Somehow, her emails were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information,’’ Comey said, adding later, “His then-spouse Huma Abedin appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to him for him to print out for her so she could deliver them to the secretary of state.” To put this in Chicagoese: What kind of jamokes are these? They could screw up a two-car funeral. [And the idea that Clinton was the most qualified candidate for the U.S. president in the nation’s history becomes more laughable by the day.

The provision, part of a last-minute amendment, lets states obtain waivers from certain Affordable Care Act insurance regulations. Insurers in states that obtain the waivers could be freed from a regulation mandating that they cover 10 particular types of health services, among them maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment and hospitalization. That could also affect plans offered by large employers, health analysts said. … Under the House bill, large employers could choose the benefit requirements from any state—including those that are allowed to lower their benchmarks under a waiver, health analysts said. By choosing a waiver state, employers looking to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and eliminate the out-of-pocket cost cap from their plans under the GOP legislation. … “Waiver state”.

The man who continued and expanded all of Bush’s most evil policies, created a failed state in Libya, exponentially expanded the civilian-slaughtering US drone program which Chomsky calls “the most extreme terrorist campaign of modern times” to unprecedented levels, facilitated the Orwellian expansion of the US surveillance state while prosecuting more whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined, and used charm and public sympathy to evade the drastic environmental policy changes we’ll need to avert climate disaster and lull the progressive movement into a dead sleep for eight years now gets paid nearly half a million dollars an hour to continue bolstering the exploitative corporatist nightmare he’s dedicated his life to. American University has compiled data indicating that the already extremely wealthy Obama family may end up being worth as much as $242 million in their post-White House years, and if Barry keeps whoring himself out like this, he might exceed even that. =================================================== The country is all branding and advertising all the time – with the same regard for reality. Imagine a photograph, and Trump is a perfect negative of Obama…. I saw a news story about how the “wall” is really a fence, and how it really was funded and authorized by Obama. Than of course there was a panel “discussion” with half of the participants going on about how terrible walls or barriers or fences (call them what you will) and the other half about how great they are. Apparently verboten from the discussion is that if walls are so terrible, why was Obama building and funding them? And of course, the pro wall group unable to acknowledge that if you REALLY want walls, Obama was IN FACT MUCH more effective and efficient at it….than Trump.

This moment nonetheless offers an opportunity to transform Haiti for the better. Instead of settling for mere tinkering with their constitution, Haitians should demand an altogether new one that can help to finally bring the peace and prosperity they have lacked for over 200 years of independence since driving away their French slavers in 1804. The new Haitian Constitution should do something virtually unprecedented: renounce the power of self-governance and assign it for a term of years, say 50, to a country that can be trusted to act in Haiti’s long-term interests. Of course, not once does Albert mention that the wealthy nations of the global North have been interfering in Haitian politics for some time, actively preventing a recognizable democratic process from taking hold. No, apparently, the problem with Haiti is the people’s unwillingness to choose a dictator abroad. It’s Klein’s shock doctrine in a nutshell: we’ll ruin your country, so that you have no choice but to let us run things. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers May 4, 2017 at 8:01 am Thank you.

I was sent to Chu Lai, Vietnam in I think December 1967, there to fix and fly around in UH-1s, do KP and guard duty, live through Tet ’68, and otherwise participate in the activities of Empire that Wilkerson talks about in other links today. The 3rd ROK Marines had a “rest and recreation” facility there, right on the beachfront and adjacent to our temporary billets but separated by obstacles at least as threatening as those forming the Green Line outside the US base, to keep “Charlie” and the NVA in their place. The R&R site was a place right on the beach, for South Korean troops to unwind from their pretty relentless scorched-earth operations across South Vietnam. http://talkingproud.us/Military/ROKVIetnam/ROKVIetnamIntro.html There was a small town that ran parallel to the coast, just west of the long northern tongue of the military base that we and the Koreans billeted on. The Koreans would go down into the “ville” to get drunk and get laid. At first, US GIs were also allowed the same privileges, but there was a steady drumbeat of “incidents” where US and ROK troops would “conflict” in the tribally segregated bars and “establishments.” The ROK dudes, with their martial arts skills and training much more advanced than the GI’s, would kick the sh!t out of the GIs. So the ville was divided too, though US military police as I recall would (between taking bribes and so forth) try to maintain order. And even the beg tough MPs, they told me, would not go into “Korean” bars when things got rowdy, after regularly getting their butts kicked by their “allies.” Why were there 50,000 ROK troops with boots on the ground through the whole active idiocy period in Vietnam?

It makes the North Korean’s distrust of the USA look rational by comparison. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi May 4, 2017 at 1:27 pm I was glad to see Hasan pull US massacres out of the memory hole. I was also glad to see him citing Bruce Cumings’ The Korean War. I was disappointed, however, to see him recycle the US line about “who started it”, presumably as a troll prophylactic: For the record, it was the North Koreans, and not the Americans or their South Korean allies, who started the war in June 1950, when they crossed the 38th Parallel and invaded the south. Yet on page 64 of Cumings’ book, after clearly showing that it is not clear which side crossed the 38th Parallel first, he demolishes the entire logic of asking “who invaded first” in a civil war between people on both sides of the parallel with differing ideologies: Ever since 1950, this civil war analogy has been like a Rumplestiltskin for the official American view: say it and the logic collapses, the interpretation loses its power… For Americans a discrete encapsulation limits this war to the time frame of June 1950 to July 1953. This construction relegates all that went before to mere prehistory, June 25 is original sin, all that comes after is postbellum. It also presumes to demarcate the period of active American involvement; before June 1950, it is Syngman Rhee against Kim Il Sung backed or controlled by Stalin and/or Mao; after July 1953, it is Rhee against the same people, his fledgling republic ever under threat. This construction focuses the bright glare of our attention on the question of who started the war, on the presupposition that the correct answer to this question furnishes answers to all the other questions. What is highlighted here obscures all that went before and all that came after, placing it in the shadows of irrelevance. In this manner a wrongly conceived and never-known civil conflict disappears before our very eyes, as an American construction that only an American would believe; but American amour propre remains firmly intact. The American focus on “who started it” is a political and often an ideological position, a point of honor that abstracts from and makes easy and comprehensible the politically shaped verdicts that began with Washington’s official story on June 25,1950. The Korean War was (and is) a civil war; only this conception can account for the 100,000 lives lost in the South before June 1950 and the continuity of the conflict down to the present, in spite of assumptions that Moscow’s puppets in Pyongyang would surely collapse after the USSR itself met oblivion in 1991. While I truly enjoy his interviews on Al Jazeera, this is not the first Hasan Intercept article that has been factually flawed. The Intercept needs fact checkers.

The Thucydides Trap (and how I wonder if there’s a parallel case from the Chinese literature). Probably many such parallel cases. Here is one, from Wikipedia, on King Wen, the founder of the Zhou dynasty: At one point, King Zhou of Shang, fearing Wen’s growing power, imprisoned him in Youli (present-day Tangyin in Henan).[1] However, many officials respected Wen for his honorable governance and they gave King Zhou so many gifts – including gold, horses, and women – that he released Wen, who subsequently planned to overthrow King Zhou but died before he could accomplish it. His second son, King Wu, followed his father’s wishes and crushed the Shang at Muye, creating the imperial Zhou dynasty. Here, the rising power is known for ‘his honorable governance.’ When we see that in a rising power in this world, today, then, the declining power would really have something to fear. Until, no fear of any Chinese Thucydides trap.

On top of all the recent crying about outsiders interfering in elections, and the $400k speaking fees, this is Obama signaling again that he’s with the bankers.

Reply ↓ Linda May 4, 2017 at 10:54 am Washington (CNN) Former US President Barack Obama is wading into the closely watched French presidential election to endorse Emmanuel Macron, the centrist politician widely backed by the establishment in his run against far-right leader Marine Le Pen. “I have admired the campaign that Emmanuel Macron has run,” Obama says in a video, which Macron shared Thursday. “He has stood up for liberal values, he put forward a vision for the important role that France plays in Europe and around the world. And he is committed to a better future for the French people. He appeals to people’s hopes and not their fears.” … “Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward.” Reply ↓ DJG May 4, 2017 at 12:38 pm Linda: Obama has his moment of “Lafayette, we are here,” and some of those darn Frenchies aren’t buying it.

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 4, 2017 at 12:39 pm Avocado trouble (not the interior decorating kind; the fruit): Avocado prices have spiked to a record high, an average of $1.25 a pop, according to theHass Avocado Board. As recently as January, the average selling price was just 89 cents, and in February, it hit a low of 77 cents. The reason is a sharp rise in demand for the creamy fruit. U.S. consumption grew to 7 pounds a head in 2014, the last year for which data is available, from 1.1 pounds in 1989. The U.S. imports most of its avocados from Mexico, followed by Chile. California produced $328 million worth of the fruit in 2014, producing 164,000 tons, or 83% of total U.S. volume. The fruit is also grown in Florida and Hawaii. http://www.marketwatch.com/story/blame-brooklyn-blame-hipsters-avocado-prices-are-out-of-control-2017-05-04 Found some avocados on sale for $0.99 yesterday.

Reply ↓ marym May 4, 2017 at 12:42 pm Not necessarily At first glance, it might appear that the community rating waivers allowed under this amendment would only allow insurers to charge premiums based on health status to people with a recent gap in coverage. Even that approach would significantly weaken community rating since coverage gaps are common, including for people with pre-existing conditions. In fact, however, the framework created by the waiver would allow states to effectively eliminate community rating protections for all people seeking individual market coverage, including people who had maintained continuous coverage. In brief, healthy people would have a strong incentive to “opt out” of the community-rated pool and instead pay a premium based on health status. With healthy enrollees opting out of the community-rated pool, community-rated premiums would need to be extremely high, forcing sicker individuals—including those with continuous coverage—to choose between paying the extremely high community-rated premium or being underwritten themselves. Either way, people with serious health conditions would face prohibitively high premiums. As a result, community rating would be eviscerated—and with it any meaningful guarantee that seriously ill people can access coverage Reply ↓ marym May 4, 2017 at 12:48 pm Adding: GOP’s Obamacare replacement bill would protect just 5 percent of people with pre-existing conditions: Analysis •The Republican bill would potentially allow insurers to charge sick people higher premiums. •To offset those costs, the bill also allocates funding for financial aid for sicker people. •High-risk pools in states before Obamacare tended not to cover enough people. The Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare does not allocate nearly enough money to protect people with pre-existing health conditions from potentially higher insurance premiums, an analysis finds.

I think a better argument is to say, “Look, we’re going to help prepare these areas for diversification, so they can succeed economically.” Then boost wages through the EITC. Give that money, with or without work. The key, I believe, is that everyone gets or is given the same amount of money.

Reply ↓ John Morrison May 4, 2017 at 2:26 pm “One could easily make the case that he not only killed off hope for change, but that he meant to — that the whole thing was deliberate from the start and that he meant to magnetize any hope left in the bruised and abused population, and suck it into the vortex forever, leaving everyone despondent and without hope.” From the Caitlin Johnstone article. That’s a variation on my own views about the two leading candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination of 2008. I questioned from the start why Obana and Clinton were leading before a single primary or caucus was held. My first theory: the establishment was pushing them hard, setting them up for the Fall — at which point they would crash and burn. (Clinton was a woman, subject to the Clinton rules. Obama was a black man, with the worst post-9/11 name one could have.) But the economy fell through. My second idea was that if some random lefty Democrat were nominated and actually won, certain persons from the Bush Administration and the mainstream establishment media would wind up in prison or dead. That could not be allowed to happen. And also, as the author put it, have them work hard, give money they couldn’t afford, and work themselves to death to oust the Republicans and put Obama in office — and then betray them. Recall the two “Bad at losing” articles, and one article (linked by the first “Bad at losing” article) questioning why Obama kept from using his huge mailing list and base to push progressive policies.

In contrast, people shouldn’t become wealthy by preying on their fellow citizens and driving them into destitution and debt bondage, but that’s precisely what is happening in many industries today. Our society rewards the worst sort of behavior, and as we observed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, protects and further empowers white collar criminals for destroying the global economy. https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2017/05/04/student-loans-and-healthcare-two-issues-that-will-define-american-politics-going-forward/#more-44193 Now, everyone please take out the kleenex for poor misunderstood Stevie. Super-rich private equity stars rue ‘lousy’ reputation, say they are misunderstood Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive and co-founder of the Blackstone Group, touted the fact that companies owned by his private equity business employed about 600,000 people and had grown 50 percent faster, on average, than the S&P 500 Index. “The idea that you can do all that and have great success and be perceived at best in a marginal way in terms of contribution to society, you’ve got to really wonder who’s doing the PR,” Schwarzman said during a panel discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton hotel. “People mistake us for financial people. I don’t know exactly why,” said Schwarzman – worth some $12 billion, according to Forbes – drawing a distinction between private equity investors which own businesses and mere financiers. “If you had 600,000 employees, you might be a company. A responsible company. And that’s what we are.” http://www.reuters.com/article/us-milken-conference-privateequity-idUSKBN17Y2MT Financial “people” or did he mean plunderer? ‘Government Sachs’ Thrives at Milken as Billionaires Talk Trump Mike Milken looks to Schwarzman for guidance on tax policy “Ah, Government Sachs!” That’s the quip David Solomon encountered at the Milken Institute Global Conference this week, when another attendee realized he was speaking with the co-president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Investors, government officials and entertainment moguls convened at the storied hotel this week for the event, now in its 20th year. While ringmaster Mike Milken packs the schedule with panel sessions, many attendees also flock to meetings in private suites upstairs and evening cocktail parties at mansions in the hills of Los Angeles. “This is like a mini World Economic Forum — like a mini Davos,” former Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday, hours before President George W.

Reply ↓ Oregoncharles May 4, 2017 at 3:23 pm “The six Brexit traps that will defeat Theresa May Yanis Varoufakis, Guardian” Yanis has his own suggestion, which might work (I didn’t quite follow his logic), but the implication of his experience is that May’s best bet is to make threats. Probably the biggest one is sending back all the EU immigrants. Not nice, not a good solution, but a real threat. I suspect there are others that I don’t know about. If the other side is going to not really negotiate, which is what Yanis is saying, then the logical response is to throw whatever bombs you have. That means both sides cutting off their noses to spite their faces, but it’s the only response they leave an opponent with. Greece was too weak for that option, but Britain is not. Let’s hope self-interest eventually prevails. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles May 4, 2017 at 3:46 pm then I read the Portes article next to it (they reverberate – nice choices); from the conclusion: “But there is absolutely nothing to stop the UK from saying, today, that it is prepared to accept a comprehensive deal, as proposed by the EU-27, that would guarantee all rights – except, that is, the fact that the UK government is neither ready nor willing to make good on its promises.” First, the caveat: I think he just said they had, certainly by calling for it. And I didn’t hear anywhere else that anything so concrete had been proposed. (After reading Yanis, I’d be checking the fine print very carefully.) But now I see why Britain might be holding out: it’s one of their few points of leverage. Reply ↓ Anonymous2 May 4, 2017 at 5:40 pm The problem is the UK needs these people from other EU member states for example to work in its hospitals and universities. Yes the UK could throw them out but the effect on the working of the UK would be very noticeable – some hospitals are 20% staffed by EU nurses. It would also of course make the UK a pariah in the eyes of many in Europe and discourage many from ever considering moving there. There has already been a dramatic fall in the number of nurses applying for jobs in the UK. Part of the problem is that the UK, with an aging population and below replacement rate level of births, needs immigrants to arrive to maintain the numbers in the workforce. They could look for them from elsewhere than the EU but that brings other sorts of problems as they may come from other cultures that do not make them as satisfactory as recruits. The UK wants to reduce immigration but it may have already achieved that too well by sending the message that foreigners are not welcome.

Alliance Data deals in private label credit cards, rewards programs, and transaction-based marketing solutions. After the stock peaked in 2015, it tumbled down 43 percent and fell as low as $177 from its $312 highs in the February of last year. But the "Mad Money" host noticed the company making a turnaround, re-positioning itself as more of a data-driven marketing play and cutting costs across the board. "While you might think a business that relies on retailers would be in trouble here, the company has had a lot of success expanding into all sorts of digital channels, and that's where the consumers are spending their money these days," Cramer said. And for the first time in over a year, Cramer feels like the company has finally gotten its act together, making moves to buy back large chunks of stock and placing itself squarely in the data and analytics space. "I think this widely misunderstood stock could have a lot more, not a little, but a lot more upside," Cramer said. Getty Images People stand in line as they wait to get into the JobNewsUSA job fair at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida. When the Federal Reserve does not waver on its two slated interest rate hikes and the market holds its breath ahead of Friday's jobs report, Cramer said it sets off a series of events that investors need to understand. "It all does start with commodities, which were weak across the board. Copper's teetering, aluminum's headed down, iron's– oh, man, get out of the way, and of course, oil's simply crashing, down 5 percent today, the worst day in months" the "Mad Money" host said. All of these changes signal a rotation into stocks that people consider safe during a market decline, like consumer packaged goods, Cramer said. At the same time, rates and bank stocks are climbing thanks to the Fed standing firm on its two-hike agenda, so Cramer turned to the latest market moves to make sense of the noise. Scott Olson | Getty Images Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and chairman of SolarCity, attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 8, 2015 in Sun Valley, Idaho. After Tesla's stock sank over $15 on Thursday following its earnings report, Cramer looked into the company to try and understand its high-flown forecasts. "If you're an analyst, I think the only way to handle an Elon Musk conference call is to take some mind altering drugs so you can really tune in and turn on the whole psychedelic story," he said of Tesla's CEO. While Cramer admires Musk's confidence, he sympathized with those who try to make mathematical sense of his ultra-positive musings. Cramer also sat down with Jeff Lawson, the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Twilio, for his take on the stock's drop after Uber, one of its biggest clients, cut back its spending with Twilio. The company helps apps manage their communications with customers using the cloud, and almost every app that sends texts, like Uber and Airbnb, are clients of Twilio's. "Because of the size of the spend and how important of a customer they are, when we got an inkling that they might change how they're thinking about communications spend, we wanted to be transparent and get that out in front of investors. But we do believe they will continue to be a very important customer of Twilio's," Lawson explained on Thursday. And, although Uber threw a wrench in the company's stock, Lawson touted the company's otherwise successful quarter and said he feels there will be more good news ahead for Twilio. "We're continuing to invest. We have a leadership position in a very large market, and we feel great about our position, about our product, about our customers. And so we continue to invest forward," he told Cramer. Heidi Petty | CNBC Brian Krzanich Finally, Cramer spoke with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich to hear more about how the company is evolving. Krzanich may have sounded downbeat on PCs when the company released earnings, but the CEO is still standing by his company's core business. "This is the best time, I think, in history to go out and buy a PC or be in the PC business because the innovation is tremendous," Krzanich told Cramer on Thursday. The CEO admitted that his bearishness on the PC business came about because customers are buying fewer PCs, but he remained enthusiastic about Intel's wide reach in the market. "There are other places that people are spending their dollars, so I can't come in to you and say, 'This is a revenue growth engine,'" Krzanich said. "But we've been able to grow profitability and we've been driving innovation with our partners, Microsoft, HP, Dell, Lenovo." In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Chemours: "Well, we're very worried about all commodity and all commodity chemicals and I've got to tell you, you've had a really good run in CC. I would ring the register on half of it right now. Take it out, because commodity chemicals are not doing well right now." Red Hat: "The sales were fabulous. The deals were great. [CEO James] Whitehurst continues to do it in the cloud. I want you to stay along." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory A friend and associate of Ret. Lt. Gen Michael Flynn worked on two major projects for the former national security advisor and one of them might result in him being called into testifying at a hearing. According to a Washington Post investigative report, Jon Iadonisi used one of his companies to help Flynn with an investigation on behalf of a Turkish government ally. At the same time, Iadonisi was doing work for the Trump campaign. According to a source familiar with the arrangement, he was tasked with managing a key social media project. Trump’s FEC reports reveal he paid $200,000 on Dec. 5 to Colt Ventures, a Dallas venture-capital firm that listed Iadonisi’s company VizSense as a client after The Post called to inquire. Colt Ventures was founded by Darren Blanton, who met frequently with Steve Bannon while Bannon was working for the Trump campaign. However, a White House official claimed that Bannon is “not aware of any of these companies or contracts.” Yet, a person familiar with the matter said that Colt Ventures personally provided Bannon with a report that detailed the work they’d done for the campaign. Trump campaign ED Michael Glassner said that Colt Ventures was paid for a social media project that involved “millennial engagement” through video content in the final month of the campaign. However, the payment went to the venture capital firm and not to VizSense for the digital work. Also, VizSense isn’t located in Dallas where Cold Ventures is, They office out of an Alexandria, VA office suite that was once shared by the Flynn Intel Group. It’s typical for political consultants and vendors to hire people to manage specific projects, but it is illegal for a campaign to avoid disclosure by paying a company that has nothing to do with the recipient of the cash, the FEC’s former general counsel and head of enforcement told The Post. “A venture-capital company is certainly a strange entity for a campaign to be making an expenditure to, and I would want to look further to assess whether it was it an appropriate recipient,” campaign-finance lawyer Daniel Petalas explained. Iadonisi’s online biography says that he worked with the CIA as a Navy SEAL and he has close ties to Flynn, whom he served with in Iraq. Flynn even endorsed Iadonisi’s work on LinkedIn as “one of the best problem solvers I have ever worked with” and “an incredible asset for any organization.” VizSense’s Twitter account promoted Flynn in December, saying that he would “construct an NSC that is custom build for what America needs to be first!” Flynn is being investigated by the Defense Department for payments he scored from Inovo, a Netherlands-based company owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-American businessman who has close ties to top officials in Turkey. He was tasked by Alptekin to investigate Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Islamic cleric who fled Turkey after an allegedly failed coup attempt. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited back to Turkey. That work was reportedly done by Tim Newberry who served as a submarine officer with Iadonisi, according to his LinkedIn page. Newberry and Iadonisi founded VizSense together in 2015 and he listed Flynn’s company as an employer for a short time. Newberry was also the chief executive of White Canvas Group, which Flynn and Iadonisi’s companies rented office space from in Virginia.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman New Ideas, Partnerships Forged for Building a Skilled African Workforce MAY 2, 2017, NAIROBI –Around 250 individuals brainstormed how to support Sub-Saharan Africa as it competes globally in applied sciences, engineering and technology fields. They represented 19 African nations as well as China, Malaysia, Korea, Brazil, India, and Germany. Leading international and African technology companies were also present. The fourth Forum, organized by the Africa-led Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET), took place in Nairobi on April 5 to 7, 2017. It tackled issues in technical and vocational training up to higher education in these fields. The Forum provided valuable input to the 19 attending African Ministries on customizing their own skill development plans. Global innovations in technical vocational education and training, as well as national skills qualification systems adapted by other countries were also shared.  Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta, in a speech delivered on his behalf by Deputy President William Ruto, appealed to African countries to pay greater attention to technical and vocational training if the continent is to speed up its industrialization and economic growth. “PASET is the beginning of an answer,” President Kenyatta said. “It sharpens our skills in the applied sciences, in engineering and in technology — especially among graduates of our technical and vocational training institutions, and of our universities. Kenya is glad to be one of the beneficiaries of PASET.” Education ministers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria attended the event. The government of Kenya and other African countries have jointly committed $10 million towards one of PASET’s key initiatives, the Regional Scholarship and Innovation Fund. The Kenyan government is also participating in PASET’s Regional Centres for Excellence in Skills Development financed by the World Bank. Further, it has joined the Bank-funded Africa Centres of Excellence project, which focuses on postgraduate education and research. “This is about the very future of technical and scientific skills for Africa and therefore the future of Africa itself in this fast-paced century,” said Keith Hansen, the World Bank Group’s Vice President for Human Development, as he thanked the Kenyan government for co- hosting the Fourth Regional Forum by the Africa-led Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET). Hansen added that PASET reflected two key priorities for the World Bank Group: its commitment to Africa and a commitment to investing in people. “It’s great to see partners and governments converge around PASET, because there is no smarter shortcut to a bright future than education when it is high quality and relevant,” Hansen said. It was also an opportunity for African institutions and tech companies to display their homegrown innovations and network with global peers. The exhibitors showcasing their work at the forum included the Moringa School, University of Nairobi, Devotra BV, Huawei Southern Africa, Centurion Systems, Andela, and Gearbox. Their exhibits included a wide variety of mechanical and electrical machines, such as plasma and laser cutters, and a 3D printer. One of the projects was a phototherapy unit to treat newborn Jaundice with safe UV light, created by University of Nairobi students and faculty to bridge the gap in supply of medical devices in local hospitals. “Being in a place like this is really important for guys like us as we get to share ideas on issues that affect Africa as a continent, not just this country. Through such forums, we have the opportunity to find solutions from different people, and see if their solutions can fit our needs and solve problems that many others have faced before,” Derrick Mugasia, who works at University of Nairobi’s FabLab, said. International firms at the forum included Microsoft, Phillips, Intel, and State Grid China, the world’s largest power company among others. These firms, along with African companies shared their own experiences with innovations in teaching of the sciences and engineering with the participants, making greater use of technology, project-based learning and various interactive approaches in teaching. “This is a good time to call upon the private sector to expand support to skills-building in Africa, with both resources and technology,” said World Bank Education Practice Manager Sajitha Bashir, who is also a board member of PASET. “I think it signals a readiness to work together to achieve the common goal of human capital development in Africa. Let us look for synergies and expand this interaction.” China, India, Brazil and South Korea have been closely involved with PASET since its 2013 launch by sharing knowledge and technical assistance, such as by organizing exchange visits for their African counterparts. For more details or to see photos from the event, contact Saori Imaizumi. Select presentations from the forum will be posted here soon.

Asus' ROG Maximus IX Extreme is fit for a king by Eric Frederiksen  10:30 AM on May 4, 2017 Asus' latest high-end motherboard for liquid cooling fans, the ROG Maximus IX Extreme, has arrived and is available for purchase. Brace yourselves and your wallets, for this is a pricey one—though not without some good reasons. The Maximus IX Extreme will set you back a cool $630. If you're still conscious after that sticker shock, read on. This E-ATX board is fully decked-out, but what really sets it apart from similar offerings is the built-in liquid cooling waterblock. To our knowledge, the full-coverage block covering the CPU socket and all the VRMs makes the Extreme the first of its kind. Asus teamed up with Bitspower to develop the waterblock, which packs flow-rate, water-leak, and temperature sensors. The company says the leak-detection sensor is capable of turning the system off in the event of a leak or spill. There's even an M.2 heatsink that can attach to the waterblock, too. Finally, for the blinkenlights fans, the block comes with RGB LED lighting compatible with Asus' Aura Sync. All those cooling niceties wouldn't be worth much if the board didn't have plenty of spots for you to plug all your hardware into, though. On the networking side, the mobo comes with an Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet port and a 2x2 MU-MIMO 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter. A USB 3.1 Type-A port and a Type-C connector with Thunderbolt 3 support are accompanied by two USB 3.0 and four USB 2.0 ports. There's also a header for a pair of front-panel USB 3.1 ports. The standard loadout of audio jacks is present, all color-coded with LEDs. The audio outputs are fed by a Realtek S1220 codec and an ESS DAC for extra audio crispness. On the board itself, you'll find three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots with SLI support, along with eight SATA ports and two M.2 PCIe x4 slots. If you're going full-bore with cooling, you'll find eight radiator fan headers and a host of watercooling sensor headers. For the overclocking-crazy, there's an external BCLK generator and support for RAM speeds up to 4133 MT/s. Finally, should things go a little awry during overclocking, the board includes multiple mode-setting switches and onboard buttons to help with the process of pulling every last MHz from your gear. This is an expensive board, but we're hardly surprised considering the extras that come along for the ride. The ROG Maximus IX Extreme is going for $630 over on Newegg right now.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. For the first time, the tech giant released a breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that most of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more manufacturing jobs Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Running Full Speed Ahead View All Posts Samsung’s (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) exploding Galaxy Note 7 is almost a distant memory. After the company finally revealed two different suppliers were the source of the problem, Samsung quietly moved on. Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr On March 29, the company announced the Galaxy S8 and S8+, a release that could prove problematic for Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the last quarter, Apple benefited from a lack of competition for its iPhone 7. Apple iPhone 8 to Replace iPhone 7 In the second quarter, Apple reported revenue of $52.9 billion, plus slowing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales. In the quarters ahead, Samsung’s S8+ may eat further into Apple’s sales. The Korean smartphone giant threw everything at the Note 7 successor. The MSM 8998 Octa Core processor that powers the Galaxy device is made by Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). The screen is a massive 6.2 inches, compared to just 5.5 inches with the iPhone 7 Plus. It has 64 GB of standard storage, double that of Apple’s device. Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm may set the future iPhone 8 back. Qualcomm supplies a CPU that integrates with the 3G/4G/5G modem. Conversely, iPhone ARM processors are separate from the modem. Should it win or settle, Apple may cut its costs but the result may set the next iPhone at a technological disadvantage. SoC chips use less space and consume less power. These are two traits that the Galaxy may have over the next iPhone. The timing of Apple’s iPhone 8 is especially important. It marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone release. Some sites speculate Apple will release the iPhone 8 in September 2017 or later. Alternatively, the company may release the 7S and 7S Plus first, then launch a curved, all-screen iPhone later. Samsung on the Offensive Samsung needs to regain its customers’ trust. Abandoning the Note branding and folding it with the Galaxy S series may prove a good move by management. The advertising message is simpler. More importantly, consumers will not associate the exploding Note 7 with the Samsung name. Despite strong iPhone 7 sales today, Apple’s next phone is at least four months behind that of Samsung’s latest release date. Apple has an advantage over Samsung on the software side. The Galaxy’s voice assistant, Bixby, is behind that of AAPL’s Siri. Some consumers consider Samsung’s TouchWiz bloatware. But Apple keeps its operating system and the user interface uncluttered. AAPL Stock’s Growth Beyond Phones Apple’s submission to test self-driving cars gives investors a clue on its growth ambitions beyond smartphones. Already, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) bought Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) to gain the know-how in autonomous driving. BlackBerry Ltd. (NASDAQ:BBRY) committed to investing $100 million in developing software for self-driving cars, creating 650 new jobs. It is only natural that Apple follows this trend. Apple is in the early innings of growing its business in the automotive market.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Trump arrive at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa on Feb. 6, 2017. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) By Matea Gold By Matea Gold May 4 at 5:47 PM Follow @mateagold Jon Iadonisi, a friend and business associate of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, had two under-the-radar projects underway in the fall of 2016. One of his companies was helping Flynn with an investigative effort for an ally of the Turkish government — details of which Flynn revealed only after he was forced to step down from his White House post. At the same time, Iadonisi was also doing work for the Trump campaign, although his role was not publicly reported, according to people familiar with his involvement. The project Iadonisi was engaged in for Trump’s campaign focused on social media, according to a person with knowledge of the arrangement. What that work consisted of — and why his company was not disclosed as a vendor in campaign finance reports — remains a mystery. The Trump campaign did not report any payments to Iadonisi or his firms. However, Federal Election Commission reports show that the Trump campaign paid $200,000 on Dec. 5 for “data management services” to Colt Ventures, a Dallas-based venture-capital firm that is an investor in VizSense, a social-media company co-founded by Iadonisi. (Reuters) The Washington Post made repeated inquiries to Iadonisi and other VizSense officials, but none responded to requests for comment. [The fall of Michael Flynn: A timeline] Michael Glassner, executive director of the Trump campaign committee, said invoices show Colt Ventures was paid for a ­social-media project that involved video-content creation and “millennial engagement” in the campaign’s final month. He declined to comment on why the payment went to a venture-capital firm and whether campaign officials were aware of the firm’s connection to VizSense and Iadonisi. It is common for political vendors to hire subcontractors whose work is not publicly reported. However, campaign committees cannot seek to avoid disclosure by paying an entity that does not have a legitimate relationship with the ultimate recipient, said Washington campaign-finance lawyer Daniel Petalas, who served as the FEC’s acting general counsel and head of enforcement. “A venture-capital company is certainly a strange entity for a campaign to be making an expenditure to, and I would want to look further to assess whether it was it an appropriate recipient,” he said. Colt Ventures was founded by Darren Blanton, a Dallas investor who later served as an adviser to Trump’s transition. Blanton met frequently with Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon at Trump Tower during the campaign, according to people who saw him there. Colt also sent a report to Bannon about work done for the campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is unclear who approved the contract with Colt Ventures. Bannon declined to comment, but a White House official said Bannon is “not aware of any of these companies or contracts.” Blanton did not respond to requests for comment. However, shortly after the The Post first contacted him, Colt Ventures updated an online list of companies that make up its investment portfolio and added VizSense. VizSense, based in Plano, Tex., promises on its website to “weaponize your brand’s influence” through “military-grade influencer marketing and intelligence services.” Iadonisi, a former Navy SEAL, started the company in 2015 with Tim Newberry, a nuclear engineer who served as a submarine officer. It was spun out of the duo’s consulting firm, White Canvas Group, which they once described as a “a privatized DARPA,” a reference to the Pentagon’s research arm. White Canvas has received numerous Pentagon contracts, including nearly $150,000 last year from the Navy for “deep and dark web capability and gap analysis,” according to contracting records. In a 2015 interview with the Dallas Morning News, Iadonisi said VizSense helps clients track online video performance and identify which social-media users drive the most traffic. He said he witnessed the power of viral media firsthand while serving in Iraq. “We know of a lot of bad guys who were killing my friends, and they were really good at making viral videos,” Iadonisi said. “These videos catalyze, and now we can look at data.” Iadonisi, who worked with the CIA as a Navy SEAL, according to an online biography, has close ties to Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general with whom he served in Iraq. His LinkedIn page features an endorsement from Flynn, who called Iadonisi “one of the best problem solvers I have ever worked with” and “an incredible asset for any organization.” In late December, the official VizSense account tweeted praise of Flynn, writing that he “is going to construct an NSC that is custom built for what America needs to be first!@DanScavino @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump.” Flynn declined to comment through his attorney. But a person with knowledge of their relationship said Flynn has no stake in Iadonisi’s companies and received no financial benefit from any of Iadonisi’s campaign work. Until recently, Iadonisi and Flynn’s firms shared an office suite in Alexandria, Va. Flynn’s now-closed consultancy, Flynn Intel Group, rented space from White Canvas Group, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. And last fall, Flynn tapped White Canvas Group to help him investigate Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, Justice Department documents show. [Top Pentagon watchdog launches investigation into money that Michael Flynn received from foreign groups] The research was financed by a company owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish American businessman close to top officials in Turkey, the documents show. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accuses Gulen for fomenting a coup attempt last summer and wants him extradited from the United States. Inovo, a Netherlands-based company owned by Alptekin, paid Flynn Intel Group $530,000 to activate an “investigative laboratory” made up of former top security and intelligence officials to research Gulen, according to documents Flynn filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Flynn, in turn, paid White Canvas Group $15,000 for “public open source research,” according to disclosures. In its contract with Inovo, Flynn Intel Group said the Gulen investigation would be done by “its most senior principals,” including “the head of Flynn Intel Group’s Special Operations Cyber Force.” At the time, that role appeared to be filled by Newberry, Iadonisi’s partner and the chief executive of White Canvas Group. In August 2016, the same month the Inovo contract was signed, Newberry temporarily took on an additional post: chief executive of FIG Cyber, a unit of Flynn Intel Group, according to his LinkedIn profile. He held the title until November, when the Inovo contract ended. Newberry did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn stepped down as national security adviser in February after misleading administration officials about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. He retroactively registered as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests in March in disclosures to the Justice Department. The Defense Department’s inspector general is investigating payments Flynn received from Inovo and other foreign groups. Defense Department guidelines require former officers to obtain permission before working for foreign governments.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, May 5, 2017 FRANKFURT - Tesla Inc said it is seeking to resolve outstanding issues with legacy customers of its Grohmann engineering unit after a takeover by the Silicon Valley-based carmaker resulted in a shift in management priorities toward Tesla projects. Before being bought by Tesla in November, Grohmann helped clients build highly automated and efficient factories, including battery assembly lines for electric cars. Grohmann's clients included rival automakers BMW, Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> and Mercedes owner Daimler AG, before Tesla boss Elon Musk ordered the company's main management resources to be devoted toward pushing expansion of Tesla's production facilities. "We have been in contact with every client for weeks on this issue and are on the way to finding individual solutions with each of them," Tesla said in a statement on Thursday. The issue of how to deal with Grohmann's existing clients resulted in the departure of Klaus Grohmann, who was ousted at the end of March, only months after selling his company to Tesla. The electric carmaker is counting on Grohmann Engineering's automation and engineering expertise to help it ramp up production to 500,000 cars per year by 2018 through the design of ultra efficient factories. Founder Klaus Grohmann disagreed with Musk's demands to focus management attention on Tesla projects to the detriment of Grohmann Engineering's legacy clients, which included parts maker Bosch Corp, chip maker Intel Corp, and pharmaceutical firms Abbott Laboratories and Roche Holding AG in addition to the German carmakers. "We believe that Grohmann will honor its contractual obligations toward us in future," BMW said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it had not been formally notified about any changes to the contractual arrangements. Daimler and Volkswagen declined to comment.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Sen. Feinstein: No evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia ‘at this time’ posted at 4:01 pm on May 4, 2017 by John Sexton Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES Asked Wednesday whether or not she had seen any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Senator Dianne Feinstein said she hadn’t. “I know that you and some of your colleagues from the Senate Intelligence Committee drove over to Langley, Virginia yesterday to CIA headquarters and you were briefed,” CNN host Wolf Blitzer said. He continued, “You don’t have to provide us with any classified information, Senator, but do you believe, do you have evidence that there was in fact collusion between Trump associates and Russia during the campaign?” “Not at this time,” Feinstein replied. Here’s a video of the exchange clipped by the Free Beacon: It’s possible Feinstein knows something that she’s not prepared to share yet, i.e. maybe the proof is classified and she can’t talk about it. Still, it’s worth noting that Democrats have been suggesting for months now that an investigation will reveal evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia but for all that talk, so far there is no proof. Here’s a brief chronology: March 3 – Sen. Coons says he believes the FBI has transcripts (which he hasn’t seen) which could provide evidence of collusion. March 6 – Sen. Coons clarifies “I don’t have and I don’t know of any conclusive proof one way or the other.” He adds, “I have no hard evidence of collusion.” March 9 – Buzzfeed reports Democrats on the Intel committee are worried the “collusion” probe isn’t going to pay off. “I don’t think the conclusions are going to meet people’s expectations,” one unnamed source tells Buzzfeed. March 22 – Speaking of collusion, Rep. Adam Schiff tells MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, “There is more than circumstantial evidence now.” April 2 –  Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper if there is “definitive evidence” of collusion, Rep. Adam Schiff says, “I don’t think we can say anything definitively at this point.” Add Sen. Feinstein’s comments yesterday to that list and you have two months of Democrats hinting but not offering any proof. And that’s just the elected politicians. Progressive media people like MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow have been much less restrained. From the Intercept: The Intercept conducted a quantitative study of all 28 TRMS episodes in the six-week period between February 20 and March 31. Russia-focused segments accounted for 53 percent of these broadcasts. That figure is conservative, excluding segments where Russia was discussed, but was not the overarching topic. Here’s what that sounds like: Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES Tags: adam schiff, Chris Coons, collusion, Dianne Feinstein, Russia, Trump campaign Related Posts: Bias: No, Tillerson didn’t abandon human rights as a core US foreign-policy value Trump to North Korea: Feel the power of our fully operational THAAD Hillary: I take absolute personal responsibility for losing the election, and also it was Comey’s fault Breaking on Hot Air Glenn Beck to Stephen Colbert: You have become me Video: Venezuelan armored vehicle plows into crowd of protesters Poll: Plurality of Democrats say campuses should not allow speakers whose words are thought “hateful” or “offensive” by some Blowback   Rep.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman D&H Fiscal Year 2018 to Include $115M in SMB Credit, Plus New Resources, Improved Services, & Added Sales Personnel /EINPresswire.com/ — HARRISBURG, PA–(Marketwired – May 04, 2017) – D&H Distributing, the leading North American computer products and consumer electronics distributor, announces it is planning a series of new investments and resources for its Fiscal Year 2018, which began as of May 1, 2017, with many of these initiatives extending into the future. Major channel investments will include $115 million in extended credit lines focused on SMB resellers, with the intention to jump-start business for emerging VARs, and fuel growth for more established resellers; plus increased channel breadth for vendors. The distributor will also develop new internal investments in FY 2018, such as new sales personnel, and team events that enhance D&H’s work-life balance for co-owners. „D&H strives to be an ideal distribution partner for our customers across a range of markets. We will continue to add resources, putting a stake in the ground and rolling out a plan to devote more support to the greater ecosystem of channel players that serve small businesses,” said Dan Schwab, co-president at D&H Distributing. „Our team is also vested in creating enhancements and customizations to our systems and logistics to make our transaction processes faster and more efficient for our partners,” he added. „We apply such efficiencies to our internal processes as well, creating an environment that’s not only productive and creative, but that stresses the well-being of our co-owner employees, to insure a healthy and constructive atmosphere.” D&H’s new investments for FY 2018 and beyond include: $115 million in extended credit: In the largest credit promotion D&H has ever conducted, the distributor will roll-out increases for more than 4,000 SMB VARs, as part of D&H’s Business Assurance program. The initiative will augment individual credit lines for many accounts by 50 to 60 percent — with some increasing as much as 100% for select customers in good standing. The effort will target a broad range of D&H resellers, to increase buying power and extend support for a broad portfolio of SMB VARs. Increase Customer Breadth: D&H will focus on growing customer breadth for its vendors across-the-board. While channel breadth is declining for many manufacturers, D&H intends to increase support and funding for it SMB-focused manufacturer partners to generate additional sales. New Canadian Distribution Center: D&H is opening a major new warehouse facility in Vancouver, British Columbia, in addition to its headquarters location in Brampton, Ontario. The new center is strategically located to speed delivery and expand D&H’s logistical services within the western end of the country. The unveiling of this new distribution center coincides with D&H Canada’s 10th anniversary. Enhanced service model/training venues: D&H will continue to consult, train, educate, and enable its partners on new trends, sales strategies, and technologies, creating opportunities for customers to expand their core competencies. Fiscal Year 2018 will include additional training venues (including D&H’s new trade event in the Chicago area this fall) and vendor-based educational content, exploring virtual, online, and event-based offerings. Materials will support vertical markets such as education and healthcare, in addition to product launches from major vendor partners. Added sales personnel: D&H has plans to increase its sales staff dramatically, to accommodate new growth and maintain its ongoing „high-touch” service model. Improved logistics: D&H is enhancing its capabilities in logistics, inventory management, forecasting, and ecommerce support in order to provide optimal services in a demanding marketplace. Enhanced „work/life balance”: As a private, family-owned company celebrating its 99th anniversary, D&H maintains an extraordinary focus on work/life balance, offering a long list of internal events and activities that strengthen D&H’s team and engender a family atmosphere. Activities include „softball slams,” family picnics and movie nights, and „D&H Cares” co-owner charity events. In addition, multiple fun co-owner events are planned each month to celebrate D&H’s „Centennial Countdown” year. „Just as we’ve grown business with partners such as Cisco, HP, Lenovo, Acer, Microsoft, Intel, and Dell in the past years, D&H is laser-focused on adding incremental revenue for dozens of key channel vendors. The goal is to generate increased opportunities for our resellers, and we intend to double-down on those investments. We’re looking to add dozens of strategic, complementary manufacturers to expand our customers’ revenues and breadth of offering,” said Michael Schwab, co-president at D&H. „The goal is to bring more resellers into the fold and provide ample resources to help them grow profits, building on some of the impactful models we leveraged in the past. While some distributors carry nearly every vendor as part of their strategy, we prefer to have a more focused line card,” Michael Schwab added. „This allows us to add greater value and help our vendors achieve wider market penetration with the customers we serve. We align with these vendors to help our partners succeed in both their consumer and business initiatives.” D&H resellers can contact their representatives at (800) 340-1001 or visit www.dandh.com.

The company says it will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Michael Liedtke and Christopher S. Rugaber SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the United States economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1-billion (all figures US) fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." The Wednesday report on jobs is its fourth update on its U.S. employment, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment centre is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven).
