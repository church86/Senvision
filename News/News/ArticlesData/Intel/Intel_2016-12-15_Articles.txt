MGTI, -1.35% In a judicial filing on Tuesday, December 13, 2016, with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York (the "Court"), MGT Capital requested that the Court issue a preliminary injunction (i) enjoining Intel from selling, trading, assigning, leasing or otherwise transferring any alleged rights, in whole or in part, relating to any marks, names, trade names, or entities containing the word "McAfee" until the resolution of the previously filed request for a Declaratory Judgment, and (ii) granting such further relief in Plaintiffs' favor as may be deemed just, equitable, and proper. As previously announced by Intel Corporation on September 7, 2016, Intel reached a definitive agreement to sell its Intel Security business (formerly called McAfee Security) to a new company jointly owned by Intel and TPG, a leading global alternative asset firm.  The new business has proposed to be named McAfee, and is valued at $4.2 billion. Prior to Intel's announcement, on September 2, 2016, MGT and its Executive Chairman and CEO John McAfee filed a lawsuit seeking a judgment that the Company's use of "John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc." does not infringe upon any trademark rights of Intel Corporation or breach any agreement between the parties. Rather than wait until properly adjudicated, Intel has proceeded to enter into a transaction that appears to convey property rights it may not even own. "It is very clear from the contractual documentation that Intel is, and has been, improperly using my name," stated Mr. McAfee. "It is hard to believe that now they stand to receive billions of dollars for this misappropriation while simultaneously trying to avert fair competition in the market." A copy of the lawsuit as filed by MGT Capital is available at on the MGT website at http://www.mgtci.com/s/intel-docs.pdf. About MGT Capital Investments, Inc. MGT Capital Investments, Inc.

Credit: Intel/IDGNS More like this Intel's new Kaby Lake chips for PC: Here's the company's vision Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Some critics may like to knock PCs as dinosaurs, but laptops and desktops have gotten faster and even smarter. For every blue screen of death, there are technological enhancements driving PCs into the era of virtual reality, 4K video and 5G connectivity. Here are the top 10 PC technology and trends to watch next year. VR PCs on your head Intel/IDGNS An Intel employee demonstrates the company's Project Alloy headset on stage during IDF 2016 in San Francisco on August 16, 2016. VR devices will come in many new shapes and sizes, with some acting essentially as PCs that fit on your head. Dell, Asus, Acer, Lenovo and HP will release mixed reality headsets, which will allow users to interact with 3D objects that pop up as floating images superimposed on a real-life background. The devices will provide a new level of human-computer interaction, making it more fun to create 3D objects, play games, watch movies and have interactive Skype calls. These "holographic computers," as they have been called, will have Intel chips, an integrated GPU and possibly a 3D RealSense camera to identify objects, measure distances, and provide new perspectives on surroundings. Storage prices will go up Martyn Williams A computer with an Intel SSD on display at Computex 2015 in Taipei Prices of SSDs are going up due to shortages, and that could have an impact on the price of laptops, 2-in-1 computers and storage. Dell's XPS 13 with Intel's Kaby Lake chips and a 512GB SSD, for example, is not available right now.  Other laptops with 512GB SSDs are priced unbelievably high. Most PC makers are offering 128GB or 256GB SSDs in PCs by default. Choose storage wisely, as it isn't easy to screw open a superthin 2-in-1 to replace an SSD. Talk to your PC Microsoft A woman uses Microsoft's Cortana voice-activated assistant on Lumia smartphone. The feud between Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana voice-activated assistants could get more interesting next year. Users will be able to shout out Cortana commands to Windows 10 PCs from a longer distance, thanks to a "far-field speech recognition" technology that Intel and Microsoft are working on. Until now, Cortana worked best if a user was close to a PC, but millions of Windows PCs will turn into Amazon Echo competitors with this new feature. Cortana can do a lot more than Amazon Echo, like accessing information from the cloud, chatting with chatbots, checking email and other tasks. AMD ratchets up chip battle with Intel Martyn Williams Intel has been the unchallenged king of PCs for more than a decade, but AMD is fighting back with its new Ryzen PC processor, which will reaches PCs next year. A healthy rivalry will be good news for PC users, some of whom may jump from the Intel to the AMD camp. AMD claims Ryzen is 40 percent faster than its current PC chips, which on paper is impressive. The chips will first hit gaming PCs, and then mainstream laptops and desktops later in 2017. Ryzen will battle Intel's Kaby Lake in early 2017, and the 10-nanometer Cannonlake in late 2017. ARM-based laptops with Windows, again Stephen Lawson The first attempt at ARM PCs, which ran on Windows RT, was an unmitigated disaster, and it left many users skeptical of the idea. But Microsoft hasn't given up, especially as 5G starts to become a reality and cellular connectivity in PCs becomes essential. Microsoft announced that next year PCs will be available with Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which is primarily for smartphones. Super-thin laptops will get integrated modems and a long battery life with the chip. The ARM-based PCs will run Win32 applications that run on regular x86 PCs via emulation. For now, no PC maker has announced ARM-based Windows PCs -- manufacturers  may be cautious in light of the Windows RT fiasco. There are also many challenges. Snapdragon isn't as fast as high-end x86 Intel or AMD chips, and won't support 64-bit applications initially. Also, emulation may limit the ability to exploit hardware acceleration. Bluetooth 5 will take charge Stephen Lawson The Bluetooth logo. Laptops and 2-in-1s will be equipped with the latest Bluetooth 5 wireless specification, which is a longer and faster upgrade to the aging Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 will allow PCs to communicate wirelessly with devices up to 400 meters away in clear line of sight, but a more reasonable range is about 120 meters, according to analysts.  Bluetooth 5 will transfer data at speeds of up to 2Mbps, which is two times faster than its predecessor. Beautiful screens, 4K and HDR Dell Dell's XPS 13 has an edge-to-edge screen. Laptops like the XPS 13 and Lenovo's Yoga 910 have beautiful edge-to-edge screens, a feature that may be included in more laptops next year. Also, 4K screens and HDR (high-dynamic range) technology will make games and movies look stunning. HDR results in more vivid images, and TVs, cameras and monitors supporting the technology are already available. Netflix is also doubling down on HDR. An HDR standards battle is brewing with DolbyVision and HBR3, but GPU makers are supporting both standards. AMD expects DolbyVision to ultimately win. New storage and memory technologies Intel 3D XPoint is the technology behind Optane products. Intel's Optane, a superfast SSD and DRAM replacement that could ultimately unify memory and storage, could cause a radical change in PC architecture. But that won't happen for a few years, and the initial expectations for Optane are modest. The first Optane SSDs will be in enthusiast PCs, and could cost a small fortune. Optane SSDs have been measured as being 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. Over time, Optane could replace DRAM DIMMs, with the added advantage of being able to store data. The SSDs won't be in laptops next year as the technology's uses are still being explored. Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, which Intel co-developed with Micron. SSDs based on Micron's 3D XPoint technology will ship next year under the QuantX brand. More changes for keyboards Lenovo Lenovo's Yoga Book has a virtual keyboard on a touch panel. We saw some interesting changes to keyboards this year. Apple added the Touch Bar, while Lenovo swapped out the hard keyboard for a virtual keyboard on a touch input panel for its Yoga Book. Lenovo wants to bring the virtual keyboard to more Chromebooks and 2-in-1s, partly because of its versatility. The touch input panel can also be used to draw or take notes with a stylus. It's a toss-up: Lenovo believes that those used to typing on mobile devices will adapt to this touch panel keyboard quickly, while hard keyboard diehards will dismiss the idea. Some ports won't go away easily James Niccolai USB Type-C cable on show at CES PC makers may not muster the courage to remove the headphone jack and SD card slots from PCs right away, but USB 2.0 slots could be on their way out. Some PC makers may leave out display and other legacy ports with the emergence of the versatile USB Type-C, which can be used to charge PCs and connect displays, storage devices and other peripherals.

Look for a follow-up story coming Saturday, Dec. 24. We've narrowed the field to 25 candidates for your consideration. As you'll see, they aren't all heroes. Some of them are controversial figures; some were involved in tragic stories; some are longtime leaders and some you may never have heard of. And one is not a person at all. The finalists all have local or regional ties, and at one point or another captivated readers or encapsulated issues that proved to be defining moments for Oregon in 2016. Read about the candidates below (listed in no particular order) to refresh your memories, then make your pick. You may vote once per day until the poll closes at 11:59 p.m. Dec. 20. Note: We have limited voting to one a day per IP address for the entirety of the voting timeline. Robert Borba: Cowboy vigilante Borba just needed some dog food at Walmart, but instead he roped an alleged bike thief while on horseback and came away with viral fame. Borba told The Medford Mail Tribune he "seen this fella trying to get up to speed on a bicycle. I wasn't going to catch him on foot. I just don't run very fast." That's when the rancher and former rodeo cowboy grabbed his horse Long John and gave chase in an Eagle Point parking lot, eventually roping the alleged thief before calling police. National and international news outlets picked up on the story, and it was a novelty for the Eagle Point police as well. "We've never had anyone lassoed and held until we got there," Sgt. Darin May said. "That's a first for me."  Phil Knight: Nike co-founder and philanthropist The Nike magnate stepped down in June as chairman of the company he co-founded in 1964, leaving behind an $85 billion enterprise that Forbes calls the "most valuable sports brand in the world." In October, he and his wife Penny pledged $500 million to the University of Oregon for a new science complex in Eugene, with the aim of accelerating the progression from scientific discovery to "real world impact." The donation is the nation's largest to a public flagship university and brings the couple's total contributions to higher education in Oregon and beyond to more than $2 billion. Juror 4: Oregon standoff trial One of the 12 jurors who acquitted Ammon Bundy and six other defendants on federal conspiracy, weapons and other charges stemming from the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. He's the lone juror who spoke out, explaining the jury's decision. He's also the juror who sent a note to the judge during deliberations, suggesting another juror was biased. His note led U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown to dismiss Juror 11 and replace him with an alternate juror and order deliberations to begin anew. Juror 4 is a business administration student at Marylhurst University. Chloe Eudaly: Political novice who upset Steve Novick on Portland City Council Eudaly, a longtime indie bookstore owner new to local politics, ousted Portland Commissioner Steve Novick in November -- the first loss for a City Council incumbent in 24 years. Sure, her shoe-string campaign rode a wave of anti-Novick sentiment. But Eudaly, the only commissioner on the city's vast east side, emerged as a champion for renters worried Portland's housing boom will force them to leave an increasingly expensive city. Vineet Edupuganti: Teen inventor Edupuganti might be a mere high school senior. But at age 17, the Portland teen's already invented something that could spare many of his fellow humans from serious surgery -- while revolutionizing the diagnosis and monitoring of health conditions deep in the body. His ingestible biodegradable battery earned the highest individual award -- and $100,000 -- at the nation's premier high school science competition this year. The engineering chairman who helped judge the contest called the battery "a truly transforming step." Despite those accolades, Vineet is humble and credits others with helping him excel. The Bernie Bird* He doesn't have a name. He didn't vote (we hope.) But for one fleeting moment, he put Oregon in the national spotlight during the presidential primaries. It was like a scene out of a Disney movie. As Bernie Sanders orated his disdain for the millionaire- and billionaire-class to a crowd at the Moda Center, a tiny sparrow perched on his podium, prompting thousands to proclaim, "Only in Oregon." Of course, the whimsy of such a moment only lasts so long. One of the Rose Quarter's general managers told The Oregonian/OregonLive that avian visitors aren't exactly a rare occurrence at the venue. And they don't all come bearing messages of peace. Some of them -- as an Oregonian/OregonLive videographer discovered -- are just stopping for a bathroom break. Ammon Bundy: Oregon standoff leader The 41-year-old leader of the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, who came to Burns in November to press Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward and other government officials to step in and prevent two Harney County ranchers from returning to federal prison on arson convictions. He led a march in Burns on Jan. 2 in support of Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven Hammond, and then joined with his brother Ryan Bundy and other supporters to seize the federal wildlife refuge located about 20 miles south of Burns. He was arrested Jan. 26 as he and others were driving to a community meeting in John Day. He went to trial on federal conspiracy and weapons charges, testified in his behalf over three days and was acquitted by a jury of all allegations. Bundy, of Emmett, Idaho, now faces prosecution in Nevada stemming from a standoff with federal agents over grazing rights fees involving cattle from his father Cliven Bundy's ranch near Bunkerville. Dennis Richardson: First Republican to win statewide elected office in over 20 years Richardson, newly elected secretary of state, waited for The Oregonian/OregonLIve to make it official before he'd admit becoming the first Republican to win a statewide election in Oregon since 2002. The win was a reboot for Richardson, who lost to Gov. John Kitzhaber in 2014 despite assailing him about the ethics scandal that later drove him from office. This year, Richardson looked prescient on ethics and argued that his controversial views on social issues -- opposing abortion and same-sex marriage -- don't matter in a more bureaucratic job. Gregory McKelvey: Portland's Resistance leader McKelvey is a Portland law student and a leader of the advocacy group Portland's resistance, which  organized prominent anti-Trump protests after the election. McKelvey also was part of an hours-long standoff in front of City Hall over the city's new labor contract with police and another protest when people camped in front of Mayor Charlie Hales' house to decry the police response to the City Hall protest. The large Resistance protests put Portland in the national spotlight after Donald Trump's presidential election. One of those protests caused an estimated $1 million in property damage after a group of violent protesters joined the crowd of approximately 4,000.  Tobin Heath: U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year The women's soccer star appeared in 22 games for the U.S. Women's National Team in 2016, recording a career-best six goals and eight assists and garnering U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year honors. She represented the USA at this summer's Olympic Games, finishing the tournament with two assists. With the Portland Thorns, the 28-year-old recorded a league-record 10 assists this season in just 14 appearances. She was named to the NWSL Best XI for her performance and was a finalist for the league's MVP award. Heath led the Thorns to the NWSL Shield as the best team in the regular season, and the Thorns entered the playoffs as the favorites before falling to Western New York 4-3 in the semifinals. Ursula Le Guin: Local literary legend Le Guin is Portland's best-known author, a literary luminary whose long career includes numerous major literary awards. She has stopped writing fiction, but in 2016 she returned to the news for three reasons: The announcement that the Library of America, which almost never honors living authors, was issuing the first of several volumes collecting her works. A Kickstarter campaign that raised nearly three times its goal for a documentary film about her and her writing. And her selection as the focus of the University of Oregon's annual feminist science fiction convention, which drew attendees from throughout the country. Though she is now held up as a guiding light of feminism, her early writings contained few women because, she has said, "I didn't know how to write about women. I didn't know that you could write about women." Devon Allen: UO wide receiver turned pro hurdler The Oregon Ducks' two-sport star burst onto the international scene in the 110-meter hurdles, suffered a season-ending injury on the football field and announced he would be turning pro in track. Allen won the NCAA title in the 110 hurdles in June, then beat all the best American pros at the Olympic trials in July, clocking a personal-best 13.03 seconds. Allen, 21, was the youngest of the eight competitors in the 110 hurdles final at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August. Running in his first international meet, Allen placed fifth in Rio. He then returned to Eugene to rejoin the Ducks football team. The junior wide receiver's season ended abruptly, after just four catches for 141 yards and a touchdown, as he tore the ACL in his left knee Sept. 17 against Nebraska. Two months removed from surgery, Allen announced in November he would forgo his remaining college eligibility in both sports to turn pro in track.  Lt. Peter St. John: Injured firefighter who evactuated people in NW Portland gas explosion On the morning of Oct. 19, St. John helped clear a building of people in Northwest Portland after hazard readings showed a dangerously high level of natural gas. After the workers were out, St. John walked toward a nearby hole where an excavating crew had hit a natural gas pipeline. Then the building exploded into a ball of flame, sending St. John flying into a nearby cyclone fence. He blacked out temporarily and when he awoke, he couldn't move his legs. He saw one of his legs grotesquely twisted. The Station 3 firefighter is recuperating at his Tigard home with his wife and three children. The former Portland State University football player looks forward to his return to work, but isn't certain when that will happen. Brian Krzanich: Intel CEO Though he lives in California, Intel's chief executive runs Oregon's largest private employer. This past year, his fourth running Intel, was the company's most eventful in a generation. Anticipating long-term decline in Intel's core market, the PC business, Krzanich oversaw the elimination of 15,000 jobs worldwide from April through September. The company laid off 784 Oregonians in April and cut loose hundreds or thousands more through buyouts. In June, Krzanich acknowledged employees found the cutbacks too "harsh and quick," but he stood by his plan to remake Intel by focusing on data centers and other new technologies. "The best way to get morale and confidence up is when our business growth really starts to take off," Krzanich told employees. Anna Brown: U.S. District Judge presiding over the Oregon standoff trial Brown was the trial court judge for the federal prosecution of Ammon Bundy and six co-defendants stemming from their occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which began in mid-September and lasted five weeks, with verdicts announced on Oct. 27. She managed the high-profile, multi-defendant case that presented many challenges: three defendants who were allowed to represent themselves, one who repeatedly questioned her oath of office and Ammon Bundy's lawyer Marcus Mumford who tried her patience. She'll continue to preside over a second trial expected for seven remaining defendants, and handle motions by three other defendants to withdraw their guilty pleas. John Brigande: OHSU superstar hearing researcher Brigande, hearing researcher at OHSU: Considered a superstar in his field, he's developed a way to correct deafness in mice fetusus by correcting a gene abnormality. "I thought that this would be an obvious, clear path to give me the best chance to communicate effectively," Brigande said about his choice of profession. Brigande started losing hearing in his left ear at age 9. He has a cochlear implant but it didn't bring back his hearing. Jamie Weisner: Former OSU guard who helped her team to the Final Four The former Oregon State guard capped her college career by being named the Pac-12 Player of the Year, earning All-America honors and helping lead the Beavers to their first Final Four in program history. Long credited with being the first high-profile prospect to believe in Scott Rueck's rebuilding project at OSU, Weisner morphed into one of the country's deadliest shooters as a senior and garnered consistent praise for her relentless, gritty playing style. She connected on 48 percent of her field-goal attempts (the highest mark for a Pac-12 guard) and on 44.3 percent of her shots from three-point distance, helping her average 17.3 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. "She's legendary," Rueck said. "From her freshman year on, she has set the tone in that area, and how vital is that for a program? You have to have somebody that you kind of look to and say, 'OK, this person defines toughness for us,' and I think Jamie's the one that has done that." She was originally selected by the Connecticut Sun in the second round of the WNBA Draft and spent part of the season on the Washington Mystics' roster.  Jason Goodding: Seaside police sergeant killed in the line of duty Goodding, Seaside police officer and married 39-year-old father of two, died in February after trying to arrest a man with a history of assaulting officers, police said. He was shot outside a downtown restaurant while taking a man into custody on a warrant tied to an earlier assault on a police officer. Colleagues remembered Goodding as a keen listener who looked you in the eye and treated everyone like good people. He was a familiar figure on Seaside's youth sports scene, primarily coaching his daughters in basketball and occasionally helping out with the boys' program.  "It just sounds like we're putting him up on this pedestal," Clatsop County Sheriff Tom Bergin, the Gooddings' next-door neighbor, said days after Goodding's death. "But if any guy deserved to be on a pedestal, it was him." Carole Smith: Former Superintendent of PPS who retired amid lead scandal After nine years leading Portland Public Schools, Smith was driven out in the wake of an epic lead scandal, in which years of missteps meant students and employees were exposed to tainted water, and lead dust and debris. Smith left a more positive legacy as well: Under her, the district's abysmal graduation rate rose dramatically. And supporters say changes she accomplished, such as limiting transfers out of neighborhood schools, will better serve minority, low-income and second-language students for years to come. But critics worry the district will continue to suffer from Smith's record of tolerating or excusing poor job performance, from promoting principals who bombed at leading schools to allowing sub-par performance by high-level administrators. Jamie Shupe: State's first legally non-binary person  Shupe did something in 2016 no one else in American history had ever done before, experts say: The 52-year-old Army veteran won a judge's permission to legally identify as "non-binary" instead of male or female. Shupe, who began transitioning as transgender in 2013, worked with a lawyer to stake out new ground out of a strong sense that the traditional gender identifiers didn't fit. "I was assigned male at birth due to biology," Shupe told The Oregonian/OregonLive in June. "I'm stuck with that for life. My gender identity is definitely feminine. My gender identity has never been male, but I feel like I have to own up to my male biology. Being non-binary allows me to do that. I'm a mixture of both. I consider myself as a third sex." Vance Day: Indicted Marion County Circuit Judge Day has become perhaps one of the most talked about judges in the state -- after allegations arose in 2015 that he was covertly discriminating against same-sex couples by refusing to marry them. After the state's judicial fitness commission recommended in January 2016 that he lose his job based on this allegation and others, Day is still fighting -- with a hearing set before the Oregon Supreme Court in May 2017. A website -- www.defendjudgeday.com -- states that his legal fees have topped $500,000. Day has said he's defending his First Amendment and religious rights. As of November 2016, Day also has been contesting criminal charges that he committed official misconduct and twice enabled a felon to possess a firearm by giving a intoxicated driving defendant in his veteran's court program a gun to handle or practice shooting. A trial date hasn't yet been set. Ashton Eaton: Still the World's Greatest Athlete The Bend native and former Oregon Ducks star maintained his grip on the title of world's greatest athlete by winning the decathlon at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August. Eaton tied the Olympic record of 8,893 points en route to the gold medal victory over France's Kevin Mayer. His total trailed Eaton's own world record of 9,045 he set at the 2015 world championships, but it was enough to bring home his second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the two-day, 10-discipline competition. He placed second in the first event, the 100 meters, but then won the long jump to take the overall lead and stayed atop the standings from there. Eaton joined Daley Thompson (1980 and 1984) and Bob Mathias (1948 and 1952) as the only decathletes to win gold medals in two Olympics.  Eddie Bolanos: Forest Grove walkout organizer Bolanos, 20, is a staff member with Centro Cultural de Washington County and Portland State University student. On the evening of May 18, Bolanos listened to two Forest Grove High School students describe the "Build the Wall" banner that hung briefly that day in the school lunchroom. The students were upset but said there was nothing they could do. "Why don't you do a walkout?" Bolanos suggested. Twelve hours later, through the power of that suggestion and social media, the Forest Grove demonstration was on. But that demonstration sparked other students throughout the Portland area, offended by that sign as well as other slights they had seen in 2016, to stage walkouts and demonstrations of their own. Bolanos later steered a core of students in Washington County schools toward a more lasting organization so that they would continue talking to school administrators into the 2016-17 school year.   Larry O'Dea: Former Portland Police Chief The former Portland police chief who resigned in June as he was under criminal investigation for an off-duty shooting of his friend during an April 21 camping trip in Harney County. O'Dea was later indicted on a negligent wounding charge in Harney County. O'Dea didn't acknowledge the shooting until reporters questioned the Police Bureau about it a month later. An internal investigation also was never initiated by O'Dea, his boss and police commissioner Mayor Charlie  Hales or police internal affairs until the shooting became public. O'Dea retired after nearly 30 years with the Portland Police Bureau. He served as chief for a year and a half after rising steadily through the ranks. Hales appointed him to lead the bureau starting in January 2015 after former chief Mike Reese retired. Kate Brown: First openly LGBT governor *made the list last year Brown, appointed governor after Kitzhaber resigned 2015, dispatched a neophyte Republican challenger to officially win the right to finish her predecessor's term. The vote distinguishes Brown as the first openly LGBTQ person elected governor in the United States. But it also sets her up for a challenge: After backing a corporate tax measure that died in November, Brown must help solve a $1.7 billion budget shortfall while soothing sore feelings among the state's polarized political factions. * * *  You have until 11:59 p.m. Dec. 20 to vote for your favorite candidate for Person of the Year below.

For every blue screen of death, there are droves of technological enhancements driving PCs into the era of virtual reality, 4K video and 5G connectivity. Here are the top 10 PC technology and trends to watch next year. VR PCs on your head Intel/IDGNS An Intel employee demonstrates the company's Project Alloy headset on stage during IDF 2016 in San Francisco on August 16, 2016. VR devices will come in many new shapes and sizes, with some of them acting essentially as PCs that fit on your head. Dell, Asus, Acer, Lenovo and HP will release mixed reality headsets, which will allow users to interact with 3D objects that pop up as floating images superimposed on a real-life background. The devices will provide a new level of human-computer interaction, making it more fun than ever to create 3D objects, play games, watch moves, and have interactive Skype calls. These "holographic computers," as they have been called, will have Intel chips, an integrated GPU and possibly a 3D RealSense camera to identify objects, measure distances, and provide new perspectives on surroundings. Storage prices will go up Martyn Williams A computer with an Intel SSD on display at Computex 2015 in Taipei Prices of SSDs are going up due to shortages, and that could have an impact on the price of laptops, 2-in-1 computers and storage. Dell's XPS 13 with Intel's Kaby Lake chips and a 512GB SSD, for example, is not available right now. Other laptops with 512GB SSDs are priced unbelievably high. Most PC makers are offering 128GB or 256GB SSDs in PCs by default. Choose storage wisely, as it isn't easy to screw open a superthin 2-in-1 to replace an SSD. Talk to your PC Microsoft Woman using Microsoft's Cortana voice-activated assistant on Lumia smartphone. The feud between Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana voice-activated assistants could get more interesting next year. Users will be able to shout out Cortana commands to Windows 10 PCs from a longer distance, thanks to a "far-field speech recognition" technology that Intel and Microsoft are working on. Until now, Cortana worked best if a user was close to a PC, but millions of Windows PCs will turn into Amazon Echo competitors with this new feature. Cortana can do a lot more than Amazon Echo, like accessing information from the cloud, chatting with chatbots, checking email and other tasks. AMD ratchets up chip battle with Intel Martyn Williams Intel has been the unchallenged king of PCs for more than a decade, but AMD is fighting back with its new Ryzen PC processor, which will reaches PCs next year. A healthy rivalry will be good news for PC users, some of whom may jump from the Intel to the AMD camp. AMD claims Ryzen is 40 percent faster than its current PC chips, which on paper is impressive. The chips will first hit gaming PCs, and then mainstream laptops and desktops later in 2017. Ryzen will battle Intel's Kaby Lake in early 2017, and the 10-nanometer Cannonlake in late 2017. ARM-based laptops with Windows, again Stephen Lawson The first attempt at ARM PCs, which ran on Windows RT, was an unmitigated disaster, and it left many users skeptical of the idea. But Microsoft hasn't given up, especially as 5G starts to become a reality and cellular connectivity in PCs becomes essential. Microsoft announced that next year PCs will be available with Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which is primarily for smartphones. Super-thin laptops will get integrated modems and a long battery life with the chip. The ARM-based PCs will run Win32 applications that run on regular x86 PCs via emulation. For now, no PC maker has announced ARM-based Windows PCs -- manufacturers may be cautious in light of the Windows RT fiasco. There are also many challenges. Snapdragon isn't as fast as high-end x86 Intel or AMD chips, and won't support 64-bit applications initially. Also, emulation may limit the ability to exploit hardware acceleration. Bluetooth 5 will take charge Stephen Lawson The Bluetooth logo. Laptops and 2-in-1s will be equipped with the latest Bluetooth 5 wireless specification, which is a longer and faster upgrade to the aging Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 will allow PCs to communicate wirelessly with devices up to 400 meters away in clear line of sight, but a more reasonable range is about 120 meters, according to analysts. Bluetooth 5 will transfer data at speeds of up to 2Mbps, which is two times faster than its predecessor. Beautiful screens, 4K and HDR Dell Dell's XPS 13 has an edge-to-edge screen. Laptops like the XPS 13 and Lenovo's Yoga 910 have beautiful edge-to-edge screens, a feature that may be included in more laptops next year. Also, 4K screens and HDR (high-dynamic range) technology will make games and movies look stunning. HDR results in more vivid images, and TVs, cameras and monitors supporting the technology are already available. Netflix is also doubling down on HDR. An HDR standards battle is brewing with DolbyVision and HBR3, but GPU makers are supporting both standards. AMD expects DolbyVision to ultimately win. New storage and memory technologies Intel 3D XPoint is the technology behind Optane products. Intel's Optane, a superfast SSD and DRAM replacement that could ultimately unify memory and storage, could cause a radical change in PC architecture. But that won't happen for a few years, and the initial expectations for Optane are modest. The first Optane SSDs will be in enthusiast PCs, and could cost a small fortune. Optane SSDs have been measured as being 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. Over time, Optane could replace DRAM DIMMs, with the added advantage of being able to store data. The SSDs won't be in laptops next year as the technology's uses are still being explored. Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, which Intel co-developed with Micron. SSDs based on Micron's 3D XPoint technology will ship next year under the QuantX brand. More changes for keyboards Lenovo Lenovo's Yoga Book has a virtual keyboard on a touch panel. We saw some interesting changes to keyboards this year: Apple added the Touch Bar, while Lenovo swapped out the hard keyboard for a virtual keyboard on a touch input panel for its Yoga Book. Lenovo wants to bring the virtual keyboard to more Chromebooks and 2-in-1s, partly because of its versatility. The touch input panel can also be used to draw or take notes with a stylus. It's a toss-up: Lenovo believes that those used to typing on mobile devices will adapt to this touch panel keyboard quickly, while hard keyboard diehards will dismiss the idea. Some ports won't go away easily James Niccolai USB Type-C cable on show at CES PC makers may not muster up the courage to remove the headphone jack and SD card slots from PCs right away, but USB 2.0 slots could be on their way out. Some PC makers may leave out display and other legacy ports with the emergence of the versatile USB Type-C, which can be used to charge PCs and connect displays, storage devices and other peripherals.

Credit: Microsoft More like this Sony's PlayStation VR bests HTC Vive in headset shipments Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets Dell sees VR as important to PCs as gaming Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Microsoft's sending a strong message: You don't need high-end hardware to plug most VR headsets into PCs. The company has established a modest set of minimum hardware requirements for upcoming VR headsets to be used with PCs. Microsoft believes mixed reality is the future of computing and wants to bring VR to as many PCs as possible. The requirements for Windows 10 PCs for tethered VR headsets do not apply to fully integrated headset computers like Microsoft's HoloLens. Companies like Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, and Lenovo plan to come out with headset accessories for PCs, and Microsoft has said prices for those VR headsets would start at $299. Microsoft's requirements are much lower than those for the high-end HTC Vive and Oculus Rift headsets, which require top-class GPUs and CPUs. By comparison, Microsoft's minimum hardware requirements make space to plug low-end VR headsets into PCs for movie watching, casual gaming, and basic applications. The specifications are just a starting point, but the more loaded a computer, the better the VR experience will get, Mingfei Yan, senior program manager at Microsoft, said during a presentation at last week's WinHEC show in Shenzhen, China. To support a VR headset right now, a laptop will need to have the equivalent of Intel's Core i5 7200U CPU based on Kaby Lake, Intel's HD 620 integrated graphics, and 8GB of dual-channel memory. The hardware requirements get a bit more demanding next year, when Microsoft releases its Creators Update for Windows 10, which is built around 3D gaming, virtual reality, and 4K movies. There's a bit more flexibility in the CPU requirements, but a computer may need a discrete or powerful integrated GPU. For Creators Update, the minimum laptop requirement will be an Intel Core i5 chip -- Microsoft provided the example of a Skylake-based Core i5 6200U. The laptop GPU will need to be an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M, AMD RX460, or DirectX 12-compatible GPU. A desktop will require a minimum of a Core i3 or an AMD FX4530 CPU equivalent, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/1050, AMD Radeon RX460, or a DirectX 12 compatible GPU. PCs will also require a minimum of 8GB of dual-channel RAM and more than 10GB of storage. Additionally, PCs should have HDMI 1.4 for 60Hz head-mounted displays and HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort for 90Hz VR headset displays. Alternately, a PC could have or USB 3.0 Type-A or USB 3.1 Type-C port with DisplayPort Alternate mode. Other specs include a Bluetooth 4.0 wireless connection for accessories like controllers. Faster storage like SSDs and DDR4 memory will provide a better VR experience. AMD's mobile chips are still being tested for the specification, Yan said. Microsoft is using tracking technology to establish a "safety zone" to allow people to move when roaming VR worlds or playing games. Microsoft will prompt users to set up an active space in which to move, with the goal for VR users to avoiding crashing into furniture or other objects. Ultimately, Microsoft hopes VR headsets will be able to communicate with PCs wirelessly. That will provide users with more freedom to roam around larger areas, Yan said. The company also believes audio will play an important role when interacting with 3D worlds via a VR headset. For example, Cortana could be an important feature for VR apps in Windows 10. For the VR headset, Yan recommended putting in dual microphones, a headphone jack, or an audio array so users can enable the Cortana experience. By the next Creators Update, Microsoft will support Universal Windows Platform apps on its mixed reality platform. Microsoft's Edge browser will have VR capabilities with support for the WebVR standard. Microsoft's goal is to provide the largest catalog of apps and content for VR headsets, Yan said. The company will add new a movie and TV catalog with the Creators Update as a one-stop shop for videos that can run on VR headsets.

While it took some time before the tech giant was able to create a device that sat with consumers just right, the release of the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015 heralded the beginning of Microsoft’s burst of innovation. With the tech firm’s flagship hybrid device being more than a year old, however, speculations are high that the Surface Pro 5 would make a debut a bit later than what many expected. The release date of the Surface Pro 5 has long been in the rumor mill, with numerous missed predictions over the last few months. With the rumored October 2016 release date ultimately proving itself to be false, speculations are now high that the highly anticipated device would see a spring 2017 release date instead, according to a Tech Radar report. While this date is a bit later than what analysts and Surface fans expected, an early 2017 release actually makes perfect sense. This is because the Surface Pro 5 is an enterprise-grade device. In a lot of ways, the Surface Pro line is Microsoft’s ongoing statement that a hybrid device could be robust enough to become a full-fledged desktop replacement. With this in mind, it seems like Microsoft is definitely holding out on the Surface Pro 5’s release due to the availability of Intel’s latest processors, the Kaby Lake family. With Kaby Lake processors being shipped late 2016, a spring 2017 release date for the Surface Pro 5 definitely seems to be Microsoft’s best way to ensure that its next flagship hybrid would be its best one yet. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The rumors surrounding the Microsoft Surface Pro 5’s specs have been very encouraging so far, with numerous speculations pointing to a device with robust specs that far exceed those offered by its competitors. While the specifics of the device have not been leaked as of date, rumors have largely been unanimous in the notion that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 would carry Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, around 16GB of RAM and a 2K screen at least. Apart from this, speculations are also high that the Surface Pen, one of the most important accessories of the hybrid device, would finally be rechargeable, just like the Apple Pencil in Apple’s iPad Pro. One particular rumor that has been very persistent lately is the speculation that the Surface Pro 5 would be released in two versions, with one being the top-tier Pro variant and another being an entry-level non-Pro device. A PC Advisor report has stated that Microsoft recently released a demo of Windows 10 running on an ARM-based computer. This has then triggered further speculations that the Surface 5 (the entry-level, non-Pro variant) would come equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor instead of an Intel Kaby Lake chip. Utilizing an ARM-based processor opens up numerous possibilities for the Surface Pro 5. While the device would lose the raw computing power that is provided by Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, the ARM-based Surface device would most likely feature a vastly improved battery life and possibly even LTE connectivity. Considering the advantages that an ARM chip could give to the Surface line, it is possible that Microsoft might actually take the gamble and release a more lightweight, endurance-focused, LTE-capable machine. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] In a lot of ways, releasing an ARM-based device with full mobile connectivity would enable Microsoft to consume yet another chunk out of Apple’s target market. After all, the iPad Pro, which is Apple’s enterprise-grade hybrid device, might lag behind the Surface Pro 4 in terms of raw power, but its capability to connect to the internet through LTE is a definite plus for the device. If the next Surface hybrid would debut with the same feature, then Apple’s power tablet would definitely be in trouble. That is, of course, unless the iPad Pro 2 proves to be a revolutionary device. As for the price of the upcoming hybrid device, rumors are high that the Surface Pro 5 would start once more at $899 for its entry-level version, with higher-tier models going well into the thousands of dollars. Surface devices have never really been affordable, but they have managed to become successful nonetheless. Thus, despite the most likely steep prices of the Surface Pro 5, its features and raw power might very well be enough to warrant a purchase from consumers. For now, at least, the wait for the next great hybrid device would continue.

The processors will be officially introduced following a closed news conference on January 4 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. The conference will take place from 4 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. The news stems from a recent leak that provided those dates along with the entire list of seventh-generation desktop processors that will be announced on January 5. They will be accompanied by the new Intel 200 Series chipsets for motherboards that will support the new processors. The list of leaked processors is rather long, consisting of 16 CPUs that includes the Xeon E3-1205 v6, three Core i7 chips, seven Core i5 models, two Core i3 units, and three Pentium processors. Here are the first eight on the leaked lineup: Model Cores/Threads Base Speed L3 Cache TDP Socket Price Xeon E3-1205 v6 4/8 3.0GHz 8MB TBD TBD TBD Core i7-7700K 4/8 4.2GHz 8MB 95 watts LGA1151 $349 Core i7-7700 4/8 3.6GHz 8MB 65 watts LGA1151 $309 Core i7-7700T 4/8 2.9GHz 8MB 35 watts LGA1151 TBD Core i5-7600K 4/4 3.8GHz 6MB 95 watts LGA1151 $239 Core i5-7600 4/4 3.5GHz 6MB 65 watts LGA1151 $219 Core i5-7600T 4/4 2.8GHz 6MB 35 watts LGA1151 TBD Core i5-7500 4/4 3.4GHz 6MB 65 watts LGA1151 $199 The upcoming desktop CPUs will support Intel’s Optane storage technology that relies on its 3D XPoint memory, which promises to be 1,000 times faster than the current NAND technology used in solid-state disks and other flash-based storage. The new desktop processors will also support HDCP 2.2, hardware-based encoding and decoding of H.264, HEVC Main, and VP9 video codecs. The integrated graphics are better too compared to the older sixth-generation Skylake processors. Now here is the full leaked list of the Intel 200 Series chipsets that will be announced at the show: Chipset Socket Stepping Product Code S-Spec Intel C422 TBD A0 GL82C422 SR2WG Intel X299 TBD A0 GL82X299 SR2Z2 Intel Z270 LGA1151 A0 GL82Z270 SR2WB Intel H270 LGA1151 A0 GL82H270 SR2WA Intel Q270 LGA1151 A0 GL82Q270 SR2WE Intel B250 LGA1151 A0 GL82B250 SR2WC Intel Q250 LGA1151 A0 GL82Q250 SR2WD Intel’s 200 Series chipsets bring new technologies to Intel-based motherboards. Some of the features include support for up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, support for up to 24 PCI Express 3.0 and six SATA 3.0 high-speed I/O lanes, support for Intel’s Optane technology, and the addition of Intel Rapid Storage Technology 15 and Intel RST PCI Express Storage x4 Generation 3. Intel’s RealSense and Ready Mode technologies are also supported. The leak should be no surprise given that secrets can never be kept from the internet. How the information was obtained is unknown at the point, so the two lists need to be regarded as rumor and speculation until Intel reveals the whole lineup during CES 2017. There is a good chance Intel will conduct a private meeting with a few specific sites as a pre-briefing before the press conference, so we may hear more about the new processors over the next several weeks.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 15, 2016 at 5:41PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world's largest chip company by revenue, and most of that $55 billion-plus in revenue comes from the sale of chips that the company designs and manufactures itself. Image source: Intel. In contrast, most other chipmakers design their own products but rely on third-party contract chip manufacturers to manufacture those designs. Those chipmakers are commonly referred to as "fabless" semiconductor companies. That's because a chip manufacturing plant is referred to as a "fab," which is short for "fabrication plant." Intel has been working to try to build out a contract chip manufacturing business with the aim of nabbing business from market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) as well as Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). The obvious reason for Intel to want to enter this business is simply to find a way to make more money. After all, Intel can't design and build products for every segment of the market, so it makes sense for Intel to try to capitalize on opportunities by manufacturing chip designs for others. A not-so-obvious reason -- one that Intel manufacturing executive Stacy Smith recently talked about -- is that by configuring itself to be able to handle a wider variety of chip designs from third parties, Intel can help its internal chip design teams to be more effective. Let's take a closer look at what Smith had to say at the Credit Suisse 20th Annual Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. Transcript via Seeking Alpha. Building that foundry capability Smith conceded that the company's revenue and unit volumes from contract chip customers are quite small today. However, he stressed that having the capability to service those customers has "a lot of option value to [Intel] as a company. ... But I don't want to minimize that the capability to flip it around and show that foundry face to our internal [system-on-a-chip] organization is absolutely key," Smith said. He added that he and Intel Client and Internet of Things President Murthy Renduchintala want to make sure that Intel's own system-on-a-chip teams can "land a product very quickly and take advantage of our Moore's Law benefit." A really important capability One of the big strengths of the contract chip manufacturers is that their manufacturing processes, design tools, and intellectual-property libraries are all designed to allow chip designers to quickly put together a diverse range of system-on-a-chip products. That makes a lot of sense, given that, historically, those contract-chip makers have been required to service a lot of different customers with a wide-ranging set of requirements. TSMC, for example, builds everything from Wi-Fi chips all the way to high-performance graphics processors.  Intel, on the other hand, has built its business primarily around high-performance microprocessors targeted at the personal-computer and server markets designed by in-house teams. As Intel tries to push into new areas, and as its core markets require an increasingly diverse set of products, the company needs to make sure that its internal design teams aren't hamstrung by the very manufacturing technology that Intel management cites as a key strength.

What do things look like going forward? Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 16, 2016 at 5:21PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had a great year in 2014. Its data-center business surged by more than 18% year over year, and its personal computer revenue grew in what was expected to be yet another down year for the beleaguered personal computer market. Things just generally went well for the chipmaker, which allowed the company's stock to rise from just under $26 per share to just over $36 per share -- about a 40% gain. Since then, though, Intel stock hasn't done all that well. It dropped over the course of 2015 from just over $36 per share to about $34.45 per share. Year to date in 2016, with the year almost over, Intel shares are up nearly 7%, which isn't terrible in absolute terms -- a gain is a gain, after all. However, compared with, arguably, its two most important peers in the semiconductor industry – wireless chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) -- Intel has dramatically underperformed. Qualcomm's up just under 39% year to date, enjoying a healthy recovery after a dismal 2015, and TSMC is up 33.45% year to date after experiencing a roughly flat 2015 in terms of stock price. Image source: Intel.  Taking a longer-term view Looking at a single year's performance in isolation doesn't tell investors the whole story. After all, if a stock dropped 75% in one year and then rose by 100% the following year, investors who had to suffer that 75% drop are still down 50% compared to where they were before that precipitous plunge. That's why it's important to look at how a stock has performed over a longer period relative to its peers. So how does Intel's share price performance stack up to Qualcomm's and TSMC's since the beginning of 2013? Stock Start Price (1/2/13) End Price (12/13/16) % Difference Intel $21.38 $36.80 72.1 Qualcomm $64.75 $69.34 7.08 TSMC $18.10 $30.36 67.73 Taking this longer-term view puts Intel in a far better light compared with Qualcomm and TSMC than this year's results do. If an investor had picked one of these three large-cap chip companies to invest her or his money into at the start of 2013, the highest share price appreciation would have come from Intel, followed by TSMC. Qualcomm would have been, by far, the worst performer of the bunch over that time frame. Peering at the underlying fundamentals Although stock prices are what ultimately matter at the end of the day, it's also important to look at the fundamental revenue and profit performances of each company over that period. Since the beginning of 2013, TSMC's trailing-12-month revenue has grown by 50.54%. Qualcomm and Intel, on the other hand, have seen sub-10% growth over that time. Image source: YCharts. In terms of operating profit growth, TSMC once again has far outperformed its peers, growing at 64.4% over that time, versus declines for both Intel and Qualcomm: Image source: YCharts. Intel's 5.24% operating income decline represents the worst performance of the bunch, followed by Qualcomm's 1.29% decline in operating profit. Both companies saw operating profit decline even as revenues grew, suggesting that both suffered operating margin contraction. TSMC's operating-profit growth has been very robust over that time, up by 64.4% and outpacing revenue growth, meaning that operating margin expanded.  Looking ahead As far as stock price performance goes, Intel underperformed in 2016, but has done reasonably well over a three-year time horizon. In terms of the underlying financial fundamentals, Intel's revenue is up, but nowhere near as much as the stock price is. Operating income is actually down a smidgen.  This fundamental performance is reflective of the fact that the personal computer market -- to which Intel is heavily exposed -- has declined, offsetting the growth that the company has enjoyed in other areas (such as in its data center group and Internet of Things group). It has also boosted its operating expenses to invest in those future opportunities beyond the personal computer market.  Intel is doing what it needs to in order to secure its long-term future, but investments take time, which dents near-term profitability. If the investments that Intel is making ultimately prove successful, we should see both an acceleration in revenue growth as well as growth in operating profit that starts to outpace revenue growth. I think, though, that investors are going to need to be patient, as it might still be a couple of more years before that potential fundamental financial outperformance might happen -- if it happens at all.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Clear Containers, launched last year, represents Intel's effort to combine the isolation provided by virtual machines with the deployment advantages of containers, in conjunction with hardware acceleration. Through KVM stage1, rkt for more than a year has supported virtual machine-based containers. Now CoreOS has given rkt the ability to automatically shut down a container subject to a privilege escalation attack and to restart a new instance of the container. "What we've done is patched the kernel and we trap various important system calls like open and exec," said Brandon Philips, CTO of CoreOS, in a phone interview with The Register. If you're running containers on bare metal, Philips said, "you want increased isolation and an additional layer of privilege separation." As CoreOS security engineer Matthew Garrett describes in a blog post, the modifications to the kernel allow it to notify the hypervisor when processes are created and destroyed. Communication between the two software components allows them to coordinate their respective states. And theses state can be confirmed whenever a process requires permission verification. "For example, when a process requests that a file be opened, the kernel now calls out to the hypervisor," said Garrett. "The hypervisor is then able to examine the process state and ensure that it remains consistent with its internal representation of process state." If inconsistency is detected, if the kernel's state differs from the hypervisor state, that indicates unauthorized modification. When that happens, an administrator can be notified and the compromised container can be discontinued or restarted. Philips said the changes to rkt makes a large class of attacks more difficult. Vulnerabilities that aren't addressed, like "Dirty COW" and attacks within the userspace, may eventually be addressed by other Linux-oriented security efforts like the Kernel Self Protection Project and the GRSecurity project. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Google gently leads Intel into its cloud: This is for your own good All is well, rejoice, rejoice, let's get into the white 'n' fluffy Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll focus on 2-3 broad areas of interest and will work with Mozillians to refine into specific topics: Product topics e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics Emerging Technologies e.g. Internet of Things; Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality; and their implications on Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access People topics e.g. teamwork & collaboration; community-building; communications Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from general “TED”-like inspirational talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

As ArsTechnica noted, the company “told us repeatedly and emphatically that it had taken no specific steps to improve MacBook Pro battery life” with macOS Sierra 10.12.2. Now, some people have reported seeing improved battery performance after installing the update on their MacBook Pro, but there’s a reasonable explanation for that. Wait, does that mean that reports of new MacBook Pro owners seeing poor battery life of five hours or less are bogus? In a word, no. In a nutshell, users initially saw decreased battery performance because post-install processes put a major strain on the battery. The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple was told the same thing by his own Apple sources. According to Apple’s own data, the new MacBook Pro’s batteries are performing as intended (the firm rates the new MacBook Pro’s batteries at ten hours of web browsing and iTunes movie playback). Like iOS, macOS typically performs resource-intensive tasks following a major software update. Some of those processes can run for hours, if not days, until they complete. The battery is affected by things like initial Spotlight indexing, iCloud sync and the Photos app which performs detailed analysis of the user’s photos and videos to recognize faces, objects and scenes on them and populate the Memories tab with automatically created albums and slideshows. Battery may be sapped until facial recognition, Memories, image analysis and other initial first-run tasks in Photos have completed. macOS also needs to sync your iCloud Drive, Photo Streams and iCloud Photo Library. Because these and other processes can make for a lot of uploading, downloading and CPU usage, battery life in the first day or two may not necessarily be representative of normal battery life once everything has settled down, as Ars notes. “This could also help to explain some of those reports that battery life has improved since the 10.12.2 update landed,” wrote the site. “It could be that the update’s installation coincided with the end of those first-time Spotlight and iCloud operations.” That’s not saying that the new MacBook Pro’s battery is stronger than its predecessor. As Ars explains, 13 and 15-inch Pros come with a 34 percent and 24 percent reduction in battery capacity, respectively: the 13-incher went from 74.9 WHr to 49.2 WHr and its 15-inch counterpart fell from 99.5 WHr to 76 WHr. As for Intel’s Skylake chips in the new Pros, they’re more power efficient but only when your Mac is idling and not running resource-heavy apps such as video editing, having lots of browser tabs open and so forth. Skylake chips in new Pros use around the same amount of power as 2015’s Broadwell in previous-generation 13″ Pro and a little bit less than 2013’s Haswell in 15″ Pro. Intel says Skylake chips are more power-efficient than their predecessors, but it seems that’s only really true when they’re under extremely light load. “The less idle processor time you have, the less Intel’s recent power optimizations can help you,” noted Ars. Another problem lies in the fact that 15-inch Pros have power-hungry discrete GPUs which cannot be disabled to conserve power because the machines must be capable of driving two 5K screens at 60Hz at once. Because there’s no integrated-only GPU option, you’re unable to prioritize battery life over external display output. As for Touch Bar’s impact on Pro’s battery, it’s relatively minor versus the rest of the system thanks to Apple’s power-efficient T1 chip. Plus, the Touch Bar screen uses power-saving OLED technology (versus the notebook’s LCD-based screen) and switches off when you’re not actively using the computer. Other factors are at play here. Some of the apps you use may be real battery hogs, for example, especially if they don’t take full advantage of your computer’s hardware and system APIs like anything Adobe, video players like VLC and media center apps like Plex and Kodi. These and many other third-party media players use the CPU, not the GPU, to render Mac-unfriendly video files like MKV, AVI and DIVX. This is why Apple’s ten-hour battery life claim assumes browsing the web in Safari and playing movies in iTunes. Safari is optimized for low energy consumption while movies imported in iTunes are re-encoded in Apple-friendly H.264 or MP4 format which the GPU handles very efficiently via hardware acceleration. Ars wraps up the article by providing a few power-saving tips. Use Safari over Chrome whenever possible as it takes advantage of macOS’s power-friendly technologies. You should reduce screen brightness and close any unused browser tabs and apps, especially items in the Mac’s menu bar and apps which frequently perform a background sync, like Dropbox, One Drive and Outlook. Lastly, launch the Activity Monitor app within the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder to identify apps that may be using too much power. Energy tab in Activity Monitor can help identify battery hogs. Pro tip: you can check out your battery’s time remaining estimate in Activity Monitor. An earlier version of Apple’s support document about Mac batteries stated that the battery’s time remaining indicator would update frequently and change depending on screen brightness and system workload. The now-removed passage said that some users might see the time remaining “drop significantly” should macOS update the indicator while the user was opening a very large file or starting up an application. “It’s important to remember it’s an estimate based on what your computer is doing at the specific time it updates,” read the now-removed part of Apple’s support document. All mentions of the battery’s time remaining got removed from the document yesterday. Mac notebooks with macOS Mavericks 10.9 or later now display the low battery warning when the battery has approximately ten minutes of power remaining versus earlier macOS versions, which report it at fifteen percent or less, reads the document. Aside from a number of big fixes and performance improvements, macOS Sierra 10.12.2 did address graphical glitches that some customers complained about, as per Apple’s software engineering boss Craig Federighi.

Then when I looked at an animated iMessage the discrete graphics came on (doesn’t ever go off until messages is quit) and time went down faster. I think they need to redesign graphics switching to turn back off when not needed or give an energy prefs to do the opposite of unchecking “use automatic graphics switching does” which locks it to discrete, mobile users want to lock it to integrated! Rolf Bause But hey, it’s thinner tho – and that’s what counts at the end of the day! Get used to it, fanboys! madmaxmedia The 2020 MacBook Pro is going to have 20-hour battery life if you’re doing nothing, but only 20 minutes if you’re doing anything CPU-intensive… Daniel Werner But it will only be 0,01 inches thick!!!!!11111oneone OUsooner08 Guess what my work Surface Pro 4 does the same crap. You can hover over the battery at any given time within a 10 minute period and get wildly different “time remaining” numbers. boosook The problem is not only the unreliability of the indicator. The problem is simply that battery life is much shorter than the previous macbooks, because batteries are much smaller. Apple promised a miracle (same battery life with smaller batteries) that simply did not happen. OUsooner08 Except that’s not true, I’m getting 9-11 hours based on the criteria set in the battery testing standards Apple uses which is web browsing. Watching iTunes movies I got 12 hours on a charge. Apple didn’t promise “up to 10 hours of Photo Shop” or “up to 10 hours of gaming.” Byambaa I am gonna sum up the entire thing from apple inside perspective: We have to show some changes in our new model! – Lets make it thinner. But the batteries have to get smaller then. – Remove the depressing battery indicator and say them, they should do nothing to longer the battery live or close as many programs as possible and at least dim the screen, who cares about iSheep’ eyes. – It may have a negative impact on our mac sales and profit! – Increase the price then. People won’t know about it at first. – Do we improve the battery life in coming updates? – Lets be really quiet and hold the 30 percent battery percentage’ peace we cut off. sorry for my bad english 😀 boosook Lol… The only step they could take is… Put in a bigger battery! Guys deal with it: the batteries in the new Mac books are underpowered. 35% smaller in the 13″ and 25% in the 15″ compared to previous generation. There’s no software update that could fix this. Apple chose to sacrifice everything (battery size, keyboard, ports) on the altar of the “slimmest Mac ever” mantra, and these are the results. These are not pro computers, not anymore.

He has got a few plans for Smartron, which has already released tablets and smartphones in the premium range — to make it a Samsung or Huawei of India. The firm was set up two years ago, but was kept in the stealth mode as it developed products that factor in the advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and artificial intelligence. It launched its initial models about six months ago with Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador. The company has built a team of 200 employees, with 90 per cent of them in the research and design team, and raised ₹100 crore. “We have so far made revenues of ₹50 crore,” he said. “We are planning to enter the next phase of growth. We will initially raise ₹250 crore in the next few months, and later ₹1,000 crore to support our developmental plans for the next 18-24 months.” The start-up plans to grow its team to 500 people.Smart firm “We would like to be known as a good product company. We have filed for 50 global patents in the areas of robotics, artificial intelligence and IoT. We are in the process of building a platform for apps driven by smart technologies,” Lingareddy said. Lingareddy set up Soft Machines in 2006 in the US along with his former colleague at Intel, Mohammad A Abdallah. The firm remained in a stealth mode for about seven years till it developed a chip with high processing power. After facing teething troubles early on, the firm weathered the financial meltdown and went on to raise $100 million from global investors. Reports suggest that Soft Machines’ acquisition size could be in the order of ₹2,000-3,000 crore. The firm, however, remains tight-lipped about the deal size, citing confidentiality terms.

Co. Ltd. If Samsung spins off its contract chip manufacturing business, this Apple supplier might be set to benefit. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 16, 2016 at 11:11AM A report from Business Korea says that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is considering spinning off its contract chip manufacturing business. The report goes on to say that Samsung began mulling this over "after the company lost Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest customer in the sector of application processors" to Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short. Image source: Intel.  It's hard to know if this will ultimately happen, but if it does, it could have some interesting implications for TSMC. Without Samsung Electronics, Samsung Foundry might fall behind Contract chip manufacturers like TSMC generally don't just build chips on the latest whiz-bang manufacturing technology. They build chips on a broad spectrum of technologies, ranging from brand-new technologies all the way to technologies that first began production a decade or more ago. Very few chip manufacturers have been able to deliver those leading-edge technologies at a rapid cadence, with just Samsung, TSMC, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at the forefront (with Global Foundries saying that it will be, too). Other chip-makers, like United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC), or UMC, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (NYSE:SMI), tend to bring technologies to market years after the top players do. There are many chips to be built on older manufacturing technologies, so these smaller, weaker players can still go after a significant portion of the semiconductor market. However, on older generation technologies, a technology leader like TSMC has significant scale and potentially yields advantages over the smaller technology laggards (since its "mature" technologies compete with their "leading edge" technologies). Nevertheless, I think that if Samsung were to spin off its contract chip manufacturer, the stand-alone Samsung Foundry wouldn't be able to afford the substantial R&D and capital equipment investments to stay at the leading edge of technology -- especially if it could no longer count on the captive demand from Samsung's chip design group (which, itself, has plenty of captive demand from Samsung Electronics). In short, I think it would become another UMC or SMIC -- effectively eliminating the foundry competition that TSMC currently has in building leading-edge chips. TSMC already captures much of the leading-edge foundry business out there, but additional share here certainly couldn't hurt. Two potential challengers If Samsung were to effectively be out of the leading-edge technology race, there's still Global Foundries and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) that could potentially step in to take its place as the No. 2 leading-edge contract chip manufacturer. Global Foundries talks quite a big game and has for years suggested that it would deliver leadership technologies alongside the major players, but thus far reality hasn't been so kind to the chipmaker. It couldn't develop a viable 14/16-nanometer generation technology on its own, which forced it to license Samsung's 14-nanometer LPE/LPP technologies, for example. The chip-maker indicates that it's going to be in production on a competitive 7-nanometer technology by late 2018, but I wouldn't bet money on the company delivering on that promise. Intel has the technology to compete effectively with TSMC and it has been making plenty of noise to suggest that it will eventually become a viable leading-edge contract chip manufacturer (right now, Intel primarily builds chips on leading-edge technologies for itself). However, just as Global Foundries has a technology credibility problem, Intel has a contract chip manufacturing credibility problem. Even though Intel Custom Foundry has been around for more than half a decade, it's still not generating revenues that would be considered significant by any stretch of the imagination.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 2, 2017 Harrowing Story of Installing Libreboot on ThinkPad 43 Comments by: Bryan Cockfield December 16, 2016 As an Apple user, I’ve become somewhat disillusioned over the past few years. Maybe it’s the spirit of Steve Jobs slowly vanishing from the company, or that Apple seems to care more about keeping up with expensive trends lately rather than setting them, or the nagging notion Apple doesn’t have my best interests as a user in mind. Whatever it is, I was passively on the hunt for a new laptop with the pipe dream that one day I could junk my Apple for something even better. One that could run a *nix operating system of some sort, be made with quality hardware, and not concern me over privacy issues. I didn’t think that those qualities existed in a laptop at all, and that my 2012 MacBook Pro was the “lesser of evils” that I might as well keep using. But then, we published a ThinkPad think piece that had two words in it that led me on a weeks-long journey to the brand-new, eight-year-old laptop I’m currently working from. Those two words: “install libreboot”. Libreboot is a piece of free software that replaces proprietary BIOS firmware on some modern computers. This has, surprisingly, become increasingly difficult to do as Intel ramps up deployment of the Intel Management Engine. In a nutshell, the IME is a separate processor that can monitor or even take over everything happening in a computer and send that information out over the network to anyone (or any company) that has control of it. It does so without any knowledge of the user and is (obviously) a huge security vulnerability. Since Intel’s competitors do similar things, there’s almost no escape unless you can replace the IME with something like libreboot or coreboot. Not as Easy as You’d Think When I started researching libreboot, I assumed that it would be a simple process: download it and run some installer on my computer that would re-flash the BIOS. It couldn’t take any more than a half hour! Especially since the original article simply said “install libreboot” as if it was something that a child could do in between naps. The reality of what I was about to dive into, however, was much different. First of all, libreboot only works on a handful of older ThinkPads. Newer models have fallen victim to a new strategy by Intel of checking the firmware loaded on the BIOS chip and disabling the computer if an unapproved firmware is discovered. Apparently Intel thinks that fixing security flaws or modifying something that you own is ridiculous and unacceptable. Anyway, I picked up an eight-year-old X200 on eBay for $65 shipped. I’m a simple guy who enjoys simple but reliable things even if they’re getting along in years, so the age of the computer wasn’t too much of a concern for me. Thinking I was doing pretty well for myself, I took a look at the installation instructions for the new firmware. Some Disassembly Required This is a step I probably should have taken before ordering the computer. Not that it would have stopped me from doing this, but it probably would have given me a better idea of what I should expect from this process. First of all, I found out that to flash the chip, disassembly and soldering would be required. The firmware has to be programmed directly. Anytime something like this is done, bricking the device is a real possibility. At least I would only be out $65. The tiny chip to the left of the Intel-branded processor is the source of the problem. Then, I learned that the BeagleBone Black is the preferred device to use to flash the new firmware to the ThinkPad. I have three Raspberry Pis lying around, but I went ahead and suspiciously ordered a BeagleBone for $40. Couldn’t hurt, I told myself, and I’ll have a new tool to use for other stuff in the future. But it did seem weird that there wasn’t an option to use a Raspberry Pi. The next hurdle was figuring out exactly what type of firmware chip I had in my laptop, because there are different SOIC clips for different types of chips, and the only way to find out which sized chip I had was to get the laptop and take it apart. This set me back a few days (and another $10) waiting on the correct clip to arrive. During this process I also learned that there is no free software that will run on Intel’s proprietary WiFi card in these computers, so I also ordered an Atheros card to install ($15) since I had the laptop taken apart already. New Atheros WiFi card installed. Moving along, the BeagleBone had to be configured in a very particular way. I had never interacted with one of these before, and it’s not quite as straightforward as a Raspberry Pi. This process took me a few hours over the course of two days. I also learned through a third-party tutorial that Libreboot actually can be flashed with a Raspberry Pi, but this is one (among many) situations where the libreboot folks will go to great lengths to use free and open source software when they can. The BeagleBone fits their requirements, the Pi does not, and they do not mention this. I could easily have saved myself the $40 and used a Pi, but in the spirit of libreboot (and the fact that I was too far along to switch) I pressed on. Navigating Libreboot’s Install Process Most of the problem I had setting up the BeagleBone is with libreboot’s files and instructions. For example, at one point I had to patch the libreboot ROM file with a MAC address descriptor specific to the Ethernet card in my laptop. It wasn’t immediately clear which script out of the many provided would do this. Even then, the different ROMs that are available were all in a single folder, and unless you realize this immediately you’ll fill the memory of the BeagleBone when you unzip the archive. In general, it felt like I needed multiple degrees in computer science to make sense of their instructions on the first try. This can be a common plague of free software: alienating people through documentation that doesn’t relate to those with less knowledge and experience. And I’m not exactly an amateur, either. I have a degree in electrical engineering and passable knowledge of what’s going on, but even then I felt like I was blindly charging through a dark jungle of jargon. Anyway, the BeagleBone Black I received didn’t have a display output (that I could find; I’ve never used one before and might have been missing something) and I had some difficulty getting it to work over the USB link to my Mac. That meant getting it on the network via Ethernet, and since my router is in the kitchen I set up shop there. After soldering some wires to the SOC clip, I was finally ready to start flashing some firmware. At this point, I’ve had the X200 for almost three weeks, all spent waiting on parts I couldn’t have known I needed and programming the BeagleBone to act as a programmer. My libreboot flashing station in the kitchen. Complete with janky power supply. The actual flashing only took me about an hour and a half, though. Once I figured out which ROM to use and hooked up my 3.3V power supply (luckily I had one of these cobbled together already) it was a fairly simple process to back up the factory ROM, verify it, and start flashing libreboot. There was one major hiccup at this point, though. I attempted this process four times, and each time the new firmware couldn’t be verified. Error messages appeared everywhere, which is not something you’d want to see at this point in the process. The BeagleBone wrote the firmware successfully but afterwards, for some reason, couldn’t verify it. After getting a little anxious that I might have failed after all of this work, I decided to stick the battery in the laptop to see if it would boot up. I saw the picture of Tux and Gnu hanging out on my BIOS screen, and made the executive decision that libreboot was successfully installed. I went ahead and installed Ubuntu to make sure everything would work correctly since I already had an Ubuntu live-USB stick lying around. Even the new WiFi card seems to work well (except it doesn’t have a 5 GHz antenna like the Intel card did, but that’s not too big of a deal). Not an ideal place to get stuck. Free software aficionados will note that Ubuntu isn’t really the pinnacle of the free software movement. It’s been criticized for including proprietary software, binary blobs, and other issues. That being said, after the initial Ubuntu test installation, I did try to install Trisquel (crashed during the install because it got confused that the X200 doesn’t have an optical drive), a version of Arch called Parabola (wouldn’t boot from a USB stick) and another Debian-based distribution called gNewSense (you have to chuckle at the terrible name), but I found all of them to be difficult to install, unusable, or both. For now, I’m happy just to have neutralized Intel’s Big Brother and I’ll probably keep using Ubuntu until the libre distributions have improved a little more (or I get really bored one day and decide to try again). Even though the process to install libreboot was tedious, it is possible. I would recommend having a libreboot computer to anyone who cares about privacy, security, or freedom. Even if you don’t want to throw your Apple in the garbage.

Most of us aren’t worried about an advanced firmware bound rootkit from an adware drive-by. We already have UEFI secure boot to prevent that. If that’s even a likely threat; the cost is very high and targeting is limited. It’s as easy as a single NSL/Court order to Intel/Lenovo/Dell and the NSA/CIA/TLA can get the private keys and bypass Boot guard entirely because its rootkit is “official”. User controlled Secure Boot that provides the same functionality on the other hand uses USER generated/managed keys no one else has, including the OEM.

Buy a (refurbished) T420 Thinkpad from a reputable dealer. Mine comes from A*n (for USD 180.00) and has–compared with “more modern” machines–great specs, including an optical drive, and Win7 for those times when I absolutely, positively must have a win OS. 2. When you turn the computer on, you’ll see a message in the start-up splash screen which states “To interrupt normal start-up, press press the blue “ThinkVantage” button” [on the keyboard]. 3. Install Linux Mint 17.3 from the boot thumb drive or DVD which you’ve created 4. Twenty minutes later, or a little later if you use DVD, you’ll have a dual-boot Linux computer which also, by the way, runs one of the last almost-acceptable versions of windows. Suggestions– 1.Don’t try to use Libreboot if you have an option. I took the route outlined here BECAUSE I read what I needed to do in order to use Libreboot on my existing hardware, and I did NOT have a computer which I wanted to salvage, come Hell or high water; nor do I have the temperament to make a career out of upgrading computers. 2. Do NOT use any version of Mint Linux past 17.3. All reports (from me, too) are that Mint 17.3 is rock-solid and a joy–a real joy–to use, and that later versions are not, due to the builds being associated with the later “buggy” versions of Ubuntu (cf.

Report comment Reply Unferium says: December 16, 2016 at 11:19 am Found some of my answer in the coreboot site. The thermal table for throttling can be edited in source for coreboot. Still not sure what overrides in the EC are though and presumably at a higher execution ring than the main BIOS, i.e. System management ring or similar/higher or similar to how the ME firmware would control things? Either way, turn Monday I’ll probably find out. Report comment Reply asdf says: December 17, 2016 at 12:58 pm The EC (or Embedded Controller) is a separate microcontroller (Renesas H8S in older models, SMSC/Microchip MEC series in newer ones). Report comment Reply Unferium says: December 20, 2016 at 5:32 am Dunno why I’m replying since this is now an old post…. a day passed before you commented so I missed the main opportunity… However if you do see this thread again: In my Dell, the EC is connected to some interrupt lines and I recall some #reset lines also.(where did I save those schematics?) The EC will interrupt the CPU and call SMM functions when entering a thermal debug mode… Holding Shift and FN then typing 15324 enables EC into a kind of debug mode and FN + R or FN + T pauses Ring 0 (OS Kernel, my mental memory is stale about ring levels though) execution and shoves some payload into the memory (SMBIOS? BIOS-reserved?) area to display the thermal debug pages (EC controls all thermal and SMBUS in the laptop) If the EC is completely seperate and thus has no hypervisor capability then explain this. P.s. works on older Intel architecture where those CPU control lines are exposed between the CPU and the Northbridge (MCH/PCH in some systems). The newer embedded core i# don’t seem to show the pages confirming the missing control lines even though the LED flashes to indicate the EC has entered this mode. A lot can be learnt from schematics (if available for your current model) Report comment asdf says: December 22, 2016 at 1:02 am Systems management mode can be entered via an external pin, but why do you assume that the external controller is injecting code, rather than the functionality being present in the BIOS (which is responsible for setting up the SMM handler in the first place)? Lenovo’s choices of embedded controllers are well documented on sites like ThinkWiki etc. Report comment nob says: December 20, 2016 at 1:23 pm With regards to clock throttling on C2D thinkpads, on some units when plugged into the 65W adapter, will throttle clockspeed when also plugged into a bad battery. Can be forced to full speed with throttlestop, plugging into a 90W adapter instead, getting a good battery, or all three. Cheers Report comment Reply macegr says: December 16, 2016 at 11:16 am The BeagleBone Black does have a display output, but it’s micro-HDMI so you’ll also need a special cable to connect it to a monitor. Report comment Reply erat says: December 17, 2016 at 4:53 am Another method for getting non-graphic output from a BBB is the 6-pin serial header that can output even the OS boot messages through a USB/serial dongle. It’s that thin row of unlabeled (of course) pins near one of the female headers along one side of the BBB. If you don’t need graphics, it’s definitely the way to go. Report comment Reply Richard says: December 16, 2016 at 11:37 am “Apple doesn’t have my best interests as a user in mind” In that case I think that the spirit of Steve Jobs is alive and well at Apple. He show’ed the industry two things. People want form over function and that having a walled garden is a great way to make a LOT of money. Report comment Reply Galane says: December 16, 2016 at 3:17 pm So is taking credit for other people’s work, going back to when Jobs was passing off Wozniak’s hardware wizardry as his own to Atari. Think how different things would be if Woz had gotten fed up with Jobs and split before they started Apple. Report comment Reply asdf says: December 18, 2016 at 4:22 am Without Jobs, Wozniak would likely have remained at his H&P dreamjob for the rest of his career.

Was a pretty simple process, just had to trip the write protect pins on the mobo and it was finished in an hour or two. Report comment Reply nob says: December 20, 2016 at 1:28 pm I’ve been slowly following this same adventure myself for several on/off months. Most of my headache has been the same story – piss-poor documentation that takes great assumptions in the reader’s prior knowledge, linux being linux (awful distro I won’t use, distro I would use won’t install, distro I knew worked stopped working, etc), complete ambiguity of what the next step is at several points. Trying to do it all from within windows before making the jump to linux might well just be a pipe-dream. Glad to see a post about coreboot/libreboot on HAD at least though, thanks for the write-up Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The New Linux 4.10 Kernel Features So Far: AMD Zen, TBM3, More ARM Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 16 December 2016 at 11:08 AM EST. 3 Comments Here is a look at the new features so far of the Linux 4.10 kernel, less than one week into the two-week merge window process. There is a lot of great improvements and additions to Linux 4.10, but we'll see if it ends up being a bigger release than Linux 4.9. Among the Linux 4.10 changes we have covered in the past week on Phoronix, if you're behind on your reading of our 10+ original articles per day, are the following highlights for this next kernel version: DRM / Graphics: - Yet another big DRM update including three new ARM DRM drivers. - Prep work on Intel GVT support coming together. - The i915 DRM driver has scheduler prep work and priority boosting, among many other low-level code improvements. - AMDGPU DRM has power management fixes and RPM fan information along with a new GPU VM manager. - The open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) driver is very exciting this time around with atomic mode-setting, DP MST, preliminary BOOST support for faster performance, a LED driver, and more. - The VC4 Raspberry Pi driver presents ETC1 and fragment shader threading support. - Freedreno MSM has initial support for the Qualcomm Adreno A5xx along with early 3D bits in the Freedreno Gallium3D Mesa driver. - The Linux kernel is now without any FBDEV maintainer as this subsystem continues to lose interest by most Linux kernel developers. Disk / Storage / File-System: - EXT4 DAX iomap support along with other improvements, including fscrypt changes. - DAX iomap for XFS and other improvements. There's also now a new temporary maintainer to the XFS code for the Linux kernel. - UBIFS file encryption support making use of the fscrypt framework. - A RAID5 write-back cache feature for MD along with more AVX2 optimizations. - ATA Command Priority support. - Performance tuning for F2FS. - A variety of block changes. Other Hardware: - Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support! Yes, TBM3 is finally here for benefiting Broadwell-E and future Intel CPUs. - Early support for NVIDIA's Tegra P1 / Parker SoC (Tegra 186). - There's also support for several new ARM platforms with the mainline kernel including the Samsung Exynos 5433, HiSilicon Hip07, Qualcomm Snapdragon 808/810, Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 6X, Pine64, Droid 4, PhooPlug v3, and much more. There's also better mainline support for the Raspberry Pi 3. - HDMI CEC is now mainstream rather than being within the kernel's staging area. - Various x86 laptop quirks. - OpenRISC improvements for those looking forward to this open, royalty-free processor ISA. - A mediated device interface for VFIO as part of Intel's GVT graphics virtualization support and NVIDIA is also using it as part of their vGPU support. - Microsoft Surface 3/4 touch input support. - More AMD Zen (Ryzen) code is being mainlined. Other: - Many power management updates. - The usual work from Ingo Molnar's changes, including some code related to AMD Zen. - 1,000+ staging changes. - EFI now exposes the frame-buffer configuration for localized update strings and more. Stay tuned for more Linux 4.10 coverage as the merge window remains open until right before Christmas. Once the merge window is over and the new features landed, you can begin seeing preliminary Linux 4.10 kernel benchmarks on Phoronix. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Makes Available BIOS and Drivers for NUC7i[x]BN and NUC7i[x]BK NUC Kits The drivers are only compatible with Windows 10 64-bit Dec 16, 2016 12:55 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Since Intel has recently added a new NUC kit series to its line-up, namely the NUC7i[x]BN and NUC7i[x]BK devices, we have gathered all drivers and BIOS files required by these devices to provide maximum performance and usability. To be clear about the targeted models, the producer has provided installation files for its NUC7i3BNK, NUC7i5BNK, and NUC7i7BNH Next Unit Computing kits (NUC7i[x]BN series), as well as for the NUC7i3BNH and NUC7i5BNH device models (NUC7i[x]BK series). When it comes to the available files, owners of these products can apply Intel’s Management Engine (11.6.0.1196), Rapid Storage (15.2.0.1020), Ready Mode (1.1.70.528), and Thunderbolt (16.2.55.275) chipset packages. In addition to that, Intel has also developed the devices’ Graphics (21.20.16.4541) and Ethernet (21.1) drivers, and takes care of their Bluetooth (19.01.1627.3533) and WLAN (19.20.3) capabilities as well. Last but not least, the newly-released NUC kits benefit from a Consumer IR (5.3.2.0) driver provided by ITE, ALC Audio (6.0.1.7982) and Card Reader (10.0.14393.29093) files developed by Realtek, as well as from devices’ initial BIOS (might turn up useful if future versions include bugs). As far as installation goes, except for the BIOS, to apply the available drivers, simply save and extract them one by one, run the setup.exe, and follow all instructions displayed on the screen for a complete upgrade. However, once finished, don’t forget to perform a system reboot to allow the drivers to take effect properly. If this task isn’t requested automatically, it would be a good idea to perform it manually to make sure no issues are encountered. That said, from the links below, follow the one that best describes your NUC model, apply all drivers, and constantly check our website to be aware when newer versions are available.

(AP photo) Print Email Tribune News Service By Tribune News Service The Oregonian on December 15, 2016 at 7:40 AM comments The California Energy Commission (CEC) on Wednesday passed sweeping energy efficiency standards for computers and monitors in an effort to reduce power costs, becoming the first state in the country to adopt such rules. The regulations promise to reduce energy consumed by computers by about one-third, saving ratepayers some $373 million in utility bills by 2027, and figure to have impacts far beyond California's state lines. An industry group that includes Intel and HP Inc. backed the new standards. Computers and computer monitors in the state use an estimated 5,610 gigawatts-hours of electricity, representing up to 3 percent of residential electricity use and 7 percent of commercial use. ""Such efficiency improvements are good for consumers, good for the electric system, good for the environment and frankly good for the green credentials of the manufacturers," said Andrew McAllister, a CEC commissioner who helped guide the new rules through a four-year process of consultations with industry that culminated in Wednesday's 5-0 vote in Sacramento. "There's a lot of substance to like here." The first tranche of the new standards will start Jan. 1, 2018, to be completed in stages by July 1, 2021. One of the rules' chief targets is desktop computers, which use about four times as much power as a typical laptop (or notebook) computer. Sometimes called "energy vampires" by efficiency experts, desktops are switched on 77 percent of the time but sit idle for 61 percent of those minutes, according to a recent study from a University of California Irvine research team. Under the new rules, desktops must reduce their power-draw by about 30 percent when idle by the beginning of 2019 and nearly 50 percent by mid-2021. Most computer monitors will also be affected, with the new rules establishing thresholds for the amount of power a monitor or display can consume, even when they are in sleep mode. The standards also apply to laptops but it's estimated about 73 percent of notebook computers on the market already meet the rules' requirements. By 2021, the CEC estimates the new rules make the cost of each desktop about $14 more expensive but said consumers will save more than $55 over five years in reduced energy bills. Monitors will cost about $5 more but are expected to lead to $30 in savings over seven years. Laptops will cost about $1 more but energy savings in four years, the CEC said, is about twice that amount. The Consumer Federation of America praised the regulations and said the percentages in cost savings more than make up for the increase in prices. "Believe me, the average consumer who can barely get 2 percent on his CD today, that's a pretty darn good investment," said Mark Cooper, the federation's director of research in a teleconference after the commission passed the rules. Representatives from Intel and HP Inc. also took part in the teleconference, with HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford calling the energy limits "ambitious but achievable." The CEC has emphasized that manufacturers will have flexibility to meet the standards. "It's been a very good process that has led to, I think, a very good rule," Ford said. The rules apply only to computers in California but the sheer size of the state's share of the computer market is so formidable -- California by itself accounts for 25 million computer monitors, 23 million laptops and 21 million desktops -- the new standards will have ripple effects across the country and beyond. "It will have a global impact and significantly change the way future energy-efficient desktops and all-in-one computers are designed and manufactured," said Andrea Deveau, vice president of state policy and politics for Tech Net, a trade group that counts Cisco and Microsoft among its members. "It was never taken lightly and it is definitely an historic rule-making." But Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank based in Los Angeles, questioned the CEC's cost savings estimates and said consumers already have a built-in incentive to buy energy-efficient computers in order to keep their utility bills low. "It's always easy to say, hey, this is a really cheap way for people to save a lot of money but for some reason, (consumers) just aren't doing it," Moore said. "So we, the energy commission being all wise and powerful here in Sacramento, can make this happen for them. Because we know as the energy commission, we know far more about computer markets than dumb old computer makers, much less dumb old computer consumers." The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental group, worked closely with the CEC to develop the new standards. Pierre Delforge, the group's director of high-tech sector energy efficiency, said the savings estimates are "relatively conservative" and said the rules will lead to huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, helping California meet its aggressive climate goals. "The standards are strong and they will lead manufacturers to design significantly more efficient products than they would have otherwise," Delforge said. "When advocates work together with industry to reduce the energy use of their products, save consumers money while cutting pollution and carbon emissions, what's not to like?" By CEC estimates, the efficiency standards will save 2,332 gigawatt-hours per year -- the equivalent of the power used by households in San Francisco and San Luis Obispo counties combined. -- San Diego Union-Tribune Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Also attending the session Wednesday at Trump Tower were leaders from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, Oracle, IBM, Cisco and Tesla -- many of whom actively opposed his election. "I found today's meeting with the president-elect, his transition team and tech leaders to be very productive," Bezos told CNBC on Wednesday. "I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech -- agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -- everywhere." Trump often has been critical of Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, but they were civil Wednesday. "We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation," Trump said of those attending in a press briefing before the meeting. "There's no one like you in the world....anything we can do to help this go along, we're going to be there for you. You can call my people, call me — it makes no difference — we have no formal chain of command around here." The meeting was organized by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and PayPal and Palantir co-founder and Trump transition adviser Peter Thiel. Also in attendance were Trump's three grown children -- Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric -- as well as billionaire Wilbur Ross, his commerce secretary pick, and Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, his selection for director of the National Economic Council. "I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come here to this meeting," Trump said. "And I will say Peter [Thiel] was saying, 'No, that company's too small,' and these are monster companies. But I want to start by thanking Peter, because he saw something very early, maybe before we saw it. And of course, he's known for that... he's ahead of the curve." Topics included jobs, skilled immigration and China, a person familiar with what was discussed told CNBC on Wednesday. "They're going to do fair trade deals," Trump said. "They're going to make it easier for you to trade across borders, because there are a lot of restrictions, a lot of problems. If you have any ideas on that, that would be great." Other attendees were two of Trump's economic advisers: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. "This is a truly amazing group of people," Trump said from the 25th-floor conference room before the press departed from the 90-minute meeting. None of the executives spoke to the media after the meeting. No one from Twitter was invited. Twitter declined to comment on why, but one of his campaign officials wrote on Medium that Twitter had killed a #CrookedHillary emoji. Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Trump, said Twitter was left out because of space considerations.

It looks like the platonic ideal of a Windows 10 touchscreen laptop: simple, black, well-made, light, and just ready to quietly get out of the way and let you do your thing. And the emphasis is on "quietly," because the Spin 7 doesn’t have any fans. Even with its hefty asking price of $1,249, it still makes a very good first impression. Sadly, if you’ve been paying attention to laptops for the past six months you know that there’s going to be a "but." Because with the possible exception of the new HP Spectre x360, every new laptop these days has one or several critical flaws that keep it from reaching its potential. In this case, it’s several. The closest analogue to Acer’s Spin 7 isn’t some other Windows laptop, it’s actually the 2016 MacBook. Like the MacBook, the Spin 7 is focused on being hyper mobile and almost tablet-esque in its design. That means that there are no fans here, just wonderfully quiet, appliance-like computing. It’s less than half an inch thick and weighs just over two and a half pounds. It's trying to be a Windows version of the MacBook Comparing them head to head, I actually can’t say one is better designed overall than the other. Where the MacBook is thin to the point of ridiculousness, the Spin 7 has squared-off edges that give it that sense of solidity without much weight. It’s not festooned with garish treatments to the case: it’s just matte black almost everywhere. The only flourish is a silver border around the surprisingly large touchpad. The Spin 7 is made of aluminum which looks great until you put human hands on it, at which point it becomes a showcase for fingerprints and palm prints. Both computers also share the same processor, an Intel chip that’s underpowered compared to other computers but might just be powerful enough for most of your regular computing tasks. Neither is necessarily slow for stuff like chatting and web browsing, but do too much on either machine and they’ll bog down. (I could go on a rant about how Intel’s decision to rename this Core M processor to Core i7 is some real dissembling garbage, but I will leave that for another time.) The comparisons should end there, though. Because even though the Spin 7 is more directly competitive with Apple’s ultra-mobile laptop than anything else I’ve seen, it still deserves to be taken on its own terms. Mainly because it has a touchscreen on a hinge that can wrap all the way around. And just as the overall design is simple and reserved, so is this hinge. It works, you won’t have to think or worry about it. But now the buts, and they are myriad. The most egregious is battery life — it is not good. In our looping website test, the Spin 7 conked out at a little under six hours, which is well below what’s acceptable for a laptop in 2016. And real-world usage mirrored that result for me, I found myself filled with battery anxiety constantly, quitting apps and riding the screen brightness toggle down well before lunch on most days. The Spin 7 uses USB-C ports for everything (well, there is a headphone jack). Like the Yoga 910, Acer has used two different variations of USB-C so that only one can drive a display, but thankfully either can be used for power or USB things. And Acer did us the favor of including both a USB and HDMI adapter in the box. There isn’t an SD card slot and it doesn’t support Thunderbolt 3, but I’m not too worked up about either thing in an ultra-mobile computer in this class. Battery life is bad, the trackpad is buggy, and there's no backlight on the keyboard The keyboard has much better key travel than new MacBooks, but Acer made the mystifying decision to omit backlighting on the keys. It’s great to type on, but backlighting a keyboard is expected these days, especially for a computer that costs north of $1,000. The trackpad, as I mentioned, is very large. Mousing around on such a wide surface is great. Sadly, Acer didn’t do the necessary work on the drivers. Its palm rejection is downright atrocious, for one thing. For another, I find that sometimes when I switch between tablet and laptop modes the touchpad straight up doesn’t start working again. There’s a mysterious button on the keyboard for toggling the touchpad on and off. When I first saw it I wondered why the heck Acer would bother including such a button. Having experienced those two issues, it seems obvious to me it’s a kludge kind of fix to deal with those two issues. I could go on with everything else there is to know about the Spin 7, like the 1080p HD screen or the included software or whatever else. But the poor showing on battery life and the inconsistent trackpad have put me off this machine, and it will do the same for you. It’s too bad, too, because if you asked me in the abstract what I would want out of a Windows 10 laptop, I would describe this machine almost exactly. There is a market for a super thin, light, and elegant touchscreen laptop out there. One that is just powerful enough to get the job done, but not so powerful you have to deal with reduced battery life or fans. When you’re designing computers, diligently paying attention to the details matters just as much as having the right ideas. The Spin 7 is the kid in class who is really smart but waits until the last minute to do his homework, and the result is a disappointing mix of brilliance and sloppy work. You know the kid could pull off an A, but you shake your head and write "not working up to potential" at the top of his report before ruefully marking it with a big, red C.

But all that could change with Ryzen. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | December 14, 2016 -- 17:18 GMT (09:18 PST) | Topic: Hardware AMD Ryzen For the past decade Intel has ruled the processor roost. Sure, AMD has had a few minor hits, but they were never enough to get the company off the back foot and making real progress. But in 2017 that could all change with Ryzen. ZDNet: Chipmakers announce 7nm technology | TechRepublic: Next generation processors will require Microsoft Windows 10 | Tech Pro Research: Dell PowerEdge R830 review: Four into two does go Ryzen is the name for AMD's upcoming high-performance desktop processors based on the company's "Zen" core architecture (previously codenamed "Summit Ridge"). Ryzen chips built using 14-nanometer architecture will make their way into high-performance desktop and notebook systems, beginning in the first quarter of 2017. So what's special about Ryzen? A claimed increase of greater than 40 percent in instructions per clock, that's what. At the core of this is a technology that AMD calls SenseMI, which itself consists of five separate features: Pure Power: more than 100 embedded sensors with accuracy to the millivolt, milliwatt, and single degree level of temperature enable optimal voltage, clock frequency, and operating mode with minimal energy consumption; Precision Boost: smart logic that monitors integrated sensors and optimizes clock speeds, in increments as small as 25MHz, at up to a thousand times a second; Extended Frequency Range (XFR): when the system senses added cooling capability, XFR raises the Precision Boost frequency to enhance performance; Neural Net Prediction: an artificial intelligence neural network that learns to predict what future pathway an application will take based on past runs; Smart Prefetch: sophisticated learning algorithms that track software behavior to anticipate the needs of an application and prepare the data in advance. "The 'Zen' core at the heart of our Ryzen processors is the result of focused execution and thousands of engineering hours designing and delivering a next-level experience for high-end PC and workstation users," said AMD President and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. "Ryzen processors with SenseMI technology represent the bold and determined spirit of innovation that drives everything we do at AMD." Build your own $4,250 10-core PC SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 9 NEXT PREV While all we have are demos to go on at the moment, Ryzen seems pretty impressive, with AMD claiming that a 95-watt TDP Ryzen processor at 3.4 GHz without boost can "match or outperform" a 140-watt TDP Intel Core i7 6900K ran at stock processor speed and boost when it comes to image rendering and video transcoding. "If you look at 2017, I don't think we've seen anything this exciting since, honestly, back towards the '90s," said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics business, who was referring back to the AMD K6 series of processors. Ryzen will need a new socket -- the AM4 -- which means new motherboards, but support for the new silicon will also bring to the table DDR4 and PCIe gen 3 support, as well as USB 3.1 gen 2, NVMe, and SATA Express storage options. Now we need to see how Intel responds with its Kaby Lake processors line. Possible counters to AMD are a core boost or a price cut, but with Ryzen now effectively weeks away, Intel might find finally itself on the back foot.

Dec 15, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dashlane, the award-winning password manager and leader in online identity management, announces its participation in the #TurnOn2FA two-factor authentication awareness campaign. The campaign, which is in support of the White House's Cybersecurity National Action Plan, seeks to empower consumers to add a level of security to their account with two-factor authentication. Dashlane will promote the campaign, which was created by Intel® and TeleSign. Two-factor authentication is one of the strongest security steps consumers can take to protect their online accounts from fraud, hacks, and other cyber-criminal activity, yet many are either unaware of what it is, or unsure how to implement it. The #TurnOn2FA campaign seeks to educate the broader public about the benefits this additional security step provides. "Dashlane is a firm believer that users should use two-factor authentication for all of their accounts," states Dashlane CEO Emmanuel Schailt. "As the first and only password manager to support the FIDO Alliance's Universal Second Factor (U2F) standard, Dashlane is committed to raising awareness on the need for two–factor implementation for both consumers and businesses." "Two-factor authentication is an important consideration to stay safe in today's digital climate. We are pleased with the support of this security education awareness program. Intel is active in educating consumers on simple and secure methods to protect their everyday digital lives," states Rick Echevarria, Vice President, Software and Services Group and General Manager, Platform Security Division for Intel. The value of two-factor authentication is the added layer of account security it provides. It drastically reduces the likelihood your account can be compromised as it adds a second layer of verification someone must authenticate, such as a mobile phone, before they can access your account. Dashlane provides two-factor authentication when users want to authorize a new device. The company also has partnership with Yubico, a leader in authentication hardware keys, to provide multifactor logins, both on the Dashlane application and other websites. As part of the awareness campaign, consumers are invited to take a pledge to add two-factor authentication to their accounts.  Participants in the pledge will also be entered into an associated contest if they turn on two-factor for at least one of their accounts and tweet with the hashtags #TURNON2FA and #2FA4Pizza. Winners will be chosen at random each week and prizes will be delivered in the form of one grand prize Lenovo® Yoga 910 with 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processor first prize, and 40 $15 Pizza Hut™ gift card second prizes per week.

Market The company is aiming its Radeon Instinct graphics cards at deep learning. Success is far from guaranteed. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Dec 15, 2016 at 8:10AM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines on Monday with the introduction of Radeon Instinct, a line of GPU accelerators aimed specifically at deep learning systems. The company has offered products targeting data centers and high-performance computing for years with its FirePro graphics cards. But Radeon Instinct, along with the MIOpen open-source software that AMD announced alongside the new products, marks a shift in the company's strategy. Image source: AMD. Radeon Instinct will come in three flavors. The MI6 is based on AMD's Polaris GPU architecture, which powers the mainstream gaming graphics cards the company launched earlier this year. This card is aimed at neural network inference, where a trained neural network is used for an application. The MI8 is based on AMD's old Fiji architecture, featuring greater processing power and memory bandwidth, but a quarter of the memory. This card is also likely aimed at inference. The MI25 is the big daddy of the bunch. Built around AMD's upcoming Vega GPU architecture, which will power the company's high-end gaming graphics cards next year, the MI25 offers a whopping 25 TFLOPs of half-precision floating-point performance. This card is aimed at neural network training, a more computationally intensive process than inference. For comparison, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) P100 Tesla GPU clocks in at 21.2 TFLOPS in the best-case scenario, using the company's homegrown NVLink technology instead of standard PCIe. Radeon Instinct products are expected to begin shipping during the first half of 2017. This news comes about one month after AMD scored a big data center win, with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announcing that it would integrate the company's FirePro graphics cards into its cloud platform. Despite this apparent momentum, AMD remains far behind NVIDIA in the data center market generally and the A.I. acceleration market specifically. With additional competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)and even Google itself, it won't be smooth sailing for AMD. NVIDIA's dominance NVIDIA has been talking about deep learning for years. The company's data center business is booming thanks to that early focus, closing in on a $1 billion annual run rate after tripling revenue year-over-year during the third quarter. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs are already offered by most of the major cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud. AMD's GPUs are absent from all three. Google will be adding NVIDIA's GPUs to its cloud platform along with AMD's, so while that announcement was a big win for AMD, it was also a win for NVIDIA. According to an analyst at Nomura, NVIDIA enjoys an 80% share of the accelerator market. A vast amount of software has been ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs, ranging from computational finance to scientific simulations, creating switching costs for those already using its products. The market for A.I. acceleration is still in its infancy, meaning that AMD is not incapable of catching up. But NVIDIA has a clear lead. Intel and Google Intel has been trying to break into the accelerator market for years with its Xeon Phi line of products. The most recent, Knights Landing, has the advantage of acting as the main processor as well, offering customers potential costs savings. Intel stated earlier this year that it was aiming to move 100,000 units in 2016, a number that would make the product a major force in the accelerator market. Intel is planning to launch a version of Xeon Phi, Knights Mill, aimed specifically at deep learning. Knights Mill will also feature the ability to act as the main processor when it launches next year, giving NVIDIA some serious competition in the A.I. acceleration market in addition to AMD's upcoming products. Image source: Intel. Google may pose a threat to all three companies in the long run. The search giant announced earlier this year that it had designed an application-specific-integrated-circuit in an effort to accelerate deep learnings tasks. Google is reportedly using more than 1,000 of the Tensor Processing Units in its data centers already. In the same way that a GPU is more efficient than a CPU at graphics processing because it's designed at the hardware level for the kind of math involved, Google's TPU is more efficient than a GPU for inference because it's designed at the hardware level for that task. Google claims that its TPUs provide and order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt compared to GPUs. Late to a party that could end early AMD is playing catch up when it comes to deep learning. Like NVIDIA, AMD is betting that GPUs are the future of A.I. acceleration. But ASICs like Google's TPU could upend both companies' long-term plans. If other cloud computing vendors move to design their own custom chips for deep learning, the GPU vendors could be left out in the cold. AMD's Radeon Instinct is the company's first real attempt at going after NVIDIA in the A.I. acceleration market. If the company can price the cards competitively, it could be a very profitable endeavor. But the threat of Intel is looming, and the potential for custom chips to eventually displace GPUs is very real. AMD investors should be happy that the company is taking deep learning seriously. But they also shouldn't get ahead of themselves. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Its ADS1000 uses hardened Ethernet to have array network access latency cut to <3 µS for a round trip. That’s fast. Fast Ethernet with no stack obstruction is Apeiron's tech approach. We’ve been asking NVMe over fabrics vendors and startups about their fast fabric access, giving them the chance to show off their technology, and so we interviewed Apeiron to find out how it sees the fast array access world. A crucial question for fast access array storage buyers is this: hardened Ethernet technology or NVMe over fabrics RDMA technology? This interview is Apeiron presenting its case for hardened Ethernet. El Reg: Will simply moving from SAS/SATA SSDs to NVMe drives bottleneck existing array controllers? Apeiron: Absolutely. Architectures based upon classic storage controllers will see little/no gain from NVMe. The storage controller is the bottleneck, so providing faster raw storage behind the bottleneck will not do much. Classic storage controller based arrays will show no performance improvement with the next generation of storage class memory (Intel’s 3D XPoint technology) either. The Apeiron architecture provides a platform with less than 1.5 µS of protocol overhead (today’s NAND based SSD solutions are typically 100 µS). The Apeiron ADS1000 storage architecture eliminates the controller performance bottleneck by leveraging the data management capabilities inherent in today’s scale-out applications. Apeiron storage management (Virtual Volumes, mirrors, etc.) uses a small amount of CPU on each application server. Data storage transfers are hardware-accelerated to minimise CPU loading. This architecture exposes all of the performance available in NVMe SSDs directly to the applications, while scaling with no performance degradation. El Reg: Must we wait for next-generation controllers with much faster processing? Apeiron: That would help, although, the classic storage controller architecture is the real problem. CPU performance is still only doubling every 18 months while storage technology performance has increased by orders of magnitude. HDDs achieved latencies in the 100ms range, NVMe flash SSDs offer 100us and storage class memory based SSDs will be in the 10us range. The only way the application can really take advantage of this performance in a networked storage solution is to get the CPU complex out of the data path. That’s the approach Apeiron has taken. We architected the solution to support extremely fast storage devices such as Intel’s 3D XPoint technology. El Reg: Will we need affordable dual-port NVMe drives so array controllers can provide HA? Apeiron: No. Today’s scale-out applications provide storage HA through replication. Dual-port drives will limit the performance, and therefore the value of NVMe. Scale-out applications such as Splunk have the inherent capability to manage their own replication and protection. No storage controller is required. El Reg: Why did Apeiron take this very different design approach? Apeiron: We recognised several years ago that the world of storage was heading for a huge disruption. Several forces were converging that would demand a new storage architecture. The first was the industry pivot from developing scale-up to scale-out applications. These applications are architected for loosely coupled parallel processing. The server is the basic scale-out hardware element and many of these applications are designed for real-time performance. They manage their own storage. The second was the dramatic increase in persistent storage performance through flash and storage class memory components running over NVMe. Lastly, since storage management is handled by the application, a storage controller just adds cost and gets in the way of device performance. We realised that the value proposition for the classic storage array in these markets was dead and that a new, light-weight, very simple, very fast network architecture was required. El Reg: How does your storage network compare to NVMeF? Apeiron: These solutions are complementary, but address different market segments. Apeiron is working to address the need to provide externally attached, pooled NVMe storage features to what was traditionally Direct Attached Storage (DAS or scale-out). NVMeF is addressing the need for data centres to disaggregate storage and access disparate storage silos/tiers. It evolved from need to “include” the data centre storage solutions in the market today, and therefore must cover a larger swath of these legacy solutions. While they will need to have common IT management capabilities they are very different in how they are implemented. NVMeF is making use of RDMA over various transport protocols. It is designed to work over any transport layer, and defines a rich feature set. It is a more complex protocol which requires more storage processing. This architecture still leads to “storage box” centred solutions. NVMe SSD commands must be rebuilt on the storage side but provides additional storage capabilities. For Apeiron these capabilities are provided by the application, OS and application CPU complex (versus a storage controller). Apeiron’s products are designed around server or application storage management. We simply tunnel native NVMe commands over a hardened layer 2-40Gbit Ethernet network. Apeiron is moving PCIe TLPs (Transaction Layer Packets), the same NVMe commands a SSD sees if installed internally on the PCIe bus. Each server must track only a small number of connections, enabling the system to scale to 1000’s of drives without performance degradation. To realise the potential of NVMe, and especially technologies such as Intel’s 3D XPoint technology, you must have an ultra-fast network and lightweight protocol. Apeiron’s total induced latency is <3 µS round trip. Server-class NVMe drives on the horizon will be under 10 µS of latency. Apeiron passes this entire performance gain directly to the application. These products will co-exist in the market and may overlap in some use cases in the future as capabilities expand. Of course, the most important point is that Apeiron is shipping product today. El Reg: How does your storage network scale? How big can your storage network get? Apeiron: The Apeiron storage network is designed for low cost scale-out. Each ADS1000 storage enclosure integrates 32 x 40Gbit Ethernet switch ports for external connections. To add a server you simply connect HBA ports to the ADS1000 switch ports. Adding ADS1000s is just a matter of connecting cables between boxes. The system scales to 100s of servers and Petabytes of storage before any external switches would be required for rack to rack connectivity. We have a partner who is using these top of rack switches to network thousands of servers to our storage. El Reg: How do you see the NVMe external storage solutions evolving over the next few years? Apeiron: Increasingly applications are moving towards real-time analysis of massive datasets using artificial intelligence. To avoid data centre sprawl external NVMe solutions must be able to scale while continuing to increase IOPs and lower latencies. Apeiron saw this need coming back in 2013 with the growth of NOSQL in-memory databases. While these solutions were very successful, once datasets grew to roughly 10 TB or ~100 servers, direct-attached storage led to excessive hardware and management costs. This is the challenge of scale-out architectures and the reason many are moving to using external NVMe storage solutions. These applications are now evolving to use multiple types of NVMe storage. In one application, you may need to use server-class memory for metadata, MLC (2 bits/cell) flash for hot working data, and TLC (3bits/cell) or QLC (4bits/cell) for longer term read-only data. The ADS1000 was designed to support all of these NVMe SSD classes in one environment. Comment Apeiron’s array is easier to adopt than an NVMe over fabrics array, in general, but its differentiation versus the expected flood of NVMe over fabrics arrays will need maintaining so customers see the difference, and the worth of the difference. If we come across a customer story that shows this, particularly one about the partner who is using these top of rack switches to network thousands of servers to our storage, then we’ll run that. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register Splunk slam dunk as FC SAN sunk by NVMe hulk Case study ESG says Apeiron NVMe array delivers real time Splunk goods 7 Comments Flashy startup Apeiron wipes Splunk floor with XtremIO... says Apeiron IO-bound Big Data apps love NVMe over fabrics 3 Comments Let's talk about NVMe, let's talk to Dell EMC: Let's talk about $1bn baby DSSD Interview Ecosystem's maturation will provide D5 springboard next year NVMe SSD?

Political Reporter For Dailymail.com and Reuters Published: 23:54 EST, 14 December 2016 | Updated: 08:39 EST, 15 December 2016 e-mail 71 shares 119 View comments Twitter has been snubbed by Donald Trump after the social media company was left off an invitation list for a roundtable meeting with Silicon Valley executives. Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla founder Elon Musk were among the biggest names present on Wednesday as the President-elect attempted to smooth over frictions after a contentious presidential campaign. But the omission of Twitter from the meeting surprised some in the industry given Trump's prolific use of the social media platform during his election campaign. Twitter was left off the invitation list because it is too small, according to a spokesman for Trump's transition team  'They weren't invited because they aren't big enough,' the transition official said. With a market capitalization of $13.85 billion, Twitter is smaller than Facebook and Amazon - companies that were both included in the meeting in New York. The smallest company in attendance was electric car maker Tesla, with a market capitalization of $31.92 billion.  However, Yahoo! which is worth about $33bn was not on the list, neither was AOL.  Uber and Airbnb were both invited to yesterday's meeting but did not attend.

Trump leveraged his sizable following on Twitter to circumvent traditional media to speak directly to the public and to bash his opponents.  During the Obama administration, Twitter was a regular participant in meetings meant to address technology concerns, especially given its use by groups such as Islamic State and the ease with which the site is used for online bullying. One source familiar with Trump's relationship with Twitter said the decision to exclude Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey was motivated by the president-elect's ire at the company, which rejected an advertising deal with his campaign in October.

Share this article Share 71 shares Trump's election campaign had offered to pay to have an emoji that would show up on tweets during the second presidential debate anytime Twitter users tweeted the phrase "#Crooked Hillary", which was Trump's nickname for his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Twitter rejected the deal, saying it might mislead users who would not be able to tell that the campaign had paid for the emoji. The Trump spokesman said the emoji had nothing to do with the invitation omission.  The official said Trump has had public spats with other tech leaders who were invited, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, who hosted a fundraiser for Clinton. Trump, speaking to the group of technology officials at the meeting, acknowledged others had been left off the list, but he did not mention Twitter specifically. During the meeting he called the group gathered 'amazing' and then boasted about the stock market 'bounce' that followed his election, which helped many of the businesses represented in the room.    'So right now everybody in this room has to like me – at least a little bit,' Trump told the crowd.  'But we're going to try and have that bounce continue,' Trump pledged.  The CEOs of Airbnb and Uber were invited but did not attend Wednesday's gathering. Uber's Travis Kalanick is traveling in India all week, although he will be joining Trump's strategy and policy forum.  Donald Trump entertained a number of Silicon Valley CEO's and bosses including Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg Donald Trump (left) thanked his one Silicon Valley backer, Peter Thiel (right), who brought a number of tech titans to Trump Tower today 'Right now everybody in this room has to like me - at least a little bit,' said Donald Trump to tech executives including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel (center) and Apple CEO Tim Cook (right)  Oracle's CEO Safra Catz, one of the top women in tech, attended today's meeting at Trump Tower, along with top executives from Facebook, Tesla, Google and IBM  The president-elect's children: Donald Jr. (left), Ivanka (middle) and Eric Trump (right) sat through the meeting today with Silicon Valley bigwigs Donald Trump's three adult children including Eric Trump (left) and Ivanka Trump (right) attended the meeting today with Silicon Valley leaders, again raising questions about the role they will play in both the Trump White House and the handling of the Trump business empire  Donald Trump's incoming economic adviser Gary Cohn (left), the current president of Goldman Sachs, along with Trump's commerce pick Wilbur Ross, sat through today's meeting with Silicon Valley's top brass  United States President-elect Donald Trump, US Vice President-elect Mike Pence, cabinet nominees and technology company chiefs are seen at the meeting Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg (left) attended a meeting for Silicon Valley executives alongside Vice President-elect Mike Pence (center) and Donald Trump (right) While Mark Zuckerberg skipped the meeting, Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg (left) attended, as did Jeff Bezos (right) of Amazon and the Washington Post. Trump was critical of the Post's coverage through the campaign  It was Peter Thiel, Trump's one prominent Silicon Valley backer, that brought the tech titans and the president-elect face-to-face.  Safra Catz, the CEO of Oracle, had been the first to arrive at Trump Tower, after issuing a statement setting out what she, and likely the others, were likely to say.  'If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever,' Catz said in a statement. Soon after Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos arrived. He's also the owner of the Washington Post, one of the many media outlets that Trump took issue with during his presidential campaign.  Other attendees included Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Palantier's Alex Karp, Intel's Brian Krzanich, Cisco's Chuck Robbins, IBM's Ginni Rometty and Saya Nadella of Microsoft.  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates paid the president-elect a visit yesterday at Trump Tower.  Reporters were briefly led into the room, in which Trump hosted the tech titans, along with his three adult kids, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.  The adult children's presence comes at a time when their expanded role is sparking controversy, as they were originally supposed to be charged with handling Trump's business ventures while he was in the White House.   Trump's Vice President-elect Mike Pence, adviser Steve Bannon, incoming chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, commerce secretary pick Wilbur Ross and economic adviser selection Gary Cohn, were also in attendance. Trump kicked off the meeting by complimenting Thiel.  'He got about just the biggest applause at the Republican National Convention,' Trump said.  'He's ahead of the curve. And I want to thank you. You're a very special guy,' Trump added, grabbing the hand of Thiel, who was sitting on his left-hand side.  The president-elect then addressed the full group.   First arrival: Safra Catz, the CEO of Oracle, was the first of the tech giant bosses to arrive at Trump Tower Amazon.com's CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, arrived for a meeting with Donald Trump today at Trump Tower  Google giants Larry Page (left), now the CEO of the search engine's parent company Alphabet, and Eric Schmidt (right), the chairman of Alphabet, are spotted arriving at a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump  Tesla's Elon Musk (right) participated in a roundtable meeting with President-elect Donald Trump and met with him personally after the big meet-and-greet  Ginni Rometty, the president and CEO of IBM, was among the Silicon Valley titans spending time with President-elect Donald Trump and his team today in New York   Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was spotted leaving a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump and his team at Trump Tower today in New York.

Trump was referring to the post-election bounce on the stock market. 'They're all talking about the bounce,' he repeated.  Trump said the most important thing was 'we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation.'  'There's nobody like you in the world, in the world. There's nobody like the people in this room,' the president-elect told the titans. HOW MUCH ARE TRUMP'S TECH EXECUTIVES WORTH?  Elon Musk (CEO, Tesla) $11.5 billion Tim Cook (CEO, Apple) $503 million Larry Page (CEO, Alphabet) $40.7 billion Eric Schmidt (Executive Chairman, Alphabet) $11.5 billion   Jeff Bezos (CEO, Amazon) 66.9 billion Sheryl Sandberg (COO, Facebook) $1.27 billion  Safra Catz (CEO, Oracle) $525 million  Satya Nadella (CEO, Microsoft) $84 million  Brian Krzanich (CEO, Intel) $14.6 million Chuck Robbins (CEO, Cisco) $17 million (base yearly salary)  Ginni Rometty (CEO, IBM) $45 million Peter Thiel (PayPal founder) $2.7 billion Donald Trump (president-elect) $3.7 billion   Trump pledged to be there for Silicon Valley and make it easier for American companies to trade.  'And you'll call my people, you'll call me. It doesn't make any difference,' Trump continued. 'We have no formal chain of command over here.'    After several minutes, reporters were ushered out of the room.   Attendees, like Sandberg, will likely bring up their own priorities like strong encryption and liability protections from content shared by their users. The meeting was billed as an introductory session, said four sources briefed on the talks, all of whom requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. Early reviews of the meeting suggested it went as well as it could.  Bezos labeled the get-together 'productive,' according to Politico.   'I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech – agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing – everywhere,' the Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner said in a statement.    Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his surprise victory last month alarmed many companies that feared he might follow through on his pledges.  He has said that many tech companies are overvalued by investors. 'You look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they're selling for so much money,' he told Reuters in an interview in May. Those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks as Trump has threatened to upset trade relationships with China, a key market for US tech companies, and appoint officials who favor expanded surveillance programs. 'For some of the companies, there was some hesitation about whether to attend' because of sharp political and personal differences with Trump, one tech industry source said. Nearly 600 employees of technology companies pledged in an open letter on Tuesday to refuse to help Trump's administration build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations. Silicon Valley enjoyed a warm rapport with President Barack Obama and heavily supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign. Schmidt was photographed on election night at Clinton headquarters wearing a staff badge, and Musk said in interviews before the election that Trump's character reflected poorly on the United States. Musk was quoted saying that Trump 'is probably not the right guy' to be president of the United States.  Despite those tensions, Trump named Musk to a business advisory council that will give private-sector input to Trump after he takes office on January 20. Uber's Kalanick was also appointed to the council. Invitation: Trump's move to reach out to Silicon Valley also saw Elon Musk and Uber's Travis Kalanick appointed to his business advisory council Not attending: Travis Kalanick, of Uber, is in India but was named to Trump's business advisory panel Tech mogul Peter Thiel, a Trump supporter who spoke at the GOP convention, helped organize the Silicon Valley get-together From the employees of the 10 largest Fortune 500 tech companies, Trump raised just $179,400 from 982 campaign donors who contributed more than $200.  Clinton raised $4.4 million from the employees of the same companies, with more than 20,400 donations, a Reuters review of contribution data found. Trump publicly bashed the industry during the campaign. He urged his supporters to boycott Apple products over the company's refusal to help the FBI unlock an iPhone associated with last year's San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon and demanded that tech companies build their products in the United States. In another attack on Bezos, he suggested that the Amazon CEO was using is ownership of The Washington Post as a tax-dodging 'scam.'  He also got in a spat with Facebook's Zuckerberg over immigration.   Trump has also been an opponent of the Obama administration's net neutrality rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing consumer access to web content.  Two advisers to his Federal Communications Commission transition team are opponents of the rules, as are the two Republicans on the FCC. Last week, the two Republicans on the panel urged a quick reversal of many Obama policies and one, Commissioner Ajit Pai, said he believed that net neutrality's 'days are numbered.'

Breaking News CNN Toggle Search Search Election Results Nation World Our Team CNN.com House Intel Chair blasts spy agencies for delaying Hill briefing on Russian hack By Deirdre Walsh, CNN Senior Congressional Producer Updated 4:47 PM ET, Thu December 15, 2016 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights Nunes' committee reached out to four federal agencies on Tuesday for an Intel briefing The Director of National Intelligence said top administration officials have been giving regular briefings (CNN)House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, who is heading up the House probe on Russia's efforts to interfere with the US election, called the decision by the Intelligence Community -- which is run by appointees of President Barack Obama -- to delay a briefing for his panel on the issue "unacceptable." He also suggested the spy agencies were playing politics. "The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes. The Committee will continue its efforts and will insist that we receive all the necessary cooperation from the relevant leaders of the Intelligence Community," Nunes said in a statement late Wednesday. Nunes' committee reached out to four federal agencies on Tuesday -- the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence -- to summon them to brief the committee Thursday. But the CIA told the panel that it was too busy working on the investigation that Obama ordered to brief the members of the committee, according to a source familiar with the discussions. James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, said in a written statement that top administration officials have been giving regular classified briefings to those on Capitol Hill since the summer, when information emerged about Russia's actions to access accounts of Democratic operatives and campaign committee computer systems. He also indicated that his team is focused on the putting together the report commissioned by the President. The other agencies declined to respond to the committee, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Read More "Once the review is complete in the coming weeks, the Intelligence Community stands ready to brief Congress and will make those findings available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods. We will not offer any comment until the review is complete," Clapper said. CNN earlier reported that multiple sources with knowledge of the investigation into Russia's hacking say the US intelligence community is increasingly confident that Russian meddling in the US election was intended to steer the election toward Trump, rather than simply to undermine or in other ways disrupt the political process. In recent days, more information has emerged about the CIA's assessment that the hacking by Russia during the 2016 campaign was done to specifically help Donald Trump win the presidential election. That news has reignited calls from top members of Congress for an aggressive investigation to learn more details and determine steps to avoid future cyberthreats. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, has urged for a joint House-Senate bipartisan probe on Russia's actions, but House Speaker Paul Ryan has backed Nunes' efforts to keep the House investigation under his committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats on Capitol Hill have also urged the creation of an outside bipartisan commission, similar to the one created after the 9/11 terror attacks, to examine the cyber-attacks from Russia. Pelosi re-upped her call for a probe outside Congress on Thursday, citing reports of the involvement of Russian President Vladimir Putin, "given the alarming magnitude, seriousness and scope of Russia's efforts to undermine U.S. elections, we must have an independent, bipartisan investigation to protect the integrity of our democracy." Like Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes existing committees can handle the investigation so it's unlikely the GOP-led Congress will sign off on additional reviews. The Senate Intelligence committee, led by North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, is looking into the issue, and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services panel, announced he would investigate cyberwarfare and Russian hacking operations. But McCain joined South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, along with the incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democrat on his committee, Sen. Jack Reed, in calling that all efforts by Congress in what they view as a national security issue be bipartisan. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN Thursday that even though Trump has disputed the role of Russia in the election, he believes it's important to continue the effort that is "prompt, bipartisan, not re-litigating the election, but aimed at deterring and defending against this kind of cyberespionage and cyberattack in the future."

Nvidia Takes Self-Driving Journey to California Roads By Richard Adhikari Dec 15, 2016 1:26 PM PT Nvidia last week began test-driving autonomous cars on California roads, after the state's Department of Motor Vehicles gave it the green light, according to The Verge. The company is testing its Drive PX2 autonomous driving platform, said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Nvidia recently has made several well publicized moves in the autonomous car arena. It forged a partnership with Baidu this summer to build a cloud-to-car platform for semiautonomous cars. Its Drive PX2 technology will be used in vehicles participating in the upcoming Roborace autonomous car race. Nvidia this fall rolled out Xavier, a system on chip for autonomous cars, which it described as an "artificial intelligence supercomputer." Nvidia has been testing cars for well over a year -- on public and private roads and in parking lots -- in order to train its PX2 systems, Enderle told TechNewsWorld. Where Nvidia Is Going Nvidia's focus is "on bringing high-level artificial intelligence into the autonomous driving game, especially supporting SAE Level 4 and 5," noted Praveen Chandrasekar, mobility research manager at Frost & Sullivan. Tesla now uses the Drive PX2 on the self-driving hardware available in the new Model S, he told TechNewsWorld. Thrashing the Competition Nvidia is competing with Qualcomm and Intel for the autonomous car industry's business. Intel, the 800-pound gorilla in the chip market, has been busy: It secured US$1 billion in design wins with its software-defined automotive cockpit platform; It set aside $250 million to invest in autonomous driving startups; It partnered with BMW and MobilEye to establish an open development platform initiative for autonomous driving; It introduced the Atom 3900 processor for autonomous cars; and It reorganized its autonomous car efforts into a new unit, the Automated Driving Group. Still, Nvidia is the farthest along with a solution independent of automakers, said Enderle, and it has the inside track to becoming a standard. BMW also is partnering with Nvidia, which is "likely to create competition and ensure it isn't held captive by any one vendor," Enderle pointed out. Baidu Collaboration Nvidia will use the Drive PX2 in conjunction with Baidu's mapping platform for Level 3 SAE automated driving and above to "create a complete cloud-based platform to support automated driving," Frost's Chandrasekar said. The partnership is will encompass both the United States and China. AI, supplied by Nvidia, and mapping are "highly crucial for OEMs who are serious about Level 4 SAE and above, such as Ford, Tesla and BMW," Chandrasekar pointed out. Further, the partnership gives Nvidia tried and tested technology, along with an entry into the China market. Baidu "is one of the companies that is likely to become a power in self-driving car services," Enderle predicted. "Testing is currently going on broadly all over the world, and even Ford and GM are currently working on this." However, the cost of the Nvidia-Baidu solution at entry "may be prohibitive for many of the volume OEMs," Chandrasekar pointed out. Also, OEMs considering the cloud technology "need their vehicles to be equipped with high speed real-time connectivity, which is not a given in the market today" he said. In addition to its Tesla and BMW partnerships, Nvidia currently has teamed with Daimler, Audi and Ford on autonomous driving, Chandrasekar said, noting that "the risk is that OEMs might simply view it as a technology and solutions provider for autonomous driving." On the other hand, Enderle said, Nvidia "is the only company that has a packaged solution that works at this time."

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 16, 2016December 16, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Isn’t Done Running Yet Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The biggest profits in tech this year went to investors who owned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ). Yes, AMD. The little chip company that ended up under  Intel Corporation ‘s (NASDAQ: INTC ) heel just last year . Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr AMD was a $2 stock as recently as February. It opened for trade Dec. 15 at $10.65. That’s a gain of almost 450% in just 10 months. I wrote about AMD stock two months ago  and since then it is up 58%. You won’t see that kind of success on the company’s income statement, which has accumulated over $450 million in losses over the past three quarters. You may find it hard to justify on the balance sheet, too, which has only recently gotten back below a 50% debt-to-assets ratio. Heck, you won’t even see it in estimates on future earnings, where seven analysts still see losses through most of next year. Instead you will find it in earnings surprises and anticipation of the future. AMD suddenly looks competitive again. Zen Becomes Ryzen Lucy Su, who replaced Rory Read as CEO just over two years ago , has engineered the turnaround  with a processing technology called Zen , coming to market next year as a chip called “Ryzen.” The new chip has a faster clock speed that competes with the best Intel offers . Rather than challenge Intel in the mainstream of personal computing, Ryzen is focused on growing niches like gaming, e-sports and virtual reality, where high performance in the client is key. Tech analysts looking at the new chip’s specs are impressed, saying Ryzen will define the high-end of PC computing in 2017  by running 40% more instructions per clock, without the high temperatures that kept fast chips down in the past. Financial analysts looking at the new chip have been upgrading the stock to “buy”  and this, combined with top-line revenue that grew from $832 million in the first quarter of the year to over $1.3 billion in the third, have justified the upgrades. The result is that AMD is now worth almost $10 billion, not the $2 billion it started the year at, and it now has the financial firepower to at least start competing again. The fact that it no longer owns a foundry means it also has less need for capital and can play suppliers off one another. AMD’s new chips are being produced by GlobalFoundries  and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: TSM ). The company has reportedly been talking with Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) as well . Back in the Data Center AMD has always had a niche in graphics processing, but data centers have spent the past decade focusing on using massive numbers of cheap chips to get more processing power. That is starting to change. AMD got a big boost in October when Alibaba Group Holding Co. Ltd. (NASDAQ: BABA ) said it would use AMD Radeon graphics chips in its cloud offering. Potential in the cloud market is a second factor that is powering AMD stock forward. Bottom Line on AMD Stock There remain AMD bears like Stephen Chu of UBS, who say they’ve seen AMD make big claims against Intel before that turned to dust, and expect the same thing to happen again.  He says the new Ryzen chip is being compared against Intel hardware already on the market, and that the next generation of Intel chips will blow it out of the water.  He has a “sell” rating on the shares and a $5 price target. It’s important to have a bear case when considering a bull investment. Without bears, everyone is in a stock and it is fated to fall in price. Skepticism drives stock prices up a “wall of worry,” often to new highs. AMD remains a speculative buy, but considering how well it did for speculators in 2016, there should be plenty of buyers in 2017. Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

The new DIMMs will be compatible with some of the current as well as upcoming server platforms featuring Intel Xeon and other processors. Announced by Crucial this week are the new DDR4 LRDIMMs, RDIMMs, VLP RDIMMs, ECC SODIMMs and ECC UDIMMs rated to operate at 2666 MT/s interface speed with CL19 19-19-38 timings and at 1.2 V. The modules are available in 4 GB, 8 GB and 16 GB configurations and are aimed at less memory-dense server configurations. All the new DIMMs are powered by Micron’s 8 Gb DDR4 ICs made using 20 nm process technology, just like their DDR4-2133/2400 predecessors. Specifications of Crucial's Server DDR4-2666 Memory Modules   Module Capacity Latencies Voltage Height ECC SO-DIMM 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB CL19-19-19-38 1.2 V 30 mm ECC UDIMM 31.25 mm LRDIMM RDIMM VLP RDIMM 19 mm Increasing DDR4 interface speed from 2400 MT/s to 2666 MT/s amplifies theoretical peak bandwidth by 11% to 42.6 GB/s for a dual-channel memory sub-system, to 85.3 GB/s for of a quad-channel memory sub-system as well as to 127.9 GB/s for a six-channel memory sub-system. In any case, an 11% performance increase in bandwidth-hungry workloads without any rise of power consumption is a tangible benefit for many servers. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that to increase interface speeds to 2666 Mbps, the module maker also had to adhere to JEDEC specifications rise its CAS latency from CL15/CL16 and CL17 (DDR4-2133 and DDR4-2400) to CL19, which diminishes the latency performance benefits of higher clocks. Suppliers of server-class memory announce their products well ahead of their high-volume availability because CPU developers and makers of actual servers have to validate DIMMs before they use them in commercial machines. The situation is a bit different today. Officially, Intel’s current-generation Xeon E5 processors featuring the Broadwell-EP cores are compatible only with DDR4-2400 or slower DIMMs. However some OEMs offer Broadwell-EP machines that can officially support DDR4-2666 for lower memory density servers. Meanwhile, Intel and other manufacturers plan to introduce next-generation server platforms (such as Purley/Skylake-EP) that officially support new DDR4 configurations in 2017 and before those machines hit the market, new DIMMs need to pass a variety of validation process. The new server-grade DDR4-2666 memory modules from Crucial are available for purchase now. Their exact prices depend on volumes and negotiations between Crucial and its customers.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Intel’s 7th Generation Desktop CPU Line Leaked Before CES 2017 Posted: Dec 16 2016, 10:22am CST | by M. Affan, Updated: Dec 16 2016, 10:11pm CST, in News | CES   Credit: Getty Images   Here are all the details of new CPU line up that will be launched at CES 2017. It was assumed for the past many months that a new series of CPUs will be launched by Intel in year 2017. It was being said that the company will reveal the seventh generation Kaby Lake S Desktop processors before the CES 2017 convention. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries The CES 2017 will be held from 4th January 2017. It is said that Intel will announce its processors properly in an official announcement in a press conference which will take place at 4pm PST.  It will be a 45 minutes long conference so we are assuming that we will actually see a long array of products from company. The recent leaks have confirmed the date or launch of these new processors on their respective time and date too. These seventh generation desktop processors that will be announced on 5th January will be accompanied by 200 Series chip sets that will be used as the motherboards of these processors too. The list that was leaked earlier on listing all the models is rather long. There will be 16 CPUs that that will be launched in total. These include E3-1205 v6, three core i7 chips, seven Core i5 models of CPUs, two core i3 units and three Pentium processors. These upcoming CPUs will be the ones that will have the support of Optane storage technology that has the ability to rely on 3D XPoint memory, according to DigitalTrends. Intel claims that it will be 1000 times faster than the currently used NAND technology of processors. The processors will be able to provide enhanced graphics too. The CPUs might take a few weeks to go on sale but CES is a great platform to endorse them. Comments You May Like The Author M. Affan M.

Years in development and based on a grounds-up design, Ryzen, powered by the Zen architecture, is coming to market in the first quarter of next year. AMD will have you believe that a non-optimised Ryzen chip, operating at 3.4GHz, and bereft of any turbo technology, is a good match for an $1,100 Intel Core i7-6900K. It's been a long, long while since AMD has been able to claim performance and power equality with one of Intel's finest chips. A long time. Of course, AMD is showcasing Ryzen in the most positive light possible, but even so, it's not hard to be impressed with the performance potential, particularly for the legion of power users. What is just as interesting is how you view Ryzen. Is simply being as fast good enough, especially as Intel, the incumbent, has a proven platform on which most motherboard guys have multiple boards and to which they have devoted almost all of their resources? The AMD chip will compete at the high end first, then be distilled down to the mainstream four-core flavour later. Given that Intel is rock-solid in both segments and AMD is the relative performance newcomer, do you believe it necessary for the AMD Ryzen to be faster than the Intel Core for it to attract your hard-earned cash? Do let us know in the comments facility below.

At least from the viewpoint of a gamer,any savings on the CPU can be put into the graphics card for example and even from the viewpoint of a photographer the savings can be put into faster storage and more RAM. Posted by lumireleon - Fri 16 Dec 2016 16:56 being at the same speed as the 8 core but cheaper by $500 is worth killing intel for their high noncompetitive prices Posted by Biscuit - Fri 16 Dec 2016 16:57 It depends what you mean by faster; what are the metrics? Gaming? Productivity? Media work? Mathematics and Science? AI? I don't see AMD completely dethroning Intel and running away with the performance king of all possible metrics at all price points, but as long as they trade blows in enough of them, I think they should be back in the game. As long as the figures for gaming and media work are solid, I may well be tempted. Posted by flearider - Fri 16 Dec 2016 16:58 that's like asking is hexus better than the reg ? my 8350 does what it needs to @5ghz and in real terms plays anything out there like an intel chip would .. but i'll be getting a zen and a vega ..and have change left over to buy the wife something :P and if lasts as long and overclocks as my 8350 has money well spent .. Posted by kingpotnoodle - Fri 16 Dec 2016 17:03 To be credible Ryzen needs to be around the same performance in most benchmarks with Core chips at a similar price, without using much more power or having any strange quirks. Most benchmarks means not just heavily multithreaded benchmarks but day-to-day average user type stuff where single thread performance matters. If Ryzen can exceed performance in a few useful benchmarks, offer some sort of value add or just be straight up better value for money when the whole platform is taken into account then AMD might have some chance of selling them in good numbers.

Rhonda Schaffler Dec 16, 2016 11:25 AM EST Apple ( AAPL) , Cisco ( CSCO) , Microsoft ( MSFT)  and Intel ( INTC)  will be winners in the technology space in 2017, according to Scott Kessler, an equity analyst with CFRA.  Kessler believes a big theme next year will be the repatriation of foreign earnings, which may lead to additional domestic development, stock buybacks, and dividend increases. He adds one potential loser is Accenture ( ACN) , since it holds only a quarter of its revenue overseas. Kessler notes the ten largest technology sector companies in the S&P by market cap had $709 billion in cash and investments as of late November, and 74% of that was held overseas.

Float64 Support For Intel's Vulkan Driver Is Almost Here Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 16 December 2016 at 10:36 AM EST. 5 Comments While it took a long time for Intel's Mesa driver to begin supporting the ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 extension for double-precision floating-point data types in shaders, fortunately it looks like Intel should soon land the Float64 support in their Vulkan driver soon. The latest patches from Igalia this morning are their revised set of 25 patches for supporting the Float64 capability in the Intel Vulkan driver. The shaderFloat64 capability signifies 64-bit floats (doubles) support within the shader code. Adding Float64 support to the Intel Vulkan driver required changes to NIR as well as their SPIR-V code. The Float64 support for the Intel ANV Vulkan driver is being enabled currently for Intel's Broadwell "Gen8" hardware and newer, with Mesa Git not yet supporting ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 yet for Haswell. These new Float64 patches for the Intel Vulkan driver can be found via this patch series. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

He promised to sever those ties before Inauguration Day. But Flynn has other potential conflicts. Just last week, he was re-elected to a paid position on the board of a surveillance drone company with Department of Defence contracts, federal filings show. And while taking part in the classified briefings for Trump last August, he revamped his consulting company – Flynn Intel Group, or FIG – by adding one senior executive whose firm does extensive cybersecurity work for government agencies and another who was soliciting defence department aviation contracts.

Public records, government contracts and documents posted online by Flynn and his partners show that they have vied in recent months for federal contracts to supply overseas military bases, fly diplomats in and out of conflict zones, and provide cybersecurity and technology for defence and intelligence agencies. Trump's selection of Flynn is by no means the only controversial cabinet choice.   Related Content Team Trump's cabinet looks like a different kind of swamp Is Trump starting something with China he can't finish? However, Flynn's recent moves at FIG -– as well as his partnerships with companies and private equity executives who have military and intelligence contracts – could conflict sharply with his government role. Ethics experts say that as the president's top military-security aide, he will handle classified information on a daily basis and help lead the country's military, diplomatic and intelligence response around the globe. Advertisement Army records obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act already confirm that a secret US military investigation in 2010 determined that Flynn "inappropriately shared" classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan. Visits to two of Flynn's offices in Virginia suggest they are reducing their activities: one was empty and being repainted. But neither Flynn, his partners, nor the Trump transition team responded to repeated questions during the past week about how he plans to comply with federal ethics rules that forbid executive-branch employees from having a financial interest in companies that do business with the agencies they lead.

Flynn. Photo: AP The transition team also hasn't provided information about Flynn's business dealings in response to congressional requests. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who sits on the House Oversight Committee, wrote to Vice-President-elect Mike Pence last month asking for details of Flynn's business ties and steps he intends to take to avoid a conflict. A Cummings aide said none have been provided. On December 14, two Democratic senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, sent a letter to the nation's top intelligence officials arguing that Flynn's ongoing ownership of his consulting company "creates the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents."

Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general who was fired from his post as director of the Defence Intelligence Agency by President Barack Obama in 2014. His nomination as Trump's national security adviser offers him a key White House role requiring no Senate confirmation.

He made a paid speech for RT, a news agency run by the Russian government, sat at a table with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a 2015 dinner celebrating RT's anniversary, shared internet conspiracies on social media, and last February tweeted that "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL." Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU— General Flynn (@GenFlynn) 27 février 2016 But little has been publicly disclosed about the path Flynn has forged in the business world. Like many retired officers, he leveraged expertise he developed in the service into a private-sector career. Rather than join a big defence company, however, he set up his own. "I didn't walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrop Grumman or Booz Allen (Hamilton) or some of these other big companies (like) Raytheon," he told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. "I'm very independent, and it's very liberating actually. I'm not going to be a general that just fades away." In 2014, he founded his company with Bijan Kian, a prominent Iranian-American banker who served on the board of the Export-Import Bank, was a senior fellow at the US Naval Postgraduate School and a member of the White House Business Council. Federal ethics rules say that executive-branch employees who are in partnerships must avoid potential conflicts with businesses owned by fellow partners. Kian is a principal at Global Capital Markets, a mergers and acquisitions firm that has brokered deals involving an assortment of military contractors, and chairman and chief executive officer of GreenZone Systems, a technology company that sells secure communications chips and computers designed for military and intelligence agencies. Kian didn't respond to numerous attempts to reach him. FIG positioned itself as an elite operation with the state-of-the-art skills to protect global businesses and government agencies. Flynn hired a handful of cybersecurity experts who worked under him in the Defence Intelligence Agency and other military posts. Much of their business centred on providing training and information technology design advice to corporate executives concerned with protecting their companies from hacks. By late 2015, Flynn had raised his public profile through an assortment of speeches and media appearances critical of the Obama administration's anti-terror strategy, and he started advising several Republican presidential candidates. He also began to expand his own circle of business associations and his company's portfolio. In May 2016, Flynn took a paid position on the board of a company that makes surveillance drones, which grew out of a business that Donald Trump Jr represented until 2014. As a board member of Drone Aviation, Flynn has been paid $US3,000 per month and also received 100,000 shares of restricted stock, now valued at more than $US275,000, which will become fully vested next spring. Flynn continued to hold his seat after he began receiving classified intelligence briefings on August 17. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and federal contract databases show the company was awarded one Department of Defence contract in late August and two more in October. FIG worked as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a Dutch company with close ties to Turkish President Recep Erdogan. When that arrangement was reported last month by The Daily Caller, Flynn responded by having FIG leave the field of lobbying and said he would "sever ties" with his company. It isn't clear whether he will retain an ownership stake. Flynn is a partner in the business, and his son Michael is its chief of staff, so the family would stand to gain financially from any business it does with the government. He was re-elected to his paid position on the board of Drone Aviation on December 6, according to official filings. Ethicists urge Flynn to end such arrangements and sell his company. Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, said even severing ties isn't enough. People in such positions "still know the company and how its business works, so they would know how a policy decision would affect it," he said. "The only way to avoid that is for them to sell their interest and make a totally clean break."

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Dec 16, 2016 at 9:16AM Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump don't exactly see eye to eye. The two clash strongly in one particular area: global warming. Trump has openly disagreed with global warming and Musk has embarked on an ambitious vision to help put an end to it. The election of Trump to president, therefore, has prompted some uncertainty surrounding how the presidency will impact Tesla, which aims to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by building and selling electric cars, energy storage, and solar products. Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors. But Musk may have been encouraged recently when he was invited to President-elect Donald Trump's Tech Summit in New York City at Trump Tower. Musk goes to Trump Tower The invitations for Trump's Tech Summit went out earlier this month to executives of major tech companies. Beyond Musk, attendees of the event this week included prominent names like Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and Intel's Brian Krzanich. With less than a dozen tech leaders attending, invitations were scant, limited only to the tech elite. "I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting," said Trump in his opening remarks. Based on the sentiment expressed by Trump in the short portion of the meeting made public, the future President said he wanted to help things go smoothly for the companies represented. I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well. ... we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There's nobody like you in the world. ... And, anything we can do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you. You'll call my people. You'll call me, it doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here. We're going to do fair trade deals, we're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade. As Electrek pointed out, Musk's inclusion in the tech summit meeting is particularly notable considering the visionary entrepreneur is the only one leading a company with a market capitalization below $150 billion. Tesla is currently valued at about $32 billion, and Musk's privately held SpaceX's recent funding valued the company at about $15 billion. So Musk is arguably lucky to be able to represent his companies. And Musk apparently received some special attention. Notably, Trump's transition team's communication director Jason Miller said Apple's Cook and Musk were going to stick around after the tech summit event for a private meeting with Trump, according to AppleInsider.  Musk has also been honored with a spot on Trump's Strategic and Policy forum. A press release about the forum says it includes "some of America's most highly respected and successful business leaders" who "will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda." Musk, as well as Uber's Travis Kalanick and Pepsi's Indra Nooyi were added to the forum a few weeks after the Trump administration announced 16 other names, including influential business leaders like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Walt Disney's Bob Iger. What Musk and Trump have in common If the only remarks from Musk during the meeting at Trump Tower were any indication of the foot the CEO plans to put forward with the president, Musk seems like he wants to emphasize Tesla's vision for manufacturing job growth in the U.S. -- an area Trump has said he will focus on. Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley Fool. "Building rockets and cars and solar stuff in the U.S. -- actually really excited about expanding our manufacturing footprint in the U.S.," Musk said when he introduced himself at the meeting. Tesla alone has created about 30,000 jobs, most of which are in the U.S. and are manufacturing related. And Tesla also recently announced an expansion to its car factory in Fremont, California, and said it plans to add another 3,000 jobs there. Going further, the company plans to eventually employ about 9,000 people at its under-construction battery factory in Nevada and 1,000 people at its solar-panel factory in Buffalo, New York. Further, Tesla has inspired auto, defense, and solar companies all over the world to step up their games.  With Trump clearly willing to give Musk his ear, and considering Musk's important role in U.S. manufacturing job creation, Musk's companies are off to a good start with the president-elect.

CINEBENCH utilizes all of your system's processing power during the GPU test and renders a photorealistic 3D scene ("No Keyframes" animation by AixSponza) making use of multiple algorithms that will thoroughly stress all available processor cores - it can accurately measure systems that have up to 256 processor threads. You can then jump over to the Graphics Card performance test which relies on a myriad of factors to produce results such as GPU processor and drivers. It will be tasked with displaying a 3D car chase (created by renderbaron) that includes a massive amount of geometry, textures, and complex effects to fully measure your graphics card performance in OpenGL mode. Once you have run the either of the two benchmark tests on your machine you will be able to see how yours stacks up against other systems and platforms. CINEBENCH supports the following processors: Intel Pentium 4 D, Intel Pentium 4, Intel XEON, Intel Core i7, Intel Core i5, Intel Core i3, Intel Core 2, Intel Celeron, Intel Celeron D, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Sempron, AMD Phenom, AMD FX, AMD Ontario, AMD Opteron, AMD Zacate, AMD Kabini, AMD Beema, AMD Mullins, AMD Temash, AMD Llano, AMD Richland, AMD Trinity, and AMD Kaveri.

Or is his bark worse than his bite? Saif Shahin Not Losing Sleep Indian techies at the Facebook head office in California Photograph by Getty Images Sujata Tibrewala, 41, is a networking evangelist for Intel Corp, one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip makers. Her job is just as funky as it sounds: “I manage the open-source community for Intel,” she says, referring to the global network of technology aficionados who help develop a company’s open-source software. A graduate of IIT Kharagpur and IISc, Bangalore, Tibrewala moved to the US six years ago with her family and worked as a consultant for several technology companies before joining Intel at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Her husband, too, works as a manager for a technology firm; their daughter is a senior at a local school and is applying for admission to college next year. They have recently bought a house in the Silicon Valley, investing $90,000 from their own pockets, besides taking a sizeable bank loan. Advertisement But if Donald Trump has his way, Tibrewala and her family may soon be without a job and on their way back to India. The president-elect announced earlier this month that he won’t allow US workers to be replaced by foreigners. During his jingoistic campaign, Trump adopted a vehemently anti-immigration stance and spoke often against the influx of Muslims and Mexicans. The rhetoric resonated well with the constituency of white, rural voters he courted and it propelled him to victory in the November 8 election. Since then, highly skilled foreign workers such as Tibrewala, who are here on H-1B visas, have also come in the businessman-turned-politician’s cross-hairs. Targeting such workers is as easy as it is senseless: they are very few in number and often do jobs for which enough US workers aren’t available. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services issues only 85,000 H-1B visas every year, meant for foreigners with specialised knowledge—such as scientists, engineers and computer programmers. Of these, 20,000 visas are reserved for workers with a Master’s degree from a US university. As the number of applicants is three to four times above the cap, awardees are chosen through computerised lottery. Advertisement Indian-born workers are highly favou­red by technology companies as they bring specialised skills, knowledge of English, and a willingness to work at lower salaries compared with American employees. They corner the lion’s share of H-1B visas awa­rded every year. So, if Trump does follow up on his promise and curtails the H-1B programme, they would be the worst affected. “Multi-nationals can move their workers to Europe or Canada; they won’t stop their work. They will relocate their workers,” says post-doc scholar Gurpreet Singh. “My sister warned me against buying the house because of her fear that Trump would win,” Tibrewala says. “But I never thought this could happen.” She still doesn’t think it would. “Trump is a businessman. He will not do this because this doesn’t make business sense. Ninety per cent of workers in the Bay Area are Indians or Asians. These companies will shut down. They won’t have people to work on anything,” Tibrewala says. Advertisement Vishal Sanghai, a Mumbai-born engineer now working for San Diego-based Peregrine Semiconductors, agrees with Tibrewala. “Trump says a lot of things and later backtracks,” he says. There are many reasons why US companies prefer Indian-born workers, he says. “Most Americans enter the job market after getting undergraduate (Bachelor’s) degrees. But Indians who are working here often have Master’s degrees, which make them more qualified.” Some 1,66,000 Indian students enrolled in US universities in 2015-16, of which more than 60,000 were graduate—mostly Master’s—students. Sanghai, 31, himself earned a Master’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2010. He worked for companies in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas before moving to California. He says even if Trump curtails the H-1B programme, foreign workers who are already here won’t be affected. “It may affect those who are studying right now or hope to come here in the next few years.” Advertisement Among them is Gurpreet Singh, 32, at the Institute for Computational Engi­neering and Sciences, University of Texas at Austin. Gurpreet expects to complete his post-doctoral research and start working for a technology company in the next six months. Like Sanghai and Tibrewala, he doubts if Trump would follow up on his threat and scrap the H-1B programme. Even if he does, businesses would find a way around it. “Companies that hire such workers are mostly multi-nationals,” Gurpreet says. “They can move their workers to Europe or Canada. The companies will not stop their work. They will simply relocate their workers.” Attempts to speak with technology company representatives went unanswered. For a long time, Silicon Valley technologists have demanded that their companies be allowed to hire more workers under the H-1B programme. Alan H. Fleischmann, the founder-president and CEO of business advisory firm Laurel Strategies, recently wrote in an op-ed for Fortune magazine that the H-1B cap “may have been sufficient 30 years ago, but it’s just a drop in the bucket compared with today’s demand for high-skilled workers”. He reminded Trump of a bipartisan bill to double the annual cap and urged him to push it forward. Advertisement A 2012 US Chamber of Commerce report said each H-1B employee creates 2.62 new jobs for American workers because of the boost she provides to the economy. While Trump may not listen to people like Fleischmann and raise the cap, few Indian workers believe the new president will do away with the H-1B programme. Gurpreet, who has been studying in the US since 2007, remembers outgoing president Barack Obama had issued similar threats against outsourcing of US jobs when he was taking office—but never followed up on them. But he fears statements such as Trump’s could themselves undermine foreign workers’ confidence in the stability of US jobs and act as a deterrent. “People coming here from India are looking at the US as a long-term option. They are thinking about settling down here. If you take that option away, they will no longer be as keen,” he says. Those with families, especially kids, will be particularly concerned. “They have to think not just about jobs but many other things as well,” Gurpreet says. “There will be distrust. In the long term, people might be unwilling.” By Saif Shahin in Ohio READ MORE IN: Saif Shahin USA Ohio Citizenship, Visa & Residency International Next Story : Misplaced Optimism?

Over the past number of months, 4th, 5th and 6th class students from across Ireland have been getting hands on with science and showcasing their big ideas as they took part in the annual Intel Mini Scientist competition. The two Kildare projects chosen were Good vision is good for sport from Scoil Phadraig, Clane, and Pollution Solution from St. Laurence’s NS, Sallins. The competition, which kicked off in September, gives young students the chance to explore science through project based learning and exhibitions. The first phase of the program involves students participating at exhibitions in their own schools which are visited by Intel employees who judge the first round of exhibitions and select from each school a winning project to go forward to a regional final. Regional finals were then held on Thursday December 8 and Friday December 9 at the Intel campus in Leixlip. The 2016 competition saw more than 4,000 students from 101 schools in 15 counties across Ireland taking part and the Regional Finals in Leixlip brought together almost 250 students from 80 different schools to take part and exhibit their work. At the Regional Final events the participants exhibited their projects for a panel of judges, which was made up from Intel employees, who had the difficult task of choosing the winning projects from the very creative variety. The winning projects will go forward to the Helix at Dublin City University on February 3 2017 at the Mini Scientist National final which will bring together 24 different projects from around the country, all of which are being selected at Regional Final events.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition Deaths in Kildare - January 2, 2017 Kym Owens Maynooth student Kym Owens' injuries could have arisen from single blow Late burst takes Lilies over the line Revamp on the cards for Newbridge's Dunnes Stores Tony Egan, who is missing from Portarlington Appeal to find man (32) missing from Portarlington Leixlip residents angry at prospect of 2,000 new houses Kildare County Council resists call for caravan bye-law Monasterevin search called off, as body found Kildare man waiting 20 months for methadone treatment PHOTO GALLERY: The 'O Holy Night' Christmas Concert in Newbridge Newbridge Trolley dash win makes it a Happy Christmas for local woman Deaths in Kildare, December 30, 2016 Tweets by @leinsleadernews   Home News Sport Whats On Deaths About us Contact us Rss Privacy Policy Cookie policy This website and its associated newspaper are full participating members of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman.

We will be posting the transcripts from these calls after they happen. Here is the transcript from Thursday’s call. On the call were Jason Miller, the transition team’s communications director, and Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee’s communications director. OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the transition daily briefing call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time I’d like to Sean Spicer and Jason Miller. Please go ahead. Advertisement Continue reading SPICER: Hey, good morning everyone, it’s Sean. Thanks for joining us. We are now 36 days from inauguration day. At this point, as of this morning, we have — president-elect has now named 13 individuals to his Cabinet, far outpacing where any modern president has been at this point, including President Obama who was — had — had appointed 10 people to his Cabinet in 2008. 34 additional landing team members have been approved and sent to the White House which now puts that total of landing team member, at the various departments and agency, at over 250. This morning President-elect Trump announced his intention to nominate Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana to be the next Secretary of the Interior. The president-elect’s statement was as follows, “Congressman Ryan Zinke has built one of the strongest track records in champion — championing — regulatory release force, management, responsible energy development and public land use issues. As a former Navy SEAL he has incredible leadership skills and an attitude of doing whatever it takes to win. America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he’s gonna help keep it that way with smart management of our Federal lands. At the same time my administration’s goal to repeal bad regulation, use our natural resources to create jobs and wealth for the American people and Ryan will explore every possibility on how we can safely responsibly do that.” That statement in full is available on the transition site website. As I’ve mentioned, Congressman Zinke is former commander of SEAL Team Six, is a Teddy Roosevelt Republican, a man of action who believes our treasured public lands are for the benefit, enjoyment of all the people. He is the at large Congressman from the state of Montana. First elected in 2014 after serving a term in the Montana State Senate — and 23 officers — 23 years was an officer with the U.S. Navy as a SEAL. Advertisement Continue reading If confirmed, as Secretary of the Interior, he will support the philosophy of managing public lands that call for multiple uses including economic, recreation and conservation. He is a strong conservation advocate, earning praise for building quote “One of the strongest track records on conservation in public land use.” He is a strong advocate for American energy independence and in supports an all encompassing energy policy that includes renewable, fossil fuels and alternative energy. As you know, yesterday, the president-elect announced his intention to nominate Rick Perry to the Secretary of Energy. In addition President-elect Trump announced his congratulations to Ronna McDaniel as the next — as they RNC Deputy Chair and Bob Paduchik — that’s P-A-D-U-C-H-I-K — as the next RNC Deputy Co-Chairman, effective immediately. The President Elect made the following statement, quote, “I’m excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as the RNC Deputy Chair and I look forward to serving her as the party’s Chairman in 2017. Ronna has been an extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan. I know she’ll bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee. Bob Paduchik is the right choice to serve as Deputy Co-Chair. In addition to being a key leader and helping us win big in Ohio, I’m confident he’s going to work very hard to continue the excitement — the excellent work, the RNC has done building the Republican Party to a record level of strength.” Ronna will immediately begin serving as Deputy Chairman and then the president-elect intends to — intends to — nominate her as the next chairman of the RNC at the RNC winter meeting in January that will take place in Washington, D.C. SPICER: Yesterday the president and the vice president-elect held a tech summit here at Trump Tower with leaders in the tech industry. There was a readout from the summit which is as follows, quote, “President-Elect Donald J. Trump met with more than a dozen of the greatest tech leaders in the country to begin a conversation and partnership in order to spark innovation and create more jobs in the U.S., particularly for working Americans. Advertisement Continue reading During the meeting, the president-elect discussed the wide range of issues impacting both American workers and American companies, including specific innovative solutions that have blocked — been blocked by narrow thinking in Washington. The president-elect expressed an open mind and a willingness to listen which was greatly received by the industry leaders in attendance. The leaders in attendance also praised the ingenuity and energy of the American work force. And President-elect Trump suggested recommitting the tech leaders again in the future, perhaps as frequently as every quarter,” end quote. The leaders in attendance included Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Safra Catz of Oracle, Tim Cook of Apple, Alex Karp of Palantir, Brian Krzanich of Intel, Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Larry Page of Google, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Eric Schmidt of Google. The president-elect also held productive meetings yesterday with Mr. — Dr. Zeke Emanuel, Secretary Designate Wilbur Ross, Mr. Andy Beal, Ms. Paula White and Congressman Darrell Issa. I now, will turn it over to Jason to go through today’s takeoff. MILLER: Thank you very much, Sean. The president-elect began his day to day meeting with Mr. Joel Kaplan, the vice president for U.S. Public Policy at Facebook. Mr. Kaplan formerly served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and in several other roles in the administration of former President George W. Bush. President-elect Trump Will be also meeting today with Mr. Pete Hegseth, Fox News commentator and veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard.

Mr. DiMicco previously served as CEO of Nucor Steel for 13 years and has extensive experience overseeing a large steel company impacted by trade policy. President-elect Trump will meet with Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, Peter King, as well as Suffolk County Chairman John LaValle. Both of them were very supportive on the campaign trail. The president-elect will then hold a meeting with the U.S. Conference of Mayors here, at Trump Tower. Attendees of the meeting will include Mayor Mick Cornett, from Oklahoma City; Mayor Mitch Landrieu, from New Orleans; Mayor Stephen Benjamin, from Columbia, South Carolina; Mayor Elizabeth Kautz, from Burnsville, Minnesota; and Tom Cochran, CEO and Executive Director of the United States Conference of Mayors. The president-elect will then be meeting with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Secretary Kobach — and that’s K-O-B-A-C-H — is a constitutional attorney who is widely known as one of the country’s foremost experts on immigration law and border security. As Kansas secretary of state, Secretary Kobach passed the most comprehensive election reform package in the country, the SAFE Act, which requires voter ID at the polls and proof of citizenship for new voter registrants. MILLER: In conclusion of these meetings today, the president- elect and vice president-elect will travel to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for a Thank You America rally, at 7:00 pm at the Giant arena, where we’re expecting a big-league turnout this evening.

And wrapping up the week on Saturday at 3 PM, the president-elect will hold a, thank you America rally, in Mobile, Alabama at the Ladd Peebles Stadium where he will be joined by U.S. Senator and future Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Advertisement Continue reading We will now take questions. OPERATOR: Thank you. If you have any questions, please press “star one.” We’ll take our first question from Peter Alexander with NBC. QUESTION: Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the call. Given the new reporting from NBC that Vladimir Putin played a direct role in the Russian hacking of the election process in one form or another, here, or at least the process that led up to it, I just wanted to get a sense from you, if you have a reaction to that today. And Donald Trump this morning tweeted about it, he said if Russia or some other entity was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act, why did they only complain after Hillary lost. Obviously this was public, dating back to June, when it was first reported and in October, the DNI and others talked about the fact that Russia was involved in a hacking. So I guess my questions are what are Donald Trump’s plans? What will he do as president if it’s determined that Russia was involved in the hacking? And given the fact that earlier, he said that it was ridiculous. He said that it could be Russia, China, or someone else sitting on a bed. Has his position changed on whether Russia was involved in the hacking? Advertisement Continue reading Thank you. MILLER: Peter, was there a question there, or is that just a series of comments? I think we’ve addressed this the last several days in a row. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: My question is has his position changed? This morning he said if Russia or some other entity was hacking, so has his position changed or does he still believe it could be Russia, China, or somebody else? MILLER: Well, I’d let the president-elect’s tweets speak for themselves. I’d say the continued efforts to try to delegitimize the election at certain point — certain point got to realize that the election from last month is going to stand, whether it’s the recount or continued questions along this line, and we’re moving ahead and put together successful administration that’s ready go to work serving the American people. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Connell McShane with Fox Business Network. QUESTION: You know, guys there was another tweet this morning about the media for Mr. Trump, saying the media tries so hard to make my move to the White House as it pertains my business so complex, it actually isn’t. So, since today’s the day the news conference was supposed to be held, are you guys able to expand at all more than you the last few days on the reasons for that delay until January in terms of what might be known in January, say about Mr. Trump’s business interest that is not known now? Advertisement Continue reading MILLER: Well, thank you very much. I would say somewhere to what we’ve — we’ve said recently that the president-elect being one of our country’s most successful business leaders obviously has a great number of businesses, great number properties and developments, that he has put together and, quite frankly, that takes time. MILLER: As he transitions away from being the leader of this very successful company to becoming solely focused on being president of the United States. They’re obviously internal considerations, as far as what the structure will look like for family members that will be taking the reins of the business and I think the priority here is to make sure that we get it right. And if that takes a little bit more time, than I think that’s — I think the American people understand that, and I think they realize this when they voted for this successful business leader, as opposed to a politician in the last months election. And so, I wouldn’t say they’re necessarily new details, but the president-elect is focused on this, does look forward to having a press conference next month to start going through this and — in greater detail, so thank you. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Leo Shane with Military Times. QUESTION: Hi, yes, thanks for the call. You mentioned (inaudible) will be in today to talk to — to president-elect. I know veterans groups have expressed some concern that there hasn’t been an ACH (ph) secretary appointment yet, especially given the president-elect’s emphasis on veterans’ issues during the campaign. Should they be worried about this? What should they make of, I guess, the small number of folks coming in and talking about this position right now? Advertisement Continue reading MILLER: Thank you very much, another good question. So I had an opportunity to chat with the president-elect on this very topic the other day. And again, this is a another one where this position is so important to make sure that we get right, that there is — not only is there an unwieldy bureaucracy to deal with, we’re talking about lives of people who have gone and sacrificed everything on behalf of this country, who need help, and out our country has a debt that we need to repay them. And so, as the president-elect is going through this process, There obviously needs to be — whoever takes this position will be someone to understands how the bureaucracy works, someone who isn’t afraid to get in there and institute some very strong reforms, and to make sure that we’re delivering for veterans. Sean, do you have anything you want to add on this? SPICER: I’d just say look, two things. One is, you know, you’ve got the fastest clip that anyone’s ever been at in modern history. So — but I think to Jason’s point, this isn’t an area to your question frankly, this is an area that he cares deeply about, reforming the V.A., making sure that the person that comes in and does this has the appropriate skill cell to — to address the many challenges that — whether its lending or health care, our veterans deserve. This is, as you correctly mentioned, an area that’s near and dear to his heart, and one that he really wants to make sure is addressed appropriately, quickly and successfully. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Fred Lucas with the Daily Signal. QUESTION: Yes, thanks for taking — thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk to you about the regulation from the Obama administration. Take (ph) it just yesterday that prohibited states from defunding Planned Parenthood. Is that something the president- elect plans to reverse when he takes office? Advertisement Continue reading And also, there has some talk that I’ve heard that there might be an announcement of a Supreme Court justice before he takes office. Could you address that as well? MILLER: Thank you very much. On the first one, I know that the — the policy team is reviewing a number of different options for day one, executive orders, as well as additional executive orders during the first 100 days. There has not yet been a final list that’s put forward, but as most of you saw Stephen Miller, whose our national policy director who’s announced in that position by the president-elect, is working with the team to get those put together. So, no announcement just yet, but I would say, stay tuned. In additionally, with regard to Supreme Court, that’s also something that’s actively being discussed, but I wouldn’t want to go and — and set an arbitrary time table at this point. Obviously it’s a matter of the — the utmost importance. The president-elect had previously put out a list of 20 very, highly qualified individuals from which he would select. I know they’ve continued to narrow that list down. He himself has said that that’s probably a shorter list of five or six folks that are near the top that that’s being narrowed down to. And — but again, this — this is another one where it’s of absolute utmost priority so need to make sure we get this one right. OPERATOR: We’ll take our final question from Courtney Weaver with Financial Times. Advertisement Continue reading QUESTION: Hey there. I was wondering — do you have confirmation dates yet for Tillerson and Mattis? MILLER: I’m not aware of those confirmation dates being sent yet. But obviously we’re moving as quickly as possible. As soon as we have confirmation dates for those positions or any of the others we’ll make sure that we get them out to everyone. OPERATOR: And this does conclude our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers. SPICER: Hey, guys, have a great day. Enjoy the snow if your in New York and we’ll see you tomorrow morning. MILLER: All right, thanks, everyone, appreciate it. OPERATOR: This does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. GOVERNMENT ATTACKERS Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. QUESTIONS FOR VERIZON News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo’s shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. ___ AP technology writer Bree Fowler contributed to this article from New York.

We will be posting the transcripts from these calls after they happen. Here is the transcript from Thursday’s call. On the call were Jason Miller, the transition team’s communications director, and Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee’s communications director. OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the transition daily briefing call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time I’d like to Sean Spicer and Jason Miller. Please go ahead. SPICER: Hey, good morning everyone, it’s Sean. Thanks for joining us. We are now 36 days from inauguration day. At this point, as of this morning, we have — president-elect has now named 13 individuals to his Cabinet, far outpacing where any modern president has been at this point, including President Obama who was — had — had appointed 10 people to his Cabinet in 2008. 34 additional landing team members have been approved and sent to the White House which now puts that total of landing team member, at the various departments and agency, at over 250. This morning President-elect Trump announced his intention to nominate Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana to be the next Secretary of the Interior. The president-elect’s statement was as follows, “Congressman Ryan Zinke has built one of the strongest track records in champion — championing — regulatory release force, management, responsible energy development and public land use issues. As a former Navy SEAL he has incredible leadership skills and an attitude of doing whatever it takes to win. America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he’s gonna help keep it that way with smart management of our Federal lands. At the same time my administration’s goal to repeal bad regulation, use our natural resources to create jobs and wealth for the American people and Ryan will explore every possibility on how we can safely responsibly do that.” That statement in full is available on the transition site website. As I’ve mentioned, Congressman Zinke is former commander of SEAL Team Six, is a Teddy Roosevelt Republican, a man of action who believes our treasured public lands are for the benefit, enjoyment of all the people. He is the at large Congressman from the state of Montana. First elected in 2014 after serving a term in the Montana State Senate — and 23 officers — 23 years was an officer with the U.S. Navy as a SEAL. If confirmed, as Secretary of the Interior, he will support the philosophy of managing public lands that call for multiple uses including economic, recreation and conservation. He is a strong conservation advocate, earning praise for building quote “One of the strongest track records on conservation in public land use.” He is a strong advocate for American energy independence and in supports an all encompassing energy policy that includes renewable, fossil fuels and alternative energy. As you know, yesterday, the president-elect announced his intention to nominate Rick Perry to the Secretary of Energy. In addition President-elect Trump announced his congratulations to Ronna McDaniel as the next — as they RNC Deputy Chair and Bob Paduchik — that’s P-A-D-U-C-H-I-K — as the next RNC Deputy Co-Chairman, effective immediately. The President Elect made the following statement, quote, “I’m excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as the RNC Deputy Chair and I look forward to serving her as the party’s Chairman in 2017. Ronna has been an extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan. I know she’ll bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee. Bob Paduchik is the right choice to serve as Deputy Co-Chair. In addition to being a key leader and helping us win big in Ohio, I’m confident he’s going to work very hard to continue the excitement — the excellent work, the RNC has done building the Republican Party to a record level of strength.” Ronna will immediately begin serving as Deputy Chairman and then the president-elect intends to — intends to — nominate her as the next chairman of the RNC at the RNC winter meeting in January that will take place in Washington, D.C. SPICER: Yesterday the president and the vice president-elect held a tech summit here at Trump Tower with leaders in the tech industry. There was a readout from the summit which is as follows, quote, “President-Elect Donald J. Trump met with more than a dozen of the greatest tech leaders in the country to begin a conversation and partnership in order to spark innovation and create more jobs in the U.S., particularly for working Americans. During the meeting, the president-elect discussed the wide range of issues impacting both American workers and American companies, including specific innovative solutions that have blocked — been blocked by narrow thinking in Washington. The president-elect expressed an open mind and a willingness to listen which was greatly received by the industry leaders in attendance. The leaders in attendance also praised the ingenuity and energy of the American work force. And President-elect Trump suggested recommitting the tech leaders again in the future, perhaps as frequently as every quarter,” end quote. The leaders in attendance included Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Safra Catz of Oracle, Tim Cook of Apple, Alex Karp of Palantir, Brian Krzanich of Intel, Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Larry Page of Google, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Eric Schmidt of Google. The president-elect also held productive meetings yesterday with Mr. — Dr. Zeke Emanuel, Secretary Designate Wilbur Ross, Mr. Andy Beal, Ms. Paula White and Congressman Darrell Issa. I now, will turn it over to Jason to go through today’s takeoff. MILLER: Thank you very much, Sean. The president-elect began his day to day meeting with Mr. Joel Kaplan, the vice president for U.S. Public Policy at Facebook. Mr. Kaplan formerly served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and in several other roles in the administration of former President George W. Bush. President-elect Trump Will be also meeting today with Mr. Pete Hegseth, Fox News commentator and veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard.

The president-elect will then be meeting with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Secretary Kobach — and that’s K-O-B-A-C-H — is a constitutional attorney who is widely known as one of the country’s foremost experts on immigration law and border security. As Kansas secretary of state, Secretary Kobach passed the most comprehensive election reform package in the country, the SAFE Act, which requires voter ID at the polls and proof of citizenship for new voter registrants.

And wrapping up the week on Saturday at 3 PM, the president-elect will hold a, thank you America rally, in Mobile, Alabama at the Ladd Peebles Stadium where he will be joined by U.S. Senator and future Attorney General Jeff Sessions. We will now take questions. OPERATOR: Thank you. If you have any questions, please press “star one.” We’ll take our first question from Peter Alexander with NBC. QUESTION: Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the call. Given the new reporting from NBC that Vladimir Putin played a direct role in the Russian hacking of the election process in one form or another, here, or at least the process that led up to it, I just wanted to get a sense from you, if you have a reaction to that today.

And given the fact that earlier, he said that it was ridiculous. He said that it could be Russia, China, or someone else sitting on a bed. Has his position changed on whether Russia was involved in the hacking? Thank you. MILLER: Peter, was there a question there, or is that just a series of comments? I think we’ve addressed this the last several days in a row. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: My question is has his position changed? This morning he said if Russia or some other entity was hacking, so has his position changed or does he still believe it could be Russia, China, or somebody else? MILLER: Well, I’d let the president-elect’s tweets speak for themselves. I’d say the continued efforts to try to delegitimize the election at certain point — certain point got to realize that the election from last month is going to stand, whether it’s the recount or continued questions along this line, and we’re moving ahead and put together successful administration that’s ready go to work serving the American people. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Connell McShane with Fox Business Network. QUESTION: You know, guys there was another tweet this morning about the media for Mr. Trump, saying the media tries so hard to make my move to the White House as it pertains my business so complex, it actually isn’t. So, since today’s the day the news conference was supposed to be held, are you guys able to expand at all more than you the last few days on the reasons for that delay until January in terms of what might be known in January, say about Mr. Trump’s business interest that is not known now? MILLER: Well, thank you very much. I would say somewhere to what we’ve — we’ve said recently that the president-elect being one of our country’s most successful business leaders obviously has a great number of businesses, great number properties and developments, that he has put together and, quite frankly, that takes time. MILLER: As he transitions away from being the leader of this very successful company to becoming solely focused on being president of the United States. They’re obviously internal considerations, as far as what the structure will look like for family members that will be taking the reins of the business and I think the priority here is to make sure that we get it right. And if that takes a little bit more time, than I think that’s — I think the American people understand that, and I think they realize this when they voted for this successful business leader, as opposed to a politician in the last months election. And so, I wouldn’t say they’re necessarily new details, but the president-elect is focused on this, does look forward to having a press conference next month to start going through this and — in greater detail, so thank you. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Leo Shane with Military Times. QUESTION: Hi, yes, thanks for the call. You mentioned (inaudible) will be in today to talk to — to president-elect. I know veterans groups have expressed some concern that there hasn’t been an ACH (ph) secretary appointment yet, especially given the president-elect’s emphasis on veterans’ issues during the campaign. Should they be worried about this? What should they make of, I guess, the small number of folks coming in and talking about this position right now? MILLER: Thank you very much, another good question. So I had an opportunity to chat with the president-elect on this very topic the other day. And again, this is a another one where this position is so important to make sure that we get right, that there is — not only is there an unwieldy bureaucracy to deal with, we’re talking about lives of people who have gone and sacrificed everything on behalf of this country, who need help, and out our country has a debt that we need to repay them. And so, as the president-elect is going through this process, There obviously needs to be — whoever takes this position will be someone to understands how the bureaucracy works, someone who isn’t afraid to get in there and institute some very strong reforms, and to make sure that we’re delivering for veterans. Sean, do you have anything you want to add on this? SPICER: I’d just say look, two things. One is, you know, you’ve got the fastest clip that anyone’s ever been at in modern history. So — but I think to Jason’s point, this isn’t an area to your question frankly, this is an area that he cares deeply about, reforming the V.A., making sure that the person that comes in and does this has the appropriate skill cell to — to address the many challenges that — whether its lending or health care, our veterans deserve. This is, as you correctly mentioned, an area that’s near and dear to his heart, and one that he really wants to make sure is addressed appropriately, quickly and successfully. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Fred Lucas with the Daily Signal. QUESTION: Yes, thanks for taking — thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk to you about the regulation from the Obama administration. Take (ph) it just yesterday that prohibited states from defunding Planned Parenthood. Is that something the president- elect plans to reverse when he takes office? And also, there has some talk that I’ve heard that there might be an announcement of a Supreme Court justice before he takes office. Could you address that as well? MILLER: Thank you very much. On the first one, I know that the — the policy team is reviewing a number of different options for day one, executive orders, as well as additional executive orders during the first 100 days. There has not yet been a final list that’s put forward, but as most of you saw Stephen Miller, whose our national policy director who’s announced in that position by the president-elect, is working with the team to get those put together. So, no announcement just yet, but I would say, stay tuned. In additionally, with regard to Supreme Court, that’s also something that’s actively being discussed, but I wouldn’t want to go and — and set an arbitrary time table at this point. Obviously it’s a matter of the — the utmost importance. The president-elect had previously put out a list of 20 very, highly qualified individuals from which he would select. I know they’ve continued to narrow that list down. He himself has said that that’s probably a shorter list of five or six folks that are near the top that that’s being narrowed down to. And — but again, this — this is another one where it’s of absolute utmost priority so need to make sure we get this one right. OPERATOR: We’ll take our final question from Courtney Weaver with Financial Times. QUESTION: Hey there. I was wondering — do you have confirmation dates yet for Tillerson and Mattis? MILLER: I’m not aware of those confirmation dates being sent yet. But obviously we’re moving as quickly as possible. As soon as we have confirmation dates for those positions or any of the others we’ll make sure that we get them out to everyone. OPERATOR: And this does conclude our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers. SPICER: Hey, guys, have a great day. Enjoy the snow if your in New York and we’ll see you tomorrow morning. MILLER: All right, thanks, everyone, appreciate it. OPERATOR: This does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

(Photo: Screenshot/CNN) Despite consistent demands that Donald Trump create clear firewalls between the involvement of his family, the operation of his business empire, and his new responsibility as a public servant, the president-elect on Wednesday invited three of his grown children—Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric—to attend a high-profile meeting with some of the nation's most wealthy and powerful executives from the tech industry. As first noted by Huffington Post reporter Christina Wilkie on Twitter: Look who’s sitting at the head of the table in Trump’s official meeting with tech CEO’s: Don Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. pic.twitter.com/xUYo3QL0g7— Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) December 14, 2016 The meeting, reportedly coordinated by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka, was a veritable who's-who of tech billionaires, including Google co-founder Larry Page, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Oracle CEO Safra Catz, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. As Common Dreams reported Tuesday, experts are warning that Trump's reluctance to separate himself from his business empire—which he said this week will be put in the control of Donald Jr. and Eric—presents an "unprecedented threat" to the nation. News that his adult children attended Wednesday's meeting prompted renewed outrage over Trump's continued disregard for the ethical conflict it represents: WHY ARE TRUMP'S KIDS IN ALL THESE MEETINGS!!?? If they're gonna run his "beautiful company" as #TRUMP says, there's no justification for it— Joe Jackson (@joejackson) December 14, 2016 @SenWarren why are Trump's children allowed in these meetings? I resent this and I don't understand why it is allowed.— Elizabeth Shepardson (@eabs8147) December 14, 2016 How can Trump's kids run his business and yet be privy to presidential meetings...... damn corrupt!!— minefield101 (@minefield101) December 14, 2016 You know her as one of Trump's three children who will be running his businesses... now, apparently, from within The White House. #DonTheCon https://t.co/t6LpxYM5ut— Dennis W. Alpert (@DennisWAlpert) December 14, 2016 That last tweet includes a reference to another new revelation out Wednesday concerning Trump's eldest daughter Ivanka. According to CNN, Trump's eldest daughter Ivanka will be getting an office in her father's White House in a space typically reserved for the first lady. As The Hill reports: Some have speculated that Ivanka, one of the president-elect's daughters, will fill a role similar to first lady's during her father's presidency. The New York Times reported this month that she may be one of the most powerful first daughters in history. In early December, she met with former Vice President Al Gore, a prominent climate change activist, at Trump Tower in New York City. The first daughter reportedly plans to make global warming one of her main issues. Trump has said he'd "love" to have Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, involved in his administration. Last month, Ivanka's presence at a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe resulted in outrage, leading journalist Keith Olbermann to declare on Twitter, "Attention @realDonaldTrump. Nobody else in your family was "elected." Get your daughter THE FUCK OUT OF STATE MEETINGS." As CNBC reports this week, the head of the Office of Government Ethics determined that even Trump's plan to simply hand the business over to his kids would not be enough to remove the conflict of interest. In a letter sent Monday to Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), agency director Walter Shaub Jr. said transferring control of Trump's businesses to his children "would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest" under the primary federal statute.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Washington Post Staff December 15, 2016 President-elect Trump's transition team is holding daily media calls to update the press on how the transition is progressing. We will be posting the transcripts from these calls after they happen. Here is the transcript from Thursday's call. On the call were Jason Miller, the transition team's communications director, and Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee's communications director. OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the transition daily briefing call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to Sean Spicer and Jason Miller. Please go ahead. SPICER: Hey, good morning everyone, it's Sean. Thanks for joining us. We are now 36 days from inauguration day. At this point, as of this morning, we have -- president-elect has now named 13 individuals to his Cabinet, far outpacing where any modern president has been at this point, including President Obama who was -- had -- had appointed 10 people to his Cabinet in 2008. 34 additional landing team members have been approved and sent to the White House which now puts that total of landing team member, at the various departments and agency, at over 250. This morning President-elect Trump announced his intention to nominate Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana to be the next Secretary of the Interior. The president-elect's statement was as follows, "Congressman Ryan Zinke has built one of the strongest track records in champion -- championing -- regulatory release force, management, responsible energy development and public land use issues. As a former Navy SEAL he has incredible leadership skills and an attitude of doing whatever it takes to win. America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he's gonna help keep it that way with smart management of our Federal lands. At the same time my administration's goal to repeal bad regulation, use our natural resources to create jobs and wealth for the American people and Ryan will explore every possibility on how we can safely responsibly do that." That statement in full is available on the transition site website. As I've mentioned, Congressman Zinke is former commander of SEAL Team Six, is a Teddy Roosevelt Republican, a man of action who believes our treasured public lands are for the benefit, enjoyment of all the people. He is the at large Congressman from the state of Montana. First elected in 2014 after serving a term in the Montana State Senate -- and 23 officers -- 23 years was an officer with the U.S. Navy as a SEAL. If confirmed, as Secretary of the Interior, he will support the philosophy of managing public lands that call for multiple uses including economic, recreation and conservation. He is a strong conservation advocate, earning praise for building quote "One of the strongest track records on conservation in public land use." He is a strong advocate for American energy independence and in supports an all encompassing energy policy that includes renewable, fossil fuels and alternative energy. As you know, yesterday, the president-elect announced his intention to nominate Rick Perry to the Secretary of Energy. In addition President-elect Trump announced his congratulations to Ronna McDaniel as the next -- as they RNC Deputy Chair and Bob Paduchik -- that's P-A-D-U-C-H-I-K -- as the next RNC Deputy Co-Chairman, effective immediately. The President Elect made the following statement, quote, "I'm excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as the RNC Deputy Chair and I look forward to serving her as the party's Chairman in 2017. Ronna has been an extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan. I know she'll bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee. Bob Paduchik is the right choice to serve as Deputy Co-Chair. In addition to being a key leader and helping us win big in Ohio, I'm confident he's going to work very hard to continue the excitement -- the excellent work, the RNC has done building the Republican Party to a record level of strength." Ronna will immediately begin serving as Deputy Chairman and then the president-elect intends to -- intends to -- nominate her as the next chairman of the RNC at the RNC winter meeting in January that will take place in Washington, D.C. SPICER: Yesterday the president and the vice president-elect held a tech summit here at Trump Tower with leaders in the tech industry. There was a readout from the summit which is as follows, quote, "President-Elect Donald J. Trump met with more than a dozen of the greatest tech leaders in the country to begin a conversation and partnership in order to spark innovation and create more jobs in the U.S., particularly for working Americans. During the meeting, the president-elect discussed the wide range of issues impacting both American workers and American companies, including specific innovative solutions that have blocked -- been blocked by narrow thinking in Washington. The president-elect expressed an open mind and a willingness to listen which was greatly received by the industry leaders in attendance. The leaders in attendance also praised the ingenuity and energy of the American work force. And President-elect Trump suggested recommitting the tech leaders again in the future, perhaps as frequently as every quarter," end quote. The leaders in attendance included Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Safra Catz of Oracle, Tim Cook of Apple, Alex Karp of Palantir, Brian Krzanich of Intel, Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Larry Page of Google, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Eric Schmidt of Google. The president-elect also held productive meetings yesterday with Mr. -- Dr. Zeke Emanuel, Secretary Designate Wilbur Ross, Mr. Andy Beal, Ms. Paula White and Congressman Darrell Issa. I now, will turn it over to Jason to go through today's takeoff. MILLER: Thank you very much, Sean. The president-elect began his day to day meeting with Mr. Joel Kaplan, the vice president for U.S. Public Policy at Facebook. Mr. Kaplan formerly served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and in several other roles in the administration of former President George W. Bush. President-elect Trump Will be also meeting today with Mr. Pete Hegseth, Fox News commentator and veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard. In addition to serving in the military, Mr. Hegseth is the former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America and the former executive director of Vets for Freedom. The president-elect will then be meeting with Mr. Dan DiMicco, a number of the U.S. Trade Rep Landing Team and current Chairman Emeritus of Nucor Steel. Mr. DiMicco previously served as CEO of Nucor Steel for 13 years and has extensive experience overseeing a large steel company impacted by trade policy. President-elect Trump will meet with Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, Peter King, as well as Suffolk County Chairman John LaValle. Both of them were very supportive on the campaign trail. The president-elect will then hold a meeting with the U.S. Conference of Mayors here, at Trump Tower. Attendees of the meeting will include Mayor Mick Cornett, from Oklahoma City; Mayor Mitch Landrieu, from New Orleans; Mayor Stephen Benjamin, from Columbia, South Carolina; Mayor Elizabeth Kautz, from Burnsville, Minnesota; and Tom Cochran, CEO and Executive Director of the United States Conference of Mayors. The president-elect will then be meeting with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Secretary Kobach -- and that's K-O-B-A-C-H -- is a constitutional attorney who is widely known as one of the country's foremost experts on immigration law and border security. As Kansas secretary of state, Secretary Kobach passed the most comprehensive election reform package in the country, the SAFE Act, which requires voter ID at the polls and proof of citizenship for new voter registrants. MILLER: In conclusion of these meetings today, the president- elect and vice president-elect will travel to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for a Thank You America rally, at 7:00 pm at the Giant arena, where we're expecting a big-league turnout this evening. And as a reminder, tomorrow night at 7 PM, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence, will hold the next, thank you America rally, in Orlando, Florida at the Central Florida Fairgrounds. And wrapping up the week on Saturday at 3 PM, the president-elect will hold a, thank you America rally, in Mobile, Alabama at the Ladd Peebles Stadium where he will be joined by U.S. Senator and future Attorney General Jeff Sessions. We will now take questions. OPERATOR: Thank you. If you have any questions, please press "star one." We'll take our first question from Peter Alexander with NBC. QUESTION: Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the call. Given the new reporting from NBC that Vladimir Putin played a direct role in the Russian hacking of the election process in one form or another, here, or at least the process that led up to it, I just wanted to get a sense from you, if you have a reaction to that today. And Donald Trump this morning tweeted about it, he said if Russia or some other entity was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act, why did they only complain after Hillary lost. Obviously this was public, dating back to June, when it was first reported and in October, the DNI and others talked about the fact that Russia was involved in a hacking. So I guess my questions are what are Donald Trump's plans? What will he do as president if it's determined that Russia was involved in the hacking? And given the fact that earlier, he said that it was ridiculous. He said that it could be Russia, China, or someone else sitting on a bed. Has his position changed on whether Russia was involved in the hacking? Thank you. MILLER: Peter, was there a question there, or is that just a series of comments? I think we've addressed this the last several days in a row. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: My question is has his position changed? This morning he said if Russia or some other entity was hacking, so has his position changed or does he still believe it could be Russia, China, or somebody else? MILLER: Well, I'd let the president-elect's tweets speak for themselves. I'd say the continued efforts to try to delegitimize the election at certain point -- certain point got to realize that the election from last month is going to stand, whether it's the recount or continued questions along this line, and we're moving ahead and put together successful administration that's ready go to work serving the American people. OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Connell McShane with Fox Business Network. QUESTION: You know, guys there was another tweet this morning about the media for Mr. Trump, saying the media tries so hard to make my move to the White House as it pertains my business so complex, it actually isn't. So, since today's the day the news conference was supposed to be held, are you guys able to expand at all more than you the last few days on the reasons for that delay until January in terms of what might be known in January, say about Mr. Trump's business interest that is not known now? MILLER: Well, thank you very much. I would say somewhere to what we've -- we've said recently that the president-elect being one of our country's most successful business leaders obviously has a great number of businesses, great number properties and developments, that he has put together and, quite frankly, that takes time. MILLER: As he transitions away from being the leader of this very successful company to becoming solely focused on being president of the United States. They're obviously internal considerations, as far as what the structure will look like for family members that will be taking the reins of the business and I think the priority here is to make sure that we get it right. And if that takes a little bit more time, than I think that's -- I think the American people understand that, and I think they realize this when they voted for this successful business leader, as opposed to a politician in the last months election. And so, I wouldn't say they're necessarily new details, but the president-elect is focused on this, does look forward to having a press conference next month to start going through this and -- in greater detail, so thank you. OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Leo Shane with Military Times. QUESTION: Hi, yes, thanks for the call. You mentioned (inaudible) will be in today to talk to -- to president-elect. I know veterans groups have expressed some concern that there hasn't been an ACH (ph) secretary appointment yet, especially given the president-elect's emphasis on veterans' issues during the campaign. Should they be worried about this? What should they make of, I guess, the small number of folks coming in and talking about this position right now?

Sean, do you have anything you want to add on this? SPICER: I'd just say look, two things. One is, you know, you've got the fastest clip that anyone's ever been at in modern history. So -- but I think to Jason's point, this isn't an area to your question frankly, this is an area that he cares deeply about, reforming the V.A., making sure that the person that comes in and does this has the appropriate skill cell to -- to address the many challenges that -- whether its lending or health care, our veterans deserve. This is, as you correctly mentioned, an area that's near and dear to his heart, and one that he really wants to make sure is addressed appropriately, quickly and successfully. OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Fred Lucas with the Daily Signal. QUESTION: Yes, thanks for taking -- thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk to you about the regulation from the Obama administration. Take (ph) it just yesterday that prohibited states from defunding Planned Parenthood. Is that something the president- elect plans to reverse when he takes office? And also, there has some talk that I've heard that there might be an announcement of a Supreme Court justice before he takes office. Could you address that as well? MILLER: Thank you very much. On the first one, I know that the -- the policy team is reviewing a number of different options for day one, executive orders, as well as additional executive orders during the first 100 days. There has not yet been a final list that's put forward, but as most of you saw Stephen Miller, whose our national policy director who's announced in that position by the president-elect, is working with the team to get those put together. So, no announcement just yet, but I would say, stay tuned. In additionally, with regard to Supreme Court, that's also something that's actively being discussed, but I wouldn't want to go and -- and set an arbitrary time table at this point. Obviously it's a matter of the -- the utmost importance. The president-elect had previously put out a list of 20 very, highly qualified individuals from which he would select. I know they've continued to narrow that list down. He himself has said that that's probably a shorter list of five or six folks that are near the top that that's being narrowed down to. And -- but again, this -- this is another one where it's of absolute utmost priority so need to make sure we get this one right. OPERATOR: We'll take our final question from Courtney Weaver with Financial Times. QUESTION: Hey there. I was wondering -- do you have confirmation dates yet for Tillerson and Mattis? MILLER: I'm not aware of those confirmation dates being sent yet. But obviously we're moving as quickly as possible. As soon as we have confirmation dates for those positions or any of the others we'll make sure that we get them out to everyone. OPERATOR: And this does conclude our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers. SPICER: Hey, guys, have a great day. Enjoy the snow if your in New York and we'll see you tomorrow morning. MILLER: All right, thanks, everyone, appreciate it. OPERATOR: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government attackers Article Continued Below Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. On Dec. 14, 2016, Yahoo said it believes hackers stole data from more than one billion user accounts in August 2013.  (Michael Probst / The Associated Press)   In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things in our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, Calif., company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion (U.S.) — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two hacks, more than a billion accounts Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: it doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be renegotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said.

The Grammy winner announced the partnership Thursday. Amex (AXP) said the job could include helping design cards and picking the music for its airport lounges, in addition to developing benefits and services for cardholders. It's the first time Amex has enlisted a creative director for the Platinum Card, though certainly not the first time a celebrity has teamed with a company in a brand ambassador role. Intel tapped will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas to be its director of creative innovation back in 2011. And Dr. Dre is now part of team Apple after it bought his headphone maker, Beats. But not all partnerships between Hollywood and corporate America work so well. Alicia Keys was creative director of struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry for just a year. And Lady Gaga parted ways with Polaroid after a four-year stint as its creative director. American Express has a long history of teaming up with celebrities to promote its other cards, including Martin Scorsese, Ellen DeGeneres, Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi, Shaun White and Tina Fey. Related: AmEx vows to cut costs Janey Whiteside, an Amex senior vice president, said the company chose Pharrell because he's a "creative powerhouse." "He's traveled the world, he has an amazing and curious mind," she said. "He's so much more than just a performer." Amex would not say what it will pay Pharrell. It has vowed to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017. "We've said quite publicly that we are investing in our premium brands," Whiteside said. "And we've been saying that for months so this is something to do with the creative vision of the platinum product itself." --CNNMoney's Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report.

 The net asset value (NAV) of a closed-end fund is the market value of the underlying investments (i.e., stocks and bonds) in the Fund's portfolio, minus liabilities, divided by the total number of Fund shares outstanding. However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount. Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at http://www.all-starfunds.com/. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.

No More Ransom portal adds 32 more free decryption tools to help you Bitdefender, Check Point, Emsisoft and Trend Micro have joined the No More Ransom scheme - allowing more victims of ransomware to get their files back without paying criminals. By Danny Palmer | December 15, 2016 -- 16:21 GMT (08:21 PST) | Topic: Security Wildfire is one of the types of ransomware which No More Ransom offers decryption tools for. Image: McAfee Labs A scheme which enables victims of ransomware to decrypt their files and data for free is now offering even more decryption tools thanks to new partners pledging to help take the fight to cybercriminals. Launched by Europol, the Dutch National Police, Intel Security, and Kaspersky Lab in July this year, the No More Ransom initiative provides keys to unlocking encrypted files, as well as information on how to avoid getting infected in the first place. The website initially launched with four tools for unlocking different types of ransomware, including the notorious CryptXXX. During its first two months, No More Ransom helped 2,500 people rescue their data, depriving cybercriminals of more than €1.35 million in ransom. To date, the scheme has so far helped nearly 6,000 people decrypt devices locked by the likes of MarsJoke, Teslacrypt and Wildfire without needing to pay criminals for the privilege. Now thirty new partners are joining the scheme, offering new possibilities to the victims of ransomware with a decryption tools for a wider array of the different variants of the malicious file-locking software. Cybersecurity firms Bitdefender, Check Point, Emsisoft and Trend Micro have all joined the No More Ransom project, adding 32 new decryption tools for ransomware variants including Globe 2 -the ransomware which recently took a whole UK hospital group offline - Stampedo, FenixLocker and more. Initially only available in English, the No More Ransom portal is now available in Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese and Russian in order to better assist victims of ransomware across the globe. Translations into other languages are currently ongoing, but Europol say their implantation will follow "very soon". New supporting partners of the scheme include a variety of private companies from across Europe, as well as eu-LISA - European Agency for the operational management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the area of freedom, security and justice - and the Austrian, Croatian, Danish, Finnish, Maltese, Romanian, Singaporean and Slovenian police. The total of countries involved with No More Ransom now stands at 22. No More Ransom recommends protection measures such as regularly backing up systems so ransomware can't destroy personal data, using robust security software and warns PC users not to trust any suspicious-looking links in messages. Ransomware has boomed during 2016, with the cost of ransomware attacks expected to amount to more than $1 billion by the end of the year.

Somewhere in between you'll find 15-inch systems like the ASUS ROG Strix GL502VS, a gaming laptop small and light enough to lug around, yet thick enough to house the sort of powerful internals you'd need to play just about any game you want. Though it's not a premium machine by any means, the Strix strikes a nice balance between power and portability. Gallery: ASUS ROG Strix GL502VS review | 11 Photos 11 +7 Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key ASUS ROG Strix GL502 from $1599+ Buy Now 80 Pros Fast and powerful Lightweight for its size VR ready Cons Disappointingbattery life Finicky trackpad Distractingbright orange accents Summary The Strix is an excellent mid-range gaming laptop. It may not have a premium build, and it suffers from middling battery life, but it has more than enough power to handle any game you might care to throw at it. Even in virtual reality. Design Spotting a gaming laptop in a crowded coffee shop is easy -- just look for the loudest, most garish machine in the room. Indeed, ASUS' Strix wouldn't take long to find: The laptop's otherwise subdued chassis is adorned with glowing neon orange highlights. Colorful touches against a dark frame are a common design trope in gaming notebooks, but the Strix's obnoxiously bright shade of orange is the ultimate "look at me" color, with accents everywhere from the speaker grilles, logos, WASD keycaps, and keyboard lettering to the touchpad. It's also the machine's only visual flair; apart from the dim red hue of the Strix's air vent, the rest of the chassis is a study in black plastic and straight lines. The Strix lacks the premium feel of an aluminum milled machine, but the trade-off is worth it: The plastic chassis makes this relatively light for a midsize gaming laptop, weighing in at just over five pounds. It doesn't feel cheap for the sake of the material either -- a brushed plastic palm rest mimics the look and feel of the single aluminum plate adorning the lid. It's a handsome machine, and a fairly portable one too. All told, its 1.18-inch-thick frame is just thin enough to comfortably fit my backpack's laptop sleeve. Those thick edges leave plenty of room for connectivity too, including three USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, an SD card reader, Ethernet and outputs for HDMI and Mini DisplayPort. Worried the next generation of peripherals will leave you in the dust? Don't. The Strix also has a single USB Type-C connector. Not bad. Keyboard and trackpad You could use the Strix's keyboard to write home, but you wouldn't. It's nothing special. That isn't to say there's anything wrong with it; the Strix's well-spaced keys offer 1.6mm of travel and land with a firm but not hard stop. It's a perfectly serviceable keyboard with little to add to the experience apart from a dark red backlight. In fact, the only thing that sets it apart from any other is an ASUS standard: The company has replaced the ten-key pad's Num Lock toggle with a dedicated button for calling up its ROG Gaming Center software (more on that later). It's mostly a harmless change, but vigorous typists may accidentally find themselves launching ASUS' gaming suite when they mean to strike the backspace key. Well, I did anyway. The keyboard at least has standard "gaming keyboard" features, including a set of colored WASD keycaps (draped in the same obnoxious orange as the rest of the laptop's highlights) and anti-ghosting support for up to 30 simultaneous key presses. The trackpad, on the other hand, can be a bit flighty. The large, smooth mousing surface works fine for basic cursor manipulation, but I found it unreliable when it came to multi-touch gestures. On more than one occasion, the surface misread two-finger scrolling as a zoom pinch. At least once, too, it misinterpreted my attempt to pinch the zoom back to normal as a scroll. Most of the time, it reads either gesture just fine, but these are the kind of issues that have long given Windows touchpads a bad reputation. Combined with the pad's stiff buttons, this trackpad feels like a step backward. Display and audio The display here has everything you could ask for from a gaming laptop: a non-reflective screen with wide viewing angles, deep contrast and bright, beautiful colors. In fact, ASUS says the Strix's panel covers 98 percent of Adobe's RGB color space and 100 percent of the sRGB standard. That's great for gamers, but even better for folks using the machine to do video editing or Photoshop work. Laptop audio is almost never remarkable, but the Strix's speakers are somewhat notable. Instead of flanking the keyboard, like on most laptops, the Strix's speakers live on either side of the touchpad. It's sort of clever: The speakers' already clear sound pops just a little more by dint of being closer to the user. It's nice. Beyond that trick, however, the audio seems to be on par with that of other gaming laptops: clear, but not particularly deep. As always, a good equalizer goes a long way; turning off the ROG Gaming Center's audio enhancements leaves the machine sounding a bit dull. The Strix also comes equipped with a trio of microphones designed to filter out ambient sounds, but the array failed in my recording tests to remove noise from a fan on the other end of my house or even the sound of passing traffic. There may be three laptop microphones in this gaming rig, but at the end of the day they're still just laptop microphones.

By overshadowing them with high-end internals and excellent gaming performance. With a 2.6GHz Intel i7-6700HQ CPU (3.5GHz with Turbo boost), 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage on top of a 256GB SSD boot drive, the Strix handled my workload with aplomb. Still, we don't buy gaming laptops to manage cloud documents, chat applications, music players and Photoshop; we buy them to play games. So how'd ASUS' kit do? Just fine, thank you. The Strix's NVIDIA GeForce 1070 GPU didn't completely shrug off my PC game library, but it certainly kept pace with it. Games like TitanFall 2, Just Cause 3, Hitman and Battlefield 1 all maintained solid frame rates of 60 to 90 fps on their highest graphic settings, though Battlefield 1 could occasionally drop into the high 40s on busier multiplayer maps. More demanding titles like The Witcher 3 and Watch Dogs 2 dipped just below the 60-fps threshold on "Ultra" settings, but could be coaxed above it with a few tweaks. All told, there wasn't a single game in my library the Strix couldn't comfortably play at its highest settings. Well, at least not until you put those games in virtual reality. That's right, we're living in a new era of gaming laptops -- an age when any machine worth its salt will bear a "VR Ready" sticker. The Strix is the first of this breed to land on Engadget's review desk. With a score of 6,135 in VRMark's "Orange Room" benchmark (and 1,640 in the more intensive "Blue Room" experience), the GL502VS is indeed a VR-capable gaming PC. It can run pretty much everything available in today's consumer virtual reality market. It can't, however, play all those VR games at their highest fidelity. The laptop can run most virtual reality titles at their default settings, but configuring games like Raw Data and Serious Sam VR on Ultra can give the Strix serious pause. Pushing these games to the max turned their virtual landscapes into laggy, stuttering realities, resulting in the kind of head-tracking delays and low frame rates that can lead to nausea and VR headaches. Fortunately, you'd really have to go out of your way to get a bad experience: Few VR games offer configurable graphics for this very reason, and everything I ran on the Strix played beautifully on default settings. That's more than good enough for the first generation of PC VR games, but you also shouldn't consider the machine future-proof by any means. Still, it's good enough for now. Keep your virtual worlds tuned for performance, and not visual fidelity, and you'll be happy.

In Engadget's standard battery test (where we loop an HD video at fixed brightness until exhaustion), the Strix barely lasted three hours. Sadly, that's barely below par for the majority of larger gaming laptops, but still: It's disappointing. When competitors like Alienware, Razer and HP can make high-performance rigs that last between six and eight hours, three is just underwhelming. ASUS can, and probably should, do better. Software As the years go on, manufacturer pack-in software has become less and less necessary. Most laptop builders have done away with branded update tools, display managers and audio filters. ASUS hasn't, but its software suites get slimmer year by year. In the past, ASUS' ROG Gaming Center application served as a hub for half a dozen purpose-built programs for adjusting the audio equalizer, tweaking screen settings and configuring keyboard macros. Now all of that is simply integrated into the main application. Unfortunately, that app is unintuitive and messy and doesn't even do much. The ROG Gaming Center will let you adjust the color temperature of your screen (including normal, vivid, manual and "eye care" modes); choose from five audio presets; and disable the Windows key. But that's about it. There's an "advanced tuning" button as well as a system resource monitor, but these features just replicate the functions of the built-in Windows Task Manager. Being able to tweak screen and audio presets in one place is nice, but it's not useful enough to warrant a dedicated keyboard button. If only the software suite included a key mapper -- at least then the laptop's ROG button might be able to do something useful. The Strix does pack in one more standard ASUS gaming application: the Gamefirst network manager. This program isn't necessary, but it is sort of neat, offering users an overview of their PC's internet activity. Want to know what programs are using the most bandwidth, or prioritize Steam over Chrome for downloads? You can do that here. Configuration options and the competition My $1,700 review unit came with the maximum specifications ASUS offers for its Strix laptops: an Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6GHz CPU (3.6GHz with Turbo Boost), 16GB of RAM, 1TB of onboard storage with a 256GB SSD boot drive, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics chip. Downgrading the GPU on that machine to NVIDIA's GTX 1060M will save you $200. To cut the price by another $120 and change, be prepared to give up the "VR Ready" sticker, cut the solid-state storage in half and settle for last year's GTX 970M GPU. Finally, bottom-dollar buyers can find a $1,200 model with the same CPU and RAM as our review unit, sans solid-state drive and paired with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX970M graphics card. ASUS says additional configurations exist too, but they vary from one country to another. Not sure this is the right 15-inch gaming rig for you? You have plenty of other options: Dell's Alienware 15 comes in an array of VR-Ready configurations between $1,350 and $1,750, with plenty of RAM, fast processors and NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics chips -- but you'll need to shell out $2,150 for the top model if you want to match the Strix's GTX 1070. MSI's GT652VR Dominator is a close match to our review laptop as well, but it'll cost you $100 more and leave you with half the RAM. If you don't mind having a slightly larger screen, the best bang-for-your-buck alternative might be HP's 17-inch Omen, which can be configured with the same processor and GPU as the Strix for only $1,500. The trade-off: It ships with only 512GB of storage. Wrap-up ASUS' Republic of Gamers brand has a strong pedigree for reasonably priced, powerful gaming laptops, and the GL502VS Strix is exactly that: a mid-range gaming rig that can handle just about anything you might throw at it, even virtual reality. Some garish flourishes, subpar battery life and a disappointing trackpad keep it from being a truly excellent machine, but for those looking to split the difference between the category's large, overpowered gaming rigs and its expensive ultraportables, the Strix is a solid choice.

The Grammy winner announced the partnership Thursday. Amex said the job could include helping design cards and picking the music for its airport lounges, in addition to developing benefits and services for cardholders. It’s the first time Amex has enlisted a creative director for the Platinum Card, though certainly not the first time a celebrity has teamed with a company in a brand ambassador role. Intel tapped will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas to be its director of creative innovation back in 2011. And Dr. Dre is now part of team Apple after it bought his headphone maker, Beats. But not all partnerships between Hollywood and corporate America work so well. Alicia Keys was creative director of struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry for just a year. And Lady Gaga parted ways with Polaroid after a four-year stint as its creative director. American Express has a long history of teaming up with celebrities to promote its other cards, including Martin Scorsese, Ellen DeGeneres, Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi, Shaun White and Tina Fey. Janey Whiteside, an Amex senior vice president, said the company chose Pharrell because he’s a “creative powerhouse.” “He’s traveled the world, he has an amazing and curious mind,” she said. “He’s so much more than just a performer.” Amex would not say what it will pay Pharrell. It has vowed to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017. “We’ve said quite publicly that we are investing in our premium brands,” Whiteside said. “And we’ve been saying that for months so this is something to do with the creative vision of the platinum product itself.” –CNNMoney’s Paul R.

On Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016, Yahoo said it believes hackers stole data from more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Related Coverage Yahoo says hackers stole info in 500 million user accounts Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.83B, marking end of an era Yahoo to cut 1,700 workers as CEO tries to save her own job Yahoo’s updated email app aims to kill the password SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. GOVERNMENT ATTACKERS Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. QUESTIONS FOR VERIZON News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo’s shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.     Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

A major player in the tech industry, Twitter was noticeably absent from the incoming president's meeting, which included the heads of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Google, Facebook, Oracle, IBM, Intel, Cisco and Palantir. Trump adviser Sean Spicer denied reports that the exclusion was done purposefully, telling MSNBC that the "conference table was only so big." Sources close to the situation, however, told Politico that Twitter's absence from the summit, which also included several members from the president-elect's team, was related to CEO Jack Dorsey's rejection of the anti-Hillary Clinton emoji. Trump's campaign openly criticized the social media website and its CEO for refusing to create custom emojis despite having signed an "upfront deal," in which the Republican's team pledged to spend a certain amount on advertising in exchange for "discounts, perks and custom solutions." Gary Coby, director of digital advertising and fundraising for Trump's campaign, blasted Twitter in a November Medium.com post for reportedly rejecting three versions of the "Crooked Hillary" emoji -- a hand receiving a bag of money, a stick figure running with a bag of money and a bag of money with wings. Coby accused Dorsey of personally intervening to quash the emoji, which would have been offered as a replacement to the hashtag "#CrookedHillary." Spicer, who also serves as the Republican National Committee spokesman, was reportedly the one who made the call to refuse Dorsey and other Twitter executives' invitations to the Wednesday meeting, sources told Politico. He, however, staunchly denied such reports and told MSNBC Wednesday that Twitter's exclusion from the meeting was not done intentionally. Other top tech companies, Spicer added, were also not represented at the summit. Another transition official further told Reuters that Twitter, a $13.85 billion company, wasn't "big enough" to be invited to the meeting, which focused on improving technology in schools, reducing bureaucracy and strengthening the country's cyber security, among other things. Tesla, a $31.92 billion company, was the smallest in attendance at the summit, Reuters reported.

"Serving as FCC Chairman during this period of historic technological change has been the greatest honor of my professional life," Wheeler said in a statement announcing the move. His departure means that the FCC will start the Trump administration with a 2-1 majority, allowing the new Republican majority to immediately begin dismantling Obama-era regulations. While it is customary for FCC chairmen to resign at the start of a new administration, Wheeler had for months refused to publicly commit to stepping down when Obama leaves office, angering Republican lawmakers who held up the confirmation of his fellow FCC Democrat, Jessica Rosenworcel. The Senate did not approve Rosenworcel for a new term before it left town for recess last week, and she will have to leave the commission by Jan. 3.

TRUMP, TECH TRY TO MEND FENCES — Tony’s dispatch from Trump Tower, with help from Alex and Nancy: “The bitter war between Donald Trump and the tech giants he regularly denigrated on the 2016 campaign trail appeared to reach something of a temporary cease-fire on Wednesday,” he writes. “Months after publicly slamming Apple, Amazon, Facebook and their leaders, the president-elect invited tech executives to Trump Tower for a summit that Trump himself opened by extending an olive branch. ‘There's nobody like you in the world,’ Trump said at the outset of a meeting. ‘There's nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, we're going to be there for you.’” Full story here.

As always, catch the rest of the team’s contact info after Quick Downloads. BIGGEST BREACH EVER — One billion accounts. Yahoo says that’s the number affected by a data breach the company disclosed Wednesday. An unrelated breach that the tech giant disclosed in September was half that size, and many dubbed that one the biggest ever. The newest one dates to 2013, which cybersecurity experts said was troubling. “Yahoo never spotted this breach, and only learned of it years later through outside sources,” Willy Leichter of CipherCloud said via email. “The extent of data exposed is still not clear and these revelations will likely continue.” While Yahoo hasn’t yet blamed a nation-state for this breach, as it did for the one it announced in September, it’s a real risk. “Consider the emails of a less tame or even reckless political candidate, three-letter agency chair, general, or CEO,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer of Intel Security, via email. “They could contain material sensitive enough to destroy careers, enable blackmail, endanger a military mission, or influence high-level business or state to state negotiations and decisions. As is the case in any cyber-attack, the incentive is there, the reputation threat is real, and intelligence services have one billion reasons to try.” Those affected by the breach include 150,000 U.S. government and military employees, Bloomberg reports. GOOGLE AMPS UP OUTREACH TO REPUBLICAN LOBBYISTS — The search giant has plans to increase its outreach toward and hiring of GOP lobbyists as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, according to a source close to the matter. The move was first reported by Reuters. Currently, Google’s D.C. office includes several Republicans including former Rep. Susan Molinari. PRITZKER TALKS LEGACY — Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker is touting the digital legacy her department is leaving for future administrations. “Cybersecurity threats are on the rise. Notions of privacy are being upended. Automation and globalization are changing the nature of work for our people and disrupting entire industries,” she’ll say today in a speech to the Digital Economy Board of Advisors. “We have taken significant steps to ensure that future Secretaries of Commerce have the tools to engage with the private sector and other leading thinkers on key issues related to the digital economy – and this Board is a critical piece of that.” Watch the meeting, here. PUBLISHERS PITCH TRUMP ON COPYRIGHT REFORM — The Association of American Publishers is joining the chorus of groups pressing Trump to update copyright policy. In a letter this morning, the group says a revamped Digital Millennium Copyright Act could help fight online content theft. “The current epidemic of online infringement harms public as well as private interests in the availability of such works, and the legal flaws that hamper the DMCA in its intended operation need to be fixed by our nation’s elected representatives,” the group writes. TPI’S POLICY PRINCIPLES — The Technology Policy Institute is releasing a policy paper in conjunction with its event today on innovation priorities for the new administration. The group recommends, among other things: streamlining cross-border flows of data and talent, shifting away from the public utility-type regulation of broadband and making access to spectrum licenses more flexible. See it here. UBER’S STANDOFF WITH CALIFORNIA DMV — The ride-sharing company is testing self-driving vehicles in San Francisco, but the California Department of Motor Vehicles says it hasn’t secured the necessary permits to do so, Reuters reports. Uber argues that since its autonomous cars have a human monitor inside when they hit the road, they’re complying with state law, according to the report. This was the same logic the company used in Pittsburgh, where its tests did not require additional regulatory steps. — Uber encountered another bump in the road when one of its self-driving vehicles was caught on camera appearing to run a red light during the first day of testing, The San Francisco Examiner reports. “Safety is our top priority,” an Uber spokesperson told The Verge. “This incident has been reported and we are looking into what happened.” AMAZON’S PRIME AIR TAKES FLIGHT — Continuing his company’s push for commercial drones, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tweeted that Amazon Prime Air had completed its first-ever delivery (consisting of an Amazon Fire streaming device and popcorn) near Cambridge, England. “The fact that Amazon’s latest drone tests were in Britain is no coincidence,” the New York Times reports. “The country’s regulators have been more cooperative than their American counterparts about such flights, even signing an agreement with Amazon in July to allow the testing of drones in rural and suburban areas.” THE GRINCH WHO STOLE SMART TOYS — That would be Bill Nelson, the Senate Commerce Committee’s top Democrat. He released a report from the panel cautioning parents about the privacy risks of smart toys like teddy bears and GPS watches, citing several alleged incidents in which manufacturers did not secure children’s information.“It’s frightening to think that our children’s toys can be used against them in this way,” said Nelson in a news release. “The companies that make these toys have to do more to safeguard the parents and children who use them.” QUICK DOWNLOADS Before Pokemon Go, there was the U.S. Postal Service: The USPS reprises its augmented reality offerings this December (it had a Charlie Brown-themed app last year), with the release of a new app that enables recipients to scan packages and see a message overlaid on the boxes they receive, Mashable reports. Facebook’s got plans for expanding video programming: It’s looking into purchasing licenses for content including scripted shows and sports, Recode reports. Twitter’s instant message tool that wasn’t: The company had previously dedicated over a year to building a messaging app targeting emerging markets, which was designed to introduce users to the platform. It nixed the feature after its India engineering center closed, BuzzFeed reports. CTA looks at tech’s economic impact: The Consumer Technology Association, in a report with PricewaterhouseCoopers out Wednesday, finds that the consumer tech industry generated $413 billion in taxes and $3.5 trillion in total economic output in 2015.

On Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016, Yahoo said it believes hackers stole data from more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... NEW YORK — The revelation of Yahoo’s latest hack underscores what many Americans have known for years: All those emails, photos and other personal files stored online can easily be stolen, and there’s little anyone can do about it. The only saving grace is that the attackers apparently did not exploit the information for fraud. But their true motives remain a mystery. While there are a number of straightforward measures all users should take to protect themselves, relatively few people actually do. And in this case, doing so wouldn’t really have mattered. Even the most scrupulous individual countermeasures could only limit the damage. Advertisement Continue reading “Yahoo users could have had immaculate computer security and still been the victim here,” said Will Ackerly, chief technology officer at Virtru, a computer security firm he co-founded after working for eight years at the National Security Agency. “Short of using encryption, there’s no way to keep your email from being compromised in this kind of hack.” The mega breach disclosed Wednesday exposed more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said the attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement in September about a 2014 hack that Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government. That breach affected 500 million accounts. Some experts believe the record-breaking amount of data stolen in the breach announced Wednesday also points to state-sponsored hackers in search of a specific target, which could be why three years later the data still hasn’t been spotted for sale on the web. And neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: No organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that means no one is safe. The hacks represent yet another stumble for the struggling Sunnyvale, California, company as it tries to reinvent itself. The breaches occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who has been unable to turn around the company in the four years since she arrived. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be jeopardized by the hacking revelations. Advertisement Continue reading Meanwhile, it’s clear that Yahoo didn’t do enough to protect its users. For example, the company acknowledges using MD5, a password-storage method considered by many experts to be inadequate and inferior to others available at the time of the hack. One of Yahoo’s priorities will now need to be keeping its users updated as its investigation progresses, said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy for SentinelOne. “I think that would go a long way to assuring users and everybody that they’re doing the right things,” said Grossman, who worked in security at Yahoo from 1999 to 2001. “The best peace of mind in cybersecurity is transparency.” There’s only so much a company like Yahoo can do to protect its users without damaging its business model, which involves selling advertising based on data gleaned from its users, Grossman noted. As a result, it can’t do things like encrypt user data, which would make the information useless to hackers. Other companies that don’t sell advertising, such as Apple, are able to encrypt. And some, such as Google, do so too but not in a way that would have protected against this type of hack. They also hold the keys to that encryption, giving them the access they need for advertising sales. “If you take a step back, the 1 billion people aren’t Yahoo’s customers, they’re its product,” Grossman said. For Yahoo users, experts say, there’s little to do except for changing their passwords if they haven’t done so in the past three years. And it’s tough to protect against future hacks at Yahoo or other companies that hold personal information. Changing email providers is, at the very least, a pain for most people. Experts say picking a tough password is a must , though they are divided on exactly how important it is to change it frequently. Advertisement Continue reading The same password should not be used for multiple sites, and the questions and answers needed to reset it should be unique as well. While perfect security doesn’t exist, no one wants to be an easy target either. Cybersecurity experts like to compare the hacker threat to running from a bear: You don’t have to be the fastest runner — just not the slowest. The Yahoo breach should serve as a lesson to users that they can’t assume that companies, even large multi-national tech companies, are doing security right, said John Shier, senior security adviser at Sophos. “Hopefully this is the one that wakes everybody up, although I doubt it will be,” Shier said. “It’s frustrating to see this happen over and over again when for many years we’ve known how to better protect systems.” ___ AP technology writers Michael Liedtke in San Francisco and Mae Anderson in Atlanta contributed to this report. ___ Follow Bree Fowler at http://twitter.com/APBreeFowler .

Also attending the session Wednesday at Trump Tower were leaders from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, Oracle, IBM, Cisco and Tesla -- many of whom actively opposed his election. "I found today's meeting with the president-elect, his transition team and tech leaders to be very productive," Bezos told CNBC on Wednesday. "I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech -- agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -- everywhere." Trump often has been critical of Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, but they were civil Wednesday. "We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation," Trump said of those attending in a press briefing before the meeting. "There's no one like you in the world....anything we can do to help this go along, we're going to be there for you. You can call my people, call me — it makes no difference — we have no formal chain of command around here." The meeting was organized by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and PayPal and Palantir co-founder and Trump transition adviser Peter Thiel. Also in attendance were Trump's three grown children -- Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric -- as well as billionaire Wilbur Ross, his commerce secretary pick, and Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, his selection for director of the National Economic Council. "I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come here to this meeting," Trump said. "And I will say Peter [Thiel] was saying, 'No, that company's too small,' and these are monster companies. But I want to start by thanking Peter, because he saw something very early, maybe before we saw it. And of course, he's known for that... he's ahead of the curve." Topics included jobs, skilled immigration and China, a person familiar with what was discussed told CNBC on Wednesday. "They're going to do fair trade deals," Trump said. "They're going to make it easier for you to trade across borders, because there are a lot of restrictions, a lot of problems. If you have any ideas on that, that would be great." Other attendees were two of Trump's economic advisers: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. "This is a truly amazing group of people," Trump said from the 25th-floor conference room before the press departed from the 90-minute meeting. None of the executives spoke to the media after the meeting. No one from Twitter was invited. Twitter declined to comment on why, but one of his campaign officials wrote on Medium that Twitter had killed a #CrookedHillary emoji. Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Trump, said Twitter was left out because of space considerations.

RHT, +0.07% the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the availability of Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10, the company’s massively-scalable and agile cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution. Based on the upstream OpenStack ‘Newton’ release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 drives new features that increase system-wide scalability, ease infrastructure management, and improve orchestration, while also enhancing network performance and platform security. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduces a new software life cycle, with optional support up to 5 years. Hundreds of customers rely on Red Hat OpenStack Platform to power their hybrid and private clouds for a variety of mission-critical deployments, including BBVA; Cambridge University; FICO; NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Paddy Power Betfair; Produban; Swisscom; UKCloud; and Verizon. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is backed by a robust ecosystem of certified partners, including Cisco, Dell EMC, Fujitsu, Intel, Lenovo, Rackspace, and NetApp for enterprise businesses, as well as Ericsson, Nokia, NEC, Huawei, Cisco and others from the telecommunications industry. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 delivers a reliable cloud platform built on the proven, enterprise-grade backbone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Integrated with Red Hat’s hardened OpenStack community code, Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides the agility to scale and more quickly meet customer demand without compromising availability, performance, or IT security requirements. Also included in Red Hat OpenStack Platform is Red Hat CloudForms, a hybrid cloud management and monitoring platform to oversee not only OpenStack infrastructure components but also the workloads running on a given OpenStack cloud. Additionally, 64 TBs of storage capacity is provided with Red Hat Ceph Storage, enabling users to better evaluate the flexible, massively scalable properties of Ceph’s leading storage solution for OpenStack environments. New enhancements and updates to Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 include: A more streamlined user experience driven by an easier-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) reduces the complexities of installation and management. Designed for production use, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director GUI provides several newly integrated functions, such as automatic upgrades and updates (including Ceph), advanced networking configuration, high availability, and the option to deploy file sharing via the Manila service, using the integrated drivers available from NetApp and Red Hat Ceph Storage. Improved flexibility for greater scalability through the introduction of customizable services and administration roles using Red Hat OpenStack Platform director. Cloud operators are now able to control their OpenStack environment at a more granular level by customizing OpenStack services to run and scale independently of each other. This offers greater flexibility when deploying services to match individual organizations’ unique workload requirements. Greater data assurance through new security-related enhancements, such as improved high availability (HA) for large scale deployments. Additionally, optional object storage encryption and ephemeral security tokens improve security measures and lower risk of data access due to theft. Improved performance for network-intensive workloads through the new data plane developer kit (DPDK) component of Open vSwitch, and single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV), results in network performance that is comparable to bare metal. Additionally, network routing is now more flexible and faster, allowing customers to choose between centralized routing or distributed routing (DVR). A new “ready state” hardware certification program, based on OpenStack Ironic. While Red Hat already supports certified hardware plug-ins for several OpenStack components, the new program is designed to expand the ecosystem of hardware options for automated bare-metal configuration. Dell EMC is the first Red Hat partner to be certified for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 ready-state, with several more coming soon. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 also introduces distributed continuous integration (DCI) to key partners, such as Dell EMC, NEC, and Rackspace. This collaborative approach to testing can help partners more effectively prepare for new Red Hat OpenStack Platform releases, and provide customers with greater stability and higher quality cloud solutions that have been tested many times over with their uniquely integrated cloud system than previously offered. New lifecycle offers up to 5 years support To help customers achieve long-term stability required by their specific workload requirements, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduces a dual support life cycle model that offers greater subscription flexibility for mission-critical operations. This new model gives customers the option of standardizing on a new “Long Life” version of Red Hat OpenStack Platform, offering a three year product lifecycle and optional two additional years of extended life cycle (ELS) support available for purchase. Customers can also choose to focus on consuming new feature functionality by using rolling upgrades to follow the latest releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform every six months to one year. Long Life versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform will be offered every third release, starting with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10. Versions in between will include one year of life cycle support. Supporting Quotes Radhesh Balakrishnan, general manager, OpenStack, Red Hat “In just a few short years, OpenStack has moved from simply being an ‘innovation’ for proofs-of-concept and R&D testbeds to a foundation for mission-critical private cloud deployments, used by hundreds of enterprises and major telecommunication providers alike to power production operations. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 drives the enterprise-readiness of OpenStack by delivering a stable, reliable and open foundation for cloud deployments, delivering new innovations like composable services and roles while retaining our commitment to enterprise stability, highlighted by our new Long Life support model.” Lew Tucker, vice president, Cloud CTO, Cisco “As one of Red Hat's most committed OpenStack partners, Cisco works closely with Red Hat and the community to drive industry-leading cloud technology platforms, better enabling our enterprise and service provider customers to gain the benefits of an open cloud computing platform.

On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack -- one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government -- that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign -- not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. "The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government Attackers Of course, it's not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments." Yahoo's security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion -- a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two hacks, more than a billion accounts Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the "new development before reaching any final conclusions." Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses "definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price," Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. "We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon," the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.

Databricks raises $60 million to be big data’s next great leap forward Posted Dec 15, 2016 by Jonathan Shieber (@jshieber) 0 SHARES Next Story Instagram surges past 600M users, fueled by algorithmic feed Looking to be the next leap forward in data organization, computation, and delivery for big data Databricks, the business built on top of the popular Apache Spark open source project, has raised $60 million in new financing. Taking the route mapped by so many big data companies before it, Databricks is the business that the open source Apache Spark project built. Spark is the next step in data scientists’ long march to make massive amounts of data easy to understand and use in the next generation of applications. Data processing at velocity and volume has any number of applications in today’s data-rich world. And the victor — the company that can process that data and effectively serve it up in a way that folks inside businesses can understand and use effectively — will take the most spoils. The Spark project is part of an open source family of tools under the Hadoop umbrella that has already collected a ton (and I mean A TON) of cash. Companies like Cloudera, which raised roughly $1 billion (actually $900 million — including $760 million from Intel) during the effervescent days of 2014, came to market with claims of a better way to store and manage large amounts of data far more cheaply than any previous infrastructure technology. It’s the stuff that companies like Facebook and Google use to process the billions of pieces of data that they collect. Spark… is the next step… focusing not on the storage of data, but on how to manage it most effectively. The two work in concert, but are not the same. With its latest financing, led by the company’s previous investor, New Enterprise Associates, and including participation from Databricks’ initial investor Andreessen Horowitz, the company is looking to take its tech to the next level. The San Francisco-based company has already taken its product through some pretty intense paces, wresting the pole position in the CloudSort benchmark from an open source offering developed by the University of California, San Diego. Databricks dropped the price of sorting 100 terabytes of data from the previous record of $4.51 per Terabyte to $1.44 per TB (for data scientists… that’s a spicy meatball!). The company worked with Nanjing University and Alibaba Group to form the team, that now holds the world record. The CloudSort Benchmark is a competition designed to develop technologies that will reduce the total cost of ownership of the cloud architecture (a combination of software stack, hardware stack, and tuning) and encouraging organizations to adopt and deploy big data applications onto the public cloud. Beyond the business case, data scientists are flocking to the project, according to Databricks. There are now more than 288,000 members of the community, and over 1,000 active contributors from 250 organizations, the company said. Databricks launched its first product in 2014, around the time it raised $33 million in the first round to include NEA. In all, the company has raised roughly $100 million. At the time of the last financing, my colleague Ron Miller wrote about the first product: … the company also announced a new cloud platform called Databricks Cloud that Stoica, says has been designed to simplify big data processing by bringing the process under one cloud umbrella. The cloud solution consists of three pieces: The Databricks Platform, Spark and the Databricks workspace. The idea behind the product, Stoica says, is to provide a single place to process data without having to worry about managing a Hadoop cluster to process your data. It’s all done in the cloud instead in a managed environment. After you add your data to a project, you can begin working with it immediately. The product has several core concepts starting with Notebooks, which provide a way to interact with the data and build graphs. As you discover ways of displaying your data, you can begin to build dashboards to monitor certain types of data. Finally, the platform includes a job launcher, which enables users to schedule Apache Spark jobs to run at certain times. The company’s product has found a home with more than 400 customers and the new money will expand sales and marketing, the company said. “Apache Spark has enabled countless enterprises and cutting-edge early adopters to create business value through advanced analytics solutions,” said Ali Ghodsi, CEO and Co-Founder at Databricks, in a statement. “As Spark’s adoption and the demand for our managed Spark platform continues to rise, this funding will advance our engineering and go-to-market strategies to address all of our customer’s pain points as we continue to grow the Spark community.”   Featured Image: luckey_sun/Flickr UNDER A CC BY-SA 2.0 LICENSE 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Happy New Year from Crunch Report!

(Photo: The Motley Fool) You probably heard this: Billionaire Elon Musk just came up with this crazy idea that all his Tesla electric cars will soon be self-driving. Yes, Musk is a genuine genius and I’m a huge believer in where Tesla is steering the entire auto industry. But I have never seen so many people get so excited about a single peach while ignoring the entire orchard. All of the talking heads in the media go on and on about Tesla, but they’re not telling you the really BIG story behind it all. It’s the giant prize that Tesla and hundreds of other companies are chasing. And before you ask, no… it’s not self-driving cars. Self-driving cars could be almost insignificant compared to this new technology. Consider that the global self-driving market is supposed to reach $42 billion by 2025, according to Boston Consulting Group. But the tech I’m talking about? Cisco believes it will be a $19 trillion market before 2025. That’s 452 times bigger than self-driving cars! And as huge as that number is, consulting firm Accenture says 87% of consumers don’t even understand what this technology is. What an opportunity that presents! It’s going to be so big that companies like Cisco and Intel are budgeting billions to be a part of it. Even stodgy old General Electric is impressed… it sees an opportunity bigger than the entire economy of China! But again, 87% of consumers don’t yet understand what it is. 7 out of 8 people you see walking down the street have never even heard of it. And we believe that presents a huge opportunity for us individual investors, especially if we get in before the crowd. But that crowd may be just around the corner… I’ve already seen this technology being pitched on ABC’s Shark Tank show, and one of the investors on there went gung-ho for it by making one of the biggest investments in the show’s history. So, the masses will soon be catching on as this tech gets more and more popular. And I suspect when they do, they’ll be focusing on obvious names… like Cisco and Intel… as they look for their share of the pie. But, one renegade investor in Virginia is quietly recommending shares in a few not-so-obvious under-the-radar companies BEFORE this technology really goes mainstream. Think about how many amazing technologies you've watched soar to new heights while you kick yourself thinking, "I knew about that before everyone was talking about it, but I just sat on my hands." Don't let that happen again. This time, it should be your family telling you, "I can't believe you knew about and invested in that technology so early on." Heck, not long ago, I saw it featured on the show Shark Tank. Click here to gain instant access to this video. It’s free to you!

USA TODAY How will the left-leaning tech industry work alongside the business-minded Trump administration ... and specifically, how will future Martian overlord Elon Musk do as a newly minted Trump adviser? Let the rampant speculation begin! Twitter wasn't invited? Dance with who brung you, Donald Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Technology leaders' main expectation from the Trump administration is that the regulators will let businesses run on their own, said Eli Gelman, CEO of Amdocs. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Trump sat down with tech leaders for two hours Wednesday, with Trump mostly heaping praise on the industry and offering assistance from his administration. "This is truly an amazing group of people," Trump said to the Silicon Valley power brokers. "I want to add that I’m here to help you folks do well." The group, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, traded wish lists with the president-elect. On the execs' list: tax reform, reducing regulations, improving education and fighting immigration controls that could impact Silicon Valley's talent pool. On Trump's list: repatriating company profits held overseas, bringing tech manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and finally inventing the Back to the Future hoverboard. One surprising omission from the group was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. One source says Team Trump is still annoyed that Twitter nixed the idea of a #CrookedHillary hashtag emoji during the campaign, but Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the invite list already was fairly large, and "the conference table was only so big." And while tech royalty chatted with Donald, tech workers had their own message for him: We won't help build a Muslim database. "We refuse to build a database of people based on their Constitutionally-protected religious beliefs," read an open letter to Trump signed by 600 employees of tech companies, including those at Google and Twitter. "We refuse to facilitate mass deportations of people the government believes to be undesirable." Trump floated the idea of a Muslim registry during the campaign, but since his election hasn't made a formal request to the tech world. Facebook issued a clarifying statement Wednesday, saying, "No one has asked us to build a Muslim registry, and of course we would not do so." Fed: up Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Here's how the Federal Reserve's decisions affect your monthly bills. Bloomberg As everyone expected (except investors, it seems), the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal funds rate from 0.4% to 0.6% on Wednesday, citing a much-improved unemployment rate (4.6%, down from 10% in 2009) and an improved economy overall. The Fed also predicted three more rate hikes next year. Following the announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 120 points, with most investors hoping that borrowing rates would stay rock-bottom cheap for the foreseeable future. "Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as reflecting the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgement that will continue," Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at a news conference. But won't this rate hike hurt consumers and the economy? Eh, it depends. Higher rates translate to higher borrowing costs for homebuyers, car buyers, entrepreneurs and business owners looking to expand operations. But higher rates also encourage households to put more into savings, and will also discourage housing speculation and high-risk buyers from creating another housing bubble. (Remember back in 2007 when your 6-year-old nephew got a loan to buy a beach house? Fun times.) And oddly enough, it possibly could result in more business and home loans in the short term, because banks will see more of an incentive to take a risk on whatever absurd business plan you've hatched. And in case you're wondering: No, Donald Trump won't get to nominate a replacement for Janet Yellen in January; the Fed is set up to operate more or less independently of presidential administrations. Her four-year term runs through 2018. That doesn't mean Trump isn't already building a short list for her eventual replacement, though. Hey brother @realDonaldTrump give me control of the Fed and we will make the economy great again. Dow at 40k in 4 Years. #Yeswecanseco— Jose Canseco (@JoseCanseco) December 12, 2016 Palace coup sign-up sheet still mostly blank Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A federal judge ruled that two Colorado electors they must follow the state's popular vote and not make their own decision. The two are Democrats hoping to team up with Republicans to stop Donald Trump. (Dec. 13) AP With just four days left, the groups hoping to challenge Trump's election in the Electoral College are still a few dozen votes shy of overturning the election. Sure, there are quite a few people on board who are willing to vote against Trump, but those are the Democrats, and they already weren't going to vote for him. “Electors were given the responsibility by our Founders to vote for whoever will be the best person for the job as President," said Democracy Spring organizer Tania Maduro. "Electoral College, only you can save us.” A coalition of groups plans to protest in every state capital on Monday as electors meet to cast their ballots. A quick recap: Per the Constitution, state electors have the ability to vote for whoever they wish when the Electoral College, instead of who the voters in their state selected. (Per a federal judge, no they don't.) It's going to take a pretty intense effort to convince Republican electors to rewrite our president-electing process on the fly, and time is running out.

In the world! There’s nobody like the people in this room.” He added that if there’s anything his administration can do to help the industry, “we’re going to be there for you.” Tech leaders who attended the 90-minute meeting included Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, Oracle’s Safra Catz, Palantir’s Alex Karp, Intel’s Brian Krzanich, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Cisco’s Chuck Robbins, and IBM’s Ginni Rometty. Perhaps the most notable development to come out of the confab was Trump’s snub of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The billionaire — an incessant tweeter — did not invite Dorsey reportedly because Twitter had turned down the Trump campaign’s efforts to buy an emoji for “#CrookedHillary.” Trump’s transition team told Reuters that Twitter was not invited “because they aren’t big enough.” Trump’s overall upbeat and convivial reception of Silicon Valley’s elite stood in contrast to his previous attacks on tech companies. During the 2016 campaign, he had urged Apple to move its manufacturing to the U.S. and called for a boycott of its products after Apple refused to assist law enforcement unlock an iPhone as part of a terrorism investigation. Trump also labeled Amazon a monopoly that is dodging taxes, and had accused Facebook, Twitter and Google of somehow suppressing negative news about Hillary Clinton. The tech CEO photo-op summit was organized by venture capitalist Peter Thiel, now a Trump adviser, who was the most prominent technology leader to back the candidate. Others joining the summit included VP-elect Mike Pence; Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, his children Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump; chief of staff Reince Priebus; and senior adviser Steve Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News. According to Trump’s transition team, topics at the meeting included how to create more jobs for American workers; eliminating barriers preventing American companies from doing business in other countries; America’s competitive trade dynamic and market access with China; and repatriation of American profits “kept overseas by prohibitive tax rates.” The summit also covered protection of intellectual-property rights, improving the U.S.’s data security, and the need for greater vocational education opportunities. According to Trump’s transition team, the president-elect suggested reconvening the tech leaders again in the future, perhaps as frequently as every quarter.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | December 15, 2016 -- 13:23 GMT (05:23 PST) | Topic: Innovation More than 51 percent of users in Asia-Pacific express willingness to buy or use a driverless vehicle when available, but the possibility of being hacked is among key safety concerns. More than 60 percent wanted driverless cars with the intelligence to avoid traffic congestions and able to self-charge using solar energy, according to a Intel-commissioned study. Conducted by Intuit Research, the online survey polled 1,250 respondents across five Asia-Pacific markets: Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.

This meant they would allow the system to handle all aspects of driving, even if a human driver did not respond to a request to intervene and under all road and environmental conditions, with no involvement from the human driver. Respondents cited a range of benefits in using such vehicles, including environment-friendly, less stressful commuting experience, ease of parking, and predictable commute time. The ability to summon a car placed as a highly desired benefit, revealed the study, which also found higher interest among non-drivers in using driverless cars compared to drivers. Various aspects of safety, however, remained key concerns for respondents who pointed to the lack of safety standards and possibility of being hacked. They also expressed worry that the vehicles might not be able to identify and operate properly in new situations. "Driverless cars is one of the most interesting manifestations of technology that we will see in the next three to five years as it will positively impact so many segments of the society," said Jerry Tsao, Intel's Asia-Pacific and Japan vice president of sales and marketing group and managing director. He added that the chipmaker was collaborating with several car manufacturers on such initiatives. According to the survey findings, respondents across the region on average expected driverless vehicles to be commonly available in six years. Those in Singapore projected this would happen the soonest, with 30 percent expecting such vehicles to be commonly available within three years. Taiwanese respondents, at 83 percent, indicated a high interest in buying driverless cars, compared to just 24 percent in Australia. Across the region, 47 percent were willing to pay a premium of more than 20 percent for the vehicles, with Korean respondents most wiling to do so at 62 percent. Only 37 percent of their counterparts in Singapore expressed a similar desire.

Ltd, which provides data centre and cloud services, said on Thursday it has raised Rs 154 crore ($23 million) from Epsilon Venture Partners and an Australian private equity group in a Series A round of funding. The funds raised will help the company roll out its first few data centres across India, Pi founder and CEO Kalyan Muppaneni said in a statement. The name of the Australian PE group wasn’t disclosed. “As more users go digital in India, lower latency is paramount for better user experience, which is possible only if the digital infrastructure is located within the country,” he said. Muppaneni also said that India is poised for an explosion in digital data and that data centres are the key building blocks for a nation’s infrastructure. Muppaneni founded Pi in 2014. Before starting Pi, he worked for Intel Corporation for almost 15 years. Pi is based at Amaravati, the new capital of Andhra Pradesh, where it has a data centre spread across 10 acres. As part of the investment, Epsilon general partner Mahesh Vaidya will join Pi’s board. The technology-focused fund manager has introduced Pi to local blue-chip prospective clients and will be actively involved in its growth, Pi said. “We believe India will double its Internet user base in the next three to five years and this should position Pi very well to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity,” said Vaidya. Epsilon was founded by Sudheer Kuppam, who is managing partner. Kuppam was earlier India and Asia Pacific managing director at Intel’s corporate venture capital arm, Intel Capital. He quit Intel Capital in August 2015 to start Epsilon. Epsilon’s other portfolio firms are business-to-business farm products e-tailer GS Farm Taaza Produce Pvt Ltd, Japanese healthcare startup Pentas and Silicon Valley-based cloud object storage company Cloudian, according to its website. At the time of inception of Epsilon, Kuppam had told VCCircle that the firm would invest in product innovation firms in North Asia and Southeast Asia and services innovation firms in South Asia. He had also said the firm would not focus on early-stage ventures but had not ruled out a few deals involving young startups. Like this report?

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Yahoo’s big 1 billion hacking raises new questions on data security Yahoo’s big 1 billion hacking raises new questions on data security Yahoo revealed a massive breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, it happened in 2013 which it discovered recently By: AP | San Francisco | Updated: December 15, 2016 7:21 pm Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts on Wednesday (Image Source: Reuters) Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organisations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows US intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government Attackers Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. Also Read: Yahoo confirms one billion accounts hacked: Here’s what happened “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two hacks, more than a billion accounts Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. Also Read: Yahoo suffers world’s biggest hack affecting 1 billion users But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice — once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. Read More: Yahoo data hack contains data of US government, military employees: Report After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo’s shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.

At the summit, Trump appointed Uber's CEO, Travis Kalanick and Tesla's Elon Musk as his strategic advisors. These two will now meet the president frequently to offer their advice and expertise. Travis couldn't attend the meeting at the Trump Tower due to travel. However, the President-elect was joined by Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, CEOs of Google's parent company Alphabet, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, and Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, as well as Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber. Trump told the top people of these companies that, "There’s nobody like you in the world, in the world, there’s nobody like anyone in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, and we’re going to be there for you." Things would have been quite awkward for a few people, as nearly 150 influential people from Silicon Valley had published an open letter back in July, stating that “Trump would be a disaster for innovation". It was signed by founders and top executives from companies such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Qualcomm, Samsung, Tinder, Snapchat, Yelp, and Slack. In fact, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk had criticised Trump by saying that, "I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy". Kalanick too had jested Trump before the elections: "Oh my god, Donald Trump’s gonna win. I’m going to move to China if Donald Trump wins." Defying all the political experts, Trump is set to become the 45th President of the United States. Despite most of the mainstream media rooting against him, he still managed to clinch the election. Let's hope that instead of cribbing about his election, the Silicon Valley brokers peace with him and move forward. Source: Washingtonpost | Images: Sean Spice (Twitter), Boing Boing.

By VictorReklaitis Markets writer The tech powwow at Trump Tower is still making waves, while the Dow struggles to top 20,000 after the Fed’s move. Here’s an idea: Gather execs from the 30 Dow companies for a similar pep talk from the president-elect. That ought to get us over that hump and soothe disappointed traders. “One thing which is causing dissatisfaction among traders is that perhaps now we may not see that 20K level,” says Naeem Aslam of ThinkMarkets, reflecting on the stock slide after the Fed pointed to three rate hikes next year. But he argues the recent rally will resume, for the simple reason that Yellen & Co. are hiking because the U.S. economy is strengthening. The view that the “risk-on” party is still on after the Fed’s move serves as our call of the day. Aslam from ThinkMarkets, the Blonde Money blog’s Helen S. Thomas and Slope of Hope’s Tim Knight are all singing that song. “You just got the green light for higher yields — but also, with the final event risk of 2016 out of the way, the green light to keep on buying that equity market dip. Fill yer boots,” writes Thomas, deploying a saying that means “go for it.” Gold GCG7, +0.55%  is looking about as ugly as you’d expect after a hike, and Knight argues it will get worse for that safety play. “It’s going to be a miserable 2017 for the yellow metal (and even worse for miners),” writes the Slope of Hope blogger, who says he has no regrets about dumping almost all of his personal bullion GLD, -0.62%  when it was above $1,300 an ounce. “Gold sucks. It’s just about the only asset that’s reliably down every day,” he says. Just to make it clear where he thinks the “ultimate haven” is headed, Knight offers the graphic below. Slope of Hope Key market gauges Futures for the Dow YMH7, +0.37%  , S&P 500 ESH7, +0.32%  and Nasdaq-100 NQH7, +0.51%  are little changed, after the Dow DJIA, -0.29%  , S&P SPX, -0.46% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.90%  all retreated from records yesterday. The dollar index DXY, +0.06% is jumping after the Fed’s big event. Keep an eye on bonds today after the two-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00% hit its highest level since 2009. See the Market Snapshot column for the latest action. The chart WSJ This is probably the first time that our chart of the day is a seating chart. Is it time to short Intel INTC, -1.06%  , Microsoft MSFT, -1.21%  and IBM IBM, -0.37%  , given that their CEOs sat furthest away from President-elect Trump at yesterday’s meeting? Traders certainly have been thinking along those lines lately, after Boeing BA, -0.01% and Lockheed’s LMT, -0.26%  recent moves on Trump’s comments. You could argue for buying Apple AAPL, -0.78%  , Facebook FB, -1.12% and Alphabet GOOG, -1.40% GOOGL, -1.30%  based on their prime positions in the seating chart, if you’re not spooked by Tim Cook’s glum look during the confab. Some are even bullish on Twitter TWTR, -0.55%  , though there reportedly wasn’t room at the table for the company, perhaps due to emoji-gate. Maybe it’s all ridiculous. Check out: Why the Trump–Silicon Valley chasm is too wide to bridge The economy A deluge of economic data arrived before the open. An inflation gauge rose as expected, while jobless claims fell roughly as anticipated. Two readings on manufacturing — the Empire State index and the Philly Fed’s gauge — both showed jumps for December. Readings on manufacturing and the housing market are slated to arrive after the opening bell. And get ready for more divining of the Fed’s signals. Janet Yellen stressed yesterday that she is not always dovish, and she floated the idea of staying on at the Fed after her term as its chief ends. While the central bank pointed to three rate hikes in 2017, remember that a year ago, it was signaling four in 2016, notes Marc Chandler at his Marc to Market blog. There ended up being just one. Check out: MarketWatch’s Economic Calendar The buzz Boob-tube news: Facebook FB, -1.12% is reportedly in talks to buy its own video shows, while Comcast-owned CMCSA, -1.10%  NBC is betting viewers will watch Olympics year-round. From the deals-and-spinoffs front: Kraft Heinz KHC, -0.69%  is not in talks with Mondelez MDLZ, -1.14%  , according to a Bloomberg report, while GE GE, -0.35%  plans to raise $4 billion by selling off two of its small industrial units. Nintendo 7974, +0.55% NTDOY, +0.04%  gets mobile: Super Mario Run’s global launch on iPhones and iPads is today. It’s free to download, but you have to fork over $10 to unlock the full game. “In and of itself, Dow 20K is not significant” — that is one of the takes on the milestone. A U.S. citizen living in Moscow has surrendered to face charges in the 2014 cyberattack on J.P. Morgan JPM, +0.47%  . The quote European Pressphoto Agency Putin spreading the Russian love in Japan. A former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, sounds like he’s buying an NBC News report that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in efforts to hack the U.S. presidential election. “It is most certainly consistent with the Putin that I have watched and used to work with when I was an ambassador and in the government. He has had a vendetta against Hillary Clinton, that has been known for a long time. ... And most certainly he likes President-elect Trump’s views on Russia.” Read more: Corker’s Senate committee will ‘find out’ about Kremlin role in election hacking The stat More than 1 billion — That’s the number of accounts thought to have been hit in the newly discovered breach at Yahoo YHOO, +0.08%  .

Photos from the event showed many of the attendees from the tech industry grimacing or looking downright despairing while Trump, at the centre of the table, led the meeting. The attendees had a combined wealth of some $143.5bn (£115bn), according to various estimates of the individuals, making it one of the most valuable meetings in history. Trump with tech investor Peter Thiel and Apple chief executive Tim Cook Credit: Getty Amazon boss Jeff Bezos Credit: Rex Features Tesla's Elon Musk Credit: AP Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg Credit: Bloomberg Trump, with a net worth estimated at $3.7bn, was only the fifth richest person in the room, with Amazon's Jeff Bezos ($66.4bn), Alphabet's (Google's parent company) Larry Page ($39.5bn), Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk ($11.5bn), and Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt ($11.5bn) in attendance. Trumps tech tableplan The bosses of Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Cisco, Intel and Palantir were also present, as well as Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. Twitter was reportedly not invited to the event, despite Donald Trump's love of the service, because it had refused to create an anti-Hillary Clinton emoji.

The group reportedly talked about education, immigration and trade. In his opening remarks Trump said: "I'm here to help you folks do well. And you're doing very well right now and I'm honoured by the [stock market] bounce. "We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There's nobody like you in the world. In the world." The meeting had been brokered by Peter Thiel, a billionaire tech investor who co-founded PayPal and who supported Trump. The two had a somewhat awkward handshake during Trump's opening remarks, however. Trump and Peter Thiel Credit: Rex Some of Trump's most vocal criticisms during the election were of Apple, saying that: "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," and of Bezos, who owns the Washington Post as well as running Amazon. He said that Amazon will "have such problems" in February. The meeting on Wednesday was somewhat more congenial, with Bezos saying he was "super excited about the possibilities this could be the innovation administration".

Rick Perry is about to lead a critical agency that he once planned to abolish — if only he had remembered the department's name. But it's not so much his gaffe proposing the imminent demise of the Department of Energy that has scientists and policy experts worried. Instead it's what Perry, a vocal climate change skeptic, plans to do once he takes over. Perry staunchly rejects action to reduce carbon emissions. As recently as 2011 he said publicly that the "science is not settled" on whether man-made global warming is even real, claiming that a "substantial number" of scientists manipulated their data in a scheme to boost their funding. Play Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed When Perry wanted to abolish the Energy Dept. 3:49 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/832426051560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> He is now set to join an administration flush with fellow cabinet picks who are openly hostile toward the concept of climate change, all with President-elect Donald Trump at the helm, who has called climate change a hoax orchestrated by the Chinese. Perry's appointment means the heads of the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department are all cozy with the oil and gas industry, a dynamic that will likely slant future energy policy toward that direction, said Kim Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "It could mean a significant weakening of the climate change regulations and initiatives during the Obama administration that have started us on the path toward lowering our carbon emissions," Kimmell added. "I'm not confident that Rick Perry is fully cognizant of the role that DOE plays in keeping our nuclear deterrent safe, secure and reliable" Still, Perry has a mixed record that includes promoting clean energy options during his tenure as Texas governor — particularly when renewable energy was good for business. And he is credited for helping turn Texas into the largest wind producer in the country. This leaves some experts optimistic that those investments will continue to be a win-win for the economy as well as the environment. Related: Trump Announces Rick Perry as Pick for Energy Secretary "Irrespective of whether Perry believes in the science of climate change, what he is going to find is that the science of economics will drive a lot of these energy investment decisions," said Alex Perera, global director of the World Resources Institute's Electricity Initiative. Perry also faces scrutiny for potential business conflicts. According to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission report, Perry pulled in $236,820 for his spot on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. It's not likely that Perry will take over the Department of Energy only to burn it to the ground. For one, a critical role of the department is to manage and maintain the U.S. nuclear stockpile. But therein lies Perry's biggest weakness, according to critics who are skeptical that he appreciates the full scope of his new role. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks during a news conference in Austin, Texas, on Feb. 24, 2016. Eric Gay / AP file Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, issued a statement that slammed Perry for being "utterly unqualified" for the job. "I'm not confident that Rick Perry is fully cognizant of the role that DOE plays in keeping our nuclear deterrent safe, secure and reliable," Heinrich said. Perry has big shoes to fill in stacking up to the qualifications of his predecessor and overcoming his infamous "oops" moment from the 2011 debate where he forgot which federal agency he hoped to abolish. Outgoing Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz is a renowned nuclear physicist. By contrast, aside from the former Texas governor's two failed presidential runs, Perry's last gig was a stint on the reality competition show "Dancing with the Stars."

Credit: Alexandru Voica/Imagination Technologies More like this Imagination plans new MIPS CPU, PowerVR GPU as it looks to bounce back The mysteries of the GPU in Apple's iPhone 7 are unlocked New ARM GPU could bring VR to low-cost smartphones by 2018 Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Apple's powerful iPhone 7 GPU is based on Imagination Technologies' PowerVR GT7600 architecture, and a possible successor could come next year. Imagination will release the Series8XT family of GPUs, which could provide the underlying technology for graphics in the iPhone 8. It will succeed the Series7XT family of GPUs, which is the base architecture for the PowerVR GT7600 in the iPhone 7. Analyst firm Linley Group said the iPhone 7 GPU is the fastest among all mobile processors when operating at peak speed. The Series8XT will be even faster, and perhaps more power efficient. The iPhone 7 GPU can overheat quickly if it runs at peak speed for a long time. Imagination didn't provide further details on the 8XT or a specific release date, and did not say if the GPU would be in the iPhone 8. But Apple has used PowerVR in every iPhone to date, and recently started tuning the architecture to work better with its mobile devices. Imagination designs GPUs and licenses it to companies like Apple and Intel. Apple is also a minority shareholder in Imagination. Apple has been notoriously quiet about the underlying technology in its A-series chips. Linley Group only recently unveiled that the iPhone 7 GPU was based on PowerVR GT7600 architecture. The 8XT could be introduced in late February at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Imagination is showing off its PowerVR GPU. The company has used GDC to launch new GPU architectures in the past. The high-end 8XT architecture is a "technology generator" and will host many new GPU features developed by Imagination, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR at Imagination. Imagination will focus on putting more performance in 8XT, Deacon said. Beyond smartphones, the company's GPUs also are used in set-top boxes, TVs and other devices requiring graphics power or focusing on visual computing. Imagination this year released the 8XE GPU, which was focused on the fast-growing low-end and mid-range phones market. The Series8XT will offer more performance. Imagination's PowerVR was once competitive in smartphones, but has lost share as competition grows. ARM's Mali GPUs based on the Bitfrost architecture are catching on strong, and Qualcomm, which is the mobile chip leader, has its own Adreno GPU.  Nvidia has the best mobile GPU, but it is being targeted at automotive and machine learning applications. There are other areas of growth for Imagination GPUs outside of smartphones, especially in automotive and set-top boxes, Deacon said. Imagination is developing many more technologies to boost graphics, and supporting vectors like image analysis add value to PowerVR GPUs. There are also opportunities in machine learning, and PowerVR could play a big role in enabling self-driving cars. Imagination is developing algorithms, and has been demonstrating neural networks running on GPU computing. Imagination is also mixing up its MIPS CPU architecture with PowerVR for drones and robots, which heavily rely on visual computing and image analysis.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government attackers Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two hacks, more than a billion accounts Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice — once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo’s shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.

The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 specs have leaked through promotional material and has spilled the beans on everything if legit. If you are in the market for a solid Windows tablet, your choices are just as thin as they are with handsets. There aren’t many good options outside the Surface, but the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 looks to fit the bill as it will run Windows 10 out of the box. According to today’s leak, the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 specs will also impress as you’ll get plenty of everything in a razor thin 6.08mm metal shell. Xiaomi is going all out with the Mi Pad 3 and it will be large with a 9.7-inch panel. Not just any panel mind you, but one with a resolution of 2,048 x 1,536. Beneath that glass, you’ll find the m3-7Y30 Intel 7th Gen Core M processor along with a whopping 8GB of RAM. That is not a typo, you will have plenty of horses under the hood. The storage capacity is quite nice as well at 128GB or 256GB depending on how you roll. The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 may be a slate, but it has a few phone features. One would be the camera combos as this baby has a 16MP rear camera with an LED flash and an 8MP front-facing snapper. It also has a fingerprint scanner, something you don’t see on too many slates. Other Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 specs to note include a USB Type-C port, Dual Speakers, and a large 8,920mAh battery. As nutty as those specs seem, it will apparently be affordable if the rumor mill is right. The promotion material shows the Mi Pad 3 price to be the equivalent of $289 for the 128GB model or $332 for the larger 256GB version. There will be a keyboard dock as well and we wouldn’t be surprised to see a few more accessories appear. The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 release date is rumored to arrive on December 30th, we will keep you in the loop on any news of an international release. via – GSMarena      source: Gizmochina Tags TabletsWindows 10XiaomiXiaomi Mi Pad 3 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Super Mario Run iPhone release date arrives tonight for some Next article Next post: Swipe Elite Max launched with 4GB of RAM for Rs. 10,999 Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

Acer updated its family of TravelMate P4 commercial notebooks in the United States, offering a great balance of security and productivity for businesses. Now offered in 14-inch and 15.6-inch designs, the new models are based on Windows 10 Pro and include integrated hardware security solutions like smartcard readers and touch fingerprint scanners. Acer’s announcement on Wednesday specifically stated the TravelMate P449 14-inch model and the TravelMate P459 15.6-inch model, which at the time of this article were not listed on Acer’s website in the U.S. However, these two laptops are available overseas in several different configurations meeting the budgets of every business. The local Acer website currently only lists three configurations of the TravelMate P446. More: Acer’s ultra-thin and ultra-portable Spin 7 and Spin 5 hit store shelves That said, we only have Acer’s press release to determine what the units will offer once they go live in the next day or so. Here is a general list of features scattered throughout the announcement: Operating system: Windows 10 Pro Screen sizes: 14 and 15.6 inches Panel types: Up to an IPS display with touch support, LED backlit Resolutions: 1,366 x 768 or 1,920 x 1,080 Processor: Up to Intel’s sixth-generation Core i7 with vPro Memory: Up to 8GB of DDR4 Storage Type: SSD Storage amount: Up to 256GB Webcam: 720p HDR Battery: Up to eight hours on a single charge Keyboard: LED backlit, Chiclet-style with tactile feedback Connectivity: Dual-band 2×2 MIMO Wireless AC Sound: “Fine-tuned” speakers and microphones Known ports: 1x HDMI 1x VGA 1x SD card reader 1x USB Type-C (charges, compatible with Acer’s USB Type-C dock) 3x USB 2.0 ports 1x USB 3.0 1x Ethernet 1x Headphone jack Security: 1x Smartcard reader 1x Fingerprint scanner 1x Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip Size: Up to 0.8 inches thin According to Acer, both models can recline up to 180 degrees flat for scenarios like presenting information to clients. They also feature wide touchpads, and pre-loaded corporate-level manageability and security tools in the Acer ProShield suite. Acer even provides its Acer Office Manager software so that IT professionals can monitor computer assets, schedule maintenance tasks, unleash security policies, and more. “Our newest TravelMate series will suit business travelers and those wanting a practical portable computer for use at the office, home and on the go,” Acer’s America business manager of mobility Steve Su said in a statement. “They’re powerful, secure and user-friendly with the ability to recline flat, while a backlit keyboard enables professionals to work in low-light environments.” Finally, Acer said that the two new TravelMate P4 laptops feature the same aesthetics that made its TravelMate P6 series an award-winning family of laptops. They are built to “withstand the demands of frequent travel,” indicating the notebooks are perfect for out-of-office meetings, business trips, and so on. They even support Windows Hello so users aren’t required to enter passwords out in public, on a plane, or in a client’s office. The starting price for the new TravelMate P4 commercial laptops is $649. Check back with Acer over the next several days to see all the configurations the company will offer for the new P449 and P459 models. Also watch: Share

The collaboration itself will focus on combining Google’s Android operating system with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, which if successful, could give the internet giant a much more significant role in the burgeoning IoT arena. Google has been relatively quiet in the IoT space to-date, though linking the OS’ market penetration with its public cloud business unit could create a powerful player in the segment. The tie-up also gives Google impressive scale following Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP in October. The $47 billion purchase broadened Qualcomm’s capabilities bringing in expertise in the automotive, smart home, smart city and NFC segments. Bringing together the world’s most common OS and the largest mobile processor vendor, has the potential to replicate the Wintel (Windows/Intel) relationship that dominated the PC era. “Since the launch of the first Android phone, Qualcomm Technologies and Google have closely collaborated to create exciting new opportunities for developers in mobile, wearables and the IoT,” said Jeffery Torrance, VP of Business Development at Qualcomm Technologies. “We are pleased to announce our intent to work with Google on this new initiative to expand the Android ecosystem. We anticipate many new and exciting IoT products will result as developers are able to bring the power of the Snapdragon processor together with Android Things.” The key here to market domination will be the role of the Google Cloud Platform, as while creating a strong position from an Android-IoT perspective would be a useful addition; it’s not really more that the link between real-life and intelligence. Alphabet has been heavily investing in the world of artificial intelligence, data analytics and real-time engagement, leaving Google in a strong position in the insight game, but the link between the point-of-collection and the intelligence suite has to be there first and foremost. An IoT device is only as good as its link with the intelligent cloud and the back-end insight services; this is where the major win for Google will be. AWS and IBM Bluemix have both already made strong moves in the IoT cloud platform space, as has Microsoft with the Azure IoT suite, but with the Android Things operating on the front-end, there is potential for Google cloud to muscle its way up from the pack of the pack. As in the initial public cloud race, Google will be playing catch-up with some of the early birds, though the Qualgle/Goocomm partnership opens the door a crack.

It's new and it's bad: Yahoo discloses 1B account breach USA TODAY 15/12/2016 Elizabeth Weise Replay Video Latest Sky Sports News headlines All the latest from Sky Sports News HQ.

Sky News Play Pause Seek i Volume Volume Volume Mute Unmute CC SETTINGS OFF HQ HD HQ SD LO Full Screen Exit Full Screen Play Pause Volume Volume SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo late Wednesday disclosed a breach that took place in August 2013 that may have resulted in the theft of data associated with more than one billion user accounts. This new, 1-billion-account breach is separate from a 500-million-account breach the company disclosed in September. At the time, the 500-million-account breach was believed to be the largest on record. Yahoo shares fell 2.5% after hours. The new revelation comes at a time when cybercrime issues loom large as never before. The CIA has accused Russia of specifically attempting to tamper with the U.S. election via hacked emails, ransomware hit the nation's seventh largest transit system, in San Francisco and a monster botnet of hijacked devices took down much of the East Coast's Internet traffic for a day in October.  “We truly are under major siege and we’re unprepared for it. It really is a national emergency,” said Avivah Litan vice president at Gartner Research. “We need a national response plan for this.” Whether the attacker in this instance was state-sponsored or merely economically motivated, the danger is very real, said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. © AP Photo FILE - This July 19, 2016 photo shows a Yahoo sign at the company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. On Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016, Yahoo said it believes hackers stole data from more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) “We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments,” he said. “As is the case in any cyber-attack, the incentive is there, the reputation threat is real, and intelligence services have 1 billion reasons to try.” Yahoo said in September that it had evidence linking the 500-million-account breach to a state-sponsored actor. It does not know who is behind the 1-billion-account breach announced Wednesday and it does not appear the two are linked. In a statement on its website, the company said, "We believe that the August 2013 incident is likely distinct from the incident we disclosed on September 22, 2016." There is some overlap between the affected accounts, but Yahoo is not disclosing how much.  Ongoing acquisition Verizon announced a deal to acquire Yahoo on July 25 and work on the takeover has been ongoing since then.   "As we’ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions,” it said in a statement to USA TODAY. The new revelation "provides yet another example of why monitoring the cybersecurity posture of a merger/acquisition target is such a critical element throughout the diligence process,” said Jacob Olcott, a former legal advisor to the Senate Commerce Committee and current vice president at security firm BitSight. November disclosure Yahoo disclosed in November that a law enforcement officials had given it data files showing what appeared to be evidence that an unknown third party had access to Yahoo user data. Yahoo brought in outside forensic experts and confirmed that the data was in fact from Yahoo users. As part of that analysis, Yahoo now says it believes the attacker “stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts,” the company said in a release. Yahoo does not know who was behind the theft.  The company has pinpointed the date when the attackers were able to remove user information from the system as  August 2013, but it does not know when they gained entry to its network or how long they were there. The fact that the breach went unnoticed for so long isn’t surprising, said Arun Vishwanath, a security expert at the University at Buffalo.  “The sobering facts are that almost all such hacks are only accidentally discovered and that hackers usually stay in the system undetected for at least a year if not more.  Yahoo's case is not so unique. Only its scale is troubling,” he said. The stolen account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, the company said. The stolen information did not include payment card data, or bank account information, Yahoo said. Yahoo is working to notify affected users, and is working closely with law enforcement to investigate the breach. Some in the security community said Yahoo had not been as concerned with security as it might have been. “In our interactions with Yahoo over the years, there has been a consistent lack of interest in security as well as a palpable arrogance in their ability to manage their security without any help from the outside.  As we said in our last interaction, ‘thank you for the meeting and the best of luck doing everything yourself,’” said Philip Lieberman, president of Los Angeles-based Lieberman Software.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts.

But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. StoryYahoo: Data from more than 1 billion accounts stolen "The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. GOVERNMENT ATTACKERS Of course, it's not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. advertisement | advertise on newsday In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments." Yahoo's security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice — once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts.

If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off.

"We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon," the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal.

The only saving grace is that the attackers apparently did not exploit the information for fraud. But their true motives remain a mystery. While there are a number of straightforward measures all users should take to protect themselves, relatively few people actually do. And in this case, doing so wouldn't really have mattered. Even the most scrupulous individual countermeasures could only limit the damage. FILE - This Tuesday, July 19, 2016 photo shows a Yahoo sign at the company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. On Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016, Yahoo said it believes hackers stole data from more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) "Yahoo users could have had immaculate computer security and still been the victim here," said Will Ackerly, chief technology officer at Virtru, a computer security firm he co-founded after working for eight years at the National Security Agency. "Short of using encryption, there's no way to keep your email from being compromised in this kind of hack." The mega breach disclosed Wednesday exposed more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said the attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement in September about a 2014 hack that Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government. That breach affected 500 million accounts. Some experts believe the record-breaking amount of data stolen in the breach announced Wednesday also points to state-sponsored hackers in search of a specific target, which could be why three years later the data still hasn't been spotted for sale on the web. And neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. "The lesson is clear: No organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that means no one is safe. The hacks represent yet another stumble for the struggling Sunnyvale, California, company as it tries to reinvent itself. The breaches occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who has been unable to turn around the company in the four years since she arrived. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be jeopardized by the hacking revelations. Meanwhile, it's clear that Yahoo didn't do enough to protect its users. For example, the company acknowledges using MD5, a password-storage method considered by many experts to be inadequate and inferior to others available at the time of the hack. One of Yahoo's priorities will now need to be keeping its users updated as its investigation progresses, said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy for SentinelOne. "I think that would go a long way to assuring users and everybody that they're doing the right things," said Grossman, who worked in security at Yahoo from 1999 to 2001. "The best peace of mind in cybersecurity is transparency." There's only so much a company like Yahoo can do to protect its users without damaging its business model, which involves selling advertising based on data gleaned from its users, Grossman noted. As a result, it can't do things like encrypt user data, which would make the information useless to hackers. Other companies that don't sell advertising, such as Apple, are able to encrypt. And some, such as Google, do so too but not in a way that would have protected against this type of hack. They also hold the keys to that encryption, giving them the access they need for advertising sales. "If you take a step back, the 1 billion people aren't Yahoo's customers, they're its product," Grossman said. For Yahoo users, experts say, there's little to do except for changing their passwords if they haven't done so in the past three years. And it's tough to protect against future hacks at Yahoo or other companies that hold personal information. Changing email providers is, at the very least, a pain for most people. Experts say picking a tough password is a must , though they are divided on exactly how important it is to change it frequently. The same password should not be used for multiple sites, and the questions and answers needed to reset it should be unique as well. While perfect security doesn't exist, no one wants to be an easy target either. Cybersecurity experts like to compare the hacker threat to running from a bear: You don't have to be the fastest runner — just not the slowest. The Yahoo breach should serve as a lesson to users that they can't assume that companies, even large multi-national tech companies, are doing security right, said John Shier, senior security adviser at Sophos. "Hopefully this is the one that wakes everybody up, although I doubt it will be," Shier said. "It's frustrating to see this happen over and over again when for many years we've known how to better protect systems." ___ AP technology writers Michael Liedtke in San Francisco and Mae Anderson in Atlanta contributed to this report. ___ Follow Bree Fowler at http://twitter.com/APBreeFowler .

The Biggest Names In Tech Just Made Nice With Trump NDTV 15-12-2016 NEW YORK: A dozen or so technology executives filed into a conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower Wednesday wearing suits not usually seen in Silicon Valley. Their combined net worth - at least $136 billion - was gilded even for the likes of Trump Tower. After months of acrimony that at times felt personal, they had come to make nice with the president-elect. And make nice they did. As they went around the room introducing themselves one-by-one, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, once the target of President-elect Donald Trump's attacks, said he was "super-excited to talk about innovation in this administration." (Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post). Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was also "excited to talk about jobs." Donald Trump also was on his best behavior during the roughly two-hour meeting. "This is a truly amazing group of people," he said. "There's nobody like you in the world. In the world. There's nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you." But behind the cordiality was a sense of trepidation. Trump, both as candidate and president-elect, has used his perch to shame companies, and the consequences haven't been trivial. When Trump tweeted earlier this month that he wanted to cancel Boeing's $4 billion contract to build Air Force One, Boeing's stock price took a hit. Trump has targeted Apple and other companies for manufacturing their products in China, and has called to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, a crucial issue for Silicon Valley companies that import widgets and other hardware components from China. At the meeting, which included the leaders of Google, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, IBM, Cisco, and Tesla, Trump seemed willing to back down from a signature campaign promise to end free trade deals. "We're going to make fair trade deals," he told the executives. "We're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders." Last month, Trump negotiated with equipment maker Carrier, a division of United Technologies, to avoid losing 800 jobs to Mexico in exchange for $7 million in government subsidies. In the days leading up to the meeting, staff for the companies tried to parse whether the image-conscious Trump would try to use his leverage with them to do something similar. After the CEO roundtable, Trump met privately with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Tesla manufactures its vehicles in California but purchases components from China. Apple hardware largely comes from China. Attendees had a wide-ranging and generally positive conversation, discussing issues from visas for high-skilled immigrants to trade issues to the cloud, according to people familiar with the discussion. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a central campaign promise, and called for an end to the high-skilled visa program during a presidential debate, though he later backtracked. Technology companies are some of the heaviest users of such visas. At the meeting, Trump seemed open to keeping the high-skilled visa program, a person familiar with the discussion said. The president-elect also heaped praise on Facebook board and transition team member Peter Thiel, shaking his hand and calling him a "special guy." Trump made a point of saying that Thiel, who convened the meeting, nixed companies that were too small from attending. But one relatively small company with ties to Thiel made the cut: Palantir. Unlike the other companies in attendance, the data-mining start-up, which Thiel founded in 2004, is private and had revenue last year of less than $300 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. A large portion of Palantir's business involves contracts with federal agencies, and the company is currently engaged in a lawsuit with the Department of Defense over the right to compete for more contracts. The executives left as they arrived - wordlessly and quickly, striding through the lobby and ignoring press questions. Some smiled; Oracle's Catz flashed a brief thumbs-up when asked how the meeting went. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Image: Joseph Stohm/Shutterstock US president-elect Donald Trump summoned Silicon Valley’s elite for a show of force. Was it really about innovation and job creation or will decency and diversity pay a price? US president-elect Donald Trump likes to put on a show. But did he really succeed in trying to show the so-called giants of Silicon Valley who is boss, and will the tech elite simply stand for it? At the table yesterday (14 December 2016) sat the most powerful figures of Silicon Valley, and like supplicants to a ruler, they meekly introduced themselves by name, title and company to Donald Trump. They included Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Oracle CEO Safra Catz, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, Google chair Eric Schmidt, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Alphabet CEO Larry Page. Also at the table sat Trump’s children Eric, Donald J Trump Jr and Ivanka, as well as vice-president elect Mike Pence. It’s hard to know whether it was just a show of force by the new president-elect to make clear who is in charge, or a genuine realisation that tech is one of the key bastions of the US economy, and must be taken seriously. Honored to have sat in on this meeting. The most impressive group of minds I've seen assembled all looking to fight for America and US jobs. https://t.co/e2si8Kb9Au — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) December 14, 2016 It is equally hard to fathom the thoughts of the shrewd, intelligent and capable leaders of companies like Apple, Facebook and Microsoft who got where they are in life on grit and talent, and why they even answered Trump’s call. Noticeably absent from the meeting was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The previous evening, Dorsey hosted a live video call between Twitter’s HQ in San Francisco and surveillance whistle-blower Edward Snowden somewhere in Russia. This is the real backstory: Twitter was not invited because out of all of the tech companies, it has stood up to Trump’s insiders on a number of fronts. According to Politico, it refused to allow an emoji version of the hashtag #CrookedHillary during the presidential election campaign. More critically, Twitter has said on the record that if asked, it would refuse to help the Trump administration to create a national Muslim registry. According to The Intercept, Facebook and Twitter are so far the only two out of eight tech firms that have said they would refuse to contribute to such a registry. In the throne room of a new king Like vassals to their new baron, the elite of Silicon Valley – who at any other time would rarely be in the same room – trooped meekly into a conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. “This is a truly amazing group of people,” Trump said to flatter the assembled tech leaders. Echoing the shtick he employed in his election campaign, he intoned: “There’s nobody like you in the world. In the world! There’s nobody like the people in this room.” Trump said that anything that the government “can do to help this go along, we’re going to be there for you”. The meeting was organised by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and it also included Trump supporter Peter Thiel, another of Silicon Valley’s elite; billionaire Wilbur Ross, Trump’s new commerce secretary appointee; and Goldman Sachs’s Gary Cohn, Trump’s incoming director of the National Economic Council. “They’re going to do fair trade deals,” Trump said.“They’re going to make it easier for you to trade across borders, because there are a lot of restrictions, a lot of problems. If you have any ideas on that, that would be great.” Boosting Thiel’s stature at the meeting, Trump continued: “I won’t tell you the hundreds of calls we’ve had asking to come here to this meeting,” Trump said. “And I will say Peter [Thiel] was saying, ‘No, that company’s too small’, and these are monster companies. But I want to start by thanking Peter, because he saw something very early, maybe before we saw it. And of course, he’s known for that … he’s ahead of the curve.” Trump also alluded to the rallying of stocks since his election. “I’m very honoured by the bounce, everybody’s talking about the bounce, so everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit,” Trump said. “We’re going to try to have that bounce continue.” At the meeting, issues from jobs to innovation and national security were discussed. But it is questionable how much common ground Trump has with the tech industry. Real points of contention will be diversity, surveillance, encryption and immigration, which were not discussed. Another question is how realistic does Trump consider the tech sector’s ability to help him deliver on his election promises to boost blue-collar America and restore its industrial fortunes? Cook famously brushed with outgoing US president Barack Obama when it was suggested that Apple bring back jobs from China and elsewhere to the States. “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” Cook replied tartly. The curious thing is that Trump appeals to the profiteering mindset that allowed jobs to seep away from Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan in the 1980s to other countries in the first place, while at the same time, he tries to appease the ordinary US citizen who just wants the dignity of a job. It will be a tough balancing act. The next four years are going to be interesting for the US and the rest of the world. But for the titans of tech at Trump Tower yesterday, navigating these new straits, and at the same time adhering to principles of decency and diversity in the new order of things, will not be easy. Trump’s leadership selections (for example, that of climate-change denier Scott Pruitt to the head of EPA in the US), must surely grate with companies like Google or Apple that have lofty 100pc renewables goals. And of course, the key issues are diversity and inclusion. Microsoft and Google are respectively headed by emigrants from India, Nadella and Sundar Pichai, Catz is from Israel, Cook came out proudly as a gay man in 2014 and Sandberg is the author of Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, a book about the empowerment of women in the workplace. Will Trump’s America lend itself to supporting diversity and inclusion? I suspect that was the real question going through the minds of Catz, Nadella, Cook and Sandberg at the table on the 25th floor of Trump Tower. And we will have to wait for the real answer.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) AP Yahoo's big breach helps usher in an age of hacker anxiety By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer Dec 15, 2016 (…) Marcio Jose Sanchez FILE - This Tuesday, July 19, 2016 photo shows a Yahoo sign at the company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. On Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016, Yahoo said it believes hackers stole data from more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. "The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. GOVERNMENT ATTACKERS Of course, it's not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments." Yahoo's security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security.

Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis QUESTIONS FOR VERIZON News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the "new development before reaching any final conclusions." Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses "definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price," Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. "We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon," the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. ___ AP technology writer Bree Fowler contributed to this article from New York. ___ This story has been corrected to note that services such as Yahoo securely store passwords by scrambling them once with a cryptographic technique called hashing, not twice.

 Tech titans are meeting with Trump today Rob Price Dec. 14, 2016, 4:29 AM 10,786 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the expected attendees. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Some of the most powerful and high-profile leaders from the technology industry are scheduled to meet with US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday. The meeting has the potential to be a tense affair: Silicon Valley was overwhelmingly opposed to the Republican president-elect before the election, and during the campaign he repeatedly railed against the business practices of the industry. The discussion is likely to centre on jobs and immigration — issues on which the tech community and Trump seem likely to clash. The meeting, due to be held at Trump Tower in New York, has a star-studded guest list: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt from Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla's Elon Musk, IBM's Ginni Rometty, and Brian Krzanich from Intel are among the attendees, according to a roundup from The New York Times. (Sidenote: Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and CEO of Twitter — a social network beloved by Trump — was not invited.) It's all about jobs A key issue on the table will be jobs and immigration. Silicon Valley is heavily reliant on immigrant workers, hiring engineers and other employees from all over the world — but Trump ran his campaign in opposition to immigration, promising to build a wall along America's southern border and to halt Muslim immigration altogether. Trump has been critical of the H-1B skilled-worker visa program, which the tech industry uses heavily, saying in a statement in March: "I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions." Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has expressed concern that there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley. The attendees will be hoping that Trump is prepared to be more pragmatic about the issue than his rhetoric on the campaign trail might have suggested. The tech industry and Trump do not get along Several of the attendees at the meeting have previously been the subject of Trump's ire. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly went after Bezos, the Amazon CEO who also owns The Washington Post, which aggressively reported on Trump during the campaign. President-elect Donald Trump. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trump said Bezos had "a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much," while Bezos countered that Trump's strategy of targeting the news media "erodes democracy." (Bezos later promised to keep an "open mind" after Trump's election.) Trump attacked Apple over its refusal to help unlock an iPhone for the FBI in February, asking, "Who do they think they are?" and calling for a boycott. He has also targeted the company for building its iPhones in China. One of Trump's few backers in Silicon Valley is Peter Thiel, the Paypal cofounder turned billionaire investor and Facebook board member. Thiel supported Trump's candidacy, speaking at the Republican National Convention in the summer. He now sits on the president-elect's transition team, and he helped organise Wednesday's meeting. In November, Trump sat down for a similar off-the-record meeting with media executives. It was reportedly an awkward affair, with Trump attacking the assembled execs over their coverage of his campaign and their failure to anticipate his victory. Business Insider will bring you more on Wednesday's meeting as it happens. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Although the first Mi Pad was powered by Android, the second iteration gave users a choice, offering the Mi Pad 2 in a Windows 10 variant. A little over a year has passed since the last release and it appears that Xiaomi could be gearing up to offer a successor with the upcoming Mi Pad 3. Although the tablet has not been officially confirmed, the folks over at GizmoChina have found what appears to be leaked presentation slides that show quite a bit of detail. The tablet looks beautiful, is a bit larger than its predecessor and comes in at a svelte 6mm thin. According to the leaked slides, the tablet will offer: 9.7-inch 2048 x 1536 display (264PPI) Intel m3-7Y30 processor with Intel graphics 8GB DDR3 RAM 16MP rear camera with 8MP front-facing 8290mAh battery USB Type-C 239.5 x 164.5 x 6.08mm Windows 10 While last year's Mi Pad 2 was smaller and cheaper, the new tablet offers so much more. For this reason, it's no surprise that the upcoming tablet could be priced higher with the slides revealing a starting price of ¥1999 (roughly $288) for the 128GB version and ¥2299 (roughly $331) for the 256GB version. The Mi Pad 3 is expected to makes its official debut prior to the end of the year.

Puma 7 chipset. Hitron’s D3.1 device recently obtained certification from CableLabs.   RELATED: Hitron ‘Coda-45’ Modem Nets DOCSIS 3.1 Certification   “From a technical perspective, there is still a lot of testing going on and some enhancements are already planned to be deployed between not and the end of January,” the post read, noting that the device isn’t yet IPv6-enabled but should be in the January release.   The post also notes that the Hitron device will available in stores starting Dec. 13, and will be the “new default” product for Rogers  Gigabit customers. Current subs on Rogers’s 1-Gig and “250u” (250 Mbps downstream/20 Mbps up with unlimited data) “Ignite” tiers “should be able to swap their existing gateway without issues,” the posting adds.   Rogers has been asked for additional detail about the rollout as well as pricing on the Hitron gateway.    UPDATE: A Rogers official confirmed that the operator has begun to deploy DOCSIS 3.1 on its network while also making the new HItron gateway availalbe. "This week, starting with our Gigabit Internet customers, we're inviting them to swap their existing modem (free of charge) for the new modem that will offer more capacity for faster speeds, more robust performance and more capacity to support our customers’ growing needs," the official added in an email to Multichannel News. Regarding availability through Rogers stores, the MSO is not selling the Hitron device at retail but letting gigabit customers swap out their existing modems at those outlets.    South of Roger’s border, Netgear is gearing up for the retail release of its first DOCSIS 3.1-certified device, the CM1000. Comcast and Cox Communications have already approved it for use on their networks. Arris is also getting ready to offer a D3.1 modem, the  SurfBoard 8200, at retail.   RELATED: Netgear Hatching More DOCSIS 3.1 Retail Efforts Want to read more stories like this?

Getty Images Advertisement Technology industry leaders including Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos met with Donald Trump on Wednesday, seeking to persuade a man whose presidential bid many of them opposed to avoid policies they believe would hurt their companies. “I’m here to help you folks do well,” Trump told the executives as the meeting began on Wednesday. Jobs, immigration and China were major topics, while infrastructure, education and repatriation of technology companies’ overseas cash were also discussed, according to a person briefed on the summit. The atmosphere was friendly, added the person, who asked not to be identified speaking about a private meeting. Vice President-elect Mike Pence wrote on Twitter that the summit was "productive," and focused on job creation and innovation. Popular Now Best Practices for Using Value Stream Mapping as a Continuous Improvement Tool 8 Essentials of Building a Strong Team Bike Production Shifts Gears and Rolls Back to the US Trump has a prickly relationship with the industry. He differs with many tech CEOs on immigration, internet security and regulation and on government investment. This summer, more than 140 tech industry executives published an open letter denouncing his candidacy and declaring that he "would be a disaster for innovation." Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz, who like most other CEOs at the Trump Tower meeting did not sign the letter, said that trade would be at the top of the agenda. Trump has promised to unwind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 other Pacific Rim nations. He’s also said he would seek to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement. "This is a very important meeting," Catz said beforehand. "Better trade deals are tremendously important to us. We are net exporters. Over 60 percent of our sales are overseas. So better trade deals are very much in our interest." Trump told the executives at the meeting that he would make “fair trade deals. We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders." The meeting also included Alphabet Inc.’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich, Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco Systems Inc. CEO Chuck Robbins, Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook, Palantir Technologies Inc. CEO Alex Karp and International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty. Rometty also serves on a panel of CEOs advising Trump on business and economic matters. Bezos is Amazon’s CEO; Sandberg is Facebook’s chief operating officer. Catz, Nadella, Sandberg, Page and Schmidt all exited via the lobby of Trump Tower, where they declined to speak to reporters staking out the building. Catz gave a thumbs-up when asked how the meeting went. Campaign Donations Employees of internet companies donated far more money to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign than to Trump--$5.6 million compared with $54,472, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics. Before Wednesday’s meeting, some technologists debated whether invitees should even attend. A few top industry executives that were invited, including Uber Technologies Inc.’s Travis Kalanick and Airbnb Inc.’s Brian Chesky, didn’t go. Both companies said their CEOs had conflicting travel. Trump announced on Wednesday that Kalanick and Elon Musk would both join Rometty on his advisory panel, the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. Despite any reservations, most corporate executives would jump at the chance to press their agendas with the new leader of the world’s largest economy. And there are areas of common ground. The largest U.S. technology companies hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas and would like to bring that money back at a favorable tax rate. Trump has called for tax reform to allow such repatriation and has said revenue from the move could fund improvements to U.S. infrastructure. Trump noted that the U.S. stock market has enjoyed a "bounce" since his election--the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up about 5.7% since Nov. 8. " "They’re all talking about the bounce so everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit," he said. Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association, said most of the disagreement between Trump and the tech industry has been over social issues rather than business. "Trump is in a transition from running for office to serving in office. He will want Apple and other major tech companies to succeed," Shapiro said before the meeting. Trump’s three oldest children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, all participated in the meeting, as well as Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trump has said that Donald Jr. and Eric will take over leadership of his business while he is president; their dual roles as influential advisers to their father has raised conflict-of-interest concerns. Trump sat at a long conference room table with Pence to his right, followed by Sandberg, Page and Bezos. To his immediate left sat Thiel, followed by Cook and Catz. Schmidt was among tech executives across the table. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross. whom Trump plans to nominate as his commerce secretary, also participated. Trump thanked Thiel, perhaps his strongest supporter in Silicon Valley, for helping to organize the meeting, calling him "terrific and so outstanding." Job Moves During his campaign, Trump criticized U.S. corporations for moving jobs to other countries, and since his election, he has threatened "consequences" for companies that send work offshore. Earlier in the year, he said that he’d aim to get Apple to make its products in the U.S. Apple has suppliers make most of its products in China; moving that work to the U.S. would likely increase the cost of iPhones and iPads. Some big technology companies made what appeared to be preemptive moves ahead of the meeting with Trump. IBM’s Rometty unveiled a plan to hire about 25,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years. Apple may back a $100 billion technology fund that aims to invest about half the money in the U.S. and has pledged to create 50,000 new domestic jobs. Hours before the meeting, Bezos announced Amazon’s first delivery of a consumer product by drone to a customer. The test was conducted in England because Amazon says the U.K.’s regulations are less restrictive. Trump has vowed to ease regulations across the government.

The tech titans met with Trump behind closed doors, although reporters and cameramen were admitted for the first few minutes of their discussion, reporting that the heads of firms such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Intel and Amazon were all seated with the President-elect around a large conference room table, EFE news reported. "This is truly an amazing group of people," Trump said at the start of the meeting. "I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well. ... We're going to try to have (the current post-election stock market) bounce continue and perhaps even more importantly we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There's nobody like you in the world. There's nobody like the people in this room." The President-elect added that he had to make "hundreds" of telephone calls to assemble all the top Silicon Valley chiefs for the confab. "We're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders," said Trump before reporters were asked to leave the room, leaving the group to its deliberations. Seated with Trump at the meeting were three of his children -- Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka -- and son-in-law Jared Kushner, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trump told the members of the group that there is no "formal chain of command" on his team and assured them they could call him or anyone on that team at any time. Seated around the huge rectangular table were, among others, the top executives with Apple (Tim Cook), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), Alphabet (Larry Page and Eric Schmidt), IBM (Ginni Rometty), Cisco Systems (Chuck Robbins), Amazon (Jeff Bezos) and Intel (Brian Krzanich). Also participating in the meeting were Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla's Elon Musk and Oracle's Safra Catz. Trump, in his opening remarks, thanked financier Peter Thiel -- seated to his left -- for his efforts to make the meeting come about.

 This is how ridiculous the Trump tech meeting was Mark Suster, Both Sides of the Table Dec. 15, 2016, 12:14 AM 386,699 facebook linkedin twitter email print From left, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon; Larry Page, the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc.; Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook; Vice President-elect Mike Pence; and President-elect Donald Trump at Wednesday's meeting in New York. Drew Angerer/Getty Images A room full of some of the top tech leaders in the US: Apple, Facebook, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Amazon, Tesla, and so forth. It's a breath of fresh air to see that Marc Benioff, who has become a beacon for protecting the rights of our most vulnerable citizens, is not in attendance. But I actually fall on the side of the issue that it's good that our tech leaders are meeting with President-elect Donald Trump for two reasons: Whether I like it or not (I most certainly do not like it), Trump will be president of the United States, and anything we can do to influence his behavior away from what was displayed on the campaign trail and toward less harmful policies, the better. No, I don't hold out much hope now that we have seen his Cabinet picks, his Russia posturing, etc., but asking our best leaders to put their heads in the sand is also not a strategy. I also think that as public-company CEOs, they have a responsibility to their shareholders not to make governmental hostility a company policy until and unless Trump does enact some of the policies he has proposed by which they will face tougher choices. But a seat at the table is the responsible action if asked  —  as disgusting as Trump was during the campaign. Being present at such a meeting is not an endorsement of Trump's policies of Trump as a person. But. Trump's actions on Wednesday are a farce, and anybody not willing to say so publicly is hypocritical, because I guarantee if this were an Obama or a Clinton meeting, this would be pointed out in spades. I looked at a seating map published by Quartz and noticed 25 people in attendance. This is a group of our most senior technology leaders and our new government-elect. Skye Gould/Business Insider Twenty-five people. Four of them — FOUR — are the president-elect's children. That is 16% of everybody in the room, or put differently, if I include Trump, the meeting consists of 20% family members. This is the definition of nepotism that we would condemn from the least democratic nations in the world. Trump has not legally separated himself from his businesses, and to the extent that he has made statements, it has been that his children will run his business for him — his children who are sitting in the effing room with him while he meets the top technology leaders in the country. If that’s not a kleptocracy, I don’t know what is. Let me point out what else is ridiculous. Trump has been tweeting negative comments about Boeing and Lockheed Martin and taking all too literally the colloquialism of the "bully pulpit" in a way that directly affects individual stocks and companies. Because we know nothing about Trump's economic interests, we of course can't know whether this is market manipulation for personal benefit. But think about this: If we live in a society in which the president of the US publicly bullies companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Carrier, you can imagine what's coming for our sector when they try to stand up to Trump's autocratic tendencies. That's when we'll truly know how our industry will respond to autocracy. For now, they've just taken a seat at the 80% of the table not occupied by Donald Trump's family. This is an opinion column.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← No Offense Marine drops TRUTH BOMB about VA horrors → Trump Tries to Soothe Tech Chiefs With Pledge He’s an Ally Posted on December 14, 2016 by Martist MSN (Bloomberg) — Technology industry leaders including Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos met with Donald Trump on Wednesday, seeking to persuade a man whose presidential bid many of them opposed to avoid policies they believe would hurt their companies. “I’m here to help you folks do well,” Trump told the executives as the meeting began on Wednesday.   Trump has a prickly relationship with the industry. He differs with many tech CEOs on immigration, internet security and regulation and on government investment. This summer, more than 140 tech industry executives published an open letter denouncing his candidacy and declaring that he “would be a disaster for innovation.” Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz, who like most other CEOs at the Trump Tower meeting did not sign the letter, said that trade would be at the top of the agenda. Trump has promised to unwind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 other Pacific Rim nations. He’s also said he would seek to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement. “This is a very important meeting,” Catz said before hand. “Better trade deals are tremendously important to us. We are net exporters. Over 60% of our sales are overseas. So better trade deals are very much in our interest.” Trump told the executives at the meeting that he would make “fair trade deals. We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.” The meeting also included Alphabet Inc.’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich, Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco Systems Inc. CEO Chuck Robbins, Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook, Palantir Technologies Inc. CEO Alex Karp and International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty. Rometty also serves on a panel of CEOs advising Trump on business and economic matters. Bezos is Amazon’s CEO; Sandberg is Facebook’s chief operating officer. Campaign Donations Employees of internet companies donated more than ten times as much money to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign than to Trump — $5.6 million compared with $54,472, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics. Before Wednesday’s meeting, some technologists debated whether invitees should even attend. A few top industry executives that were invited, including Uber Technologies Inc.’s Travis Kalanick and Airbnb Inc.’s Brian Chesky, didn’t go. Both companies said their CEOs had conflicting travel. Trump announced on Wednesday that Kalanick and Elon Musk would both join Rometty on his advisory panel, the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum.

Seated with Trump at the meeting were three of his children  Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka  and son-in-law Jared Kushner, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trump told the members of the group that there is no formal chain of command on his team and assured them they could call him or anyone on that team at any time. Seated around the huge rectangular table were, among others, the top executives with Apple (Tim Cook), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), Alphabet (Larry Page and Eric Schmidt), IBM (Ginni Rometty), Cisco Systems (Chuck Robbins), Amazon (Jeff Bezos) and Intel (Brian Krzanich). Also participating in the meeting were Facebooks Sheryl Sandberg, Teslas Elon Musk and Oracles Safra Catz. Trump, in his opening remarks, thanked financier Peter Thiel  seated to his left  for his efforts to make the meeting come about.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

The state Energy Commission said that when fully implemented the industry-backed plan will save consumers $373 million a year and conserve at least as much electricity annually as it takes to power all of San Francisco's households. Final approval at a meeting of the five-member commission in Sacramento capped several years spent developing the rules in collaboration with computer makers, consumer activists, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other environmental groups. The new rules will cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion to generate power by 700,000 tons a year, the NRDC said. The standards work by setting benchmarks for machines' overall energy use - focusing on when they are turned on but left inactive - and leave manufacturers flexibility to choose which efficiency measures are employed to meet the standards, an approach aimed at fostering innovation. The rules drew support from nearly 40 companies represented by the Information Technology Industry Council, including such Silicon Valley giants as HP Inc and Intel Corp. HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford called the standards "groundbreaking," describing them as "ambitious but achievable." "This is a big deal," said Mark Cooper, a policy analyst for the Consumer Federation of America, adding that computer ownership per capita in California ranks second in the world behind Sweden. In California, computers and monitors draw an estimated 5,610 gigawatt-hours of energy per year - representing roughly 3 percent of residential electric bills and 7 percent of power costs for commercial users - much of that while the devices sit idle. The NRDC has said the amount of power consumed by computers and monitors will be reduced by a third once there is a complete turnover in existing stocks of those devices. The first phase of the rules takes effect in January 2019 for desktop, laptop and notebook computers. The standards kick in for workstations and small-scale servers in January 2018 and for computer monitors in July 2019. Video-game consoles, industrial computers, large-scale servers, tablets and other handheld devices are exempt. The standards will add about $14 to average retail costs of desktops, which are far less energy efficient than laptops, but will save consumers more than $40 in electric bills over five years, according to commission estimates. Over half of desktops typically in use in California now meet the first tier of the standards, which grow more stringent in 2021. Seventy-three percent of laptops already comply. Computer monitors have farther to go, with a compliance rate of just 14 percent among the 25 million units now installed in homes and businesses statewide. The latest rules could set a new standard for manufacturers everywhere by virtue of the size of the consumer market in California, which often leads the way in U.S. environmental initiatives. If the same standards are adopted nationwide, they could save U.S. consumers about $2.2 billion annually in electric bills while reducing energy generation by the equivalent output of seven coal-fired power plants, the NRDC said.

What is the linkage between foreign investors and local investors in Vietnam’s energy sector?John Rockhold, chairman of the Vietnam Business Forum’s Power and Energy Working Group, talked with VIR’s Phuong Thu about how to maximise Vietnam’s energy resources to stimulate investment in energy generation and attract foreign investors. We cannot develop the energy sector without domestic companies. We need strong domestic developers. We need equipment for renewable energy projects made here in Vietnam, as the country has to import these items currently. The cost is too high to implement renewable energy projects [on our own]. We need local companies involved in [the field] to kick start its growth. The local companies can structure renewable energy projects so we can drive their price down. For example, we have seen how other countries have invested in solar power projects. When they first invested in solar, at first the price was 13, 14, 15 UScents per kWh. In the few years after domestic firms were able to come in with the technology and learn it, the price dropped down to 6 UScents. This is what we want to do. We also want to see that we can buy energy directly from a power producer. Right now we can only buy power from state-run Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). Buying energy directly has been shown to be extremely effective in developing clean energy in other countries. Foreign investors in Vietnam, and other multinational corporations as Intel and Nike, have publicly made global commitments to work towards using energy from renewable, energy-efficient projects. A change in this policy, allowing enterprises and customers to have access to clean energy, will attract additional investment and global brands that will help carry Vietnam up the manufacturing value chain. If the Vietnamese government approves direct power purchase agreements of 1,000 megawatts of wind power and solar power that can be added to the grid before 2020, this will cost the government nothing in capital costs, and will not require any government guarantee. Besides power purchase agreements between power producers and larger power consumers in wind or solar farms, what are the recommendations of your “made-in-Vietnam energy plan” in your report at VBF? The report outlines the advantages of placing greater emphasis on cleaner domestic energy solutions for Vietnam’s future energy needs, and demonstrates the advantages of domestic hydro, gas, wind, and solar energy. It also directly supports Vietnam’s global and domestic environmental commitments and will attract immediate investment from the private sector. We need to create a clear power pricing roadmap to 2020, with a vision to 2025, including a definition of variable pricing between the three main tariff groups: residential, commercial, and industrial. The provision of actual cost information can empower consumers and investors as to the most effective way to invest in higher efficiency equipment and processes. Energy efficiency investment and innovation is not occurring in high volume now because consumers believe the power price will remain low. Meanwhile, investors require government guarantees because the prices do not reflect the full costs of production. In addition, we suggest the government works with the private sector to develop offshore gas reserves and infrastructure, and encourage exploration to bring additional gas on line as soon as possible to reduce the need for imported coal. We support the enhancement of EVN’s creditworthiness. This involves increasing international donor support for renewable and cleaner energy development, and procedures to assist the costs of guaranteeing that EVN will pay power suppliers, under a power purchase agreement for renewable and clean energy projects in Vietnam. Your report also referred to related environmental issues, which are one of the big concerns of the public. In your opinion, what kind of punishments should be instituted for polluters? Many countries have a “pollution pays” law – if you make pollution, you pay for it. In Vietnam, polluters are only fined, and if you look at the fine, it is very low. People will pay much more attention to pollution if they are hit with very high fines. Vietnam has in place adequate environmental laws and regulations, but sadly we have seen businesses able to bypass these laws. The government of Vietnam needs to consistently and comprehensively enforce these laws, forcing companies to implement their environmental plans, especially those with large energy consumption and potential pollution risks from producing things like cement, steel, and fertilizer.

Imagination will release the Series8XT family of GPUs, which could provide the underlying technology for graphics in the iPhone 8. It will succeed the Series7XT family of GPUs, which is the base architecture for the PowerVR GT7600 in the iPhone 7. Analyst firm Linley Group said the iPhone 7 GPU is the fastest among all mobile processors when operating at peak speed. The Series8XT will be even faster, and perhaps more power efficient. The iPhone 7 GPU can overheat quickly if it runs at peak speed for a long time. Imagination didn't provide further details on the 8XT or a specific release date, and did not say if the GPU would be in the iPhone 8. But Apple has used PowerVR in every iPhone to date, and recently started tuning the architecture to work better with its mobile devices. Imagination designs GPUs and licenses it to companies like Apple and Intel. Apple is also a minority shareholder in Imagination. Apple has been notoriously quiet about the underlying technology in its A-series chips. Linley Group only recently unveiled that the iPhone 7 GPU was based on PowerVR GT7600 architecture. The 8XT could be introduced in late February at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Imagination is showing off its PowerVR GPU. The company has used GDC to launch new GPU architectures in the past. The high-end 8XT architecture is a "technology generator" and will host many new GPU features developed by Imagination, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR at Imagination. Imagination will focus on putting more performance in 8XT, Deacon said. Beyond smartphones, the company's GPUs also are used in set-top boxes, TVs and other devices requiring graphics power or focusing on visual computing. Imagination this year released the 8XE GPU, which was focused on the fast-growing low-end and mid-range phones market. The Series8XT will offer more performance. Imagination's PowerVR was once competitive in smartphones, but has lost share as competition grows. ARM's Mali GPUs based on the Bitfrost architecture are catching on strong, and Qualcomm, which is the mobile chip leader, has its own Adreno GPU.  Nvidia has the best mobile GPU, but it is being targeted at automotive and machine learning applications. There are other areas of growth for Imagination GPUs outside of smartphones, especially in automotive and set-top boxes, Deacon said. Imagination is developing many more technologies to boost graphics, and supporting vectors like image analysis add value to PowerVR GPUs. There are also opportunities in machine learning, and PowerVR could play a big role in enabling self-driving cars. Imagination is developing algorithms, and has been demonstrating neural networks running on GPU computing. Imagination is also mixing up its MIPS CPU architecture with PowerVR for drones and robots, which heavily rely on visual computing and image analysis.

Imagination will release the Series8XT family of GPUs, which could provide the underlying technology for graphics in the iPhone 8. It will succeed the Series7XT family of GPUs, which is the base architecture for the PowerVR GT7600 in the iPhone 7. Analyst firm Linley Group said the iPhone 7 GPU is the fastest among all mobile processors when operating at peak speed. The Series8XT will be even faster, and perhaps more power efficient. The iPhone 7 GPU can overheat quickly if it runs at peak speed for a long time. Imagination didn't provide further details on the 8XT or a specific release date, and did not say if the GPU would be in the iPhone 8. But Apple has used PowerVR in every iPhone to date, and recently started tuning the architecture to work better with its mobile devices. Imagination designs GPUs and licenses it to companies like Apple and Intel. Apple is also a minority shareholder in Imagination. Apple has been notoriously quiet about the underlying technology in its A-series chips. Linley Group only recently unveiled that the iPhone 7 GPU was based on PowerVR GT7600 architecture. The 8XT could be introduced in late February at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Imagination is showing off its PowerVR GPU. The company has used GDC to launch new GPU architectures in the past. The high-end 8XT architecture is a "technology generator" and will host many new GPU features developed by Imagination, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR at Imagination. Imagination will focus on putting more performance in 8XT, Deacon said. Beyond smartphones, the company's GPUs also are used in set-top boxes, TVs and other devices requiring graphics power or focusing on visual computing. Imagination this year released the 8XE GPU, which was focused on the fast-growing low-end and mid-range phones market. The Series8XT will offer more performance. Imagination's PowerVR was once competitive in smartphones, but has lost share as competition grows. ARM's Mali GPUs based on the Bitfrost architecture are catching on strong, and Qualcomm, which is the mobile chip leader, has its own Adreno GPU.  Nvidia has the best mobile GPU, but it is being targeted at automotive and machine learning applications. There are other areas of growth for Imagination GPUs outside of smartphones, especially in automotive and set-top boxes, Deacon said. Imagination is developing many more technologies to boost graphics, and supporting vectors like image analysis add value to PowerVR GPUs. There are also opportunities in machine learning, and PowerVR could play a big role in enabling self-driving cars. Imagination is developing algorithms, and has been demonstrating neural networks running on GPU computing. Imagination is also mixing up its MIPS CPU architecture with PowerVR for drones and robots, which heavily rely on visual computing and image analysis.

During the meeting, which lasted for several hours at Trump’s business headquarters in New York City, the incoming president attempted to build rapport with the Silicon Valley leaders, many of whom were vocal supporters of his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Also in attendance were Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz; IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins. Noticeably absent was the leader of Trump’s seemingly favorite tech product; Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey was not invited. Trump promised to improve international trade deals during the huddle and keep open lines of communication between Silicon Valley and the White House. He also announced that Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick would become official advisors on policy. “You're doing well right now and I'm very honored by the bounce...so right now everybody in this room has to like me,” Trump said to the gathered executives. Vice President-elect Mike Pence was at the meeting, along with Trump’s three adult children and incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. “Today's tech summit included productive discussions about job creation and economic growth,” Priebus, currently the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tweeted after the meeting. “We're on track to make America first again.” Many in the tech industry are concerned that Trump could use platforms like Twitter or Facebook to help create a database for Muslims, a project he discussed multiple times while campaigning. Hundreds of tech workers, including Dorsey, and activists have sharply criticized the idea of a registry for Muslims. “Targeting Muslims in the ways Trump has proposed is not only ineffective and would do nothing to keep the country safe, but it is also deeply immoral,” Eddie Kurtz, the executive director of activist group Courage Campaign, announced in a statement Wednesday. “It would repeat mistakes made during some of the darkest days of America's past. This is a line that tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others must not cross.” Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Photo: William Luther, Staff / San Antonio Express-News Partnership announced to train teachers in computer science 1 / 3 Back to Gallery U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Helotes, announced Wednesday that 40 middle school math teachers in his vast congressional district will receive low-cost training in March to integrate computer science into their curriculum. “Coding is the language of the 21st century economy,” Hurd said at a press conference at the BiblioTech South branch on Pleasanton Road. “If our students can’t speak it, they’re going to be left behind.” The training will be provided by the nonprofit Bootstrap, through the University of Texas Center for STEM Education. Four tech companies — Dell, Intel, Facebook and Brocade — donated a total of $35,000 to fund the training, said Carol Fletcher, deputy director of the Center for STEM Education. The Texas Education Agency will provide a smaller amount of matching funds, Fletcher added. The teachers can apply on Hurd’s website by the end of January to receive the three-day training at the end of March. Breakfast, lunch and transportation will be included, as will lodging for teachers coming from more than 60 miles away.

The superintendents of North East and Southwest Independent School Districts — both in Hurd’s district, which curls around inner-city San Antonio — praised his effort Wednesday. North East will pilot the program at Lopez Middle School, said Superintendent Brian Gottardy. Andrea Connor, a seventh-grader at Lopez, remembered using computers in kindergarten to learn her vowels and consonants. “I’m not really sure what I want to become when I’m older, but I do know I want it to be technology-based, because our future lies in computer science,” she said. Training 40 teachers will expose an additional 5,000 middle school students to computer science in the fall, Hurd said. Hurd was inspired to focus on computer science in high school, while interning at the Southwest Research Institute. He became a Central Intelligence Agency operative and joined a cybersecurity company after leaving the agency. He said San Antonio has the second-highest number of cybersecurity jobs in the nation, behind the Washington, D.C. area. Texas also has about 42,000 unfilled computing jobs statewide, even though those jobs come with an average salary of $89,000, Hurd said. “We need to change that, and that means getting to these kids sooner,” he said. amalik@express-news.net Twitter: @AliaAtSAEN The Latest Man crashes aircraft in New Braunfels residence Fisher's daughter breaks the silence after mother's death Dog named Scarface attacks Fla. family for dressing it in sweater Reward for accused S.A. killer's capture raised to $12,500 3 men decapitated, 2 more slain in Acapulco over New Year's Zillow: What's IN and what's OUT in home decor for 2017 South Texas fossil could be reptile that swam 90M years ago Tractor-Trailer accident stalls I-35 traffic north of Laredo Mariah Carey rep: Technical problems bungle New Year's show Photos: When live nude acts were common in S.A.

Press Pool Internet by Marguerite Reardon December 15, 2016 7:44 AM PST @maggie_reardon by Alfred Ng December 15, 2016 7:44 AM PST @alfredwkng Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Tech titans turn out for Trump Some of the biggest names in the industry met with President-elect Donald Trump. 1:25 Close Drag For President-elect Donald Trump, it's kiss-and-make-up time. Trump met with more than a dozen executives from the biggest tech companies in the US -- a roundtable fraught with potential for awkwardness given Trump's repeated attacks on tech and the philosophical disagreements he has with some of the executives. The president-elect instead pledged to do "anything we can do" to help continue the industry's success. "This is a truly amazing group of people," Trump said, according to a press pool transcript. "I'm here to help you folks do well. And you're doing well right now, and I'm very honored by the (stock market) bounce. So right now everybody in this room has to like me -- at least a little bit -- but we're going to try and have that bounce continue." The eagerly anticipated meeting was Trump's attempt to mend fences after a volatile election season in which he went after high-profile companies like Apple. Trump had hoped to reset the relationship with an industry that had close ties to the Obama administration and openly supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign. Earlier Wednesday, Trump said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick would serve as advisers. Trump kicked off the roundtable by complimenting the accomplishments of his guests and hinting that any bad feelings may be behind them. He continued by offering an open line of communication between executives and his administration. "You call my people, you call me," he said. "It doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here." A who's who The meeting, which was held at Trump Tower in New York, included a guest list of who's who in Silicon Valley. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt from Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon head Jeff Bezos, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich were there along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who coordinated the meeting. Trump's children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner were also in the meeting. The CEOs of Oracle, IBM, Cisco, and Palantir Technologies, a company co-founded by Thiel, were also there. Press and curious onlookers crowded Trump Tower hoping to catch a glimpse of a high-profile figure like Kanye West or Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, both of whom appeared on Tuesday. Tourists left disappointed when they were told that tech executives, and not rap stars, would be showing up today. The more recognizable faces, like Cook and Bezos, were able to sneak past the press and make the meeting without being seen. Bezos left feeling the meeting was "very productive," the Amazon founder said in a statement. "I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars." Notably missing from the meeting was CEO and co-founder of Twitter Jack Dorsey, whose absence was a surprise given Trump's penchant for using the social media platform to bypass the traditional press. Trump's transition team told Reuters the omission was because Twitter was too small. All about jobs Several tech execs declined comment on the meeting. Reince Priebus, who will become Trump's White House chief of staff, said in a tweet that the summit included "productive discussions about job creation & economic growth." Creating jobs was on the agenda for the meeting. The consumer tech sector is a significant part of the US economy, generating $3.5 trillion in economic output and employing more than 15 million people, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Of that, the companies in attendance represent more than 1.3 million of those jobs with a total market cap of $2.9 trillion, according to CTA. There is a belief they could be doing more. Trump has a complicated history of jabs at the tech leaders. During the campaign he accused Google of burying negative news about Clinton, which was disproved with a simple search. He's also accused Google -- along with Facebook and Twitter -- of hiding news about the FBI's investigation of Clinton, which was also disproved. In his most vocal tech feud during the campaign, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company refused to provide a security backdoor to the FBI to access the locked iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist. He also said on the campaign trail that he'd force Apple to build iPhones in the US, which would send iPhone prices soaring. Troublesome issues There is a long list of other issues in which the tech sector and Trump disagree, including his stance on limiting H-1B visas and plans to restrict trade. Trump tried to allay fears that his trade policies would hurt tech companies. He told the executives that he wanted to work with them to ensure that there were fair trade deals that would "make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders."

The Mi Pad 3 will be bigger than both of its predecessors, opting to sport a 9.7-inch 2,048x1,536 touchscreen, matching Apple's iPad Pro 9.7 in both size and resolution. Speaking of which, the Mi Pad 3 is barely thinner than Apple's tablet, coming in at 6.08mm compared to 6.1mm. Xiaomi's device weighs only 380g, 57g less than the iPad, and it manages to be shorter and narrower too, at 239.5x164.5mm. The Mi Pad 3 is powered by Intel's 7th Gen Core m3-7Y30 processor, aided by 8GB of RAM and a choice between 128 or 256GB of storage. It runs Windows 10, and boasts an 8,290 mAh battery as well as a USB Type-C port for charging. On the rear will be a 16 MP camera with dual-tone LED flash, while selfies will be taken care of by an 8 MP sensor. The device is reportedly going to launch on December 30, priced at CNY 1,999 ($289 or 273) with 128GB of storage, and CNY 2,299 ($332 or 314) with 256GB. The keyboard dock you can see below will be sold separately for CNY 99 ($14 or 13). The Mi Pad 3 has a full metal build with dual speaker grilles on the bottom, flanking the USB Type-C port. It's unclear if there will ever be an Android version of this tablet, since the leak doesn't mention such a possibility. That said, last year's Mi Pad 2 did have two OS versions, so it's not entirely unreasonable to expect an Android-powered Mi Pad 3 to show up at some point next year.

California calls this illegal.

The only problem is the company might be breaking state law. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:14 Close Drag Uber has a simple approach to business: Don't ask for permission, but be prepared to seek forgiveness. Its foray into self-driving cars in California is no different. Confirming news that CNET broke Tuesday, the ride-hailing company officially announced Wednesday that it's rolling out a fleet of self-driving cars to passengers in San Francisco, making California only the second state in which Uber offers such services. But Uber didn't run the plan past the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires a permit for such cars. Now, the DMV told Uber to cut it out ... or else. "It is illegal for the company to operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads until it receives an autonomous vehicle testing permit," the DMV wrote in a letter to Uber on Wednesday. "Any action by Uber to continue the operation of vehicles equipped with autonomous technology on public streets in California must cease." Self-driving cars are a hot topic in both the auto and tech industries. Toyota, Ford, Volvo, Tesla and other automakers have projects underway, while Silicon Valley giants including Google, Intel, Tesla Motors and Apple are also betting on the tech. But with Uber's efforts to beat out rivals, is the company going too far by skirting the rules? The rules don't apply to us The DMV warned Uber a month ago that it needed a permit to operate self-driving cars in the state, according to Brian Soublet, the department's chief legal counsel, who held a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. Soublet said he told the company the same thing Tuesday before its launch. But Uber didn't appear to listen. "We understand that there is a debate over whether or not we need a testing permit to launch self-driving Ubers in San Francisco," Anthony Levandowski, Uber's vice president of self-driving technology, wrote in a blog post Wednesday. "We have looked at this issue carefully and we don't believe we do." Twenty other companies working on self-driving technology have already received permits from California's DMV, including Google, Tesla, BMW, Honda, Ford, Mercedes Benz, Nissan and GM. Uber is the first of these companies to bring its autonomous vehicles to the public in the US. Levandowski criticized California's rules and requirements as overly strict, warning they "could have the unintended consequence of slowing innovation." Arizona, Nevada and Florida have been leaders in this arena, he said, proving they are "pro technology." Pennsylvania, where Uber first launched its self-driving cars in September, hasn't yet enacted autonomous vehicle legislation. Related stories Uber puts self-driving cars on the road in SF California deems carpooling via all ride-share services illegal Another Tesla crash blamed on car's Autopilot system California's rules apply to cars that are completely autonomous without a person monitoring the driving, Uber's Levandowski said in his post. Uber intends to have "safety drivers" who can take over if anything goes awry in a self-driving car, at all times. "Our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them," Levandowski said, adding the project is in its "early days." Soublet said in the conference call that the law applies to the kind of technology in the vehicle, not whether a human is behind the wheel. "They've equipped the vehicles that allows them to operate autonomously," Soublet said. "That's the key." Are self-driving cars safe? The DMV says it encourages the development of self-driving cars as long as companies seek proper permission. The reason for that, the department says, is for public safety. "It is essential that Uber takes appropriate measures to ensure safety of the public," the DMV wrote in its letter to Uber on Wednesday. "If Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action." Uber didn't return request for comment regarding the DMV's letter. Most companies working on self-driving cars tout the vehicles as a potentially safer alternative to human drivers. And, for the most part, testing of the technology has shown the cars to be safe. However, some autonomous vehicles have been involved in accidents, including a Google car collision and at least three crashes involving Teslas in autopilot mode, one of which was fatal. Since Uber introduced self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, there have been a few reports of cars involved in fender-benders, going the wrong way down one-way streets and ignoring traffic signals, according to Quartz. No injuries have been reported, however. A self-driving Uber ran a red light in downtown San Francisco on Wednesday morning, just hours after the company's launch. A dashboard camera video, captured by Luxor Cab taxi, shows the self-driving Uber Volvo SUV zooming through the light long after it turned red. Similar incidents have been reported throughout the city today, according to the San Francisco Examiner. Luxor Cab confirmed to CNET it recorded the video. An Uber spokesperson said in an email that the incident was due to human error. "This vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers," the spokesperson said. "The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate." Uber's launch of self-driving cars in California without a permit isn't the first time the company has sallied forth without government permission. The company didn't seek permission when it launched its ride-hailing service in San Francisco in 2010. Four months after its rollout, Uber was hit with a "cease and desist" letter from the California Public Utility Commission and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The same thing happened when the company launched its carpool service UberPool in 2014. "We don't have to beg for forgiveness because we are legal," Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told the Wall Street Journal in 2013 during an interview about the cease-and-desist letters. "There's been so much corruption and so much cronyism in the taxi industry and so much regulatory capture that if you ask for permission up front for something that's already legal, you'll never get it." As of this writing, Uber's autonomous vehicles are still cruising San Francisco's streets, despite the threats from the DMV. With self-driving cars, Uber appears to continue its modus operandi of dealing with regulators after the fact. First published December 14, 3:24 p.m. PT.

Trump, still savoring his election victory, convened a summit at Trump Tower for nearly a dozen tech leaders, whose industry largely supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Many in the industry are worried that Trump will stifle innovation, curb the hiring of computer-savvy immigrants and infringe on consumers' digital privacy. He immediately tried to allay those fears. "We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. Anything we can do to help this go on, we will be there for you," Trump said. "You'll call my people, you'll call me. We have no formal chain of command around here." The CEOs who filled the table in Trump's 25th floor conference room included Intel's Brian Krzanich. Krzanich sat next to Donald Trump Jr., on on the opposite side of the table from the president-elect. Others who made the pilgrimage to included Apple's Tim Cook, Alphabet's Larry Page, Google's Eric Schmidt, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tesla's Elon Musk, IBM's Ginni Rometty, Oracle's Safra Catz and Cisco Systems' Chuck Robbins. Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, attended instead of its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who is one of many tech executives who have expressed misgivings about Trump's pledge to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally. Trump was joined by several members of his senior staff and his three eldest children, who are expected to help run his business once he takes office, again blurring the line between the president-elect's personal and professional lives. Reporters were allowed to witness only the first moments of the meeting and most of the attendees departed without comment. A spokesman for Cisco said the meeting was "very informative and productive." Bezos, who is also owner of The Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of Trump complaints about campaign coverage, said he was "super excited about the possibility of innovation," a comment echoed by several other attendees. No industry was more open in its contempt for Trump during the campaign. In an open letter published in July, more than 140 technology executives, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists skewered him as a "disaster for innovation." And Trump's denigration of Mexicans, his pledge to deport millions of immigrants now living in the U.S. illegally and his crude remarks about women were widely viewed as racist, authoritarian and sexist by an industry that prides itself on its tolerance. Trump, in turn, sometimes lashed out at the industry and its leaders, and -- despite his reassurances Wednesday -- questions remain about how he'll govern. He has lambasted Bezos for the Post's campaign coverage and has suggested that Amazon could face antitrust scrutiny after his election. Trump also rebuked Cook for fighting a government order requiring Apple to unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a shooter in last year's terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. And Trump's repeated negative comments about immigrants raised fears that he might dismantle programs that have enabled tech companies to hire tens of thousands of foreign workers with the skills to write computer programs, design web pages and build mobile apps. The industry is also worried that Trump might try to undermine "net neutrality," a regulation requiring internet service providers to offer equal access to all online services. Trump's harsh characterization of the media as dishonest and unfair has raised other fears that he might try to restrict free speech online. Some in Silicon Valley think the industry's best move would be to keep its distance until Trump changes his tone. Former Google executive Chris Sacca, now a tech investor, argues that industry leaders should have steered clear of the meeting altogether. Sitting down with the president-elect "would only make sense after Trump has given public assurances he won't encourage censorship, will stop exploiting fake news, will promote net neutrality, denounce hate crimes and embrace science," Sacca said. "If and until then, tech figures who visit are being used to whitewash an authoritarian bully who threatens not just our industry but our entire democracy." One major tech company not invited, despite Trump's frequent use of its product, was Twitter. Sean Spicer, communications director for the Republican National Committee, disputed that they were singled out -- Twitter has said it declined to make branded emojis on the campaign's behalf -- and explained its absence by simply saying "the conference table was only so big, OK?" Separately on Wednesday, Michigan's Republican Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel was officially named Trump's choice to become the new RNC chair next year. The niece of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney would be the first woman to hold the committee's top position in 40 years, and her promotion comes after Trump became the first Republican to carry Michigan in 28 years. Trump also officially announced his selection of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as his secretary of energy, leading a department Perry once suggested scrapping. While Trump remained in his Manhattan skyscraper Wednesday, he was hitting the road Thursday for the latest stop in his "thank you" tour, this time in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The tour, which is designed to salute supporters in states that helped him win the White House, will continue Friday in Orlando, Florida, before wrapping Saturday at a Mobile, Alabama, football stadium which was the site of the biggest rally of his campaign. -- The Associated Press Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

The afternoon summit at Trump Tower comes as the 70-year-old Republican leader-in-waiting continues to fill out his cabinet, with former Texas governor Rick Perry tapped to serve as secretary of energy. Washington is still buzzing over Trump`s nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be his secretary of state, with concerns about the oilman`s ties to Moscow riling some amid allegations of Russian interference in the November 8 election. Against that background, Trump is heading into hostile territory -- with the exception of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley shunned the New York billionaire during the presidential campaign, throwing their weight behind his Democratic rival Clinton. "I`m here to help you folks," Trump said at the start of the meeting. "We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There`s nobody like you in the world." Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were seated at a long table with America`s top tech titans, including CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Larry Page of Alphabet (Google) and Brian Krzanich of Intel. Also on the guest list were Amazon founder and chief Jeff Bezos, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, Facebook`s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Oracle chief executive Safra Catz. Trump`s three adult children Don Jr, Ivanka and Eric were also present. One major absence was that of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey -- despite the fact that the billionaire-turned-president-elect uses the social network as a major means of getting out his message. Bezos has been the target of the Manhattan real estate tycoon`s ire, for allegedly using The Washington Post to secure tax benefits for Amazon -- and to attack the Republican. Bezos responded by cheekily offering Trump a trip into space -- on a rocket operated by his Blue Origin space flight company. Late last month, a group of 17 tech associations offered to work with Trump while calling for policies to "foster growth and innovation."The effects of a Trump presidency on the sector are hard to foresee. While the tech industry is likely to oppose any trade barriers or efforts to limit immigration, many companies are expected to welcome a lowering of corporate tax rates promised by Trump, especially on profits repatriated from overseas. "We`re going to make fair trade deals. We`re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders. There`s a lot of restrictions, a lot of problems that I think you see," Trump told the executives at the start of the meeting. Tech firms led by Apple are responsible for the lion`s share of an estimated $2.5 trillion being held overseas by US companies, and are reluctant to bring those funds back and face a hefty tax bill. A potential clash between Trump and the sector is possible over encryption, and the ability of law enforcement and intelligence services to decrypt devices for national security investigations. Trump said Wednesday he would add Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to join his advisory council of business leaders. "My administration is going to work together with the private sector to improve the business climate and make it attractive for firms to create new jobs across the United States from Silicon Valley to the heartland," Trump said.Trump is now putting the finishing touches to his cabinet, formalizing his nomination of Perry and reportedly choosing Montana Representative Ryan Zinke to be his interior secretary. The nomination puts Perry, the oil-rich state`s longest-serving governor, in charge of a vast array of energy oversight, including maintenance of the US nuclear weapons arsenal, enhancement of nuclear security and science and innovation in the energy field. "As the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy," Trump said in a statement. Perry, who participated in the Republican primary but was crushed by Trump early on, once assailed him as a "cancer on conservatism." On Wednesday, Forbes magazine ranked Trump as the second most powerful person of the year -- right behind Russian President Vladimir Putin.

PHOTO: AFP [NEW YORK] Technology industry leaders including Facebook Inc's Sheryl Sandberg and Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos met with Donald Trump on Wednesday, seeking to persuade a man whose presidential bid many of them opposed to avoid policies they believe would hurt their companies. "I'm here to help you folks do well," Mr Trump told the executives as the meeting began on Wednesday. Jobs, immigration and China were major topics, while infrastructure, education and repatriation of technology companies' overseas cash were also discussed, according to a person briefed on the summit. The atmosphere was friendly, added the person, who asked not to be identified speaking about a private meeting. Vice President-elect Mike Pence wrote on Twitter that the summit was "productive," and focused on job creation and innovation. Mr Trump has a prickly relationship with the industry. He differs with many tech CEOs on immigration, internet security and regulation and on government investment. This summer, more than 140 tech industry executives published an open letter denouncing his candidacy and declaring that he "would be a disaster for innovation." SEE ALSO: White House to test Trump's leadership chops Oracle Corp co-CEO Safra Catz, who like most other CEOs at the Trump Tower meeting did not sign the letter, said that trade would be at the top of the agenda. Mr Trump has promised to unwind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 other Pacific Rim nations. He's also said he would seek to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement. "This is a very important meeting," Mr Catz said beforehand. "Better trade deals are tremendously important to us. We are net exporters. Over 60 per cent of our sales are overseas. So better trade deals are very much in our interest." Mr Trump told the executives at the meeting that he would make "fair trade deals. We're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders." The meeting also included Alphabet Inc's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Intel Corp CEO Brian Krzanich, Microsoft Corp CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco Systems Inc CEO Chuck Robbins, Apple Inc's Tim Cook, Palantir Technologies Inc CEO Alex Karp and International Business Machines Corp CEO Ginni Rometty. Ms Rometty also serves on a panel of CEOs advising Mr Trump on business and economic matters. Mr Bezos is Amazon's CEO; Ms Sandberg is Facebook's chief operating officer. Mr Catz, Mr Nadella, Ms Sandberg, Mr Page and Mr Schmidt all exited via the lobby of Trump Tower, where they declined to speak to reporters staking out the building. Mr Catz gave a thumbs-up when asked how the meeting went. Employees of internet companies donated far more money to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign than to Mr Trump - US$5.6 million compared with US$54,472, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics. Before Wednesday's meeting, some technologists debated whether invitees should even attend. A few top industry executives that were invited, including Uber Technologies Inc's Travis Kalanick and Airbnb Inc's Brian Chesky, didn't go. Both companies said their CEOs had conflicting travel. Mr Trump announced on Wednesday that Mr Kalanick and Elon Musk would both join Ms Rometty on his advisory panel, the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. Despite any reservations, most corporate executives would jump at the chance to press their agendas with the new leader of the world's largest economy. And there are areas of common ground. The largest US technology companies hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas and would like to bring that money back at a favorable tax rate. Mr Trump has called for tax reform to allow such repatriation and has said revenue from the move could fund improvements to US infrastructure. Mr Trump noted that the US stock market has enjoyed a "bounce" since his election - the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up about 5.7 per cent since Nov 8. "They're all talking about the bounce so everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit," he said. Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association, said most of the disagreement between Mr Trump and the tech industry has been over social issues rather than business. "Mr Trump is in a transition from running for office to serving in office. He will want Apple and other major tech companies to succeed," Mr Shapiro said before the meeting. Mr Trump's three oldest children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, all participated in the meeting, as well as Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr Trump has said that Donald Jr and Eric will take over leadership of his business while he is president; their dual roles as influential advisers to their father has raised conflict-of-interest concerns. Mr Trump sat at a long conference room table with Mr Pence to his right, followed by Ms Sandberg, Mr Page and Mr Bezos. To his immediate left sat Mr Thiel, followed by Mr Cook and Mr Catz. Mr Schmidt was among tech executives across the table. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, whom Mr Trump plans to nominate as his commerce secretary, also participated. Mr Trump thanked Mr Thiel, perhaps his strongest supporter in Silicon Valley, for helping to organise the meeting, calling him "terrific and so outstanding." During his campaign, Mr Trump criticised US corporations for moving jobs to other countries, and since his election, he has threatened "consequences" for companies that send work offshore. Earlier in the year, he said that he'd aim to get Apple to make its products in the US. Apple has suppliers make most of its products in China; moving that work to the US would likely increase the cost of iPhones and iPads. Some big technology companies made what appeared to be pre-emptive moves ahead of the meeting with Mr Trump. IBM's Ms Rometty unveiled a plan to hire about 25,000 people in the US over the next four years. Apple may back a US$100 billion technology fund that aims to invest about half the money in the US and has pledged to create 50,000 new domestic jobs. Hours before the meeting, Mr Bezos announced Amazon's first delivery of a consumer product by drone to a customer. The test was conducted in England because Amazon says the UK's regulations are less restrictive. Mr Trump has vowed to ease regulations across the government.
