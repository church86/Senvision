Devin Nunes said that he'd seen no evidence of Trump's claims  By Abigail Miller For Dailymail.com Published: 18:43 EDT, 6 May 2017 | Updated: 20:47 EDT, 6 May 2017 e-mail 21 shares 93 View comments Senator Rand Paul has 'formally requested' information from the White House and the intelligence community regarding whether the Obama administration 'surveilled' him during the presidential election. In a tweet on Friday, the former presidential candidate wrote: 'I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!'  Senator Rand Paul has 'formally requested' information from the White House and the intelligence community regarding whether the Obama administration 'surveilled' him during the presidential election In a tweet on Friday, the former presidential candidate wrote: 'I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!' Paul also wrote: 'Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges? Did the Obama admin use warrantless "wiretapping" on other candidates besides @realdonaldtrump?'  His tweets come nearly two months after President Trump tweeted unfounded claims that the White House under former President Barack Obama had ordered phones in Trump Tower to be 'wiretapped' during the 2016 election. Representative Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Community, and a Republican, said that upon reviewing classified intelligence reports from the prior administration, he had seen no evidence supporting Trump's claims that Obama surveilled him, reported AOL News. Paul also wrote: 'Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges? Did the Obama admin use warrantless "wiretapping" on other candidates besides @realdonaldtrump?' Representative Devin Nunes , pictured, the chairman of the House Intelligence Community, and a Republican, said that upon reviewing classified intelligence reports from the prior administration, he had seen no evidence supporting Trump's claims that Obama surveilled him FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers confirmed that assessment in a March hearing before the committee. In his tweets, Paul linked to an article by the publication Circa that claims that, starting in 2011, Americans overseas had their information collected, searched and disseminated by the National Security Agency 'after President Obama loosened privacy protections.' The article cited the Statistical Transparency Report which was published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on May 2.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Was Trump trying to establish a back-channel to Putin... Going to pot: Trump signs $1trillion spending bill... Share this article Share On April 10, the Senator also sent a letter to President Trump, asking him to investigate an 'anonymous' claim that his name was 'unmasked' in intelligence reports collected by Obama's people. In the letter, he cited 'revelations' that people associated with Trump's campaign had their names unmasked by Obama as the reason for a new investigation. Paul's letter came about a week after reports surfaced that Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, tried to learn the identities of officials on Trump's transition team whose conversations with foreign officials were incidentally collected during routine intelligence gathering operations.  Paul's tweets come nearly two months after President Trump tweeted unfounded claims that the White House under former President Barack Obama (pictured in April 2017) had ordered phones in Trump Tower to be 'wiretapped' during the 2016 election On April 10, Senator Paul (pictured in Jan 2017) also sent a letter to President Trump, asking him to investigate an 'anonymous' claim that his name was 'unmasked' in intelligence reports collected by Obama's people The intelligence reports that Rice obtained were 'summaries of monitored conversations,' mostly between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition.  However, in some cases the conversations were direct contact between members of Trump's team and those monitored foreign officials, Bloomberg reported at the time.  Unless Paul or any of his staffers were communicating with monitored foreign agents, it is unlikely that their names would be unmasked by those Obama administration officials who received daily intelligence reports.  Read more: Rand Paul requests information on whether Obama administration was spying on him - AOL News circa.com/politi...

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffTop House Dem calls on Trump to 'forcefully' respond to Macron hack Top Intel Dem: Hacking of French candidate 'a nightmare scenario' Schiff: Yates testimony could come within 'weeks' MORE (D-Calif.) on Saturday called the hacking of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron a "nightmare scenario," citing reports that hackers had leaked a mixture of fake and real documents. A large cache of emails purportedly from Macron's campaign were published online Friday, just two days before the French election. Reuters reported a statement from the Macron campaign saying it had been the target of a “massive and co-ordinated hack.” French officials said Saturday that the leak contained “false information” among the documents. Schiff called this a “dangerous escalation” and warned of its potential consequences. ADVERTISEMENT “Imagine the impact on an election if hackers inserted false information into an email that suggested illegality by a candidate,” Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in his statement. “In France, with Macron’s campaign, that nightmare scenario may be playing out.” The French election commission warned media outlets that publication of the stolen emails could influence Sunday’s vote and said that publication of the hacked documents could be a criminal offense. Macron is leading in the polls a day before Sunday’s election against right-wing National Front candidate Marine Le Pen.  Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

Intel warned Monday of a firmware vulnerability in certain systems that utilize its Active Management Technology (AMT) that could allow an adversary to elevate privileges on a vulnerable system. The flaw (CVE-2017-5689) could allow an attacker to remotely gain access to business PCs or devices and gain full control over systems. Related Posts Researcher: ‘Baseless Assumptions’ Exist About Intel AMT Vulnerability May 3, 2017 , 3:39 pm Intel Patches Nine-Year-Old Critical CPU Vulnerability May 2, 2017 , 9:04 am In its documentation of the flaw released Friday, Embedi said the vulnerability was likely a programmer’s mistake. It dubbed the vulnerability “Silent Bob” because the impacted AMT sub-systems don’t require a password under certain access conditions. “Keep silence when challenged and you’re in,” wrote Embedi researchers. Embedi said adversaries who can gain access to PCs with open ports 16992/16993 can easily bypass authentication. “In other words, an attacker may not have credentials and still be able to use the Intel AMT functionality. Access to ports 16992/16993 are the only requirement to perform a successful attack,” wrote Embedi researchers. Researchers at Tenable said the attack doesn’t require much technical expertise. Using web application security tools such as Burp Suite, Tenable researchers were able confirm the vulnerability by intercepting and manipulating HTTP packets sent between a them and the AMT web server running locally on vulnerable systems. Using specially crafted requests, Tenable was able to access to the AMT interface and gain full control over targeted PCs. “AMT provides the ability to remotely control the computer system even if it’s powered off, but connected to the electricity and network,” Embedi wrote. “The good news is most PCs with AMT running don’t typically expose ports 16992 and 16993 to the internet,” said Anthony Bettini, senior director of software engineering at Tenable. According to Embedi, the date range of Intel systems affected by this vulnerability (version 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6) go from 2010 to 2011. “We really hope by bringing this to light, it will raise awareness about security issues in firmware and avoid possible issues in the future,” warned Embedi. For its part, Intel said it expected computer-makers to make updates available beginning the week of May 8. Computer maker HP Inc., Lenovo and Fujitsu have each announced timelines for fixing for the vulnerability. Intel has also released a downloadable discovery tool that will analyze systems for the flaw. “Until firmware updates are available, systems administrators can take the mitigation steps detailed in the mitigation guide published under our security advisory,” Intel wrote. Embedi was able to find the vulnerability by reverse engineering the AMT firmware and examine the communication between the AMT web server and the remote client. “The age of smart devices is advancing at a rapid pace, we hope that device and firmware developers understand the importance of security because shattering consumer’s confidence is a perilous endeavor,” it wrote. 0Categories: Hacks, Privacy, Vulnerabilities Leave A Comment Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Asus introduces 11.6 inch Apollo Lake laptop (VivoBook E12) 05/05/2017 at 3:30 PM by Brad Linder 2 Comments Asus launched its first laptops with Intel Apollo Lake processors in late 2016. Now the company is adding a few new models to the family, and this time they feature smaller, 11.6 inch displays. The Asus VivoBook E12 E203NA and  VivoBook E12 E203NAH are compact notebooks with low-power Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core or Pentium N4200 quad-core processor options. While pricing hasn’t been revealed yet, they’ll probably both be relatively cheap. Both laptops have the same basic design and features, but there’s one key difference: the E203NA has eMMC flash storage, while the E203NAH has a hard drive. Among other things, that means you get more storage with the Asus VivoBook E203NAH (it’s available with 500GB to 1TB of storage, while the E203NA comes with 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB). But the hard drive model is also a bit thicker and heavier, coming in at 0.82 inches thick and 2.7 pounds, compared with 0.67 inches and 2.2 pounds for the version with flash storage. Both models feature 1366 x 768 pixel displays, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, HDMI, microSD card, and headset jacks, as well as two USB 3.1 Type-A ports and one USB 3.1 Type-C port. Asus says each notebook should be able to get up to 10 hours of battery life, even though the hard drive model has a larger 42 Wh battery, compared with a 38 Whr battery for the thinner, lighter model with eMMC storage. Interestingly, the Asus website also says the notebooks will be available with either Windows 10 Home or Endless OS, which is an Ubuntu-based GNU/Linux operating system initially designed for use in developing markets. thanks anonymous tipster!

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement ECS unveils the “world’s smallest” Apollo Lake mini PC 05/05/2017 at 1:47 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment The latest tiny desktop computer from ECS is a box that looks a bit like an Intel NUC. But the ECS PB01CF is smaller is even smaller than Intel’s little desktop, measuring just 2.8″ x 2.8″ x 1.2″. Under the hood, it sports an Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core processor, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of eMMC storage. ECS says the PB01CF is the “world’s smallest mini PC with Apollo Lake,” and I think the company might be right… for now. One thing to keep in mind about this little PC is that unlike the recently launched ECS Liva ZE, the PB01CF is not fanless. There’s a small fan in the case to help keep the system cool, but it’ll also generate a bit of noise. The computer also features a USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, a micorSD card slot, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, and 802.11ac WiFi. It supports 4K Ultra HD video output and the system supports Windows 10 Home 64-bit software. The PB01CF shows up in both the “Digital Signage” and “System” categories on the ECS website, suggesting that while the little computer is designed to be used in commercial environments, it could also be put to use in other settings. via AnandTech Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "ECS unveils the “world’s smallest” Apollo Lake mini PC" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member 'Ilvee Tidus' Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Why Intel is taking self-driving cars out for a spin Dean Takahashi@deantak May 6, 2017 11:05 AM Above: Kathy Winter is working on self-driving cars at Intel. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Kathy Winter is going to spend a lot of time in the garage. But she’s not a mechanic. Winter is the vice president and general manager of automated driving solutions at Intel. She helped dedicated the new Intel Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif., this week. Intel is engaged with 33 “tier 1” carmakers, and it has alliances with car suppliers such as Delphi. While the company is testing self-driving cars now, it still has a long road ahead. Self-driving cars will have dozens of Lidar, radar, and camera sensors that can generate 45 terabits of data per hour. They will need 5G connectivity, or multiple gigabits per second wireless broadband, to communicate with servers that can help the cars make split-second decisions. The final cars that hit the road are cars are going to need around 15 to 20 teraflops, or 10 to 20 times the computing power that is in cars today. Winter’s job is to help make that happen. Before joining Intel in August 2016, she was an engineering executive at automotive supplier Delphi. This week, I visited Intel’s new Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif., and went for a ride in a self-driving Audi powered by Delphi and Intel. Then I spoke with Winter about the technology. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Yep, that’s a server in the trunk. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: I felt like a normal driver. It shifted lanes more quickly than I might have done, if I were gradually shifting over into a right turn lane, but I’m sure it looked behind and didn’t see anything. I’m never 100 percent confident that there’s nothing behind me. Kathy Winter: It’s interesting you say that. Over time—these cars are very conservative. There’s the whole trust factor. Does it really know? But one thing that’s improved over the last 12 months is the more human-like driving style. It’s programmable. When you think of different OEMs—some vehicles let you put them in sport mode, versus economy mode. It’s sort of like that. They can tune it to be more aggressive or more conservative. VB: On the one hand, having gone for the ride, it seems like self-driving cars are very close. But when I hear about how much data has to be processed, it sounds farther away. Winter: You hit it right. The technology is there. Even on the data center side, when you think about how we think of it—there’s the compute in the car itself. There’s the networking, the connectivity to the cloud, and on up to the data center. Each of those parts of the autonomous driving picture are there today and being worked. Bringing them together is something unique for Intel. We can go to the teams that are experts in 5G, because they’re working on it anyway for things like industrial applications and smart cities. They have a huge data center business. We spend time working with them now on doing the automotive-grade applications. What do you layer on there from a function, safety, temperature perspective — all the things that go along with being in an OEM vehicle for a long time? The things that are pacing it now – the technology is moving along very quickly – are things like regulation, insurance, liability. And especially user acceptance. Is it comfortable? Do you trust it? Getting people, in a much broader way, to experience it so they can trust and believe in the vehicles is going to take real time and effort compared to just the technology itself. VB: It seems like 5G would gate it in some way as well, since you have so much data to transfer. Winter: Today’s vehicles that are out there are built on existing platforms. The amount of data coming out is growing, and it can still be managed with a 4G connection. Maybe you download some of that data when you’re within reach of wi-fi, or you’re even swapping drives today. But when you start to think about the amount of data as you increase to fully autonomous vehicles, that’s a lot of data coming off. Thinking about the resolution of the vision systems, of radar and lidar, continually increasing—that’s data-intensive. And then you bring in HD mapping. You don’t have to have 5G, clearly, to have fully autonomous vehicles, but it brings a lot to the overall solution, to your ability to have big bandwidth going to and from the vehicle, and very little latency or delay. If it’s mission-critical, you want that to happen in a split second. You always have a lot of processing going on in the vehicle, but there are things that we like to—if we see an anomaly or a problem, we send it up to the cloud and alert every other car in the area in a split second. There are applications and ways that 5G will enhance the autonomous vehicle experience. Think about being in there and just riding along. Maybe you want to watch a movie or download something else. You can think of lots of things using the 5G connection that you don’t have to have, but the experience would be so much enhanced. And you’ll have that connection anyway to operate the fleet, to monitor the health of the vehicle, to update HD maps. Once you have that big pipeline in there, you can dream up all kinds of things to use it for. Above: Intel and Delphi show off a self-driving car. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: How much of the expertise has to be inside Intel, versus a Delphi or the car companies? Winter: Today there are the OEMs, as well as the disruptor car companies – Google, Uber, the new players. You have that big group of folks building cars. You still have tier one. The tier one role is getting more and more involved in software as time goes on. It used to be more about mechanically integrating the vehicle and their sensors. In the case of Delphi, they now have a fully automated driving software stack. They’re still a tier one, but it’s morphed past a tier one in a way. At Intel, what we’re trying to do is enable both. We’re providing platforms, whether it’s in the vehicle, and highly optimized, running on Intel architecture, bringing in the modem piece. We don’t run 5G networks, but we can enable that with the modems and the integration with those carriers globally. And then the whole data center piece. The tier one wouldn’t really operate the data center piece. We pull through the system-on-chip, the CPU, the FPGA, the pure hardware play. Then we have the 5G technology and networking play, and then the data center and deep learning at the data center, as we try to improve the algorithms running down in the vehicle. We do work a lot with the OEMs. You see us with BMW, because between us and Mobileye we’re trying to define the state-of-the-art platform that a tier one could help integrate, or another OEM could potentially pick up and drop into their systems. Above: Intel executives dedicate their new Advanced Vehicle Lab in San Jose, Calif. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: The Delphi car didn’t have the big lidar setup on top, right? Winter: No. I can speak to this only because I worked there for five years before I came to Intel in August. There are a couple of different approaches out there. In one approach, you just don’t care what it looks like. Some companies have the huge lidar on top and sensors stuck all over because they’re most concerned about progressing the software and the data piece. There are other approaches, like what Delphi has taken and BMW is very much taking, where they’re asking what a production-intent vehicle would really look like. It’s highly integrated. You’ve done the work to custom-fit the radars and design ways to tuck in the lidar. You put smaller lidar in multiple places, instead of just putting this huge lidar on top. When I think of what a real production vehicle might look like, especially for consumers, that’s where you see BMW and Delphi taking that approach. When I look at some of these projects where they don’t care what it looks like, if you’re offering a ride service, potentially, does the customer care what the car looks like? They just want it to show up. It’s a different business case. But they’re two different approaches to the same problem. VB: Is there a way to figure out how much hardware is going in there from Intel or from all the vendors put together? Just to get an idea of what the cost could be. Winter: Lots of estimates are out there. You have many different sensor configurations. Some rely more on lidar. Some rely more on radar. Some rely more on vision systems. But most will agree that it’s a combination and redundancy that gives you all-weather performance. You have that fail-safe mode. If one system isn’t sure, you have others voting. We’ll add HD mapping as well. You have input coming from multiple places fused together, and you have your software deciding what to do with that information. What’s the next move? It varies from vehicle to vehicle. A lot of why you see all these different pilots that all look a bit different is because everyone is trying to find the optimal balance between different types of sensors. It depends. Today radar has come way down the cost curve. It used to be huge, a couple of thousand dollars, and now they’re very small and inexpensive – a little bigger than a deck of cards, costs a couple of hundred bucks. Lidar today is very large. They’re starting to come down, with the Pucks, but I think they’re still in the thousands. You’re paying $70,000 to $80,000 for the really big ones. We need to see lidar come down that same cost curve and potentially move to solid state. Today they’re mechanical. That’s a failure mode, when you think about putting that kind of mechanical contraption in the car and then it hits a huge pothole. Even without that, they eventually have failure points. Vision systems are another one where there’s a difference of approaches, between experimenting with lots of small, cheap cameras or a few big high-end cameras with tons of software. You see different opinions. It’s tough to zero in on cost because there are different ways to approach the problem. Above: Intel’s self-driving car lab. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: All these acquisitions you guys have done, has that come together to help you? Winter: Absolutely. The biggest one, obviously, is Mobileye. It’s very complementary. Part of why we chose them is because we were working with them for more than a year, side by side on BMW, and also with Delphi. We’re both working on a similar automated driving platform for them as well. We’ve gotten to know them well, their strengths and their expertise. Mobileye brings in the computer vision piece. They’re arguably the best in the industry. They also bring in their REM technology – Road Experience Management. They’re taking all their camera data that they collect for vision systems and saying, “How can we use that to create an overlay on the HD maps? How can we improve that by crowdsourcing from all these cars driving around with vision systems?” Can you use that real-time data to improve maps? If all the cars in the area see that something’s changed, can you fix that? From an Intel perspective—I keep using the word “data.” Camera data, vision data, HD maps. What are you doing with that, moving that information back and forth? It’s very complementary. It plays to our strengths. Those are things that help broaden our overall offering in autonomous driving solutions.

Unveiled during this week’s Autonomous Driving Workshop in San Jose, the new Advanced Vehicle Lab joins existing research bases in Arizona, Oregon, and Germany. They’ve been created, according to the company, for algorithm development and training; researchers will feed information from Intel’s test cars to train AIs and improve machine learning. In November, the chip maker proposed a $250 million investment in self-driving cars, revealing plans to “make fully autonomous driving a reality.” The money will be spent over two years, specifically on the Internet of Things as it related to transportation and technology to minimize risk while improving efficiency. Via Intel Corporation Wednesday’s workshop, meanwhile, highlighted the first fruits of that labor with the unveiling of one of the first highly automated driving (HAD) cars expected from Intel, BMW, and Mobileye later this year. The three companies in July disclosed plans to bring highly and fully autonomous vehicles into production by 2021 via a common platform. “We are now successfully demonstrating that platform and are preparing plans to bring it to market for other OEMs and tier-one suppliers to accelerate their programs,” Doug Davis, general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Solutions Group, wrote in a blog post. Davis, in fact, is so confident in Intel’s future achievements that he postponed his retirement for “the chance to solve one of the most complex technology challenges of our time.” Via Intel Corporation At the heart of autonomous driving is the ability of the car to see, interpret, and act on everything around it. That requires cameras, radar, sonar, GPS, and LIDAR—each of which generate kilobytes of data every second. A single vehicle, Intel warned, can produce 4 terabytes of information a day just from embedded sensors and systems. “The single most important factor in autonomous driving is data—how best to process it, manage it, move it, store it, share it, and learn from it,” Davis said. “As we move down the road toward autonomous cars, the data challenge will become much more complex and require new ways to work with data inside the vehicle, throughout the network, and across the cloud. “It’s important to remember that autonomous driving isn’t a game,” he continued. “When cars are thinking and acting without human intervention, they must be able to do so in a safe and trustworthy way.” In September, Intel Joined the 5G Automotive Association in a bid to define how next-generation cellular networks will talk to connected cars. “The faster we can deliver autonomous driving technology and take humans out of the driver’s seat, the faster we can save lives,” Davis wrote. “It’s that simple—and that important. And I am confident Intel will not only succeed in helping our partners put self-driving cars on the roads, we will do so in the fastest, smartest way possible.” Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Reddit autonomous BMW car Intel Mobileye self-driving vehicle Speak Your Mind More in Tech 05.05.2017 :: 2:15PM EDT :: Stephanie Mlot Tech Google’s Project Sunroof Helps Germans Go Solar Tech 05.05.2017 :: 1:30PM EDT :: Daniel Starkey Tech Google Launches New Phone Cases in Honor of Space Day!

Thanks to Android apps, the OS is only becoming more and more useful too. One of the hardest parts of Chrome OS, though, is picking a machine to run it on. So, let’s take a look at the best Chromebooks you can buy today… The best gifts for Android users NEW FOR MAY: Lenovo Flex 11 Lenovo is no stranger to Chrome OS and for 2017, it’s first notable release for 2017 is the Flex 11. This Chromebook, designed with education in mind, is designed to be affordable and offer an experience ready for Android apps, even though they won’t be enabled out of the box. The Flex 11 is powered by the quad-core MTK 8173C processor clocked at 2.1GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The machine also offers an 11.6-inch 1366×768 IPS touchscreen which is on a 360-degree hinge. The Flex 11 also doesn’t skimp on ports, offering a USB-C port, a full-size USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, and a full-size SD card slot. It also features improved drop resistance and limited water resistance. It also offers a 45 watt-hour battery that should be enough to power it through a full day. This machine is obviously targeted at education, but general consumers can also easily buy it from Lenovo’s website for $279. FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR: Samsung Chromebook Plus The headliner in the Chrome OS market today is the Samsung Chromebook Plus. Samsung’s latest machine is a premium device designed for Android apps that is one of the more well thought-out machines in recent memory. It offers a 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio that comes in at 2400×1600. It’s a very sharp display which looks stunning, and with a responsive touchscreen that can flip all the way around, it makes for a solid tablet replacement. Android apps are enabled out of the box on this one as well, meaning that users can easily use this machine both for tasks in Chrome and in their favorite apps. It also makes Samsung’s embedded stylus possible, with improved functionality through a couple of pre-loaded apps. The Chromebook Plus runs on top of a hexa-core ARM-based chipset developer in collaboration with Google. The OP1 chipset is well optimized for Chrome and Android apps, and it works pretty well on the Plus. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, it makes for a solid experience overall. Samsung has made the decision to go all-in on USB-C on the Chromebook Plus as well, leaving users with two USB-C ports for charging, data transfer, and output. It’s not ideal, but it’s also not a big deal on this sort of machine. Priced at $449, Samsung is certainly going for the higher end of the market, but after using it, I certainly feel it’s worth the asking price. You can pick up the Samsung Chromebook Plus from Amazon (where it’s commonly on sale), the Google Store, Best Buy, and various other retailers. ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA The other big release we’ve seen in 2017 has been the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA. This machine closely rivals the Chromebook Plus with a premium design, but takes a slightly different approach with the overall package. The C302CA offers Android apps (in the beta channel only for now) and was clearly designed with them in mind. The 12.5-inch 1080p touchscreen display is great for using apps, and the 16:9 aspect ratio feels natural when using media applications as well. It also offers an excellent backlit keyboard and all-day battery life, with charging support via the two USB-C ports, which are the only ports found on the machine. ASUS has packed this Chromebook with Intel’s Core m3 chipset, 64GB of storage, and 4GB of RAM. That Intel chipset makes the C302CA a great choice for those who need some extra power, and it works very well. Priced at $499, the C302CA isn’t necessarily for the first time Chromebook buyer, but it’s an excellent option that will become an even better value when Android apps make their way to the stable channel. Retailers such as Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy offer it. HP Chromebook 13 Google’s Chromebook Pixel was easily the best of the best when it comes to Chromebooks, but it’s been long gone. For users who crave a similarly premium experience, the HP Chromebook 13 is an excellent option. It offers a striking design made from premium materials and a solid set of specifications. The Chromebook 13 runs on top of an Intel Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and has a 13.3-inch 3200×1800 IPS display. It also offers 11.5 hours of battery life and two USB-C ports along with full-size USB ports and a B&O enhanced headphone jack. The keyboard is also backlit. Pricing for the HP Chromebook 13 starts at about $500 from retailers such as HP itself, Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, and B&HPhoto. B&H, however, does offer the machine in a few other configurations, maxing out with an Intel Core m7 processor and 16GB of RAM for about $1,000. Acer Chromebook 14 Acer is one of the most popular Chromebook makers, and that’s why it has more than one option on this list. The first, though, is the Acer Chromebook 14. Offering up a metal build, Intel Celeron chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, this is a pretty respectable offering from the company. This is certainly a Chrome OS-first experience, though, as the screen doesn’t flip around, nor does the machine feature a touchscreen for using Android apps (although it will still receive them, eventually). Priced at $299, the Chromebook 14 isn’t a bad deal. It lacks some of the newer perks of modern Chromebooks, like USB-C, but it’s definitely a good choice. It’s available in both silver and gold from retailers such as Amazon. You can learn more in our full review. Acer Chromebook N7 (C731) Education is the biggest market for Chrome OS, and hardware is constantly being released with that in mind. One of the more recent options has been the Acer Chromebook N7, launched back at CES 2017. This machine offers a lot for its $229 price tag, including an Intel Celeron chipset, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and an 11.6-inch IPS touchscreen HD display. Like many other Chromebooks with an education focus, the N7 offers improved durability with drop and water resistance. It unfortunately doesn’t feature USB-C, but does offer up two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, a full-size SD card reader, and, of course, a headphone jack. The Acer Chromebook N7 is available for purchase from Amazon, Newegg, Walmart, and other retailers. Acer R11 If you’re looking to replace your aging Android tablet with a Chromebook, the Acer R11 is a solid option. It’s one of the few Chromebooks on the market today that features Android apps out of the box, and it’s a great showcase for the functionality thanks to the 360-degree hinge. Running on top of an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, the R11 offers a great experience on Chrome OS. Its age causes it to lack thing like USB-C, but it features plenty of full-size USB ports, HDMI, and a full-size SD card slot to make up for that. At $279, it’s a solid machine to pick up. Acer Chromebook 15 If you’re looking for affordability above all else, it doesn’t get much better than the Acer Chromebook 15. Priced at just $199, this machine offers a huge 15.6-inch display (albeit a low-resolution one), a solid keyboard, wide array of ports, and suprisingly good performance. It packs an Intel Celeron chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. It’s a bare bones machine for sure, but it gets the job done. It’s easy to find the 2016 model at Walmart, but if you’re looking for some extra power or a better display, other models are available for purchase on Amazon for an extra $50-$100.

The tweet appears to build off of President Trump's claim, presented without evidence, that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential race. FBI Director James Comey has flatly denied any direct surveillance of the Trump campaign.  ADVERTISEMENT Paul tweeted about his request for information in the context of both Trump's allegations of deliberate surveillance and a recent NSA report stating that the NSA abided by nearly 2,000 requests to unmask names in 2016. The NSA report does not, however, state that the NSA was unmasking names with the hope they would turn out to be specific people. "Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges? Did the Obama admin use warrantless 'wiretapping' on other candidates besides @realDonaldTrump?" Paul wrote in his previous two tweets, both linking to a piece from the news organization Circa requesting documents about unmasked intercepts. Paul has argued that incidental collection of Trump associates' calls with foreign citizens who were themselves under surveillance is "a big deal." Paul and many civil libertarians argue that, since foreign surveillance requires no warrant, Americans caught up in that surveillance are being observed without a warrant.  Foreign, warrantless surveillance is authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which comes up for renewal later this year. Comey has described Section 702 as the "crown jewels" of FBI surveillance tools. Tags Barack Obama Rand Paul   View the discussion thread.

Intel was able to reduce its required pick time per box by 29 percent. By using xPick running on Intel Recon Jet picking processes were were sped up significantly.     ATLANTA, GA, May 06, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Intel piloted the Ubimax Pick-by-Vision solution xPick in its worldwide Distribution Center in Chandler, Arizona (U.S.). Order pickers were equipped with xPick running on Intel Recon Jet Pro Smart Glasses paired with wearable ring scanners. During a two month pilot, similar orders were provided to all operators - order pickers with traditional hand-held scanners and those equipped with Vision Picking Smart Glasses. Vision Picking clearly had an immediate positive impact on picking speed, error rate, employee training requirements and downtime - with minimal ramp-up time, Intel reduced its KPI "pick time per box" by 29 percent. Percy Stocker, COO, Ubimax, points out the benefits over conventional scanner solutions: "Having the relevant information always right in front of the eye combined with intuitive hands-free interaction methods leads to less stress and makes our xPick solution superior to often confusing hand-held scanners". Chelsea Graf, Enterprise Wearables Director, Intel, states: "The real benefit that we got from using Intel Recon Jet and xPick is the fact that workers can be brought in during peak periods and immediately contribute as if they had been trained for a long time". On the very first use without any training, order pickers were already 15 percent faster using Vision Picking compared to the picking process with hand-held scanners. Thanks to hands-free order picking and the intuitive graphical user interface displayed in the field of view of the workers, the picking workflow was significantly accelerated and errors were reduced. Pick confirmations via light-weight barcode ring scanners contributed to both performance increase and improved ergonomics. Workers explicitly emphasized the high wearing comfort of the Intel Recon Jet Pro Smart Glasses, the positive impact of hands-free working and the intuitive usability of xPick. The pilot shows the tremendous optimization potential which exists in today's warehouses which can be unlocked by state-of-the-art Wearable Computing technology. Based on the promising outcomes, Intel is evaluating the further expansion of the xPick solution in its warehouses around the globe. About Ubimax Inc.

Due to the range of models, operating systems and constant updates it can be hard to choose the right system that is going to last. With so much choice just a few clicks away, The Telegraph has broken down some of the main questions you should be asking when making a purchase and selected some of the best laptops, notebooks and Chromebooks you can buy, from the top performers to those which won’t break the bank. What kind of laptop do I need? Even before you get down to the details it helps to know what sort of device you are looking for. Do you need your device for the home or on the move? Will you only use it for email and web browsing? Will you want to stream videos or play video games? For something cheap and portable a smaller Chromebook or laptop with low weight and a screen of around 11 inches would work, such as the Acer Chromebook R11 or the HP Steam 11. Both of these will set you back under £250, although sacrifice power and storage capacity. If you are using your laptop for email, typing documents or using the internet you may only need to spend a few hundred pounds, while you may need to spend a little more to stream videos to a higher quality. For gaming you will need a more powerful device with a quality graphics card. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming is at the cheaper end of the scale for this, more expensive brands can cost thousands of pounds. And if you demand the highest specifications for video or photo editing you may want to look to a powerful MacBook. A number of laptops are now also ‘two-in-one’ devices, that can act as a tablet by detaching from the keyboard. Other laptops also feature touchscreens with stylus pens, such as the Lenovo Yoga Book. Do I want a Windows laptop, MacBook or Chromebook? Current devices broadly run on three different operating systems that run on the three main varieties of laptop: Windows 10 These are some of the most common devices and run Microsoft's Windows operating system. They are able to perform some of the widest ranging tasks and also have the greatest variety in models, brands and pricing. Pros: Commonly used, greatest access to programs and apps, best for gaming Cons: Considered more vulnerable to viruses MacBook The MacBook Pro, MacBook and MacBook Air are all Apple laptops running on macOS. They are generally seen as powerful, smooth and highly reliable. Pros: Best for high performance use of creative software, connectivity to other Apple products and services Cons: Limited access to some programs, expensive Chromebook Google’s ChromeOS used on Chromebooks is largely limited to online use, essentially operating like a web browser. Rather than installing programs users access them through Google's Chome Web Store. They have limited storage capacity, but are fast and inexpensive. Pros: Cheap, fast, user friendly Cons: Largely limited to online use and Google applications Macbook Pro 2016 v Surface Book i7 01:33 Jargon buster | A rough guide to tech terminology How much do I want to spend? The most important consideration to many buyers is cost; a low price doesn't always have to mean sacrificing performance if your laptop can still run the tasks you need. Nowadays you can pick up a cheap laptop or Chromebook for less than £250. You will be quite limited in terms of performance on a laptop, although you could get a decent Chromebook for around that price. For between £500 and £750 you should be expecting at least an Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM or better, which will perform more complicated tasks faster. Spending £1,000 and up you would be looking at a premium product sporting the latest generation of Intel Core i5 or i7 processors. You would want this for high intensity work such as video editing or gaming. A recent price surge from some Apple products and others has pushed more top laptops into this bracket. What else to consider Screen size: Obviously a smaller screen means a smaller laptop, increasing its  portability. Larger screen models will also need high resolution to create the perfect picture, but can be better if you want a more accessible screen or want to open lots of tabs. Weight: If you plan to lug your laptop to classes or work, you may want something that weighs 1.5kg or less. If it is going to sit on your desk most of the day you can always go for a bulkier model, which may be cheaper than a sleek ultrabook. Battery life: If you're going to be using your laptop at your desk for most of the time, battery life will be less of an issue, but if you work on the go or in a coffee shop, you don't want to get caught without power at a crucial moment. Some dedicated gaming laptops may only last four hours when under strain, while ultraportables can manage 12 hours or better. Under £500 Best for Windows on a budget: Acer Swift 3 Credit: Acer Screen: 14 inches Weight: 1.5kg Battery life: 10 hours For a Windows-running performer, the Acer Swift 3 has the feel of a pricier laptop for under £500, with its smooth aluminium case reminiscent of more up-market devices. The most basic model has an Intel i3 processor with an 128GB SSD  and 8GB of RAM, enough for most daily tasks. Other features include a backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner, and the Swift 3 is fairly connection-friendly with HDMI, USB and USB-C. The drawbacks are largely limited to screen brightness. Improved processors will set you back another £250, although that is still great value for a solid device. Pros: Solid Windows Ultrabook at an excellent price Cons: Screen brightness a little low Cost: £499 Buy Now Also consider: Lenovo Yoga 510 2-in-1 (£379) Best for practicality: HP Chromebook 14 Credit: HP Screen: 14 inches Weight: 1.7 kg Battery life: 9.25 hours For a bigger screen Chromebook this HP is a useable device at a reasonable price. The HP Chromebook 14 lacks some of the flashy touch screens of the latest generation, but comes with plenty of practical features including three USB ports, an SD card slot and HDMI connection. In addition, the 1920x1080 screen resolution will provide a crisp, quality picture. This larger Chromebook will easily see you through most routine tasks. Pros: Large screen and practical features Cons: Not the cheapest for a Chromebook Price: £331.98 Buy Now Also consider: Acer Chromebook 15 (£239.99) Best for simple stuff: Acer Chromebook R11 Credit: Acer Screen: 11.6 inches Weight: 1.25 kg Battery life: 12 hours At the cheaper end of the market, the Acer ChromeBook R11 comes in at around £250 and looks good with a crisp white finish and aluminium top panel. The R11 features a stylish touchscreen with 360 degree rotation, although the resolution is a little low at 1366 x 768 pixels it will look fine on the smaller screen. A solid battery life with its slimmer size and portability make this ideal for use on-the-go. Pros: Value offering with flip screen Cons: Low resolution Price: £249.99 Buy Now Also consider: Asus Chromebook Flip (£249.95) Under £1,000 Best for reliability: MacBook Air Credit: Apple Screen: 13.3 inch Weight: 1.35 kg Battery life: 12 hours It has been two years since the last update to the MacBook Air, with many predicting a phase-out due to the launch of the new MacBook Pro in 2016. However, the Air remains the most affordable Apple notebook you can buy, all the more important given recent jumps in Apple prices. Like most Apple products it is known for a battery life that lives up to expectations, in this case around 12 hours. The laptop also still retains traditional USB slots, unlike more recent Apple updates. While it remains a solid buy, it could be undercut by the upcoming Microsoft Surface Laptop (which will be released in June). Pros: The cheapest MacBook you can buy Cons: Aging design Cost: £949 Buy now Also consider: Microsoft Surface Laptop (£979 - pre order) Best Apple alternative: Lenovo IdeaPad 710s Credit: Lenovo Screen: 13.3 inch Weight: 1.1 kg Battery life: 8 hours A rival to the MacBook Air, the Lenovo IdeaPad 710s has been noted for its similarity in design to Apple’s cheapest model, matching its aluminium bodywork . As a cheaper alternative, the IdeaPad 710s now comes in at around £170 cheaper with an Intel Core i5-7200U processor. It is also thinner (at 14mm) and lighter than the Air. With a display that can rotate to 180 degrees it is also flexible, but on battery life it is not as competitive as some other brands. Pros: Good value for a powerful build Cons: Battery life Cost: £849.95 Buy Now Also consider: Asus Zenbook UX310 (£600) Best for gaming for less: Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming Credit: Dell Screen: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.65kg Battery life: Up to 10.5 hours If you are not willing or unable to spend thousands of pounds on a gaming laptop, the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming is a decent backup option. It is not going to outrun the high end machines, but for casual gaming you’ll get the performance you need. The cheapest model comes in at under £1,000, which is a steal for a gaming ready device. The design includes Ethernet, SD, HDMI and USB ports and comes in a smart black and red finish. Pros: The best gaming laptop on a budget Cons: Not for hardcore gamers Cost: £899 Buy now Also consider: MSI GL62 (£849) Best for standing out: Lenovo Yoga Book Credit: Lenovo Screen: 10.1 inch Weight: 0.689 kg Battery life: 15 hours A stunning laptop/tablet hybrid launched last year, the Lenovo Yoga Book features an innovative keyboard and touchpad that stand out from the latest generation of devices. The Yoga Book features no physical keyboard, instead presenting a virtual one which only switches on when you start using it. As well as a touch screen, the Yoga Book pushes itself as a device you can really write on, clipping a notepad over the virtual keyboard sees notes and drawings transmitted onto the main screen. While it's an exciting offering at a low price, the keyboard is considered tricky to get used to, but the overall product is light, portable, and certainly something different. Pros: Innovative design and featherweight Cons: Touchpad keyboard will take some getting used to. Cost: £549  Buy now Money no object Best all-rounder: Dell XPS 13 Credit: Dell Screen: 13.3 inches Weight: 1.29kg Battery life: 13 hours The highly rated Dell XPS 13 is considered the lead challenger to the MacBook Pro. The XPS 13 features a virtually borderless 13.3 inch Infinity Edge display, which is available with touch. Dell also claims the laptop offers up to 22 hours of battery life, although in practice this is more like 12 to 13 hours when streaming video. The latest models also run on Kaby Lake processors, Intel's newest and more powerful seventh generation processor. Without the touch display you could currently pick up the new model for £1,149, but with it included the XPS 13 will set you back £1,279. The main drawback is an awkwardly placed webcam, sitting to the bottom left of the screen. Pros: Top of the range display, superb battery Cons: Awkward webcam placement Cost: £1,149 Buy now Also consider: HP Spectre 13 (£1,149.95) Best for Apple addicts: MacBook Pro Credit: GEOFF PUGH/TELEGRAPH Screen: 13.3 inches Weight: 1.37kg Battery life: 10 hours Coming four years after Apple’s last high-end laptop, the latest MacBook Pro is thinner, more powerful and features innovations not seen on other laptops, such as its 'Touch Bar' and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The Touch Bar offers shortcuts and replacing function keys, but is not supported on many apps just yet. And the new edition has done away with some staple features, dropping support for standard USB sticks and SD cards, meaning you may have to buy new dongles or wires for its USB-C ports. Models with the Touch Bar and fingerprint scanner will also set you back £1,749 compared to £1,499 for the basic 13 inch model. But overall, the new MacBook Pro remains the top performing device for Apple lovers, with a beautiful screen, exquisite 'butterfly' keyboard and easy-to-use trackpad. Pros: High performance, Apple-style keyboard and trackpad Cons: Touch Bar has limited uses, price Price: £1,499 Buy now Also consider: Macbook 12-inch (£1,249) Best for versatility: Microsoft Surface Book Credit: Warren Allott/Daily Telegraph Screen: 13.5 inches Weight: 1.6 kg Battery life: 12 hours Microsoft’s first ever laptop launched in the UK last year and the Surface Book features a detachable 13.5 inch display and highly flexible hinge which gives Microsoft’s "ultimate laptop" the added versatility of a tablet. The Surface Book has Microsoft calls a 'dynamic fulcrum hinge' connecting the keyboard and display to hold the heavier screen in place, since it holds all the parts to operate as a tablet. The keyboard can also hold an optional discrete GPU, or graphics processor, which gives the laptop added power. This does add to the weight and top end price, and the Intel Core i5 model with the discrete GPU costs around £400 more. Pros: Unique design and flexibility Cons: Expensive for top graphics Cost: £1,299 Buy Now Also consider: HP Elite X2 (£1,360.80) Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics MacBook Microsoft Laptops Apple Show more Technology latest 06 May 2017, 7:35pm Panasonic pulls in Japanese experts for help on rail links 06 May 2017, 7:11pm This fund will let you invest in Uber or Spotify before they go public 06 May 2017, 6:01pm Slack's Stewart Butterfield: 'We'll never kill email' Premium Gallery 06 May 2017, 11:04am Gallery: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - All 48 tracks ranked 06 May 2017, 7:00am The Internet of Things: Could it really change the way we live? 05 May 2017, 5:08pm Uber faces criminal investigation over secret Greyball technology 05 May 2017, 4:05pm Plans for extensive Government spying powers revealed in leaked report  05 May 2017, 12:55pm Debenhams Flowers hacked: Credit card details of 26,000 people stolen  Gallery 05 May 2017, 9:44am Gallery: 26 iPhone secrets, shortcuts and hidden features you should know about 05 May 2017, 9:14am This teenager has invented a bra that detects signs of breast cancer 04 May 2017, 9:20pm Comment: Tech and talent must top the next government’s wishlist Jeremy Hand Premium 04 May 2017, 5:27pm Google settles huge £259m tax bill to end criminal investigation into alleged avoidance 04 May 2017, 3:58pm Former tech unicorn Ve Interactive sold for just £2m 04 May 2017, 11:00am How to avoid the Google Docs phishing attack and what to do if you're a victim Gallery 04 May 2017, 9:00am Gallery: Funny Google Street View images 04 May 2017, 8:09am Imagination Technologies opens dispute with Apple over iPhone chip 04 May 2017, 12:11am WhatsApp goes down and social media erupts as millions of users left 'in turmoil' 04 May 2017, 12:03am Spam campaign targets Google users with malicious link 03 May 2017, 10:33pm Facebook approaches 2 billion users 03 May 2017, 6:18pm This tool shows the political parties targeting you on Facebook 03 May 2017, 3:57pm Facebook to hire thousands of people to monitor violent videos Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017

It can be easy to forget that the lion's share of PC displays get their marching orders from the pixel pushers integrated into Intel's ubiquitous mobile and desktop CPUs. The graphics driver update du jour comes from the bunnysuits at Santa Clara and packs support for a couple of new games and fixes for a handful of problems. The Intel Graphics Driver for Windows version 15.45 is out now for the 64-bit flavors of Windows 10 and Windows 7. The driver promises improved performance for Intel Iris graphics processors in Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III and Titanfall 2. Some graphical anomalies should now be gone when playing the pre-alpha of Unreal Tournament or Doom under the Vulkan API, too The release notes also say the new version corrects a problem that would deny a user access to the Steam folder. Intel says that applications should no longer move to the primary monitor after waking from sleep when third-party display EDID overrides are enabled. Streaming 4K Netflix requires a heap of hoop-jumping on PCs, but Kaby Lake systems that meet all the DRM requirements should use a little bit less power when binge-watching Lady Dynamite.

Kentucky senator Rand Paul, apparently concerned that he was under surveillance by the Obama administration, is demanding answers from the intelligence community. “I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!” Paul tweeted Friday morning, providing no evidence for the claim, which appeared to reflect President Donald Trump’s own unfounded claim that both his campaign and Trump Tower were bugged by the Obama White House. It’s not clear whether this is a cry for help or attention, or whether Paul has simply been spending too much time next to Kellyanne Conway’s microwave. His series of tweets linked to a Circa report on N.S.A. surveillance, claiming that the agency collected and “searched” information pertaining to nearly 2,000 Americans abroad in 2016, after loosening privacy protections in 2011. “Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges?” Paul wondered. “Did the Obama admin use warrantless ‘wiretapping’ on other candidates besides @realdonaldtrump?” https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/860462292386938881 https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/860480504168165378 https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/860482401109258242 F.B.I. director James Comey, National Security Agency director Mike Rogers, and Republican House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes have all said that there is no evidence Trump, Trump Tower, or his campaign were ever illegally surveilled. Still, it’s not paranoia if they’re really out to get you. Last month, Paul sent Trump a letter asking him to look into a claim made by an “anonymous source” that Paul’s name was “unmasked” in the intelligence reports collected during the Obama administration. “In light of the revelations that the names of persons associated with the Trump campaign were unmasked,” Paul wrote, “I believe the allegations that myself and other elected members of the legislative branch may have also been unmasked or caught in the intelligence gathering warrants investigation.” Now he wants Trump to conduct a formal investigation to determine whether he and other members of Congress were spied upon. Earlier this year in a Fox News interview, Paul erroneously claimed that “everybody admits that somebody spied on Mike Flynn, and he was part of the Trump campaign. So, it sounds like what the president said has already been proven true.” In fact, reports suggest Flynn was surveilled while communicating with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., as most communications with Russian officials are monitored by the N.S.A. His various attempts to obfuscate those communications ultimately cost him his job.

Why we choose terrible passwords, and how to fix them Megan Squire WEEKEND REVIEW Sunday May 7, 2017 1 Share Play NBR radio on The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorising long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it.

Dan Goodin - May 6, 2017 4:01 pm UTC Enlarge Intel reader comments 88 Share this story A remote hijacking flaw that lurked in Intel chips for seven years was more severe than many people imagined, because it allowed hackers to remotely gain administrative control over huge fleets of computers without entering a password. This is according to technical analyses published Friday. Further ReadingIntel patches remote hijacking vulnerability that lurked in chips for 7 yearsAs Ars reported Monday, the authentication bypass vulnerability resides in a feature known as Active Management Technology. AMT, as it's usually called, allows system administrators to perform a variety of powerful tasks over a remote connection. Among the capabilities: changing the code that boots up computers, accessing the computer's mouse, keyboard, and monitor, loading and executing programs, and remotely powering on computers that are turned off. In short, AMT makes it possible to log into a computer and exercise the same control enjoyed by administrators with physical access. AMT, which is available with many vPro processors, was set up to require a password before it could be remotely accessed over a Web browser interface. But, remarkably, that authentication mechanism can be bypassed by entering any text string—or no text at all. According to a blog post published Friday by Tenable Network Security, the cryptographic hash that the interface's digest access authentication requires to verify someone is authorized to log in can be anything at all, including no string at all. "Authentication still worked" even when the wrong hash was entered, Tenable Director of Reverse Engineering Carlos Perez wrote. "We had discovered a complete bypass of the authentication scheme." A separate technical analysis from Embedi, the security firm Intel credited with first disclosing the vulnerability, arrived at the same conclusion. It stated: With a little help of the local proxy at `127.0.0.1:16992`, which is meant to replace the response with an empty string, we're able to manage the AMT via the regular Web browser as if we've known the *admin* password: ``` GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:16992 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Digest:048A0000000000000000000000000000", nonce="qTILAAUFAAAjY7rDwLSmxFCq5EJ3pH/n",stale="false",qop="auth" Content-Type: text/html Server: AMT Content-Length: 678 Connection: close GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:16992 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="Digest:048A0000000000000000000000000000", nonce="qTILAAUFAAAjY7rDwLSmxFCq5EJ3pH/n", uri="/index.htm", response="", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="60513ab58858482c" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 4 May 2017 16:09:17 GMT Server: AMT Content-Type: text/html Transfer-Encoding: chunked Cache-Control: no cache Expires: Thu, 26 Oct 1995 00:00:00 GMT 04E6 Embedi e-mailed the analysis to reporters, but didn't publish it online. Making matters worse, unauthorized accesses typically aren't logged by the PC because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. When AMT is enabled, all network packets are redirected to the Intel Management Engine and from there to the AMT. The packets bypass the OS completely. The vulnerable management features were made available in some but not all Intel chipsets starting in 2010, Embedi has said. In a blog post published Friday, Intel officials said they expect PC makers to release a patch next week. The releases will update Intel firmware, meaning patching will require that each vulnerable chip set is reflashed. In the meantime, Intel is urging customers to download and run this discovery tool to diagnose potentially vulnerable computers. Systems that test positive should be temporarily secured using this mitigation guide until a patch is supplied. Computer makers Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo, have also issued advisories for specific models they sell. [Update, 5:40pm EDT] A query of the Shodan security search engine found over 8,500 systems with the AMT interface exposed to the Internet, with over 2,000 in the United States alone: Enlarge / One of the hits for the AMT interface on Shodan.

What? I get that security is hard and that sometimes there are unforeseen vulnerabilities. But... you can enter any text as the password, and it accepts it? Did no one at Intel test a wrong password at any point? This isn't a bug, this is outright negligence. The article is a bit confusing regarding this, but no, you can't send an empty password. That's because when a browser does digest authentication it doesn't actually send the password, or even a password hash, to the web server. The browser sends instead a response MD5 hash computed on a string composed of various items, including a variable nonce sent by the server, in addition to the password, for example: response=MD5(MD5(username:realm:password):nonce:MD5(method:digestURI)) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_ac ... entication This means a normal browser would never send an empty response, even when you enter an empty password. It would always send a 32 hex digit MD5 hash looking like this: response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1" The server would then compute the same hash, and compare them. If they are equal, it allows login, if they are different it denies login. The bug was in the code to compare the two strings. It used the strncmp function that compares the first N characters of two strings: strncmp(string1, string2, N) http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strncmp/ And applied it to the computed hash and the hash response received from the browser, with N set to the length of the response received from the browser, so something like: strncmp(computed_hash, response, strlen(response)) So when it compared a real hash generated by a browser it would do something like: strncmp("6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1","d3d4914a43454b159a3fa6f5a91d801d", 32) This would work just fine for hashes sent by the browser, which are always 32 characters in length. Even if the password field is empty, it would compare the two strings, they wouldn't match, and it would reject the empty password or invalid password. So anyone testing this from a browser would find it works perfectly. The problem is what happens if you don't use a browser, but you generate an invalid request manually or using a proxy to alter the response, sending an empty string instead of the 32 character hash. Then the compare code does this: strncmp("6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1","",0) This means the function will compare the first 0 characters between the two strings. So it is equivalent to: strncmp("","",0) Of course, two 0 length strings are equal, so it wrongfully concludes the hashes are equal. What the programmer should have done is check if the hash coming from the browser has the correct length, 32 characters, before attempting to compare the two strings. Or even better, the programmer should have used the proper string comparing function, strcmp, that already does that for you and you don't need to supply a length parameter, like this: strcmp(string1, string2) http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcmp/ 122 posts | registered 9/25/2016 Khuzon Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post The very fact that we're debating if it was the handwork of a 3 letter agency or pure incompetence is a worrying sign of the times were in. But to think that this flaw went on for 7 years... Were they just copying and pasting the AMT code from generation to generation? We're talking about Intel here, the guys who seem to release a new processor with every full moon. It just gives me shivers to think about if this has been exploited in the wild for all these years and if we'd even have known. And what else is out there waiting for us. 13 posts | registered 4/18/2015 MeateaW Ars Centurion jump to post MemberBerry wrote: show nested quotes Quote: But, remarkably, that authentication mechanism can be bypassed by entering any text string—or no text at all.

It means you can relatively trivially reverse the hash the service is expecting by providing just one or two characters each time. With less than an average of 32*17 requests. Authenticate with a single character until it works, therefore you now have the first character of the md5. Once you have all 32 chars you have the md5 to figure out the official password via offline brute forcing or whatever. 217 posts | registered 10/1/2014 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

While the Surface-maker has never acknowledged the existence of such a phone, it has given several hints in the past, including CEO Satya Nadella, who tipped about his plans to manufacture the “ultimate mobile device.” Designer Casmir Valeri has taken this idea and created new concept images on Behance with the long-running rumours, and if the phone is even close to the renders, it surely will take the market by storm. The renders look stunning to say the least. They primarily focus on productivity where the device will function as a multi-touch track-pad for a Windows 10 laptop or desktop located nearby. In lines with the Kindle Oasis, the designer has also created a cover for the smartphone that will double battery life, writes Express. Valeri has also included an additional USB Type-C port. Due to the power of Continuum, the Microsoft Surface Phone could be used both as a smartphone as well as a desktop PC. It will be able to connect to a keyboard and monitor, thereby keeping files and programs in a single device. Microsoft is set to hold the annual developer conference next week, known as Microsoft Build. Fans are expecting that the company will drop a few hints about the device. It will surely unveil the redesigned Windows 10 user interface during the conference. Meanwhile, it is also almost certain that the Redmond company will be launching yet another Surface tablet later in May. It has already sent invites for a Shanghai event, scheduled to be held on May 23. The invite was posted to Instagram by Panay with the hashtag #Surface. This has in turn led to intense speculation that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could also be revealed. However, the device will reportedly be only a minor improvement over its predecessor. To be logical, the mystery hardware could be anything, even a new Surface Book. The Surface Studio PC could also be refreshed. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Surface Phone, Surface Pro 5, Surface Book and other Surface devices.

Photo / Supplied I am sitting in front of a stage today, watching an international sporting spectacle that boasts a magnitude rarely seen in the quiet corner of Oceania. The opponents have been screaming in both the ecstasy of victory, and agony of defeat, and tens of millions of viewers have tuned in from around the world to watch. No, this is not Joseph Parker vs Razvan Cojanu fighting for the WBO world title, this is Esport's Intel Extreme Masters XII in Sydney. Over 10,000 esports fans have filled out Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, many of which are Kiwi, to watch the world's best Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) teams play on a stage usually reserved for the likes of Madonna, Jerry Seinfeld, and The Olympic Basketball Finals. CS:GO is a first-person shooter video game that essentially involves two teams of five battling on a virtual field where one side is 'attacking' and the other 'defending'. Each match consists of a series of rounds, each of which goes for a couple of minutes. In this short space of time, the 'attacking' side needs to destroy the 'defending' side's objective, while the 'defending' side wants to delay this attack until the time runs out. If one team can eliminate the other before the other's win conditions is met, they win the round. 16 rounds wins the game, there are 30 rounds in regulation time. Just like in every sport, CS:GO is filled will competitive drama, gripping stories, and individual stars. The most pressing story at IEM Sydney, will be the recently manifested Astralis and FaZe rivalry. The Danish side Astralis are currently ranked number one in the world, and are set to become one of the greatest teams in the history of the game. However, they recently showed signs of weakness where they lost to the multi-national mix side of FaZe. FaZe, is led by former captain of Astralis, Finn 'Karrigan' Anderson, who will look to take the proverbial CS:GO crown from the same team that kicked him months prior. Narratives like these, at events like IEM Sydney further supports the notion of esports as a major disrupting force in traditional sports and media. The rapid adoption of fibre and advances in computer performance led by companies like Intel, is changing the way millennials consume media and expanding the ways they can actively participate in their new sport of choice.

That's more viewers than the NBA and MLB World Series finals. Independent research by GEMBA in New Zealand found in a comparison with rugby that there are 610,000 gaming fanatics' vs 820,000 in rugby union; with nearly six times more people participating in gaming than rugby. Recently, it was also announced that esports will be included in the Asian Games, an event organised by the Olympic Council of Asia. The E-Blacks, New Zealand's national esports side, will head to Busan, South Korea later this year to represent New Zealand on the international stage. When you consider the rubber stamp of a regional Olympic Council, the fact that twenty-two countries have formally recognised esports as a sport, and the staggering amount of players and viewers, it seems the next logical steps for esports will be the Commonwealth and Olympic games.

Rand Paul (R-KY) on Friday told Breitbart News that several sources have told him that the Obama administration spied on his presidential campaign. “We’ve had several people come to us and say that it happened. I don’t have access to that information, but I’ve been very concerned that too many Americans’ information is being culled through without a warrant,” he told Breitbart News. “I don’t have any facts to say it happened,” he said. “But numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen so I want to search through, find out why I wasn’t notified. Was it on purpose?” “There’s a lot of things to be found out, particularly since we found out that Susan Rice was unmasking people and we need to know was there a political motivation, because one of the real dangers in a free society is if government gets so powerful it’s listening to all of our phone calls, the possibility of extortion, the possibility of blackmail — all of that goes up exponentially,” he said. Earlier in the day, Paul revealed that he had requested information from the White House and the intelligence community on whether he was surveilled by the Obama administration or the intelligence community. I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 In a letter Paul sent to President Trump on April 10, he asked that the administration “promptly investigate” whether his name or the names of other members of Congress, individuals from their staffs or campaigns, were included in queries or searches of database of the intelligence community, or if their identities were unmasked in any intelligence reports or products. Paul said at a CATO Institute speech later that he was sending a new letter Friday morning. “We have several sources telling us that members of the Obama administration were looking at politicians, particularly who were running for office,” he said.  Paul said he has never received a “Gates notification,” which Congress is supposed to receive if the intelligence community reveals the identity of a lawmaker in a National Security Agency intercept.  He said in the new letter, he is asking specifically whether there was a Gates notification for him.  He said he’s heard from people “specific aspects of a private conversation” he had with President Obama. “How’s anybody know that? How did General Flynn’s conversation get reported? They keep using the word incidental. Don’t let that let your guard down. There’s a million Americans having their phone calls recorded incidentally. It’s not just a no big deal to have your phone call recorded,” he said.  “Particularly if someone in the intelligence community uses the media to destroy you…As an American citizen, I’m horrified that his private conversation was leaked. Does the president not have any privacy in who he talks to?”  Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was forced to step down after a private conversation he had with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kisylak was leaked to the Washington Post.  “This is very very worrisome, and what we’ve allowed to happen,” Paul said.  Paul was among several Republican members of Congress who ran for president in 2016. The others were Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Marco Rubio (R-FL). Paul’s query comes after news reports revealed last month that former President Obama’s National Security Adviser Susan Rice had requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officials. She has not denied doing so, only doing anything illegal or “untoward.” Rice on Wednesday denied an invite from Graham to appear before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Monday to testify on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Rice’s lawyer said in a letter that Rice declined after the subcommittee’s Democrat ranking member had notified her that he disagreed with the invite.  Paul told Breitbart News “I think it’s especially egregious if it’s happening to another branch of government, that one branch of government is spying on the other branch of government and you don’t really have checks and balances.” “I can’t for the life of me think of any reason why I would be part of an investigation. And it also goes further to prove that maybe we have an intelligence community run amok if they’re looking at political figures, because I had nothing to do with any of the other things,” he added.

According to Google security developer Matthew Garrett, vulnerable systems that are set up to use AMT and have the feature provisioned by an organization could give an attacker serial console access, allow for arbitrary code execution in the operating system's kernel, or provide a way to boot a hostile operating system over a network. One of the headaches with this vulnerability is figuring out which systems are actually affected. According to Intel, only systems with support for its Active Management Technology, Intel Standard Manageability, and the now-defunct Intel Small Business Technology features have the prerequisites to get owned by the bug. Those technologies are a part of the vPro technology suite for businesses. Intel AMT bug is bad, but your consumer PC probably doesn't even have this option in the firmware, much less the necessary AMT provisioning pic.twitter.com/MTh4MEjQUN — Jeff Kampman (@jkampman_tr) May 5, 2017 Furthermore, those systems would have to be provisioned by a system administrator (i.e. set up) to use AMT, ISM, or SBT for the vulnerability to be exploited remotely. A separate but related vulnerability would allow an attacker to provision an affected system locally and gain privileges on that system, but rule of thumb: once an attacker has local access to your PC, all bets are off anyway. If you're a regular Joe or Jane, there's probably little reason to worry about this exploit on your home PC. Intel's P-series, B-series, H-series, and Z-series consumer chipsets aren't compatible with these remote management features, so they could never be provisioned for remote management in the first place. As far as we're aware, one would need a Q-series motherboard (or other business-friendly chipsets) to be vulnerable to the local provisioning exploit to begin with, and only business PCs that are already provisioned for Intel AMT can be taken advantage of over the network. If you're in a large corporation's IT department, however, we feel for you. With that baseline established, we can look at what is vulnerable. Intel says versions of its manageability firmware ranging back to version 6.0.x are affected. That firmware is associated with AMT-ready versions of Intel's 5-series motherboards, which hosted Lynnfield and Clarkdale Core CPUs back in 2009. The vulnerability is present in all management firmware ranging up to that of the Q270 chipset that can underpin Skylake and Kaby Lake chips. Here's a listing of the vulnerable firmware versions and the updated version that removes the vulnerability for each chipset: PC and component manufacturers are responsible for making these firmware updates available, however, so if a particular OEM is slow to act (or never acts, as the case may be for some older systems), Intel has released a guide users can follow to mitigate the vulnerability on their own. Intel has also released a detection guide and software tool to help IT pros determine whether their systems are vulnerable. The vulnerability was discovered by embedded device security company Embedi. The researchers there have published a whitepaper detailing the exact cause of the bug for those who want the nitty-gritty. If you're a system administrator who uses Intel's AMT or similar technologies with your PCs, we'd be auditing those systems ASAP.

Advantech’s AIMB-242 is not a thin Mini-ITX board like the similarly 6th Gen Skylake-based AIMB-285, but it is billed as “industrial.” Advantech has already released a full-height Skylake Mini-ITX called the AIMB-275. AIMB-242 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) Unlike those models, the AIMB-242 supports quad-core Skylake EQ series with Intel QM170 chipset and a Xeon E3 model with a CM236 chipset. The EQ models include the 2.0GHz, 25W TDP Core i7-6822EQ, as well as the 2.8GHz i7-6820EQ and 2.7GHz i5-6440EQ, both with 45W TDPs. The 2.8GHz, server-class Xeon E3-1515M v5 also has a 45W TDP. The only difference among the different models is that the Xeon supports 0 to 50°C operation while the others top out at 0 to 40°C. In all cases, 0.7m/s air flow is required. (CPU coolers are optional.) The boards also promise ESD level 4 protection. Linux and Windows Embedded Standard 7 are supported, as well as Advantech software APIs and the WISE PaaS/RMM device remote monitoring and management software. Advantech has been claiming WISE PaaS/RMM compatibility with its products for some time now, but only this week did it formally announce availability. AIMB-242 rear I/O view (click image to enlarge) The 170 x 170mm AIMB-242 supports up to 32GB DDR4 2133 via dual sockets, and provides dual SATA 3.0 connectors, as well as an M.2 B-key expansion interface for SSD and 3G. There are also dual mini-PCIe slots, one of which offers mSATA support, and a PCIe x16 interface. Triple display support is provided with dual DisplayPort++ 1.2 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port, all with 4K resolution. You also get dual-channel LVDS, which can be swapped out for eDP. Dual GbE ports are provided, as well as 8x USB 3.0 ports and an internal USB 2.0 connector. The AIMB-242 is further equipped with a coastline RS-232 port and audio jacks, plus an RS-232/422/485 interface, 8-bit GPIO, and a watchdog. Options include various cables and a Mini-ITX chassis with 150W ATX power supply.   Further information The AIMB-242 is available now at an undisclosed price. More information may be found in Advantech’s AIMB-242 announcement and product page.   Related posts: "Thin Mini-ITX" Skylake board has 20mm profile First embedded-focused Skylake Mini-ITX SBCs arrive Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs Fanless Mini-ITX SBC packs high-end Intel Skylake SoCs Stainless steel industrial PC has a Skylake Mini-ITX core Advantech’s first five Apollo Lake SBCs include Mini-ITX,… Industrial focused Mini-ITX board packs Skylake punch Compact fanless SBC runs Linux on Skylake, features 4K video Industrial thin Mini-ITX runs on 7th Gen Intel CPUs Mini-ITX triplets run Fedora on Skylake (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Entertainment Le Musk: AR Rahman, on turning director and choosing VR Le Musk: AR Rahman, on turning director and choosing VR When AR Rahman directs a movie, you know it will be a unique experience. By: Ivinder Gill | Updated: May 7, 2017 2:58 AM AR Rahman with Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR, at the launch of the film Le Musk When AR Rahman directs a movie, you know it will be a unique experience. Le Musk, his first directorial venture, is just that. A virtual reality film, Le Musk uses smell for an enhanced immersive experience. But why an olfactory experience when one would obviously expect a musical from Rahman’s debut venture as a director? “It all began with an informal chat I was having with my wife, who is very fond of perfumes. She suggested that I should make a movie on smell, and somehow the idea took tangible shape.” But why VR? “I have ADD (attention deficit disorder),” reveals Rahman, adding that a short format like VR was just apt for him. Le Musk will be a 10-minute film, with a prelude of three minutes that was showcased at the ‘NAB’, Las Vegas, as part of the Intel-Keynote on April 24. In India, it has been launched in collaboration with PVR Cinemas, which has a newly-opened VR lounge in Noida. The film will also be made available on Samsung smartphones. Rahman says he got a wonderful team full of international artistes and technicians for the film. The olfactory element will be provided by Feelies, a company run by Grace Boyle. Her London-based company has developed technology that will intermittently disperse scent during the film. Incidentally, Grace is the daughter of Hollywood director Danny Boyle, who has worked with Rahman on two films, Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. Rahman won two Oscars for his score in Slumdog Millionaire and the song Jai Ho from the film. You may also like to watch: However, for Le Musk, Rahman is the writer, director and producer. The story of the film revolves around an heiress for whom the smell of musk is a trail that runs from her childhood to adulthood. How she reacts after coming face to face with the ghosts of her past is the storyline. Shot in Rome, the film stars Nora Arnezeder, Guy Burnet, Munirih Jahanpour and Mariam Zohrabyan in lead roles. So is this a gateway for more endeavours as a director for Rahman? He tells us he is already working on an audio-visual presentation that will have an Indian theme. Considering his ‘ADD’, that, too, will be in VR format. Perhaps for the same reason he dismisses the idea of a full-length feature film, saying that’s too tedious for him. Rahman has not thought of exploiting the film commercially, but says his team is working out the financials with the partners the film will be made available to. For him, it has entirely been a creative experience. No Comments.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE U.S. Chairman of Joint Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and Commander of Turkish Armed Forces Gen. Hulusi Akar during Dunford's visit to Turkish capital Ankara. (AA Photo) The official Turkish delegation led by the Commander of Turkish Armed Forces Gen. Hulusi Akar met the U.S. Chairman of Joint Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford on Friday night, Turkish and American officials told Daily Sabah. Gen. Akar, along with Turkey's National Intelligence Agency (MIT) chief Hakan Fidan and presidential spokesman and senior advisor İbrahim Kalin visiting Washington to lay the groundwork for President Tayyip Erdoğan's visit on May 15-16. A spokesman for Gen. Dunford acknowledged that the meeting occurred. "They met yesterday and discussed issues of mutual concern as well as the current security situation in the Middle East, including the campaign to defeat [Daesh]," Navy Captain Greg Hicks said in an email. Turkish officials said Akar and Dunford discussed issues involving Iraq and Syria, and the fight against terrorism. The delegation's main aim is to convince U.S. officials not to partner with the People's Protection Units (YPG) in the upcoming Raqqa offensive due to its extensive ties with the PKK, a terror group designated by Turkey and the U.S. Several media reports suggested that due to its military capabilities and technical advantages, the U.S. Central Command and Pentagon are in favor of YPG forces over the alternative liberation plan proposed by Turkey. Turkish officials say they are concerned about the YPG's expansion from the north to the south in areas of Arab-majority. Turkish officials believe the YPG's presence in Raqqa would further legitimize their claims over Arab lands, and the PKK's role in the fight against Daesh. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ is to join the Turkish delegation on Monday. Bozdağ told Turkish media on Saturday that he was scheduled to meet U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday to discuss the extradition dossier of Fethullah Gülen, a Pennslyvania-based radical cleric who has been accused of leading a terror group that coordinated an attempted coup in Turkey.

Berkeley last summer after a 40-year academic career in computer architecture. He's now a key part of the team behind a critical chip that Google uses for artificial intelligence processing. Without this chip, Google top execs estimated it would have had to double its data centers to support even a limited amount of voice processing. Ari Levy | @levynews 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES David Patterson, former professor at UC Berkeley A year ago the University of California at Berkeley hosted a retirement celebration for David Patterson, who was hanging it up after a 40-year academic career in computer architecture. Patterson encored the event last May with a personal 16-minute history, chronicling his days as a wrestler in high school and college and a math major at UCLA, followed by a job at Hughes Aircraft and four decades at Berkeley. From writing two books with Stanford University's John Hennessy to chairing the Computing Research Association, Patterson told the audience that a key to his success was doing "one big thing at a time." His next big thing could be enormous. Rather than hitting the beach after retirement, Patterson joined Google in July to work on an ambitious new chip that's designed to run at least 10 times faster than today's processors and is sophisticated enough to handle the intensive computations required for artificial intelligence. It's called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), and Patterson has emerged as one of the principal evangelists. He spoke to about 100 students and faculty members at the Berkeley campus on Wednesday, a few days shy of the anniversary of his retirement celebration. "Four years ago they had this worry and it went to the top of the corporation," said Patterson, 69, while sporting a T-shirt for Google Brain, the company's research group. The fear was that if every Android user had three minutes of conversation translated a day using Google's machine learning technology, "we'd have to double our data centers," he said. Source: Google Google’s tensor processing unit or TPU. Google parent Alphabet already spends $10 billion a year on capital expenses, largely tied to data center costs. And now it's addressing what it calls a "renaissance in machine learning." Deep neural networks, or computers that are modeled to learn and get smarter over time as data sets get bigger and more complicated, require big breakthroughs in hardware efficiency. Patterson, who gave the same talk at Stanford on Thursday, was among the lead authors on a report from Google last month on the TPU's performance. The report concluded that the TPU is running 15 to 30 times faster and 30 to 80 times more efficient than contemporary processors from Intel and Nvidia. The paper, written by 75 engineers, will be delivered next month at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture in Toronto. The report was Patterson's debut project at Google. Once a week he treks down to the Mountain View headquarters and twice a week he works at the company's office in San Francisco. He reports to Jeff Dean, an 18-year Google veteran and head of Google Brain. It's not Patterson's first Google gig — he worked there while on academic sabbatical from 2013 to 2014. This time, he joined the TPU project as a distinguished engineer, a year after the chips were first put to use in Google's data centers and just two months after his retirement party. Not really a retirement Patterson has never been one to sit idle. In 2013, while still teaching, he participated in a powerlifting competition — and set a new California state record for his age group. "Now that I think back, there was no evidence for the assumption that he was retiring except that it was called a retirement celebration," said Mark Hill, a PhD student of Patterson's in 1987, and one of the speakers at his party. Hill, who now chairs the computer sciences department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said that in computer architecture Patterson is "on the short list of the great ones of the last half of the 20th century." He called the computer architecture book that Patterson wrote with Hennessy the field's most influential textbook of the last 25 years. Google says the TPU is being tested broadly across the company. It's used for every search query as well as for improving maps and navigation, and it was the technology used to power DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over Go legend Lee Sedol last year in Seoul. show chapters Chamath Palihapitiya: I spent 1½ years trying to find the people who made Google's AI chip    Thursday, 16 Mar 2017 | 10:39 AM ET | 00:38 But don't expect Google to compete in the semiconductor market against the likes of Intel and Nvidia. Outside developers who want the sort of performance that Google's processors can offer have to turn to the company's cloud computing service and products like TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine learning workloads. "They're much better at building tools for themselves than for others," said Chris Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of deep learning start-up Skymind. "They've never really succeeded as a hardware company and I don't see them pursuing that strategy." At least one start-up may be trying to fill in the gaps where Google won't tread. Several engineers from the project have teamed up with investor Chamath Palihapitiya to form a mysterious start-up called Groq. It's still very early days for the TPU. Thus far, the processor has proven effective at what's called inference, or the second phase of deep learning. The first phase is training and — as far as we know — for that Google still counts on off-the-shelf processors. But Google is famous for keeping quiet about its most cutting-edge projects. During his speech at Berkeley, Patterson was asked what's next for his team. He didn't take the bait. Patterson said that one thing he's learned at Google is that, unlike in academia, he's not allowed to talk publicly about future products. "I can say that Google isn't resting," he said. "It seemed like it was a good experience. They didn't give up. Nobody got laid off."

New Microsoft Surface Laptop First Impressions. May 6, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) The new Microsoft Surface Laptop, the American tech company’s first ever laptop was unveiled recently at an event in New York City. The laptop will make its debut on June 15 at the starting price of US$999. As far as the price tag is concerned, Surface Laptop appears to be a budget-friendly deal. Microsoft says that the company with this Windows laptop is focusing more on students as the target audience. But if you look at the Surface Laptop’s specifications, it is an impressive laptop not only for the students, but for professionals as well. Here’s why. A Warm Feeling It is not always about what’s inside a machine, there are a couple of things which are beyond how a laptop works. You will fall in love with Microsoft’s Surface Laptop from the very first moment you will open the lid. There is a common problem in most of the laptops that you can’t open the lid with a single hand. And even you try to do so, the lower part starts leaving the table as it goes up with the lid, so you simply put a thumb on it to prevent. The aluminum finish and strategic design have made all the difference in the Microsoft’s Surface Laptop making it lightweight, 2.76 pounds only. Additionally, alcantara fabric surrounding the trackpad and keys gives a warm feeling. Powerful Specs The basic model of the new Microsoft Surface Laptop comes equipped with Intel’s Core i5 processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB RAM. With high definition resolution of 2256 x 1504 on a 13.5-inch PixelSense display, the display looks similar to Surface Pro 4. The touch display can be used with a stylus and also comes with a built-in keyboard. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop can last long, up to 14.5 hours of video playback, which is pretty groundbreaking aspect a laptop can have. Freedom to Customize From the very beginning of your journey as a buyer, Microsoft doesn’t want to leave any single stone unturned. The company is giving you the ability to choose from four different color options (Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, Platinum, and Graphite Gold) which are absolutely stunning, even rivals can’t deny. You can buy Surface Laptop in latest i5/i7 processor options and can also choose among 4GB, 8GB and 16GB RAM options. Similarly, you get three SSD size options including 128GB, 256GB and 512GB. In terms of software, the new Microsoft Surface Laptop will not disappoint you, as it runs on Windows 10 S. If you prefer using non-Store apps, you can easily switch from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro for free. But remember that this offer will expire as the year ends. As a part of its introductory offer, Microsoft is also giving away one year subscription of the Personal version of highly popular Office 365 software package. The New Microsoft Surface Plus Has the Potential Since the laptop is not going to be available before June 15, you’ll have to wait for the new Microsoft Surface Laptop reviews to get an idea of its performance. Since the specification are giving a solid indication that the Surface Laptop would be a big hit for the company, Microsoft has also planned a masterstroke with the battery life. According to the company its new laptop manages to give 14.5 hours battery backup, it will surely be treated like one of the highly anticipated laptops. There Are Some Drawbacks Too Microsoft revealed that its Windows 10 S will only support Windows Store apps. However, with the Surface Laptop, the company is allowing users to download Pro version of the Windows 10, but that’s for a limited time, more specifically for early birds. Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of the Windows Terry Myerson revealed that the new operating system will support any browser, but there’s a catch. Microsoft won’t allow users to alter the default browser on Windows 10 S and the Google search lovers will also have to settle for Bing search option. Bottom Line If you analyze the competition, the new Microsoft Surface Laptop has everything to stand tall against its rivals. From price to specifications and features, the new Windows laptop has impressed us in many ways. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News? Hit up our Tech Guru at; CoreyS@ThyBlackMan.com.

The weekend has arrived once more, and that means it’s time to pause and catch our breaths, as we look back on another exciting week across the tech world. There were some major announcements, a few juicy rumors, and one or two surprises – and as ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know exactly what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in China, where authorities are apparently preparing to launch an alternative to Wikipedia, bringing together "the biggest, most high-quality author team" in the world. Underneath the obnoxiously large watermark in the image above, you'll see Fitbit's new smartwatch, which was revealed in leaked pictures alongside a new set of Bluetooth earbuds. Qualcomm is reportedly preparing to ask the International Trade Commission to enforce an import ban on iPhones entering the United States. Apple recently stopped paying royalties to some of Qualcomm's partners in China, amid a bitter dispute between the two companies over Qualcomm's licensing fees. Next week, Qualcomm will announce details of its new Snapdragon 660 processor chipset Mobile Platform for upper-mid-range devices. Rival chipmaker Intel finally patched a security vulnerability that has existed in some of its products for almost a decade. An email phishing scam attempted to ensnare users by linking to a shared Google Docs file, which routed users through a legitimate Google sign-in page, before a fake app requested authorization to access their emails. Meanwhile, Google made changes to Gmail's security warnings to offer greater protection against phishing attempts. O2, part of Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, revealed that some of its customers had had their bank accounts accessed by unknown third parties, as the result of a phishing attack combined with a known flaw in the SS7 protocol. A hacker, going by the name 'The Dark Overlord', leaked episodes of the upcoming season of hit Netflix show Orange Is The New Black, after the company ignored demands for a ransom payment. The same hacker claims to have possession of a further 36 unreleased movies and TV shows, and has again threatened to release them online unless a payment is made. Netflix content can now be viewed in 4K via the Microsoft Edge browser or the official Netflix app on Windows 10, thanks to a new preview driver from Nvidia for its GeForce GTX 10xx-series graphics cards. Samsung is hoping to attract more buyers to its Galaxy S8 flagships by offering them a free six-month Netflix subscription, 64GB microSD EVO+ card, and a Clear View Standing Cover. Samsung began rolling out a software fix for red-tinted displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in Europe, and on T-Mobile in the US, but another issue popped up this week, causing some of those devices to randomly reboot. Buyers of LG's new G6 on T-Mobile can now get the device with $150 off, along with a free Google Home speaker and an LG G Pad X 8.0 tablet. LG is reportedly working on a 'G6 mini', which could prove popular among those who prefer a more compact flagship. HTC won't officially unveil its new U 11 flagship until later this month - but thanks to a leak, it seems we now know all of its key specs. OnePlus confirmed that its new Android flagship (gosh, there sure are a lot of flagships these days...) will be called the OnePlus 5, and will launch this summer. The company is skipping over the 'OnePlus 4' moniker as that number is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Google published its latest breakdown of Android usage, revealing that just 0.5% of active devices are running the latest Android release, version 7.1. Android 7.0 is now up to just 6.6%, almost nine months after its rollout began. That long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S6 active on AT&T Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Honor 6X Google released its latest monthly Android security update, and published new factory and OTA images for its supported Nexus and Pixel devices. Details emerged of a new Android tablet in development by Motorola, with a 'premium look and feel', cellular connectivity, and a 'productivity mode', enabling users to pin apps to the nav bar. With Google's latest update to Chrome on Windows, version 58.0.3029.96, users with a 64-bit version of the OS running a 32-bit version of the browser will be automatically migrated to the 64-bit browser, if they have auto-update enabled. Google is getting ready to launch a major redesign of YouTube, including support for a dark theme - and it's got some big names onboard to support its stylish new look. Google and The Raspberry Pi Foundation teamed up to offer a low-cost cardboard kit that makers can use to build their own version of Google Home, including voice control support through the Google Assistant SDK. We've known since November that Amazon is working on a new Echo device, powered by its Alexa digital assistant, featuring a touchscreen and improved speakers - and the first images of that device appeared on Friday. Apple will reportedly unveil its own high-end rival to the Amazon Echo at its Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The new voice-controlled speaker is said to have a cylindrical design, similar to that of the Mac Pro, and - unsurprisingly - will support Apple's Siri digital assistant. Apple published its latest earnings report, revealing details of a very strong quarter for its services business, but a slight decline in iPhone sales, and a big drop in iPad sales. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in US manufacturing, and claimed that it's responsible for creating two million jobs across the country, despite only employing 80,000 people. Kensington released a new fingerprint scanner for PCs, priced at $50. The VeriMark sensor connects to a device via a USB port, and supports Windows Hello and FIDO. Toshiba's new Portégé X30 is a Windows 10 notebook that also supports Windows Hello biometric authentication, and promises enterprise-class security through a range of features, including TPM 2.0, BitLocker Drive Encryption, a Smart Card reader, and more, priced from $1,449. You don't need to spend a fortune to get Windows Hello support, though. The ASUS Transformer Mini is a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet that weighs just 790g with the keyboard attached, and has 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a kickstand similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets. The best bit is the price: it's now available in the US for just $249, including the keyboard and pen. Microsoft is offering some big discounts on its Surface products in the UK. All Surface Pro 4 models are now available with up to 19% off, while Surface Book i7 models (excluding those with the new Performance Base) can now be purchased with up to £665 off, along with free Bowers & Wilkins headphones worth £119.99. Microsoft also introduced its new Surface Arc Mouse, priced at $79.99, and available in three colors. Two of the Arc Mouse colors match those of the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled on Tuesday at an education-focused event in New York City. Unlike previous Surface devices, the Laptop isn't attempting to define a new product category - beneath its (very!) pretty design, it's a surprisingly ordinary notebook, with its only truly distinguishing feature being the Alcantara fabric trim applied to its keyboard area. And while it has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen, the display can't even be pushed back 180-degrees, so if you want to write on its screen, you'll have to do something like this: Here it is. RT @SurfaceProArt @thurrott From a reader at TabletPCReview forums. pic.twitter.com/1f8a71oNth — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) May 4, 2017 The Surface Laptop certainly has premium pricing to match its premium styling - the entry-level model, which has just 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, costs $999, or £979 in the UK. For unexplained reasons, the four color options are only available on one model - the Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD; but in the UK, and other markets, only the silver ("Platinum") color is offered across the entire range. And even though you could be paying up to $2,199 for the range-topping model, you'll still have limited connectivity options: you'll only get one USB 3.0 Type-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's no microSD slot, and no USB-C support either, even though one of Microsoft's own promotional videos showed a Surface Laptop prototype with two USB Type-C ports. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the Surface Laptop to find out more. The Surface Laptop is also the first device to come with the new Windows 10 S edition, previously known as 'Windows 10 Cloud'. Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, offering more security on devices, and limiting the impact of malware and viruses. It should also deliver better battery performance, thanks to restrictions on background tasks and services for apps installed from the Store. It will also prevent users from changing the default browser (Edge) and search engine (Bing). Windows 10 S is primarily intended for the education market, but it still comes pre-installed on the Surface Laptop for consumers, although Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for those who buy the device until the end of the year. Anyone else who wants to upgrade a device that comes with Windows 10 S to the Pro edition will have to pay around $49 to do so. Since Windows 10 S devices can only run apps from the Windows Store, Microsoft also announced that its Office 365 desktop applications are also "coming soon" to the Store. Spotify is coming to the Windows Store as well - but as it will be a simple Desktop Bridge 'conversion' of its existing desktop app, it will only be available for Windows 10 PCs, and not for other devices like phones or the Xbox One. Cloud storage service MEGA will soon launch an app in the Windows Store too, built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform, and available on PCs and phones. By the way, Microsoft has another launch event coming up later this month. The company revealed on Thursday that it "will show the world what's next" at an event in Shanghai on May 23, where it's likely to unveil its new Surface Pro 5. Last weekend, Neowin exclusively revealed that Microsoft is planning to separate development of its Edge web browser from Windows 10 when it releases its next major update to the OS in September. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which is currently rolling out to consumers, is the most recent such update for the OS. This week, Microsoft detailed some of the improvements to Edge that that update includes for IT pros and enterprise admins. Meanwhile, Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains stagnant, while Chrome has increased its share to 63.45% since last month. Microsoft brought its Focused Inbox feature to Outlook 2016, making it available to all users in the Office 365 First Release program - a big step towards rolling it out for everyone. The company also released a new Outlook for Mac Insider Preview to the Fast ring, and finally added Outlook to its Office Insider Program on iOS. Microsoft Teams - the firm's "chat-based workspace" app for Office 365 - got a big update with some handy new features on iOS and Windows 10 Mobile. Last week, when Microsoft published its quarterly earnings report, I pointed out that its phone hardware business is now dead, with negligible revenue, and no new devices coming anytime soon. But Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman went even further this week, effectively declaring that the era of the smartphone is over: "The phone is already dead," he said. "People just haven't realized." Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella had a slightly different take on things, saying: "I'm sure we will make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today." Could he be referring to Westworld-style foldable phones? Well... we can dream - but it's probably best not to get your hopes up. Microsoft is continuing to work on Windows 10 Mobile in a separate 'feature2' branch, having split its development from the main Redstone 3 (RS3) branch a few weeks ago. It released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15210, to the Fast ring on Wednesday. On the same day, Windows 10 build 16188 rolled out to PCs in the Fast ring from the RS3 branch, bringing a range of additions and improvements, including a new Cortana section in the Settings app, new Edge PDF Reader functionality, a better update experience, and more. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. It seems clear that Windows 10 development for PCs is currently proceeding at a far greater pace than for phones. Windows 10 has apparently reached a plateau on Valve's Steam gaming platform, after hitting an all-time high of 51.2% of gamers there last month. Valve announced an overhaul of its gifting system, and revealed a range of improvements to its customer support system. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he believes that Microsoft's first-party studios should be "a beacon of innovation for how our platform is being used". He cited Gears of War 4 as an example of this, with its introduction of cross-play between Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. Gears of War 4 got its latest update this week, with two new maps, multi-GPU support on Windows 10 PCs, and more. Microsoft added five more Xbox 360 games to its list of those playable on the Xbox One through its Backward Compatibility program. That list has been growing fast lately, and it won't be long before it reaches the next milestone of 400 titles. Nearly 11 years after the original game was released, the new Prey made its official debut on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Nvidia's latest GeForce driver update includes optimizations for the game. Sony revealed that it will hold its media briefing at the E3 gaming expo on June 12. Expect to see plenty of exciting announcements there, including a ton of awesome new games. However, Oculus confirmed that it's giving E3 a miss this year - the first time the virtual reality firm will be absent from the show since 2014. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week with the beginning of a new journey across all of time and space. BBC iPlayer - which is exclusively available in the UK - will be streaming a special edition of this week's episode of Doctor Who, featuring immersive 3D binaural audio. But if you're not in the UK (or even if you are), you can enjoy a new Skype game bot developed by BBC Worldwide and Microsoft, in which you can help the Doctor to discover the pieces of the Key of Time, "an ancient and powerful artifact than could decide the fate of the universe". I've suddenly got a craving for some fish fingers and custard... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Microsoft's spotlight was shining on its Surface Laptop this week, but the company also showcased a range of much more affordable PCs, some of which were priced as low as $229. Rich Woods took a closer look at some of those devices, which run Microsoft's new Windows 10 S edition. And Rich also got his paws on LeEco's new Le Pro 3, a flagship-class handset with a Snapdragon 821 processor, at a mid-range price point. Check out his unboxing video, including first impressions of the new device. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. If you're not yet a Neowin member, it's quick, easy and free to register - and you'll also see fewer ads on the site when you're logged in! From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

You’ve gotten through the week of the Google Docs phishing ploy that rocked the world, or at least a vocal corner of the media. Speaking of speaking out, FBI Director James Comey this week gave his most thorough explanation yet of the election-rocking Clinton investigation letter he gave last fall, though it’s unlikely to satisfy critics. Oh, and apps can use your phone’s mic to listen for marketing beacons your ears can’t hear. Fun! In other news, hackers tried to extort Netflix by threatening to put the unreleased, upcoming season of Orange Is the New Black online, a pretty serious miscalculation. Intel fixed a seven-year-old bug that left enterprise machines exposed. Researchers figured out how to hack a 220-pound industrial robot arm, which is how the uprising starts. Fancy Bear continues to hack on Russia’s behalf despite those US sanctions last fall. South Korea’s missile defense system has gone operational, but doesn’t provide as much cover as you’d think. And the US improved on last year’s last-place finish in NATO’s cyber-defense games—but could still maybe use some work. And there’s more. Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but that still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. The Hacker Squad That’s Taking On Casual Dining Chipotle appears to be just the latest food-service victim of a hacker group known as FIN7, or Carbanak Group, according to a report from CyberScoop. The group has previously struck Baja Fresh, Ruby Tuesday’s, and over a dozen other hospitality companies over the past year or so. As is so often the case, a successful phishing email was to blame for the intrusion. The motivation appears to be (surprise!) financial, which at least offers a change of pace from the nation-state shenanigans of recent months. Cloudflare Helps Neo-Nazis Identify Their Online Critics So-called “content deliver networks” like Cloudflare and Akamai are meant to act as the pipes that serve up web sites on behalf of their clients—in theory, without censorship or preference for any political viewpoint. But according to some critics, Cloudflare has taken that free-speech approach too far: It not only hosts abhorrent neo-Nazi websites like the Daily Stormer, a report from Pro Publica points out, but also reports anyone who asks it to stop hosting those sites to the sites’ owners, leading to multiple cases of abuse and retaliation. Although Cloudflare warns anyone who protests its hosting practices that it will alert the controversial site in question, some people who have made those complaints missed the warning. They were then surprised to find that sites like the Daily Stormer, which traffics in vile racist, anti-semitic, and misogynist content, were notified of their identifying details. One man who protested Cloudflare’s hosting of the site, for instance, received dozens of hate-filled messages, and even menacing references to his children. Creator of “Playpen” Child Pornography Dark Web Site Gets 30 Years For the last three years, the child pornography site Playpen has represented both the worst of the dark web and the most controversial methods US law enforcement would resort to in chasing its criminals. After quietly seizing the site’s server in December of 2014 and arresting its Florida-based creator Steven Chase, the FBI continued to run the site for two weeks, using it to indiscriminately hack into the PCs of every visitor to the site. Now, the case at the center of that vast hacking operation has found closure: A North Carolina court on Monday sentenced Chase to 30 years in prison for child pornography charges and engaging in a child exploitation enterprise. Beyond Chase, the case has resulted in close to 900 arrests around the world, the FBI wrote in a statement celebrating Chase’s sentencing, and led to 296 exploited children being identified or rescued. It also demonstrates just how broad the FBI’s hacking powers have become: Withired a single warrant, the bureau can hack thousands of computers around the globe. Hackers Use SS7 Telephony Flaw to Defeat Two-Factor Authentication Security researchers have warned for years that a gaping security hole has persisted at the heart of the global telephony system: Signaling System 7, or SS7, is designed to connect phone calls between phone networks, but can easily be hijacked by any carrier—or carrier impersonator—that decides to maliciously reroute calls. Now cybercriminals have finally cashed in on that long-lingering flaw. The German phone company O2-Telefonica told the Suddeutsche Zeitung this week that hackers had used an SS7 attack to steal the text messages sent to banking customers as part of their two-factor authentication scheme. After planting malware on the victims’ computers to steal their passwords, the hackers also intercepted the one-time codes sent over SMS when the hackers attempted to use those credentials, defeating that phone-based protection measure. The phone companies can’t say they weren’t warned: The technique was presented in 2014 at the Chaos Communication Conference. Last year, hackers demonstrated it again for 60 Minutes, using it to wiretap a Congressman on camera. And we at WIRED warned that the SS7 flaw is another reason you should stop using text messages for authentication. That advice applies now more than ever. Go Back to Top.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 08:01, Sat, May 6, 2017 Surface Phone - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Thu, May 4, 2017 MICROSOFT is believed to be secretly developing a next-generation smartphone – Surface Phone – to launch later this year. Play slideshow CASMIR VALERI • BEHANCE 1 of 10 CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft is working on the "ultimate mobile device" Microsoft is purportedly developing a next-generation smartphone, dubbed Surface Phone. Rumours of the flagship phone have circulated online for years, with the project now believed to be under the supervision of Surface Vice President Panos Panay. Industry sources claim Intel is heavily involved in the smartphone project. The hugely successful chipmaker could help the Surface smartphone realise its plans to bridge the gap between a smartphone and a productive mobile device. Microsoft has never formally acknowledged the existence of a Surface Phone, although it has made several hints. CEO Satya Nadella revealed in an interview last year that Microsoft's next attempt at developing a smartphone would be the "ultimate mobile device". CASMIR VALERI • BEHANCE The latest Surface Phone concept imagines some impressive integration with Windows desktops Designer Casmir Valeri has taken this idea – and run with it. The designer has created a swathe of new concept images around the long-rumoured Surface Phone. And it looks absolutely awesome. The digital renderings focus heavily on productivity, with the Surface Phone able to function as a multi-touch trackpad for a nearby Windows 10 desktop or laptop. Valeri has also created a cover for the Surface Phone that doubles battery life and includes an additional USB-C port, similar to the Kindle Oasis. "Powered by Continuum, Surface Phone is able to transition to a full-fledged desktop PC when equipped with a monitor and keyboard, keeping your files and programs onto one single device," Valeri theorises. It's certainly an interesting idea – and leverages a number of the strengths of the unified Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft holds its annual developer conference, Microsoft Build, next week. Microsoft Surface Laptop REVEALED at Windows 10 S Launch Event Mon, May 1, 2017 Microsoft has unveiled the latest addition to its ever-growing Surface product range – the Surface Laptop. This lightweight ChromeBook competitor ships with an impressive 14.5 hour battery life, free subscription to Office 365 and a touchscreen 13.5-inch LCD display. Play slideshow MICROSOFT 1 of 11 Surface Laptop will challenge ChromeBooks in the education market With any luck, the Redmond-based technology firm will offer some hints into its plans for the mobile market during its keynote. Microsoft is already expected to unveil the long-rumoured Windows 10 user interface redesign during its Build conference. The company has already scheduled a number of keynote presentations about the changes coming to Windows 10's user interface. Renown Microsoft pundit Tom Warren spotted the developer sessions in the Build timetable. Microsoft is going to tease the future of the Windows UI next week at Build pic.twitter.com/RNePHyyGe3— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) May 4, 2017 "Microsoft is going to tease the future of the Windows UI next week at Build," he tweeted. One of the Microsoft Build sessions, entitled What's New in the Microsoft Design Language, does not reveal what will feature in the session, teasing instead that the contents will only be "announced after the Keynote on May 11". That seems like a pretty strong hint Microsoft will take the wraps off its new design during the main Keynote presentation.

The iMac is very capable, yet the tech giant is promising an even more high-performance system. So what can we expect on the upcoming variant? What Apple Has Confirmed So Far Last month, Apple Insider reported that the Cupertino-based company confirmed its development of new iMacs that include a variant catering to professional consumers. Now, that’s not to say that the current lineup is not capable of heavy duty tasks. In fact, even Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering, acknowledged the capabilities of the current iMac. “And now you look at today’s 5K iMac, top configs, it’s incredibly powerful, and a huge fraction of what would’ve traditionally – whether it’s audio editing, video editing, graphics, arts, and so forth – that would’ve previously absolutely required the Mac Pros of old, are being well addressed by iMac.” Even so, Apple believes that it could take the iMac further, leading to the rumored iMac Pro version. This variant will have higher specifications, which will specifically target pro consumers. 2017 iMac Pro Specs We Can Expect Although Apple has yet to reveal the exact configuration of the iMac Pro, leaks already give us an idea of how powerful it could be. According to data obtained by DigiTimes, the high-specced, all-in-one desktop will come with a server-grade Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, which is yet to be released by Intel. The chip will be paired with 16GB to 64GB ECC RAM and the iMac Pro will come with a 2TB NVMe SSD and a latest graphics card, which is unidentified for now. So far, this configuration is looking great. We expect no less from a Pro variant of a highly capable computer. [Image by Apple] The publication also learned that there are two variants in the works: a 21.5-inch and a 27-inch iMac. Both will likely feature the same specs and options. 2017 iMac Pro Release Date Confirmed For This Year We don’t know exactly when the new lineup will be revealed, but we’ve learned from these two reports that the iMac Pro is certainly launching later this year. The reveal is reportedly being planned for the third quarter of 2017 so that it will be widely available once the holiday season comes around. That puts the possible unveiling event to be anytime in July to September, contrary to a popular rumor that states it is coming out in October. This rumor mainly comes from the fact that the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar – and other products – were introduced that month last year. Another rumor states that the iMac Pro could be unveiled during the Worldwide Developers Conference coming this June, though that’s highly unlikely. First of all, Apple is eyeing the second half of 2017 and second, rarely a hardware ever appears at the said event. Other Exciting Features To Expect While we know that the 2017 iMac Pro will indeed be a powerhouse we haven’t seen before in Apple history, we are still in the dark regarding its features. In a previous report by Inquisitr though, it is believed to be coming with an upgraded keyboard with adaptive input. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] What this means, we don’t really know. But the patent for such a keyboard implies that it will be highly similar to the Touch Bar feature of the MacBook Pro 2016. But this contradicts what Apple’s Phil Schiller said in a report by Buzzfeed. According to him, pro consumers aren’t that much interested in talking about touch, which eliminates the possibility of a touchscreen monitor and maybe the Touch Bar. The 2017 iMac Pro specs are looking spectacular, but Apple has yet to confirm these. Stay tuned for more updates, we’ll know more in the coming months.

The suspects' families are denouncing the attack. VPC The bodies of the two men that drove up and starting shooting at a security guard at the Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest at the Curtis Culwell Center are removed from the crime scene in Garland, Texas. (Photo: Mike Stone, EPA) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE The Islamic State claimed responsibility Tuesday for the attack outside a Texas art show showcasing cartoon depictions of the prophet Mohammed, but it was not clear how much involvement the group actually had. A statement read on the group's Al Bayan radio station said that "two soldiers of the caliphate" carried out Sunday's attack, the jihadist monitoring service SITE Intel Group said. If true, the attack would mark the first time the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for an attack on U.S. soil. It was not clear Tuesday if Islamic State leaders had any knowledge of the attack before it took place Sunday night at the Mohammed Art Exhibit event in Garland. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said officials don't know if the Islamic State's claim of responsibility for the attack in Garland, Texas, is legitimate. "This is still under investigation" by the FBI and other agencies, Earnest said. "It's too early to say at this point." Earnest also praised law enforcement officers for their efforts to "foil what appears to be an attempted terrorist attack." A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that authorities had an open investigation into Simpson at the time of the shooting. The official, who was not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators will be studying contacts the men had prior to the shooting, both with associates in the U.S. and abroad, to determine any terror-related ties. The statement from Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, said: "We tell … America that what is coming will be more grievous and more bitter and you will see from the soldiers of the Caliphate what will harm you, God willing," the Associated Press reported. Families of Texas gunmen condemn attack Six arrested in anti-terrorism sweep, latest in a string of such cases The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned the attack as "more insulting to our faith than any cartoon." Police said the suspects drove to a parking lot entrance at at the event site, the Curtis Culwell center in the Dallas suburb of Garland. A patrol car blocked the entrance to the lot, so the men got out of their car and began shooting, Garland police spokesman Joe Harn said. A security guard in the patrol car was wounded in the leg. Police killed the attackers, identified as Phoenix residents Elton Simpson, 30, and Nadir Soofi, 34. The exhibit, hosted by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, featured "images of Islam's prophet, both historic and contemporary, and speeches by leading voices of freedom and internationally renowned free speech advocates," according to a news release from the group. According to Islamic tradition, any physical depiction of the prophet Mohammed — even a respectful one — is considered blasphemous. On April 23, a Minneapolis man who joined the Somalia-based al-Shabad jihadist group called on "brothers" to attack the Texas exhibit, invoking the January bloodbath at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, Minnesota Public Radio reported. "The brothers from the Charlie Hebdo attack did their part. It's time for brothers in the #US to do their part," Mohammed Abdullahi Hassan wrote on Twitter, with a link to the Garland event. Known as Mujahid Miski on social media, Hassan also tweeted photos Amedy Coulibaly, a friend of the Charlie Hebdo killers who attacked a Jewish market in Paris two days later, plus photos of two men from Minneapolis who died carrying out terrorist attacks in Somalia. "If only we had men like these brothers in the #States, our beloved Muhammad would not have been drawn," Hassan tweeted, according to MPR. A Somali leader in Minneapolis told KARE-TV the community was "not surprised" by Hassan's call to arms. "He's very well followed through the social media, very well known," he said, noting that Hassan has changed names often. MPR said Twitter had suspended 31 accounts Hassan opened under different identities. "The real concern we have is that some individuals are buying their messages," he said. "They're listening to them, and that's where the concern is." Relatives of the Texas gunmen expressed bewilderment at the attack. Simpson's family issued a statement calling the attack an "act of senseless violence" and saying family members were "heartbroken and in a state of shock." Simpson is believed to have tweeted several ominous messages before the Garland incident, using the hashtag #texasattack. He was indicted in January 2010 for lying to the FBI in a terrorism investigation when he told federal investigators he had not discussed traveling to Somalia to engage in "violent jihad," federal court papers show. He was convicted a year later and sentenced to three years probation. 2 suspects dead after gunfire at Muhammad exhibit How the Garland, Texas, shootings played out on Twitter Soofi's mother told WFAA-TV in Dallas Fort Worth her son was a passionate defender of Islam -- but in no way violent. Soofi, who left behind an 8-year-old son, owned a carpet-cleaning business, according the Arizona corporate records. He previously owned Cleopatra's Pizza Bistro, a 40-seat restaurant in north Phoenix, that served halal, or Islamically permissible, food. Court records show he was sued twice for allegedly stealing pay-per-view broadcasts of Ultimate Fighting matches and showing them to patrons at the restaurant. He lost the lawsuits by default and was ordered to pay damages of several thousand dollars. "He's not a terrorist. He was kind, he was devoted to his son, and I still can't believe he would try to hurt anybody," his mother said.. "I just can't."

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. Whether you work for a bank, healthcare provider, insurance company or other large organization, your company’s risk management team likely uses a system security product to protect its mainframe and prevent unauthorized access of its applications and data. A common method relies on gathering various available records, such as from SMF, where activities like logging on and off are tracked, along with attempts to access systems, applications and data for which an ID is not authorized. These SMF records are then processed to produce audit reports. However, these types of audit reports—produced by data contained in SMF records, database log files, and other locations—offer limited visibility and exclude critical information about users. Audit reports can’t answer questions about who a user is, what they were doing, when they were doing it, or how they found access to sensitive data in the first place. Without a good view of mainframe activity, what happens when an unauthorized user gets their hands on an authorized user’s credentials and gains unapproved access to sensitive mainframe applications or data? The Threat of Insider Data Breaches In a data breach at Sage, a U.K. provider of business software, an employee gained unauthorized access to internal login data and committed a data breach affecting 200-300 U.K. customers. London police arrested the employee, but the breach and its impacts are virtually indelible from a customer experience standpoint. Insider security breaches like this have escalated to levels that critically damage businesses’ financial outcomes and reputations and now account for 43% of data loss, according to a report from Intel. One study put the worldwide average cost of a data breach at $4 million, an increase from $3.79 million in 2015, with the highest average cost per breach in the U.S. and Germany ($7.01 million and $5 million, respectively). According to IBS Intelligence, data from public databases and government-mandated disclosures indicates data leakage almost doubled between 2014 and 2015. And data from the cloud security software company Bitglass indicates five of the top 20 U.S. banks have experienced a data breach in 2016. “Financial institutions are prime targets for hackers and are rightfully concerned about the threat of cyberattacks, device theft, and malicious insiders,” Bitglass CEO Nat Kausik said. Despite an obvious increase, the threat from insiders is seldom discussed publicly. The media highlights external data breaches but rarely mentions internal risks. Yet, according to a 2016 Cisco study, 47% of respondents say preventing breaches by employees is their top internal security challenge. Is your company prepared to face this challenge? Gain Visibility, Improve Security, Reduce Threats Under the growing risk of insider data breaches, simply collecting and analyzing mainframe log data is not enough. By merely scratching the surface of user activity, you’re letting critical knowledge about mainframe applications and data access fall between the cracks. Rather than relying on security violations and SMF records, which primarily notify you of issues after someone did something they weren’t supposed to, why not collect deeper information on the activities of users and push that information to a reliable SIEM tool like Splunk? Unfortunately, having limited visibility is the reality for many companies. As one large financial institution stated, “We do not have a good view of mainframe activity. This is a huge blind-spot for us. Pushing mainframe info into Splunk would be incredibly valuable.” Monitoring users and capturing their activities can provide visibility into: Who saw the data. What sensitive data a user accessed and what they did with the data. When the data was found. How they gained access to the data. Without this in-depth level of visibility, security teams are left with significant blind spots, forcing them to sift through volumes of false positives looking for actual threats. Deeper insights into mainframe user activity can illuminate other areas that should be of concern as well, such as: Why is a user’s behavior veering toward suspicious? Why is an authorized user looking at masses of particularly sensitive data so often and for so long? Many assume that because the mainframe was built with security in mind, the information residing on it reflects the same level of protection. However, your company’s authorized users can access applications and data that a typical hacker would have trouble getting into. This opens the door for unauthorized users obtaining credentials to access sensitive information without you knowing. By limiting risk management capabilities and only tracking user flows in your mainframe environment, your company could face major consequences. Be it a damaged reputation with customers, or penalties incurred by a failure to comply with tightening government regulations or company security policies. Only with the proper application auditing tool can your company keep a closer eye on what’s going on in its mainframe environment and prevent these detriments.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Transportation Zero Accidents with AVs Isn't Realistic, Mobileye Chairman Says The chairman says that instead of total eradication of traffic-related fatalities, a drastic decline is all that should be expected. by Globes, Tel Aviv, Israel / May 5, 2017 mobileye/blogs (TNS) -- Israeli collision avoidance sensor developer Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) founder and chairman Prof. Amnon Shahua has told "Reuters" that people should not expect autonomous cars to completely eliminate accidents and fatalities. He said, "If the expectation is for zero accidents that isn't realistic." "Reuters" added that Shashua believes society would accept fatalities that are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than with people-driven cars, meaning a decline to as few as 35 fatalities annually in the US from around 35,000 today. Once autonomous driving cars are ready, there will be a period of several years where drivers will still be needed for monitoring purposes, Shashua added. RELATEDSelf-Driving Production to Begin by 2019, Say Delphi, Mobileye How is Volkswagen crowdsourcing road data?Intel Acquires Mobileye, Makes $15 Billion Bet on Self-Driving Vehicles In March, Intel Corp. announced that it is acquiring Mobileye for $15.3 billion and that Shashua would head its newly formed global autonomous driving organization based in Jerusalem. Shashua told "Reuters" that fully automated cars are not expected until at least 2021 but he sees income being generated in the immediate future from semi-autonomous driving features, which will nevertheless require drivers to remain alert. "We can enable hands-free driving to levels that are much higher than with any sensor," he said. Current systems will be enhanced by Mobileye's mapping technology. The Israeli company's "Roadbook" high-definition maps will be built into cars and will crowdsource data, presumably like Waze, in order to provide real-time traffic updates. Mobileye has already agreed mapping technology deals with Nissan, Volkswagen and BMW and Shashua told "Reuters" that four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program. "We hope to have the majority of these four signed by the end of 2017," he said. "Only car manufacturers can contribute ... because they have the cars. This is something that truly separates the car industry from the tech players." Shashua expects "meaningful" revenue from "Roadbook" although he declined to speculate on numbers. ©2017 the Globes (Tel Aviv, Israel) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) demanded more information about allegations that former President Obama might have surveilled other Republican campaigns during the 2016 election. Paul was a presidential candidate in that year. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) 93 Follow Share Tweet Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is demanded to know Friday if the Obama administration had surveillance ordered on his campaign not for legal reasons, but out of political motivations. He made the demands after reports that the Obama administration might have surveilled other campaigns in the 2016 presidential election. Paul tweeted, “We need to know was there a political motivation!” with a link to an interview he had with Breitbart News. We need to know was there a political motivation! https://t.co/9qjDzrdUKq — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 “We’ve had several people come to us and say that it happened,” he told Breitbart News. “I don’t have access to that information, but I’ve been very concerned that too many Americans’ information is being culled through without a warrant.” “I don’t have any facts to say it happened. But numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen so I want to search through, find out why I wasn’t notified,” he added. “Was it on purpose?” Earlier Friday Paul said that he had requested from the White House and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees information on whether he had been surveilled by the Obama administration. I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 He also posted the original story from Circa outlining the claim that thousands of Americans had been surveilled in 2016. “Did the Obama admin use warrantless ‘wiretapping’ on other candidates” besides Donald Trump, he asked. During his final year in office, President Obama’s team significantly expanded efforts to search National Security Agency intercepts for information about Americans, distributing thousands of intelligence reports across government with the unredacted names of U.S. residents during the midst of a divisive 2016 presidential election. Circa is requesting the Trump administration release information that relates to the spike in surveillance during 2016. Circa has formally requested that the Trump administration declassify records showing how often government officials have searched National Security Agency intercepts for intelligence on U.S. presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, federal judges and doctors and how often such Americans had their identities unmasked by the intelligence community after Barack Obama made it easier to do so in 2011. President Trump had made the claim that his campaign was surveilled by former President Obama during the 2016 election at Trump Tower. Detractors said that if members of his team were surveilled under FISA regulations (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), then that would have meant there was credible evidence of collusion with Russia in order to obtain warrants. Both accusations are currently being investigated by intelligence committees in the House and in the Senate.

The day before France's most momentous presidential election in recent history, authorities were still investigating the "massive and coordinated piracy action" that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron reported just minutes before the campaign's official end on Friday (May 5) night. The data dump, the Macron campaign said, involved thousands of non-incriminating emails and other internal communications - some of which, the campaign insisted, were fake. In a year of populist upheaval, this was the nightmare scenario for many observers, immediately reminiscent of the American election - in which, as US intelligence agencies recently concluded, Russian President Vladimir Putin commissioned an "influence campaign" to benefit Mr Donald Trump. The identity of the hacker remains unconfirmed, but the parallels were clear enough in Paris and Washington: Mr Macron, an independent centrist candidate and staunch defender of the European Union, is facing off against Ms Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist whose party has relied on Russian banks in the past and who favours pivoting France's foreign policy toward the Kremlin. In March, Ms Le Pen met personally with Putin on a visit to Moscow. "Intervening in the last hour of the official campaign, this operation is obviously a democratic destabilization, as has already been seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign," the Macron campaign said, stopping short of assigning blame. The sentiment was echoed across the Atlantic, with Rep Adam Schiff (California), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warning that the hacking, if successful, "would represent yet another dangerous escalation of cyberinterference in a Western nation's democracy." But amid France's government-mandated day of silence that always precedes election day - when candidates are strictly prohibited from campaigning in any way - the impact of the leaks on the election remained to be seen. In the French press, the leaks received comparatively little coverage: In keeping with French campaign law, reporting on the emails' contents could result in criminal charges. On Saturday, France's electoral commission urged journalists and media organisations to heed "the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election" itself. Mr Ben Nimmo, a research fellow with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said in an interview that enthusiasm for the leaks was scarcely discernible beyond the far-right, pro-Le Pen online circles that had circulated them in the first place. "It doesn't seem at this stage that there are lots of high-profile non-Le Pen accounts jumping in and spreading the message around," he said of social-media patterns surrounding the leaks. "They have kept their constituency - and they have galvanized their constituency - but they haven't necessarily stepped outside of that constituency." Most French voters interviewed on the streets of the capital the day before the vote shrugged off the hack. The stakes are much too high to be bothered by compromising internal campaign documents, they said. Mr Paul Lotere, a 29-year-old civil servant, said he was most upset that Mr Macron had no chance to respond given the strict campaign curfew. He plans to vote for the former finance and economy minister and said he has no interest in the documents until their veracity is confirmed. "Ah, yes, 'hashtag Macron leaks,'" sneered Mr Alain Chappotteau, a 51-year-old psychologist, repeating the Twitter tagline popularizing the news. "With all the fuss, all the tricks, in this campaign, what's one more? I'm voting for my child's future. This doesn't matter." Although the hacker remained unknown, Mr Nimmo said, the social-media campaign following the Macron data dump originated in the United States, in a well-known network of alt-right Twitter accounts. The #MacronLeaks Twitter storm - notably in English, not French - largely began with the account of Jack Posobiec, a Washington-based correspondent for the alt-right website TheRebel.media, Mr Nimmo said. Posobiec has written that he served, in 2016, as "Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organisation in the US," according to an article Mr Nimmo wrote on the Macron case. From there, Mr Nimmo said, news of the Macron leaks - allegedly containing details of offshore accounts and tax evasion - was retweeted by Mr William Craddick, another alt-right activist known to have spread in December a fake news story about German Chancellor Angela Merkel tolerating Islamic State terrorists to deploy an EU "army" to subdue her country's neighbors. Eventually, Mr Nimmo added, the leaks began to be retweeted by well-known National Front accounts - reaching 47,000 tweets in just three hours. Despite France's strict prohibition on campaigning after the deadline, the National Front's deputy leader Florian Philippot tweeted early Saturday morning: "Will #Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?" For months now, Ms Le Pen has also received exceedingly positive coverage in Russian state media. Meanwhile, those news outlets have pilloried Macron, accusing him of being secretly gay and of embezzling public funds. To date, most of those rumours seem to have had little effect on French voters. Throughout the election, Mr Macron has frequently said that his campaign has been the target of Russian meddling, though the Kremlin has repeatedly denied those accusations. In a report issued last month, researchers at the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro linked intrusions into the Macron campaign's online network to Russian hackers operating as an arm of Kremlin intelligence. The Tokyo-based firm said it was the same group - known variously as Pawn Storm, APT28 and Fancy Bear - that hacked the Democratic National Committee and officials tied to Mrs Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for president. In the specific case of the leaked documents, a Russian connection was not immediately identified. But according to analysis conducted by Flashpoint Intel, a digital risk firm, "it appears to be linked to the Russian state-sponsored campaign by APT28." Mr Nicolas Vanderbiest, an expert on social-media information dissemination and the author of the well-known blog "Reputatio Lab," said in an interview that there were significant connections in the Twitter storm following the leaks to accounts linked to Sputnik and Russia Today. In a paper published several weeks ago, he studied many of these accounts, some 40 per cent of which were involved with spreading the news about the Macron scandal early Saturday, he said. In any case, analysts say, the French government has taken the threat of cybersecurity in the election very seriously. In March, for instance, France's National Cybersecurity Agency said that there was "an extremely high risk" of cyberattacks and hacking of the country's electoral process, which prompted the government to suspend electronic voting this year for French citizens overseas. Mr Alexander Klimburg, an expert on cyberwarfare at The Hague Centre for Security Studies who has been in regular contact with French civil service officers, said he believes the French government is sufficiently prepared for Russian cyberattacks, especially after Russian hackers nearly destroyed a French television network, TV5Monde, almost exactly two years ago. "The sense was, 'If this happens again, we're going to be ready,' " Mr Klimburg said. "I expect there to be a massive escalation in the covert information environment." Polls show Mr Macron, a former investment banker and Socialist finance minister, with a considerable lead over Ms Le Pen, at 63 per cent to 37 per cent of the vote, according to the latest analysis from the Ipsos firm, released Friday. For many, the hacking and subsequent data dump represented a desperate, last-dash attempt to thwart Mr Macron's considerable lead in the polls - a lead that has actually grown in the final days of the campaign. "It's so obvious, and you can make all the connections so easily," said Mr Vanderbiest. "It's very amateur."   Related Stories:  42463721.1_42468856_-_06_05_2017_-_france-election_.jpg Related Story 10 defining moments in France's rollercoaster election france_voters.jpg Related Story French election: What you need to know 42468857_-_06_05_2017_-_files-combo-france2017-vote.jpg Related Story Macron, Le Pen face off as France elects president 42432888_-_03_05_2017_-_france2017-vote-posters-feature.jpg Related Story US far-right activists, WikiLeaks and bots help amplify Macron leaks: Researchers print1.jpg Related Story Macron campaign targeted in 'massive' hack ST_20170507_FRANCE07PNQO_3125105.jpg Related Story France decides st_20170507_france07q6ri_3124843.jpg Related Story Hacking attack similar to that in US election: Macron team print4.jpg Related Story Emmanuel Macron set to win but political turmoil likely to haunt France candidates-thumbnail.png Related Story Interactive: Meet the candidates for the French presidency frenchelection.png Related Story France Votes: Follow the action French presidential rivals clash in crucial TV debate Related Story Best quotes from Macron v Le Pen French presidential debate ST_20170504_WOWIN04NEW_3118721.jpg Related Story How Marine Le Pen could win the French election marine.jpg Related Story Parties in France unite against Le Pen ST_20170430_LADY30YTN9_3110639.jpg Related Story French First Ladies who were in the spotlight ST_20170425_VNMARCRON55_3098103.jpg Related Story From Macron's teacher to France's next first lady?

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Lenovo IdeaPad 720S 14″ laptop with slim-bezels, NVIDIA graphics leaks 05/05/2017 at 4:30 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments The Lenovo IdeaPad 720S is a 3.5 pound laptop that’s about the size of a small 13 inch laptop, but which has a 14 inch display, thanks to slim bezels around the screen. Sure, companies like Dell have been using slim bezels to stuff big screens into small laptops for a few years, but Lenovo’s latest model has a few unusual features for a laptop in this category, including NVIDIA graphics and a webcam that’s not horribly placed. There’s just one small catch: Lenovo hasn’t officially announced the laptop yet. Several stores are showing product pages for the Lenovo IdeaPad 720S, including TigerDirect and Newegg. But the laptop’s not actually in stock at any of those stores yet. Features for the IdeaPad 720S-14IKB include a 14 inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel IPS display, an intel Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of PCIe solid state storage, a backlit keyboard, 802.ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, and up to 8 hours of battery life from a 56 Wh battery. The notebook has a Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and headset jacks, and an SD card reader as well as a fingerprint sensor. Oh, and it also have NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics. Sure, that graphics card is a generation old at this point, but it should still provide substantially more GPU power than you’d get from the integrated Intel HD graphics alone… and my understanding is that GeForce 900 series graphics cards are cheaper and less power-hungry than their GeForce 10 series counterparts which is why they’re still showing up in some portable notebooks like the Lenovo IdeaPad 720S. via WinFuture.de Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Lenovo IdeaPad 720S 14″ laptop with slim-bezels, NVIDIA graphics leaks" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member JP Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Warren Buffett admits he missed the boat on investing in two of today's most successful tech companies: Google and Amazon. Both are among the largest companies in the world today. Buffett said he should have known early on that Google was going places. He remembered that Berkshire subsidiary Geico was paying $10 or $11 to Google every time someone clicked on an ad. He admitted to being amazed that the business was able to make additional money with no incremental cost. But he still didn't buy the stock. "I blew it," he lamented, while speaking to tens of thousands of shareholders who had congregated in Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder on Saturday. Buffett admitted he had the intel to understand Google's potential for growth early on. Along with Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, Buffett roundly praised Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Munger called him "a different species." "We missed it entirely. We never owned a share of Amazon," Buffett said. Berkshire's two major tech holdings are Apple and IBM. Earlier this week, Buffett announced that Berkshire Hathaway had dumped about a third of its IBM stock. It's the company's largest shareholder. "I thought it would do much better," Buffett admitted on Saturday. But he held that Apple and IBM are two very different companies, with Apple maintaining a focus on consumer products. Apple, which Buffett scooped up last year, accounts for about 5.5% of Berkshire's portfolio. -- CNN's Poppy Harlow contributed reporting. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Company Teases ‘What’s Next’ Gadgets 0 0 0 May 6, 2017 Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date Set For May 23? Company Teases ‘What’s Next’ Erika Miranda The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date has yet to be announced but people now believe that the highly anticipated device is “what’s next” based on a teaser from the tech firm. The Washington-based company seems to be taking its time in revealing details about the follow-up to the ultrathin tablet-laptop hybrid Surface Pro 4 which may be why people are taking every single announcement they make to be of significance. In fact, Tech Times has led people to believe that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date was already revealed without actually revealing it. Doesn’t make sense? It will in a bit. According to the outlet, Microsoft teased fans about an event happening in Shanghai which is set for May 23, 2017. “On May 23 in Shanghai, Microsoft will show the world what’s next.” The teaser then went on to order enthusiasts to check the site “for updates and more information,” which had people at the edge of their seats once again. Fortunately, Tech Times provided us a couple of compelling evidence that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will finally be unveiled at the said date. According to the outlet, several reports related to the company are actually Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date clues in disguise. Case in point, Microsoft Vice President Yusuf Mehdi told Bloomberg that “an update to Surface Pro 4” is “coming soon.” While this was first taken as a revelation about a Surface Pro 4 refresh, Tech Times strongly believes that the update is actually its successor, the Surface Pro 5. On top of that, Windows Central confirmed to the outlet that the May 23 event “will indeed unveil new hardware” and will be graced by Microsoft’s corporate VP of devices Panos Panay who “takes care of all things related to Windows 10 hardware.” See you in Shanghai. May 23. #MicrosoftEvent #Surface https://t.co/aMgvkkqE52 pic.twitter.com/vzcK9MqIpf — Panos Panay (@panos_panay) May 5, 2017 BGR echoes Tech Times’ idea, adding that Panay’s presence in the event “is also a hint that something Surfacey should be announced,” describing the Microsoft VP in the aptest terms possible. “After all, Panay is the overexcited guru of all things Windows 10 hardware at Microsoft.” Still, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date has not been directly revealed which is why it would be best to take things with a grain of salt. On that note, here are some of the rumored specs and features that will make the Surface Pro 5 a worthy upgrade from the Surface Pro 4. According to a previous report from Tech Times, the new Surface Pro is rumored to be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, a significant “spec bump” from the Surface Pro 4’s Skylake. #Microsoft To Launch A New #surface Laptop Ahead Of #SurfacePro5 That Will Compete Google's #chromebook https://t.co/zQGq2CLkCY #tech — Russ Ogi (@Russ_Ogi) April 25, 2017 The Surface Pro 5 is also speculated be a top contender for 2017’s best tablets—should it be released this year—as it is rumored to have a 4K display, a massive 512 GB of internal storage, and an even more impressive 16 GB RAM. On top of that, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to be paired with more awesome accessories including the rumored rechargeable Surface Pen. Apparently, the Washington-based company’s patent request has leaked and posted in Patently Mobile, giving us the knowledge about the rechargeable Surface Pen and its charging dock. Other Surface Pro 5-releated rumors also indicate a dual display feature that will divide the tablet in two: 1) the regular high-resolution screen; and 2) the speculated e-ink display that might be able to serve as a virtual keyboard. Past rumors about the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date speculated the unveiling in the second half of 2017 but if the recent event announcement in Shanghai is to be considered, the release should be in the second half of May.

Corazon Victorino International Business Times May 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Microsoft could be launching the Surface Pro 5 this month if a new report is to be believed. The Redmond giant is preparing for a hardware launch event later this month. Despite not giving out details on what products it will launch, there are already speculations that the Surface Pro 4 successor could be one of them.  According to a recent Business Insider report, Microsoft has already issued invitations for an event it is planning to hold in Shanghai on May 23. The news site then took Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay’s recent Instagram post as a hint to what the company will be showcasing at the event. Panay posted a picture of Shanghai and used the hashtag #Surface to tease fans on why they should watch out for the launch event. Microsoft has previously confirmed to the Verge that it will be introducing new hardware at the upcoming event. Given Panay’s post, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that a new Surface device will be the highlight of the public gathering. There are already speculations that Microsoft is revealing the Surface Pro 5 soon, so Business Insider is betting that the big reveal would be that of the highly anticipated tablet hybrid.  READ: Microsoft testing application that will defend Edge browser from malware Although it’s very likely that the Surface Pro 5 would be unveiled at the Shanghai event, there is still a possibility that the mystery hardware could be something else. On Panay’s post, fans are sharing their thoughts on what could Microsoft be launching at this time of the year. Many are guessing that the tech giant could be finally introducing the long-rumored Surface Phone. There are also fans asking for Surface Book 2, a new Surface Pro tablet and even an 8-inch Surface tablet.  Should Microsoft push through with launching the Surface Pro 5,  the tech industry already has an idea on what to expect from the new tablet-laptop hybrid. In early April, award-winning tech journalist Paul Thurrott said that there’s “nothing dramatic” about the upcoming Surface Pro device. This was then taken by the Verge as a clue to the upgraded components of the device instead of a refreshed design. One change that Thurrott confirmed was the switch to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. He also mentioned that the Surface power connector will be retained.  Interestingly, it’s a bit odd that Microsoft would launch another computer-like device so soon. Just early this week, the company introduced to the world the Surface Laptop, the Redmond giant’s rival product for Apple’s MacBook. The device is also seen as a Chromebook killer because of its Windows 10 S OS. However, the expensive price tag of the laptop is obviously no match for the Chromebooks in terms of practicality.  READ: Where to buy Microsoft Surface Arc Mouse Nevertheless, a Surface Pro upgrade is also very much needed at this point considering that the Surface Pro 4 is already showing its age. If Microsoft wants to remain competitive this year, it needs to step up its game because Windows PC manufacturers are also releasing their Surface clones. It’s also about time for Microsoft to update its non-Pro Surface tablet line. Now that it has a new lightweight version of Windows 10, it’s definitely a good idea to introduce a Surface 3 successor.  Microsoft More Microsoft is prepping for a hardware launch event wherein the tech giant is very likely to unveil the Surface Pro 5.

The legendry music composer, who has now donned director's hat for an international Virtual Reality feature 'Le Musk,' while speaking to ANI, said, he's as excited about his directorial debut, as he was for 'Roja.' "There is lot of parallels from my first movie to this. Exactly the same feeling I'm having that I had when I was doing 'Roja' more than two decades back. Though, now we had much more support, that time it was just Mani Ratnam and my family," the music maestro said, during a candid conversation, here. Rahman recently launched the prelude of his directional debut, the world's first cinematic Virtual Reality immersive narratives. The India prelude of 'Le Musk' comes after being showcased at the 'NAB', Las Vegas, as part of the Intel-Keynote. Talking about the film, he said, "'Le Musk' is an experiment and I am just waiting for more reactions. We had a lot of kind reactions from 'NAB', Las Vegas." Adding, "Feelings are mixed because it's such a new technology. Not about the content but the way people are going to experience VR, putting the headset. It's going to take some time for people to get used to that stuff." Shot in picturesque Rome, the film follows the journey of an orphaned heiress and part-time musician, Juliet, who grows up to be a diva on a mission. Written, directed and scored by A.R. Rahman, the film stars Nora Arnezeder, Guy Burnet, Munirih Jahanpour and Mariam Zohrabyan in lead roles.

Music maestro A.R. Rahman is the latest addition to the list! Speaking on the same, Rahman, who has recently donned the director's hat for world's first Virtual Reality (VR) Multisensory episodic feature film 'Le Musk,' said, "I just feel that you can do anything. You just have to delve into it; you just have to lean into it. It's not that anything belongs to anyone. Anyone can become anything." "You can see directors becoming composers and composers becoming directors. It's just how sincere I am. I should not cheat. I should be honest to my job. I should excel in it. It goes for everyone," the composer added, while addressing the media here yesterday, at the launch of an exclusive India prelude of his directorial debut. The India prelude of 'Le Musk' comes after being showcased at the 'NAB', Las Vegas, as part of the Intel-Keynote on April 24. The experience of scent, motion, spacial sound and visuals amalgamated together to give the viewer a stereosmokic effect on the Voyager chair, specially designed by Postiron.

Shot in picturesque Rome, the film follows the journey of an orphaned heiress and part-time musician, Juliet, who grows up to be a diva on a mission. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she receives an anonymous message, which brings back her mysterious past.

The Redmond giant is preparing for a hardware launch event later this month. Despite not giving out details on what products it will launch, there are already speculations that the Surface Pro 4 successor could be one of them.  According to a recent Business Insider report, Microsoft has already issued invitations for an event it is planning to hold in Shanghai on May 23. The news site then took Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay’s recent Instagram post as a hint to what the company will be showcasing at the event. Panay posted a picture of Shanghai and used the hashtag #Surface to tease fans on why they should watch out for the launch event. Microsoft has previously confirmed to the Verge that it will be introducing new hardware at the upcoming event. Given Panay’s post, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that a new Surface device will be the highlight of the public gathering. There are already speculations that Microsoft is revealing the Surface Pro 5 soon, so Business Insider is betting that the big reveal would be that of the highly anticipated tablet hybrid.  READ: Microsoft testing application that will defend Edge browser from malware Although it’s very likely that the Surface Pro 5 would be unveiled at the Shanghai event, there is still a possibility that the mystery hardware could be something else. On Panay’s post, fans are sharing their thoughts on what could Microsoft be launching at this time of the year. Many are guessing that the tech giant could be finally introducing the long-rumored Surface Phone. There are also fans asking for Surface Book 2, a new Surface Pro tablet and even an 8-inch Surface tablet.  Should Microsoft push through with launching the Surface Pro 5,  the tech industry already has an idea on what to expect from the new tablet-laptop hybrid. In early April, award-winning tech journalist Paul Thurrott said that there’s “nothing dramatic” about the upcoming Surface Pro device. This was then taken by the Verge as a clue to the upgraded components of the device instead of a refreshed design. One change that Thurrott confirmed was the switch to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. He also mentioned that the Surface power connector will be retained.  Interestingly, it’s a bit odd that Microsoft would launch another computer-like device so soon. Just early this week, the company introduced to the world the Surface Laptop, the Redmond giant’s rival product for Apple’s MacBook. The device is also seen as a Chromebook killer because of its Windows 10 S OS. However, the expensive price tag of the laptop is obviously no match for the Chromebooks in terms of practicality.  READ: Where to buy Microsoft Surface Arc Mouse Nevertheless, a Surface Pro upgrade is also very much needed at this point considering that the Surface Pro 4 is already showing its age. If Microsoft wants to remain competitive this year, it needs to step up its game because Windows PC manufacturers are also releasing their Surface clones. It’s also about time for Microsoft to update its non-Pro Surface tablet line. Now that it has a new lightweight version of Windows 10, it’s definitely a good idea to introduce a Surface 3 successor.  Microsoft is prepping for a hardware launch event wherein the tech giant is very likely to unveil the Surface Pro 5.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

Berkshire Hathaway bought IBM’s stock back in 2011. More recently, Buffett has invested heavily in Apple. Buffett recently revealed to CNBC that he had sold about one-third of his position in IBM, noting that he “revalued” the company downward. He had held just over 81.2 million shares in the company. Meanwhile, Buffett has continued to beef up his stake in Apple. As of February, he publicly said that they owned 133 million shares. Berkshire began building its stake in the iPhone maker in the first quarter of 2016. “I regard them as being quite different businesses,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting. “They are two different types of decisions and I was wrong on the first one. And we’ll find out whether I was right or wrong on the second. I do not regard them as apples and apples. I don’t regard them as apples and oranges.” Reflecting on missed tech opportunities Berkshire’s vice chairman Charlie Munger added that they avoided tech stocks in the past because they felt they had “no advantage where other people did.” “I think that’s a good idea to not play where the other people are better,” Munger said. He added that he thought they were “probably smart enough” to figure out Google (GOOG), though. “I would say that we failed you there,” Munger said. “We were smart enough to do it.” Buffett explained that Geico was Google’s customer very early on. He added that they were paying $10 or $11 per click. “That’s a good business,” Buffett said. Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger visits the shareholder shopping day in a golf cart as part of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska, May 5, 2017. REUTERS/Rick WilkingMore Of course, it’s been a learning process, just like they learned with Wal-Mart. “We blew Wal-Mart too,” Munger said. “It was a total cinch. We were smart enough to figure that.” Berkshire didn’t invest in Wal-Mart until the second quarter of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Berkshire sold about 89% of its stake. “Execution is what counts,” Buffett said. Buffett acknowledged that they could be making a mistake with IBM. “It’s harder to predict, in my view, the winners in various items or how much price competition will enter to something like cloud services and all of that.” He went on to sing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praises as someone who’s been a big competitor in the space. “He has been the CEO of two businesses, starting from scratch,” Buffett said. “Andy Grove at Intel used to say, ‘think about if you had a silver bullet and you can shoot one competitor. A lot of people would probably aim that silver bullet at Jeff.” Follow our Yahoo Finance’s coverage of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting at Finance.Yahoo.com/BRKLiveStream.

There’s some nice gameplay footage linked in the previous line, and if you’re an X-COM fan, I’m sure you will enjoy it. In other news, Overwatch reminded us of its ubiquity, first with Activision-Blizzard reporting that it’s brought in over a billion dollars for the company, and (again) a South Korean politician belittling her rivals in the best way possible: via Overwatch “Play of the Game”-inspired eliminations. Drop rate of Overwatch loot boxes revealed in China Who doesn’t love the low probability of obtaining something meaningful from an in-game purchase? Loot boxes, crates or packs have been a tremendous source of revenue for game creators over the last couple of years, but thanks to a late-2016 rule implemented by China’s Ministry of Culture, it is now mandatory for game publishers to reveal the odds of obtaining random rewards via such boxes in the country. As a result, Blizzard announced on the Overwatch site for China that players would receive a legendary item every 13.5 loot boxes and a rare item for every 5.5 boxes opened. Now, these are drop rates of loot boxes in China, and it hasn’t been confirmed if this varies based on region. In fact, some of the most popular gaming videos on YouTube are the ones where content creators simply open loot boxes for over twenty minutes, like the one above. Missed the Tom Clancy’s The Division bandwagon? Play it for free this weekend. Despite its shortcomings in terms of endgame and an oddly implemented player-versus-player multiplayer mode, The Division offered a solid co-operative shooter experience. If you chose to skip it due to middling reviews or the fact that you weren’t a burned-out Destiny player, there’s some good news: The Division got way better as its player base saw a steady decline. The better news is that it’s free to play on PlayStation 4, PC and Xbox One between the 4th and 7th of May 2017. What’s more, the game is on sale on those platforms as well, if you’re so inclined to purchase it. Find it at these links: Xbox One | PS4 | PC (Steam) Co-op story mode incoming for DOTA 2 DOTA 2’s Battle Pass has been a very popular form of engaging with the competitive DOTA 2 scene, contributing to the prize pool of annual tournament “The International”, all while basking in the glory of some fresh loot and exclusive access to tournament streams. The inclusion of a co-op campaign “Siltbreaker” is a welcome one, and potentially barrier-breaking for players who have been intimidated by the game’s steep learning curve. MOBAs in general do their best to create context through pages of lore, but the best way to do any sort of world building is through activities such as this. Siltbreaker will see teams of up to four players journey to the blackest depths of the Dark Reef, fighting monsters and evading traps. The first episode arrives later in May, while the second is expected to launch in July. You can read more about the Battle Pass on the DOTA 2 website. Dark Souls-inspired post-apocalyptic action-RPG Code Vein gets a trailer Bandai Namco is at it again. After enjoying immense critical and commercial success with From Software’s Dark Souls series (which is taking a breather from all the kiting and side-stepping, it would seem), Code Vein will arrive sometime next year to fill the void. The game is a post-apocalyptic action-RPG where you play as Revenants—vampires who need to feed on blood to fuel abilities. Expect Soulslike combat and systems, where mechanics are seldom explained in full, and boss fights of epic proportions. While I personally do find Dark Souls clones enjoyable overall, I think the genre could do well with some new ideas—let’s hope Code Vein is able to bring something new to the table. The PC Gaming Show returns this E3 It’s always odd to see PC gaming being described as the “fastest growing platform”—particularly when there’s an existing 1.2 billion players on it worldwide. Nonetheless, it’s good to see all platforms getting their due, and for a show which has turned very console-centric over the years, the PC Gaming Show is a welcome change of pace (it quite literally is—tune in this year and you’ll be surprised at the difference in the glitz and glamour). What’s more, Bethesda, Sony and Microsoft have confirmed dedicated stage events, while Nintendo seems to be continuing its practice of not doing one. Expect a livestream of some sort. PC Gamer will be presenting this year’s PC Gaming Show, with Intel as the title sponsor. The show will take place on Monday, June 12th at 10 AM Pacific (10:30 PM IST). You can read more about the PC Gaming Show on the official website.
