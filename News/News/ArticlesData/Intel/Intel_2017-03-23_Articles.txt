Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. WASHINGTON — President Trump's ousted national security adviser did not seek permission from the U.S. government to work as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests, U.S. defense officials said, raising the possibility that the Pentagon could dock the retirement pay of Michael Flynn. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Defense Department is reviewing the issue. It arose after Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, registered retroactively this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work that his company, Flynn Intel Group, carried out on behalf of Inovo BV, a Netherlands-based company. It is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is not a part of the Turkish government, but has links to it. The Inovo assignment centered on researching Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric whom Ankara blames for fomenting a coup attempt last summer and wants extradited from the United States, where he has lived in exile for years. That led Flynn's company to conclude that the work “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” according to a letter sent by Flynn's attorney, Robert K. Kelner, to the Justice Department, along with the filing. Flynn Intel Group received a total of $530,000 in three payments between September and November from Inovo BV before discontinuing the arrangement after Trump was elected president, according to Flynn's filings. It is unclear from the paperwork how much Flynn personally profited from the deal, but he is the majority owner and chief executive officer of the firm. Kelner, reached by phone Wednesday night, declined to comment on the deal. Flynn filed the foreign agent paperwork March 7, about three weeks after being removed as national security adviser after revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn's company previously disclosed its role in lobbying for Inovo BV, but did not file any paperwork as a foreign agent for Turkey because it had concluded that its client was a foreign corporation, rather than a foreign government. It changed course and filed as a foreign agent to “eliminate any doubt” about the issue, Kelner wrote. Individuals who represent foreign governments must register with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Flynn's work for Inovo came as he prepared an opinion piece for The Hill newspaper that appeared on Election Day and criticized the Obama administration while arguing that “from Turkey's point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey's Osama bin Laden.” Flynn's new filing acknowledges that the piece used information gathered through work for Inovo, but denies that either Inovo or the Turkish government requested it or had a hand in writing it. However, Inovo did receive an advance copy of it for review, the filing said. An Army spokesperson, Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, said that the service has no record of Flynn ever requesting permission before accepting any kind of “foreign employment” — something that Defense Department guidelines, separate from the Foreign Agents Registration Act — explicitly require when former officers work for a foreign government. The Pentagon's guidelines were established to comply with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which states that no individual holding any office “of profit or trust” can accept any pay or gift from a foreign government or official without the permission of the U.S. government. It applies to retired officers and enlisted service members because they are subject to recall to active duty, according to a Defense Department assessment of the issue. Defense Department guidelines warn that the department's top financial officer, the comptroller, “may pursue debt collection” if they do not do so. Any debt collection due to an Emoluments Clause violation would be capped at no more than what an individual makes in retirement pay during a period of unauthorized employment. In Flynn's case, that is more than $35,000 for the three months of the Inovo project. The position of Defense Department comptroller is held on an acting basis by Andrew Roth, a former Obama administration official who was held over to help with budget issues. David Norquist, who served as chief financial officer in the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, was nominated last week as his replacement. The Defense guidelines do not specify whether representing the interests of a foreign government while paid by a private corporation is a violation of the rules. Violations of the Emoluments Clause also are rarely enforced. “This is not something that has generally been enforced, but I do think we are at a phase where people are thinking about the remedies for this issue a lot more carefully,” said William Baude, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. The issue comes as some lawmakers continue to press for information about whether Flynn violated any laws by accepting money to appear with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization. Flynn received $45,000 for the December 2015 appearance, according to documents released recently by the House Oversight Committee. Jennifer Werner, a spokesman for Democrats on the committee, said the Army told committee members that it has found no documents suggesting that Flynn asked the service for permission to speak at the RT gala. But Kelner suggested that isn't so clear-cut: Flynn briefed members of the Defense Intelligence Agency about his trip to Moscow before and afterward, Kelner said Wednesday. Asked if he sought approval through Army Human Resources Command, as the guidelines stipulate, Kelner declined to comment. On Wednesday, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., its ranking member, requested that the White House, the Defense Department, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence furnish documents related to Flynn's foreign contacts. Chaffetz and Cummings said in a letter that the committee is reviewing whether Flynn “fully disclosed his payments from Russian, Turkish, or other foreign sources,” specifically mentioning the RT payment without limiting the request to it.

David Paul Morris / Bloomberg U.S. charges two Israeli residents with Mobileye insider trading How Israel's Hebrew University lost a Mobileye windfall Opinion Why men are terrified of the rise of driverless cars Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector’s other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups – more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs – has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016, from $2.4 billion in 2015, as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant’s purchase last week of Mobileye, which specializes in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. “A concern over the years has been that compared to the United States, Israel cannot produce outsized returns,” said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. “Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel, and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location,” he added. The price was about 21 times Mobileye’s expected 2017 revenue – or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the stock market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app that Google bought for $1.15 billion in 2013. That same year, Wix – an Israeli startup that helps people build websites – made its market debut on New York’s Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after its founding. Only a few – such as cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion – have succeeded in remaining independent. Defense tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signaled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. “It’s an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies,” said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors, including Samsung’s Catalyst Fund, bringing its total raised to date to $70 million. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of three to 10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as Startup Nation, Israel is maturing into a “scale-up nation” believes Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success, since local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, Schoenfeld said. Mobileye now accounts for 16% of BlueStar’s Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8% so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6%. Schoenfeld pointed to Wix and software provider Amdocs as examples of other companies “going the distance” by staying independent for longer. Cybersecurity firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering, moving into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. “All of these take time to build and time to get resources, and Intel already has these resources,” said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shashua. “If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product.” With more than 200 startups, Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Last year, startups in the sector raised $681 million – nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been “making the pilgrimage” to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Bessemer’s Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential buyers “will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either,” Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth-sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3-D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel’s most vibrant sectors – cybersecurity – helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon said the Mobileye deal could accelerate his company’s growth. “There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A,” he said. Carmakers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centers in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D centers in Israel, including Intel. “Now they are moving into the autonomous space, and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level,” Kram said. “It’s a win-win for both companies.” Reuters Reuters Send me email alerts for new articles by Reuters Send Close Email * Please enter your email Reuters For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

The GPU company is flying high at the moment, but there are three potential problems investors should look out for. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Mar 23, 2017 at 9:16PM There's a lot for NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its investors to be optimistic about at the moment. The company grew data center revenue by three times in its fiscal second quarter; it retains the dominant position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market against rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD); and it's quickly building on massive opportunities in both self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).  But it can be tempting to think that the good times will continue simply because that's what's happening right now. I've argued in recent articles that NVIDIA is in a great position to benefit from its endeavors, but sometimes it's also good to step into the contrarian role for just a minute in order to evaluate things more critically.  Image source: Getty Images. To do that, let's take a look at three pessimistic possibilities for the company: how AMD could gain market share against NVIDIA's GPUs; what Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) doing to take on NVIDIA in the AI space; and how Intel's proposed purchase of Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) could thwart NVIDIA's driverless car tech plans.  1. AMD's new Vega GPUs could help boost market share At the end of 2016, AMD had a market share of 29.5% in discrete desktop GPUs, and NVIDIA controlled the rest.. Obviously, NVIDIA is dominating here, but investors should be aware that just two years before, NVIDIA's GPU market share was more than 78%. Take a look: Data source: Jon Peddie Research and AnandTech. AMD has mainly made its gains in mid-range GPUs, but expect that to change in the second quarter of this year, when the company releases its new Vega GPU architecture. Admittedly, it's a bit early to know how well AMD's new GPUs will compete against NVIDIA's. But one recent move by NVIDIA -- it released a new, high-end GTX 1080 Ti with 20% to 45% higher performance than original version -- might be an indicator that the segment leader is preparing for serious competition. AMD has already managed to take significant market share away from NVIDIA over the past couple of years, and with Vega, it will go directly after NVIDIA's high-end GPU dominance. If Vega is even mildly successful in wooing some customers away from NVIDIA's GPUs, it will be a win for AMD.  2. Intel's Mobileye acquisition ratchets up the driverless car tech competition NVIDIA has a huge opportunity in the self-driving car space with its Drive PX 2 supercomputer. Drive PX uses machine learning and visual processing to interpret all of the things around a driverless car, giving it situational awareness. About 80 automotive suppliers and car companies are using variants of NVIDIA's Drive PX already, and the company expects the driverless car segment to be an increasingly important part of its business.  Image source: Intel. About a year ago, I wrote that Intel was aiming to take on NVIDIA in driverless cars, but that it wasn't doing enough to achieve its goal. That may have changed last week when Intel announced a deal to buy the Israel-based autonomous driving tech company Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Mobileye's self-driving technology consists of cameras, sensors, machine learning, and cloud software, and the company already has 70% of the worldwide market share for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The purchase will not only propel Intel toward the front of the self-driving car tech space, but also give the chipmaker more opportunities to embed its own processors in the hearts of autonomous cars -- and possibly hurt NVIDIA's push for GPU-based self-driving tech.  3. Intel is taking on NVIDIA's artificial intelligence business too NVIDIA's GPUs are also used in some of the most sophisticated AI and deep learning systems available right now, including its own Drive PX2 and DGX-1 supercomputers. Graphics processors are uniquely adept at processing AI information, and NVIDIA could end up being a big winner in this market. A recent investor note published by Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari said that NVIDIA's total addressable market in the AI and deep learning space could be as large $5 billion to $10 billion. Intel is easily the leader in the server chip space, with 99% market share, but its chips have not been the go-to components for the growing AI data center market. To change that (and to better compete with NVIDIA) Intel has been busy building out its own AI strategy. Image source: Intel. This year, the company will begin selling its new AI-focused chip -- the Knights Mill Xeon Phi processor -- which it says it can process deep learning data faster than NVIDIA's GPU (though NVIDIA has disputed that claim). And Intel recently acquired an AI company called Nervana Systems, which makes an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that it believes can increase AI computing power.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a blog post a few months ago, "We expect Nervana's technologies to produce a breakthrough 100-fold increase in performance in the next three years to train complex neural networks, enabling data scientists to solve their biggest AI challenges faster." Intel's AI capabilities are still behind NVIDIA's right now, but the company is clearly making this segment a priority, and NVIDIA investors should recognize that the massive potential size of the AI market means that competition in it is only going to increase. Should NVIDIA investors be worried? There's not much for NVIDIA investors to be worried about right now, but that doesn't mean they should take a hands-off approach to this stock. The company will need to continue dominating in the discrete desktop GPU space, and innovate faster in AI and driverless car tech to maintain its dominant positions. So far, NVIDIA has proven that it can do this well, but investors would be wise to keep a close eye on how NVIDIA's competitors are mounting their attacks.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Intel has its Core i5-7600K with 4C/8T at $239 right now on Amazon, meaning AMD offers 4 additional CPU threads with Ryzen 5 1600X at just $10 more - or, the cheaper Ryzen 5 1600 with 6C/12T and its lower price of $219.     AMD will be launching its Ryzen 5 family of processors on April 11, but some retailers are selling the CPUs early - with resellers in Europe already selling Ryzen 5 chips. Someone posted on Reddit, saying that someone purchased a Ryzen 5 1600 processor in Brazil. NEWS SOURCES:Reddit.com Recommended for You The first sign of Kaby Lake X: the Intel Core i7-7740K...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News Hardware Acceleration! Digiarty Builds Real Fastest WinX DVD Ripper Platinum Sichuan, China — (SBWIRE) — 03/23/2017 — Digiarty Software, a veteran application software developer, announces excitedly the biggest-ever update: WinX DVD Ripper Platinum 8.5.0 comes out on March 22 with a killer feature – Hardware Acceleration. On the version, Intel QSV and NVIDIA (CUDA) NVENC on users’ computers can be utilized to maximally accelerate DVD conversion speed. Specifically, the speed of DVD to MP4 (H.264) ripping can reach up to 500 FPS (with X32 DVD drive), and the whole DVD conversion takes as short as 5 minutes only. For whoever’s computer contains CPU/GPU hardware accelerator, it is the real fastest DVD conversion solution. Please download and feel the CPU and GPU based hardware encoder at: https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/ WinX DVD Ripper Platinum is a professional Windows-based program serving for ripping and converting DVD discs, ISO image files and DVD folders to hard drive, computer, and other devices supported files formats. The new version is the most fast-running and stable one. That is to say, both the kernel and interface are finalized thereon, and no frequent updates will be necessary thereafter. After beta testing, the official version comes out on Wednesday, March 22 and is believed to pack a punch. Hardware acceleration applying to video encoding/decoding is in vogue, mostly for the blossom of modern multi-core processor and concurrency-algorithm GPU, specifically for Intel QSV and NVIDIA NVENC techniques. By far, both four generations of Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, such as Intel Core i5 / Core i7 processor and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, have supported encoding H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, as a result of which DVD to MP4 (H.264) video transcoding speed skyrockets by 300% now when using this updated DVD ripping software with hardware acceleration. Before hardware acceleration, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum is already distinguished for fast software transcoding speed, attributed to uniquely developed Super Encode Engine, Hyper-threading technology and Multi-core CPU utilization. It was especially reflected in the „DVD Backup” mode, namely, in copying DVD to MPEG2 file, ISO image file or DVD folder with original quality and intact movie content. Now with might doubled, the hardware encoding is added in as a spur to finish DVD ripping to MP4 within only 5 minutes at 300-500 FPS (depending on the speed of DVD drive and the configuration of computer). Digiarty Software this year seems to have an especially great variety of update plans. Taking Version 8.0.0 built on March 10 for instance, many vital enhancements were launched, including rebuilt DVD title analysis mechanism, new ISO system support and trouble shooting for 99-title and intractable discs. „We have been committed to creating the best software with fast speed, powerful decoding ability and ease of use,” said Jack Han, CEO of Digiarty. „We think that’s already where we are. Thank you everyone who has supported us over the past 10 years for making the product what it is today!” Pricing and Availability WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0 is released on Wednesday. Any new user can download the trial version or get the full version at $39.95 from the Spring Discount at: https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/buy.htm About Digiarty Software, Inc.

While MBLY shot up 28% after it was announced that the company will be bought out for $63.54 a share, INTC stock fell 2% and closed below its 200-day moving average for the time since last June. Prior to Monday’s breakdown, Intel stock had been consolidating in a trading range with the 200-day (the red line) acting as support and the 50-day average (the blue line) as resistance. The breach of support came on double the average volume, which is a bearish sign that highlights the large number of sellers. Was Mobileye a Good Buy? The consensus on the Street is that Intel paid too much for Mobileye. That ultimately will be determined years from now, but what I found interesting was the fact that an Intel executive came out and highlighted the amount of data the company will be able to gather as a direct result of the acquisition. Think about it: Mobileye is a key player in the autonomous automobile industry, making the chips that are used in driverless and semi-autonomous vehicles. And all those chips control the sensors that map the road. The information that Intel will now be able to accumulate has the potential to be worth much more than the $15.3 billion it paid in the transaction. There has been a flurry of analyst moves since last Monday’s news, and Wednesday morning Credit Suisse jumped on the bandwagon, downgrading INTC stock to “Neutral” from “Outperform.” What’s interesting here, though, is that the Mobileye purchase was actually applauded. The downgrade was based on Intel being expensive. 10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash I don’t share that mindset, but I also do not see INTC stock as an overly attractive investment from a fundamental view right now. Its earnings growth is slowing, and the company needs to find more catalysts to boost its bottom line. Bottom Line on INTC Stock Perhaps the Mobileye acquisition is a step in the right direction. I like the potential that Intel’s 3% dividend yield represents, but I wouldn’t be a buyer just yet. If INTC stock weakens further but is able to hold price support near $33.50 in the coming weeks, I might consider opening a position in the $33.50-$34.50 area based on a combination of the acquisition and the potential within the chip sector.

Each will be led by a general manager with responsibility for definition of offerings and go-to-market strategies in the segment, as well as responsibility for the entire business end-to-end.

Most recently, she spent eight years at Intel leading that company’s Client, Internet of Things and System Architecture (CISA) Group and serving as Intel CIO for four years.

She began her career at IBM. In addition to Stevenson, three current Lenovo executives, all of whom who have been with the company for approximately one year, will assume new positions on the Data Center Group’s senior leadership team. Laura Latrello, vice president and general manager, will continue in her role leading the data center services segment. Newly appointed business segment executive leaders will report directly to Kirk Skaugen, executive vice president & president, Data Center Group: Paul Ju, vice president and general manager, Hyperscale – Ju joined Lenovo in September 2016 and has deep experience in hyperscale systems and cloud computing through management positions with leading global technology and data center providers.

Earlier this month, Intel purchased machine vision company Mobileye to get its hands on 70 percent of the market for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in self-driving vehicles. Today, Intel announced that it is consolidating its AI efforts into a single group that reports directly to CEO Brian Krzanich. Leading the new Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG) is Naveen Rao, who served as CEO of Nervana, which was acquired by Intel in August 2016 for $400 million. The Nervana acquisition brought Intel a fully-optimized software and hardware stack for deep learning tasks. Using the Nervana tech as a basis, Intel is looking to usher in a new wave of AI breakthroughs. “Just as Intel has done in previous waves of computational trends, such as personal and cloud computing, Intel intends to rally the industry around a set of standards for AI that ultimately brings down costs and makes AI more accessible to more people – not only institutions, governments and large companies, as it is today,” said Rao. Naveen Rao, Vice President and General Manager of the new Artificial Intelligence Products Group “The new organization will align resources from across the company to include engineering, labs, software and more as we build on our current leading AI portfolio: the Intel Nervana platform, a full-stack of hardware and software AI offerings that our customers are looking for from us.” The AIPG will also incorporate an applied research lab that will further push major breakthroughs in AI technology. The lab will focus on “novel architectural and algorithmic” approaches to leap over technological hurdles that may be in the way of preventing the widespread use of AI in the future. Patrick Moorhead, who serves as President and Principal Analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy, commended Intel’s newfound focus on AI, writing: Intel sees the huge potential in AI and are moving mountains to take full advantage of it. They have acquired Altera, Nervana Systems and other IP, need to connect to their home-grown IP and now it's time to accelerate the delivery of it. That's where today's organization comes in play, a centralized organization, reporting directly to CEO Brian Krzanich, to make that happen. This is classic organizational strategy, accelerating delivery by organizing a cross-product group directly reporting to the CEO. Intel is hoping that its Nervana technology along with Knights Mill-based Xeon Phi processors will help to usher in a 100-fold performance boost in training complex neural networks over the next three years. “Intel has the vision, the technologies and the commitment to harness the power of AI to deliver a better world,” said Krzanich back in November. “Now is the time to inspire and innovate for the future.” Tags:  Intel, (NASDAQ:INTC), nervana, artificial intelligence products group, aipg Via:  Intel Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 84K 10K 5K 28K CONVERSATIONS Microsoft Apparently Ramping Up...86 Here's Why Intel Kaby Lake And AMD Zen...54 Toys R Us Restocking Elusive Nintendo...23 AMD Radeon RX Vega Shipping With Up To...22 Raspberry Pi Surges To 3rd Best Selling...11 Nintendo Steps Up To Fix Your Finicky...6 EVGA Flaunts Trio Of Custom Mighty...5 FEATURED Dell XPS 15 (9560) Review: More...

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 23, 2017 10:36 AM PT Credit: Naveen Rao, vice president and general manager of Intel's Artificial Intelligence Products Group/Intel More like this Intel chases A.I. with new chips, but still lacks a potent GPU Intel has a chip with 24 cores that costs $8,898 Intel snags Nervana for a crash course on deep learning Video Need a data center location? Iceland wants you Intel's artificial intelligence efforts have been scattered over many different units but are now being united into a single operating group. The Artificial Intelligence Products Group will focus on the development of chips and software products tied to machine learning, algorithms and deep learning. The new group could become Intel's single most important group as companies implement machine learning into operations. Intel is tweaking more chips and developing software to take on workloads like analytics, image recognition, and automation. Intel is designing a new Xeon Phi chip code-named Knights Mill that will focus on machine learning. Additionally, it is applying its wide portfolio of FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) to artificial intelligence. Intel also offers many software tools for deep learning, like its Deep Learning SDK. Also part of the group will be chips from Movidius and Nervana Systems, companies that Intel acquired last year. Movidius chips are used in mobile devices, drones and robots, was well as for computer vision. Intel plans to show a high-performance machine learning ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) called Lake Crest with technology from Nervana this year. Intel will create an A.I. research lab dedicated to exploring "novel architectural and algorithmic approaches" that could be applied to data center technologies and IoT devices. Machine learning is mostly driven by GPUs, which Intel doesn't make. But between its CPUs, ASICs and FPGAs, Intel believes it can offer a wide range of chips to meet all machine-learning needs. The group will be led by Naveen Rao, who will be vice president and general manager. He was the CEO of Nervana Systems before the company was acquired by Intel. In recent months, Intel has tightened its operations to focus on the hot markets. In November, Intel created the Automated Driving Group to chase self-driving cars.

While it's been around for years and continues to be refined, for some Intel CPUs on some workloads, the CPUFreq scaling driver leads to be better performance and even Intel's own Clear Linux distribution is using CPUFreq by default. With Linux 4.12, more intel_pstate revisions are taking place. Rafael Wysocki, Linux power management expert and Intel developer, has posted a new set of patches for further tuning P-State's CPU frequency scaling behavior. He commented on at the opening of the patch series, "This series of patches makes changes to intel_pstate that will modify its behavior in visible ways and add documentation describing the driver's interface and behavior after those changes. It is targeted at 4.12." The patches affect the P-State active mode (default) behavior as it has turned out to be problematic and the new behavior is explained with this patch. One of the other patches now uses the load-based P-State mode selection more widely, for basically all hardware except servers -- as defined by the ACPI preferred profile. Another patch supports HWP processors in all operation modes. As usual whenever there's a large CPUFreq/P-State change, we'll have fresh benchmarks with the different drivers and governors when Linux 4.12 rolls into town. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | March 23, 2017 -- 16:02 GMT (09:02 PDT) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence Intel has put its artificial intelligence efforts under one group led by Naveen Rao, former CEO of Nervana, which was acquired by the chip giant. special feature How to Implement AI and Machine Learning The next wave of IT innovation will be powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We look at the ways companies can take advantage of it and how to get started. Read More The company has been repositioning via acquisitions to focus on Internet of Things to autonomous vehicles. The upshot is that Intel is trying to build a data center to IoT stack powered by its processors. See: Intel's Mobileye purchase may really be about thwarting Nvidia's car to cloud, data center connection | Intel buys Mobileye for $15.3 billion, eyes autonomous driving market, computer vision | Intel integrates Nervana technology into product roadmap In a blog post, Rao outlined how the Artificial Intelligence Products Group will work across multiple units. Part of the group's remit will be to bring AI costs down and forge standards. Rao said the group will combine engineering, labs, software, and hardware from its portfolio. Meanwhile, Intel will create an AI lab. Patrick Moorhead, principal of Moor Insights & Strategy, said the central organization makes sense. Moorhead said: Intel sees the huge potential in AI and are moving mountains to take full advantage of it. They have acquired Altera, Nervana Systems and other IP, need to connect to their home-grown IP and now it's time to accelerate the delivery of it. That's where today's organization comes in play, a centralized organization, reporting directly to CEO Brian Krzanich, to make that happen. This is classic organizational strategy, accelerating delivery by organizing a cross-product group directly reporting to the CEO.

Here are 19 best laptops to buy By Marie Brewis | 23 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What's the best laptop you can buy in the UK? Best laptop Price Key specifications Dell XPS 13 9360 £999 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 13.3in 1920x1080 display, 60Wh battery Asus ZenBook UX310UA £699 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 500GB hard drive, 13.3in 3200x1800 display, 48Wh battery Dell XPS 15 9560 £1349 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD + 32GB SSD, 15.6in 1920x1080 display, 57Wh battery We round up the best laptops you can buy in the UK in 2017, including Windows laptops and MacBooks. The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, followed by the Asus ZenBook UX310 and the Dell XPS 15 but there are plenty of other options in our list below. Also see: Best Laptop Deals Despite the rise of tablets, there are still plenty of reasons to choose a laptop. Sometimes you just can't beat a bigger screen, a keyboard and Windows for getting stuff done. But, if you want a laptop that's also a tablet, there are plenty of convertible or 'hybrid' laptops which have a touchscreen which folds right back behind the keyboard and can be used as a tablet. The Yoga 710 is one of the best we've seen in this respect, although if its 11in screen is too small, Lenovo does offer larger versions. Your Buying Guide for the Best Laptops of 2017 Choosing a laptop isn't the easiest thing to do, but we're here to help. First, if you're looking for a laptop that can handle the latest games, see our up-to-date list of the best gaming laptops. As much as we can, we make sure all the laptops here are available to buy in the UK. However, it's not something we can check every day so there's a chance you might not find the precise model listed. There are also often many different versions of the 'same' laptop so we always quote the part number of the model we tested. You can use this to search online and make sure you get the right model. But there is no harm in buying one of the other variants since - typically - it is just the amount of RAM, storage, processor or graphics card which differs: the chassis, screen, keyboard and touchpad generally remain identical across all. Most laptops will come pre-installed with Windows 10 now. Of course, we also include here the best MacBooks, which run OS X (now macOS) out of the box. Macs are often more expensive than Windows laptops, but Apple's laptops are better value than ever before. You might feel that the premium build quality and features warrant spending extra, although many Windows laptop manufacturers have stepped up their game recently. How much should I spend on a laptop?  Sometimes the best does come at a steep price, but equally you can get a lot of laptop for under £300 – provided you only need to do basic tasks like browse the web, email and create the odd document. If so see the best budget laptops. Spending a bit more, around £500 and above, will potentially get you a nice laptop but it's likely to have an entry-level set of specs. We're talking a relatively basic processor, minimal SSD storage and a relatively low-quality screen. It might also be a bit heavy and bulky. Ramp up the amount you're happy to splash out - £700 and up - and you should get a blazing fast processor, plenty of RAM, hordes of storage and a gorgeous display. You should also expect excellent build quality and premium materials. That's why it's crucial to read laptop reviews before you buy.  What screen size laptop do I need?  The size of your screen is an important decision when buying a laptop. They range from 11- all the way up to 17in. A smaller screen might be harder to work on but it means that the laptop will be far more portable, handy if you need to take it around with you wherever you go. Bear in mind that a smaller device means less space for features like ports. At 17in, you're buying a desktop replacement laptop which isn't deigned to be moved around often. You'll likely get a full-size keyboard, lots of connectivity and possibly even an optical drive, too. Generally, unless you're looking at either end of the spectrum, a 13in laptop is the sweet spot for us combining portability with usability. While many laptops have a resolution of 1366x768, you should look for something more if you want the best. Full HD (1920x1080) and higher should be a tick box and you can even get 4K laptops now, although arguably it's not necessary. If you want a touchscreen, this normally adds to the cost. Most laptops have a glossy, reflective screen (certainly this is the case with touchscreens) but most people prefer a less reflective matt finish so that's something to look out for, too. How much laptop storage do I need?  As usual, storage depends on what you want to use a laptop for. As a general rule of thumb get as much as possible without wasting money on the upgrade (manufactures can charge a premium on this area). An SSD will mean your laptop runs faster but doesn't provide as much space as a traditional hard drive. Remember that there are also plenty of cloud storage options but this isn't so helpful when you don't have an internet connection. If you're going to need to storing a large amount of data (perhaps you make home videos or you simply want all your TV box sets ready to go) then look for 1- or 2TB of space. Don't forget you can buy a portable USB drive to supplement a laptop which has only a small-capacity SSD.  Memory (RAM) is where programs and files are stored only while you're using them, and more is always better. Consider 4GB an absolute minimum, unless it's a Chromebook, with 8- to 16GB the ideal figure if you can afford the upgrade. You can't have too much. Which laptop processor is best?  Unless you're going to run complex and demanding software or gaming, you don't need the latest top-spec processor. It doesn't hurt, of course, but it's best to find a nice balance as there's nothing worse than waiting for a app to load etc. If you're happy to splash out then you're probably looking at the latest generation (7th) Intel Core i7 chip. Entry-level spec models are likely to offer a Core i3 or even a Celeron, Pentium or AMD processor instead. A Core i5 is a good mid-range choice so check how much extra it is to upgrade before making a final decision. If you're not sure which generation the Intel processor is, look at the model number as the first digit represents this. For example, a Core i5-6500 is a sixth-generation CPU. The letters after the model name are important, too. Y and U means these are ultra-low-power chips which won't be great for demanding tasks but should mean longer battery life. H means high-performance graphics (built into the CPU) and Q means it's quad-core.  While most come with Intel processors, you can still find AMD-powered devices around. See AMD vs Intel for more information. Buying an Ultrabook and ultraportable laptop Buying an ultraportable laptop is really no different than any laptop, except that your priorities are likely to be different. You might want an ultraportable laptop that's light and will last a long time away from the mains.  However, other people want an ultrabook that's powerful and can handle demanding applications without breaking your back when you carry it around. Both types are available. Some compromises are inevitable if you want a thin and light laptop, though. There's less space for a battery, so it's typical to find shorter runtimes. But some companies have overcome this with clever packaging, such as the MacBook Air.  Another factor is efficient hardware, so a newer processor is likely to sip rather than guzzle power. The same goes for other components. But you should always read our reviews to find out how long a particular laptop lasted in our tests as you can't rely on specifications and it's unwise to go only by manufacturers' claims.  Thin laptops tend to have shallow key travel, so if you need a laptop to do a lot of typing then, again, read our reviews as they're the only way (short of hunting down the machine in a shop) to find out whether a keyboard is a joy or a pain to use.  Many ultrabooks use low-power processors which are better for battery life, but may not have much power for running Windows apps. Our benchmarks sort the speed demons from the sluggards. Warranty and other considerations  We recommend all the laptops here: there isn't a duff one among them. However, we urge you again to read through the full review before spending your hard-earned cash. None of them are perfect and what will suit your needs might not simply be the device ranked at number one. Battery life and warranty are two things which vary between laptops. The latter may well differ depending on where you buy the laptop from, too. John Lewis, for example, tends to offer longer warranty than rivals. After-sales service is something you should consider, not only laptops but pretty much everything you buy. Check whether the company has a UK-based support line, and forums (including our own) are an ideal place to get an idea of whether a manufacturer is generally good or bad at carrying out work under warranty. You might not even have to deal with the manufacturer directly if you have a fault in the first six months as it's the retailer's responsibility to deal with issues. This is when it pays to have purchased from Amazon, John Lewis and others which will often replace or refund without quibble. After al that, it's also worth considering whether a laptop is what you really want. You can get some great bargains on desktop PCs these days, and if you don't want a large tower system taking up space there are plenty of all-in-one PCs to choose between. These integrate the computer behind the monitor, so they're much neater. Also, some tablets offer similar functionality to basic laptops. See our piece about choosing between laptop vs iPad, for instance.  Read on for our pick of the UK's best laptops and links to our best laptop reviews.

Dell XPS 13 9360 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 December 16 RRP: From £999 (model reviewed £1499), From US$799 The Dell XPS 13 is an excellent ultraportable laptop, the best 13-inch Windows model going for many. Dell hasn’t aimed for a single superlative feature, a potential gimmick. Its footprint is smaller than the competition, but it’s thicker. Its screen resolution is excellent, but display colour is normal rather than super-saturated. There’s also a mix of old and new connections, and a combo of a large battery and smart power management means the Dell XPS 13 lasts significantly longer than most a lot of the time. The balance is just right - we'd spend our own money on it. Read our Dell XPS 13 9360 review. 2. Asus ZenBook UX310UA Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £699 The Asus ZenBook UX310A is an ideal mid-range ultraportable laptop. It is what happens when a practical everyday laptop and an expensive all-aluminium Ultrabook fall in love, bringing you the pricey look and feel of a portable, stylish machine with the features of a workhorse and a price way below that of a rival MacBook. Core hardware includes a Core i5-6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and both a 128GB SSD and a 500GB HDD. There’s a single USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, plus USB-C, HDMI and SDXC. The Asus sports (albeit so-so) Harman Kardon stereo speakers, and with its 48Wh battery weighs in at 1.45kg. A cheaper version has the Core i3, 4GB of RAM and a lower-res display. The 13.3in screen is a highlight, with unbelievable sharpness (276ppi) and colour saturation at this price, and this matt screen excels in outdoor use. It’s paired with a scissor-mechanism keyboard with backlight and a large, comfortable trackpad. The ZenBook is not perfect - we’d like the display to tilt back further, the shell displays some flexing, and it’s a tad chunky thanks to the HDD inside - but it scored well on performance, provided you avoid intensive gaming. Battery life is solid, at 8 hours 10 minutes. You can’t have it all at this price, but the ZenBook gets close. Read our Asus ZenBook UX310UA review. 3. Dell XPS 15 9560 Rating: Reviewed on: 1 March 17 RRP: From £1349, From US$999 The Dell XPS 15 is an amazingly flexible laptop, despite looking like an ordinary high-end one on the surface. It’s very powerful but has unusually good battery life for its class. It has a 15in screen but is smaller than almost all other 15in laptops with one. And is its 4K version the XPS 15 has the colour performance for pro design work. It’s also good-looking, and while not ultra-portable is not that heavy given the components inside. It makes the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar seem a bit frivolous in comparison, not to mention extremely expensive. Read our Dell XPS 15 9560 review. 4. Acer Swift 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 February 17 RRP: £649.99 The Acer Swift 3 is a near-perfect laptop for those who want an ultraportable, but don’t want to fork out £1000+. Build quality is great, battery life very good, and performance a match for much more expensive laptops. There are just two areas where the low price shows. First, it's a little thicker and heavier than some ultrabooks. It looks good enough, but limited maximum brightness and fairly poor colour reproduction limits its usefulness in certain situations. Read our Acer Swift 3 review. 5. Lenovo Yoga 710 11" Rating: Reviewed on: 9 August 16 RRP: £549, US$549 The Lenovo Yoga 710 wants to offer the best, most convenient ultraportable laptop experience you can get without spending a scary amount of money. It has a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen, which makes is a fun machine for use while travelling around. You wouldn’t want to go any smaller for all-day work tasks, but there is also a larger 14in version of this laptop if you think the 11.6in Yoga 710 will prove too small. For what it’s worth, Lenovo has nailed the display, glossy, sharp, bright enough for outdoor use, covered in toughened glass and jet black when switched off. Core hardware includes an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. You get a single USB 3.0 port, plus micro HDMI, but no microSD slot for storage expansion. There are stereo speakers, a nice tiled keyboard with two-button trackpad that is mostly comfortable to type on, and this 1.06kg laptop runs on a 40Wh battery. It’s not the fastest Windows laptop, but sufficient for everyday tasks that don’t include gaming. It’s silent in use, with respectable audio and long battery life - 9 hours 45 minutes in our tests. Lenovo’s Yoga 710 is one of the best Windows alternatives to the 12in MacBook. Read our Lenovo Yoga 710 11" review. 6. Dell Latitude 13 7370 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 16 RRP: From £1,079 Okay so it’s a business laptop, but check out that 13in edge-to-edge display. You wouldn’t be ashamed to show off the Dell Latitude 13 inside- or outside the office, with design hints taken from the awesome Dell XPS 13 listed higher up this chart. It’s customisable to suit your needs, but the model we reviewed came with an Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. There’s a USB 3.0 port, two USB-C, Micro-HDMI, a microSD card slot and two optional Micro-SIM slots. This 13.3in-screen laptop also sports a 34Wh battery and a fingerprint scanner, and weighs in at 1.12kg. The Latitude 13 has a pleasant matt finish to its base half, but the outer side of the lid is a cool (in every sense) aluminium that is surprisingly sturdy. Or you can add a carbon-fibre lid for an extra tenner. The keyboard is distinctly business-fare, somewhat cramped and with concave, clicky keys, but it’s workable. The trackpad is good, but small. And the screen offers great colours and viewing angles, even outdoors, but it lacks brightness. What really impresses is the Professional version of Windows it ships with, the silent running of the still-powerful processor, and its outstanding battery life of 8 hours 23 minutes in our tests. Read our Dell Latitude 13 7370 review. 7. HP Envy 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 February 16 RRP: From £649 (model reviewed £799) You won’t find a laptop with a decent-sized screen more portable than this HP Envy 13. It’s incredibly slim and light, powerful, and it doesn’t cost the earth. Magic. Key specs for our review sample include the Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256GB SSD. There’s a 13.3in full-HD screen, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a fingerprint scanner, SDXC slot, Bang & Olufson stereo speakers and a tiled keyboard complete with numberpad. With a 45Wh battery the Envy 13 weighs just 1.3kg. Cheaper Core-i5 and more expensive higher-resolution-screen options are also available. Sensationally petite, the Envy 13 has plenty of its own visual personality. This ultra-light system offers a mix of officiousness and cuteness: an unusal combo. There’s a pleasant matt screen, a shallow but crisp keyboard, and HP’s trademark ultra-big, ultra-rounded touchpad - one of the best you’ll find on a 13in Windows laptop. Day-to-day performance is excellent, and more demanding tasks such as photo- and video-editing are well within the HP’s remit. With integrated graphics, though, you’ll want to keep games at low settings. In our tests battery life ran to 8 hours 5 minutes. Read our HP Envy 13 review. 8. Acer S 13 S5-371 Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 16 RRP: £549.99 Introducing the Windows ultrabook for normal people (the ones whose jaws drop when they see the price of a new MacBook Air), the Acer S 13 is an affordable and recommended alternative to such wallet-busters. There’s a quirky trackpad and some parts of the build are cheap, but this is a very decent Windows laptop. The S 13 has an embossed ‘ridged’ plastic lid, offset by a silvery hinge that gives it a recognisable two-tone style. Its underside is plastic too, and the use of this material is one way Acer has managed to keep down the price. Elsewhere the build is more premium, for example the aluminium keyboard surround. On the whole, though, the spec is good. You get an Intel Core i3-610U processor (a Core i5 option is available) paired with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C, HDMI, SDXC and stereo speakers. The 13.3in Acer has a 4,030mAh battery and weighs 1.3kg. Day-to-day performance is good and battery life is very good, but the Acer is not a great gaming machine. It’s mostly quiet, with the fans kicking in only when necessary, yet the stereo speakers are loud. Watch it, though, as they’ll distort at maximum volume. Read our Acer S 13 S5-371 review. 9. Microsoft Surface Book Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £1,299 Microsoft thinks it has made the ultimate laptop, which is also a tablet. It's difficult to argue. There are five models, with the top offering the new £2,649 Surface Book i7. We reviewed the original Intel Core i7 Skylake model with 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GPU, and found excellent performance but have to point out the Core i5 model offers better value. The Surface Book is very angular, a slightly unusual shape for a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio, though we got used to it quickly. The 13.5in PixelSense display is stunning, with a crisp 267ppi density. Colour reproduction, brightness and viewing angles all excel. The Book itself is made from magnesium alloy, lighter and more durable than aluminium. The Book splits apart into the 724g screen with a 18Wh battery and the 860g keyboard with a 51Wh battery (battery life is fantastic at 16 hours, 25 minutes). The most striking part of its design its the ‘Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge’, which looks cool and improves balance. Meanwhile, an equally cool ‘Muscle Wire Lock’ uses an electrically charged nickel titanium alloy to hold it all together. The Surface Pen attaches magnetically to the side. You’ll find ports for USB 3.0 (x2), Mini-DisplayPort and an SD Card reader. USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 are missing, but this is still an amazing example of Windows laptop tech. Read our Microsoft Surface Book review. 10. 12" MacBook Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £1,249 (256GB model) and £1,549 (512GB model), US$1,299 (256GB model) and $1,599 (512GB model) There's no escaping the fact that this is a very similar laptop to its 2015 predecessor, which so divided the tech community. But we think the problems have been overblown. The engineering on show is superb, and the performance is completely acceptable for a modern-day computer of this size. The arguments that there should be more ports on the MacBook only exist because people want one, and are frustrated that their current set-up needs will not allow for it. Apple has undoubtedly improved the MacBook for 2016. It is a truly outstanding laptop that will be wrongly categorised as a luxury technological item. There's a difference between something costing a little too much and it being luxurious - just like the MacBook Air, this laptop deserves to fall in price and rise in specs to continue to be what we consider an excellent flagship computer. The world and its ports just need to catch up. Read our 12" MacBook review. 11. HP Spectre 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 August 16 RRP: £1299 The HP Spectre 13 is desperate to appear a laptop of the future, and that comes with substantial pros and cons. Its supreme portability is quite wonderful, and while its design may polarise, it certainly is fancy. There's substance too, with a surprisingly powerful CPU for a laptop this thin and solid build in the keyboard and trackpad. Its message is a little confused, though. The processor courts enthusiasts, but that's exactly who's likely to be most annoyed by the lack of memory card slot and a traditional USB port. There's an audience for the Spectre 13, but if you've not signed-up to a wireless way of working yet you may want to think twice. Read our HP Spectre 13 review. 12. MacBook Pro 2016 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 January 17 RRP: Base prices £1,449 (13-inch without Touch Bar), £1,749 (256GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £1,949 (512GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), £2,699 (2.7GHz, 12GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), From US$1499 We're rather in love with the new MacBook Pro, but as with many love affairs there are irritations. The trackpad is huge and wonderful to use; but it's so big that the keyboard has been pushed up to make room, as well as flattened down to make the laptop slimmer. These factors together mean typing on the new Pro is a little harder - especially for touch typists, who will struggle to locate keys at first - than on on previous models. And those arrow keys are a nightmare. The Touch Bar is lovely to look at and fun to use. It's early days, both for us - we're only beginning to grasp its capabilities - and for app developers, who will surely come up with reams of clever Touch Bar features. Right now it's fun, but we're reasonably confident that it will become essential; the key will be getting lots of users on machines with Touch Bars. The tech is in this respect a little further back along the track that 3D Touch is following. This is a fast machine, of course, but maybe not quite fast enough for some tastes; it's worth reflecting on that maximum spec of 16GB of RAM, which may hold this machine back from a role in genuine pro settings. We're somewhat hopeful for a March update to add the option of more RAM and Kaby Lake processors. All in all, this is a fast and beautiful laptop but one with some flaws to consider. And ouch, that price tag is steep. Read our MacBook Pro 2016 review. 13. Lenovo Yoga 900 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 February 16 RRP: From £1199 (model reviewed £1499) The Lenovo Yoga 900 is a laptop that really asks you to believe in its design style. After all, it doesn’t come cheap and for the price you can get a laptop with much more power if you’re not out for something immensely portable. That’s where this laptop excels: portability. As well as being slim, light and all-round lovely, the smart hinge lets it sit where most other laptops just can’t. The battery should last through a full day’s work as well. The trackpad can feel fiddly and the display isn’t perfect, but if you’re feeling flush this is one of the top ultraportables around. Read our Lenovo Yoga 900 review. 14. 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £849 (with 128GB storage), £999 (with 256GB) Buy from Apple After some extensive testing, we found the MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) to be little different overall to the 2014 model. The Thunderbolt 2 update will prove useful for connecting to high-resolution UHD displays, and a few percent of added processor power is never unwelcome. But hoped-for improvements in graphics performance and battery longevity did not arise in our testing, in spite of a new Intel processor which was expected to shepherd benefits in both areas. Launched at the same price as last year’s model it still deserves attention as one of the finest ultraportable laptops available - doubly so now that its flash-drive speed has shot up another 100 percent - and it will remain the more affordable option in lightweight notebooks when the new MacBook launches this month. Read our 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) review. 15. Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Rating: Reviewed on: 14 September 16 RRP: £799 The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 tells you larger convertible laptops have truly entered the mainstream. It’s reasonably affordable, still looks good and has the roughly the same power as some laptops costing way over £1000. Down sides include that the screen isn’t as colourful as the best and that the casing is made of plastic rather than something fancy like aluminium or a magnesium alloy. Oddly enough, though, it actually fits in well among its more stylish peers. Read our Dell Inspiron 13 5000 review. 16. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £749 (model tested £1079) There is a great deal to like and rave about the Surface Pro 4. The design is thinner and lighter for starters. The screen is awesome, there's plenty of power available, the new Surface Pen is better and the Type Cover is a vast improvement on the last one. However, the design is inherently awkward at times, it's more expensive that a lot of laptops and the Type Cover, which you'll pretty much need, isn't included lowering the value. Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review. 17. Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 January 16 RRP: From £639 A very decent laptop replacement, and an okay tablet, the Surface Pro 3 is undeniably impressive. If you need a single device to do everything we can't think of any better device. And when you consider the cost of buying a discrete laptop, tablet and desktop PC the Surface Pro 3 is priced to shift. The question remains as to whether people want a single device rather than multiple gadgets that are better at their individual tasks. Microsoft's latest results suggest that Surface Pro 3 is winning hearts and minds. Has it won yours? Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review. 18. Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Rating: Reviewed on: 5 January 17 RRP: From £1099 (model tested £1499) The Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA is an extremely light laptop and one that doesn’t compromise performance or kill battery life as a result. It’s also more affordable than some of the alternatives, particularly in its entry-level spec. However, we’re not convinced about all the choices Asus has made. A single USB-C port won’t cut it for a lot of buyers, the ultra-slim keyboard isn’t great for long-form typing and the trackpad’s clicker mechanism has some real issues. The trackpad also seems a bit pointless when it’s reliability is mediocre, even if it’s down to Microsoft’s software. Its portability is just about unbeatable, but some of you may prefer the more accommodating style of the Dell XPS 13 or one of Asus’s cheaper ZenBook models Read our Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA review. 19. Acer Swift 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 17 January 17 RRP: £999 Whether the Acer Swift 7 is the right laptop for you depends on how much you care about its 10mm thickness. If you don’t mind adding a millimetre or five, you can get laptops with more power and better connectivity for the same price. Hardcore users take note. However, if you like the look and the slim frame means a lot to you, the Swift 7 is a very solid option. A great trackpad and slim-but-decent keyboard make this a very enjoyable laptop, particularly as it can last through a day’s work of light tasks. Read our Acer Swift 7 review.

First, he built Google Brain, now the hub of AI research inside the internet giant. Then he built a lab in the Valley for Baidu, the company known as the Google of China. Ng was one of the primary figures behind the enormous and rapid rise of AI over the last five years as everyone from Facebook to Microsoft rebuilt themselves around deep learning. And on Tuesday night, he announced his departure from Baidu. He didn’t say where he was going. And he didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment. But odds are, he will show up at some other big name sometime soon. AI researchers are among the most prized talent in the modern tech world. A few years ago, Peter Lee, a vice president inside Microsoft Research, said that the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher was comparable to the cost of signing a quarterback in the NFL. Since then, the market for talent has only gotten hotter. Elon Musk nabbed several researchers out from under Google and Facebook in founding a new lab called OpenAI, and the big players are now buying up AI startups before they get off the ground. More AI Cade Metz Intel’s Bold Plan to Reinvent Computer Memory (and Keep It a Secret) Cade Metz OpenAI Joins Microsoft on the Cloud’s Next Big Front: Chips Klint Finley Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived Today, this talent market may have shifted yet again. Chipmaker Intel just announced that it’s building a lab for far-looking AI research, and company vice president Naveen Rao says Intel is prepared to pay up for the caliber of talent that now works inside Google Brain or the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research Lab. “We’re looking for researchers that could potentially go to these other places,” he says, acknowledging the big dollars this will require. Asked if that could include a top name like Andrew Ng, he said, “Absolutely.” Such ambition shows just how large the AI movement has become. Intel is launching a lab not because it wants to ultimately build its own AI, but because it wants to sell the enormous number of computer chips that others will need to build their AI. Today’s AI movement revolves around deep neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. If you feed millions of cat photos into a neural network, for instance, it can learn to identify a cat. Typically, when a company like Google or Facebook trains a neural network in this way, it uses hundreds of GPU chips, graphics processors suited to this kind of math. And most of these GPUs come from nVidia, an Intel rival. Intel is hoping to build chips that replace GPUs. Last year, it acquired Rao’s chip startup, Nervana, for a reported $400 million, believing its tech can help mount this challenge. Now, with Nervana as an anchor, Intel is creating a new product development group dedicated to AI. Rao will oversee the group, and he says this effort will include a research lab that explores entirely new concepts in deep learning and related areas, all with an eye toward building chips that the Googles and Facebooks will want. “We’re actually going to have an emphasis on research—three, five, seven years out,” he says. In some sense, this move is Intel desperately trying to market itself as a serious alternative to nVidia GPUs. And at this point, it’s just not. But even that desperation underlines the importance of the new AI chip market, which is rapidly remaking computer data centers. If Intel actually hires people like Ng, maybe we can believe its hype—and the AI competition will get even fiercer. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The innovative new design, called 3D XPoint, combines the functions of two types of memory to create a data bank that runs 1,000 times faster than most hard drives. But Intel is keeping tight-lipped on how the new technology works and what it is made of. Scroll down for video  Intel's new  Optane  SSD is the first product to use the new technology, and is aimed at large scare internet servers.  The innovative new design, called 3D XPoint, combines the functions of two types of memory to create a data bank that runs 1,000 times faster than most modern computer storage. 3D XPOINT  Computers traditionally store data in two ways. The first is through hard drives, which can store large volumes of data for long periods, even when the computer is switched on and off. The second way is through separate memory systems called DRAM, which computers use to store short-term data that they need immediately. DRAM is a faster form of memory but is more expensive and holds less data than hard drives can. 3D XPoint can replace both of these pieces, according to Intel. Intel says that 3D XPoint is 1,000 times faster than any hard drive and can store 10 times more data than DRAM. 3D XPoint - pronounced 'three-dee cross-point' - was officially released this week, and was built and designed with hardware maker Micron. The technology is a computer 'building block' that acts like a Swiss army knife - it can handle several functions, replacing the need for separate components. 'This is truly transformational,' Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Wired. 'It allows architects - both at the PC level and the data centre level - to rethink how they build the system.' Mr Krzanich claims that this technology could revolutionise gaming machines and personal computers. But huge data centres owned by the internet's biggest companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon stand to gain the most. These companies are constantly in need of faster and cheaper ways to store vast reams of data as their user-base grows.

These companies build machines on an unprecedented scale could benefit a lot from Intel's new technology. But by only using one computing manufacturer for their machines, Google and Facebook run a risk of giving Intel too much power in negotiations. A choice of providers is more likely to drive prices down. This market shape has driven the technology industry for years, but Intel's new memory design could change that.

Intel says that 3D XPoint is 1,000 times faster than any hard drive and can store 10 times more data than DRAM. And Mr Krzanich said that Intel is already working with 'almost all of the big cloud service providers' to help them rewrite operating systems and other software to accommodate the new technology. He said Intel will not sell raw 3D XPoint memory to anyone else to keep its interior secret. 'We won't sell this in any other form but a finished product,' he told WIRED.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Mar 23, 2017 at 10:00AM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has enjoyed a near-monopoly in the server chip market in recent years, with a market share of roughly 99%. Its x86 chips are the standard, and without any real competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the only other x86 chip maker, Intel has been free to enjoy its dominance. Operating margin in Intel's data center segment has routinely topped 50%, and the growth of cloud computing has driven both revenue and profits higher. During 2016, the data center segment generated $17.2 billion of revenue and a whopping $7.5 billion of operating income. Image source: Intel. The company is now warning that data center growth will slow and margins will contract, reflecting a return of competition to the server chip market and its plan to bring server chips to new process nodes before PC chips. Intel expects sales of its server CPUs to grow by just 6% annually through 2021, and for its data center operating margin to drop to the low- to mid- 40% range. These lower estimates may not be pessimistic enough. Intel faces three distinct threats in the data center, all of which could eat away at its market share and its margins. The return of AMD AMD's server chip business has been insignificant for quite some time. The company was once a major force, with a roughly 26% unit share of the x86 server chip market in 2006. But it has been outclassed by Intel ever since, driving its market share down near zero. AMD will make its return to the server chip market later this year when it launches Naples, server chips built on its Zen architecture. AMD has already launched Ryzen, the PC version of Zen, and while reviews have been mixed, AMD has significantly closed its performance gap with Intel. AMD still can't compete when it comes to single-threaded performance, but Ryzen's copious cores and competitive pricing make the chips a clear winner for certain workloads. Naples will come with up to 32 cores, and AMD is touting memory bandwidth and input/output capacity as the key selling points. Compared to a comparable Intel Xeon chip, AMD claims that Naples will have 45% more cores, 60% more I/O capacity, and 122% more memory bandwidth. If Ryzen is any indication, Naples will certainly be superior for some workloads, but it's unlikely to best Intel in general. Still, Naples should make AMD a player in the server chip market once again, forcing Intel to compete for the first time in years. Exactly how much market share AMD will be able to win is anyone's guess, but it's all downside for Intel. The push toward an architecture-agnostic cloud Beyond AMD and x86 chips, there are two other threats to Intel's server chip monopoly. ARM chips are finally making their way to the data center, with Microsoft recently announcing that its Project Olympus server design now supports both x86 and ARM chips. The company is already testing ARM chips from Qualcomm and Cavium for search, storage, and machine learning, and it has created a version of Windows Server for ARM processors. Microsoft isn't the only cloud computing company looking to lower its dependence on Intel. Alphabet's Google announced last year that it was developing an open server architecture that supports the upcoming POWER9 processor from IBM. Google's toolchain fully supported POWER at the time of the announcement, allowing the company to use POWER processors in conjunction with chips from Intel. The push from the major cloud infrastructure providers to support different architectures isn't surprising. Shifting from a world where Intel is the only option to a world where there are a multitude of options will surely bring server chip prices down, allowing cloud computing to get cheaper and further eat into the traditional server market. The glory days of Intel's server chip empire are coming to an end. The data center segment will continue to throw off plenty of cash for Intel, but market share and margins are going to take a hit. It's impossible to predict exactly how much share Intel will lose, or how far its margins will fall. But it's safe to say that Intel's server chip monopoly isn't long for this world.

Jason Hall, Travis Hoium, and Brian Feroldi (TMFVelvetHammer) Mar 23, 2017 at 9:29AM Dividend stocks can make for a wonderful part of any investor's portfolio. And while low interest rates have helped drive a lot of dividend stocks up to premium valuations, there are still solid dividend investments to be had if you're patient and know what to look for.  We asked three of our contributors to write about some of their favorite dividend ideas -- specifically, dividend stocks investors should put on their shopping lists right now. They gave us Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), with its reasonable valuation and dividend-growth prospects; chipmaker giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), with its aggressive move into what could be a trillion-dollar industry; and Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), which has grown its payout every year for almost five decades, while still having plenty of growth left in its future.  Image source: Getty Images. Shopping for great dividend stocks? Keep reading to learn why these three companies should be on your list.  Banking on dividend growth  Jason Hall (Bank of America): There are legitimate reasons to be concerned about what megabank Bank of America's (BofA) stock will do in the short term. Like most financial companies, BofA saw its shares go on a tear following the election of Donald J Trump as President of the United States, setting expectations that it would benefit from reduced regulations, lower taxes, and a more business-friendly federal government, in general. At the same time, it's expected that interest rates will rise, a belief that was recently confirmed when the Fed voted to raise overnight rates by 25 basis points.  But a lot of the thesis above is based on hopes for potential actions by the Republican administration and congressional majority, and not anything that's actually happened so far. For this reason, along with other concerns, Bank of America shares have fallen more than 10% since the beginning of March.  More millennial homebuyers is one thing that could help drive profits for BofA. Image source: Getty Images. Yet even with the uncertainty about the potential easing of bank regulations and concerns about Bank of America's stock price falling in the short term, the company is still worth a high spot on your short list. Its shares trade for right around book value, which is cheap compared to almost every other big bank. Furthermore, interest rates are going up, which should drive higher profits for Bank of America. This will likely allow it to increase its dividend. CEO Bryan Moynihan wrote about this, at length, as being a priority in his most recent letter to shareholders. While BofA's dividend only yields 1.2% at current prices and payouts, this could be an excellent time to invest in future dividend growth. There are a few things to keep an eye on, but the odds seem better than even that this big bank will be able to pump up its payout going forward.  A PC giant returns to form Travis Hoium (Intel): Tech companies tend to go in cycles, dominating one market and then missing out on the next, because they're still raking in money from the market that's being disrupted. But successful tech companies find a way to learn their lessons, and urgently enter the following market trend, returning to profitability.  Intel has made a big bet on autonomous vehicles. Image source: Getty Images. This is something that's going on with Intel. The company dominated the world of PCs, but when the market shifted to mobile devices, it was caught flat-footed, with chips that didn't meet customers' demands. Management has learned some hard lessons during the last decade, but after flopping in mobile, they're determined not to miss the next trends in the cloud, Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles.  The $15.3 billion agreement to buy Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) is an indication of Intel's seriousness in autonomous vehicles and connected devices. The deal gives Intel a front-row seat in the development of autonomous-driving technology, and will allow it to marry Mobileye's tech with Intel's data-center products. An integrated suite of products to offer to automakers and technology companies could be a winning combination, and something that would be tough for rivals to duplicate. What I think you're seeing now is Intel becoming a technology leader for the next generation of tech devices. And that's a great position for investors shopping in the tech sector.  A track record of success Brian Feroldi (Federal Realty Investment Trust): Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are a fertile hunting ground for income investors, since these companies are required by law to pay out 90% of their taxable income as a dividend. One REIT that I think is deserving a spot on any income investor's watchlist is Federal Realty. Physical retail is changing, but Federal Realty is well-positioned for the future. Image source: Getty Images. Federal Realty specializes in buying high-quality retail properties that are located in major coastal markets. The company's strategy is to own and operate properties that combine shopping, dining, living, and working in a single destination. These properties attract affluent customers, which, in turn, attract high-class tenants. That allows Federal Realty to charge a premium, which its customers are happy to pay. This strategy clearly works, as Federal Realty has increased its dividend for 49 years in a row. That's the longest track record of increases in the entire REIT industry, and it spans multiple periods of economic turmoil. You can't do that without a business model that works. While Federal Realty has been in operation for decades, it's still a growth company. Over the past five years, it has grown its funds from operations -- a REIT proxy for earnings -- by more than 7% annually. Between rent increases, acquisitions, and continued property development, I see no reason why it can't produce similar results on a go-forward basis. That makes Federal Realty a great stock to put on your radar. Brian Feroldi has no position in any stocks mentioned. Jason Hall owns shares of Bank of America and Intel.

Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers Display Drivers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Close Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Dell Is Exploring The Use Of Coreboot, At Least Internally Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 23 March 2017 at 08:46 AM EDT. 17 Comments Dell appears to be using Coreboot on some of their modern Intel Atom motherboards paired with the Intel FSP and TianoCore. An email sent by a Dell developer onto a public mailing list began with the marking, "Dell - Internal Use - Confidential." In there he comments on Dell using Coreboot, "We are using the coreboot project with Intel fsp to boot the Intel Rangeley based Mohonpeak CPU. We have built the Tianocore EDK2 project and used it as the payload to bring UEFI services to this bootloader." The developer went on to ask a question to Coreboot developers about booting multiple UEFI operating systems when Coreboot is running on the board. Mohon Peak is the Intel codename for Atom C2000 series processors, for newer Atom-based x86 servers. These Rangeley CPUs have been around for a few years now, based on the older 22nm process. But still that's a more appealing platform than many of the even-older Intel/AMD platforms where Coreboot/Libreboot is commonly used. The message was posted to the public Coreboot mailing list. It will be interesting to see if Dell ends up releasing systems/motherboards making use of Coreboot. But keep in mind, this would likely be for their server/workstation products where there would be greater demand rather than in consumer products. And their current usage of Coreboot at least with this Rangeley/Mohonpeak is an older Intel platform. Lastly, they are still making use of the Intel FSP (Firmware Support Package) and thus isn't a libre system with still mixing binary blobs with Coreboot. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see what comes of this. 17 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It's an online exclusive priced at £2600/$2700. Still no M.2 SSD though... It's hard to believe that the Corsair One comes from the same company that designed the Bulldog, a small form factor PC so monstrously ugly that the mere thought of placing it in a living room was enough to set off a spousal gag reflex. Where the Bulldog was a confused mishmash of jaunty, l33t gamer angles, the One is sleek, sophisticated, and—dare I say it—even a little grown up. That Corsair continues to sell a slightly updated version of the Bulldog is something of mystery considering just how good the Corsair One is. Of all the small form factor (SFF) PCs I've tried—and there have been quite a few over the past year—it is by far the best. I'd even go as far to say it's one of the best pre-built PCs you can buy, full stop. At £2,300 for a fully loaded version, the Corsair One isn't cheap by any means—and as always, going the DIY route can lead to substantial savings—but few homebrew PCs have such a tiny footprint. Fewer still do so while being entirely liquid cooled, graphics card and all. It's a combo that results in a PC that doesn't just fit into the living room environment aesthetically, but acoustically too. And, unlike the entirely custom hardware of the Zotac EN1080, you can even upgrade it. Dual radiators FTW Well, sort of. The Corsair One does indeed feature standard hardware. Inside is a mini-ITX motherboard by MSI. There's one of Corsair's 400W, 80 Plus Gold rated modular SFX power supplies, two sticks of Corsair Vengeance 2400MHz DDR4 RAM, and a socketed Intel Kaby Lake 7700K processor. A riser cable wraps around from the single PCIe slot to the backside of the motherboard, where there's space for a triple-slot graphics card. Extension cables then bring HDMI (1x) and DisplayPort (2x) to the rear of the case. Further ReadingZotac Zbox EN1080 review: Console-sized 4K PC gaming, but by Jove it’s expensive But in the fully loaded version of the One, both the GTX 1080 graphics card and the CPU are liquid cooled by two separate all-in-one 240mm radiators, which flank each side of the One's case behind vented aluminium panels. Corsair doesn't intend for the One to be user serviceable—although getting inside just involves pushing a button and undoing four screws—but replacing the CPU is an easy enough task, as is upgrading the 2.5-inch SATA SSD, which sits insides a simple plastic slot. The Corsair One is tall, but quite slim and with a tiny footprint. Mark Walton The sides of the Corsair One have a rather pleasing fractical texture thing. Mark Walton Backside.

Mark Walton The top fan can be removed like so... Mark Walton ... revealing the PSU and graphics card. Mark Walton Mark Walton Mark Walton Mark Walton It's unlikely, especially if the rumoured roadmaps for Intel's Coffee Lake architecture hold water—that anyone would want to upgrade the CPU in the near future, but the graphics card is a different story. You can already buy a GTX 1080 Ti, and in year's time both Nvidia and AMD will have entirely new architectures on the market. The MSI-made graphics card is cooled in a similar fashion to the CPU, with a 240mm radiator. But as anyone that's tried to fit a liquid cooler to a graphics card can attest to, it's a far more involved affair than replacing a CPU, particularly since the VRMs and memory modules still need to be air-cooled. If you're skilled enough, it may well be possible to swap out the GTX 1080 for another Nvidia card with a similar board layout and keep the same cooler. Or, you could just ditch the liquid cooling entirely—or opt for the cheaper air-cooled version of the Corsair One—and install a blower-style card. But doing so ruins one of the best things about this PC: this is by far the quietest SFF system I've ever used. Enlarge / Here's a reminder of what the Corsair Bulldog looked like, just in case you'd successfully managed to purge it from your memory.You might have noticed the lack of mention of any fans, and that's because the Corsair One has just one. At the very top of the case is a single 140mm fan—one of Corsair's fancy magnetic levitation fans that promises quieter operation—which relies on assisted convection to draw air through the side panels, over the radiators, and out of the top of the case. It's similar to how Apple keeps the Mac Pro cool, but by using radiators and liquid instead of a central heatsink. It works extremely well. I don't have a way to test sound levels here in the office (consider it something we're thinking of adding to our tests), but Corsair claims that in an anechoic chamber it recorded an idle noise level of 20dBA, or about as loud as a whisper from three feet away. The system is certainly more audible while gaming if you're sitting right next to it, but over a larger distance (such as in the living room), or perhaps in a closed cupboard, you'll hardly notice it. In both cases, the fan sound is soft and dull and quite unlike the high-pitched whine of a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

But last minute negotiations Wednesday to bring conservative hardliners on board seems to have repelled another key voting bloc—Republican centrists. Now GOP leaders, who strategically scheduled the repeal vote to take place on the seventh anniversary of Obamacare becoming law, are scrambling to whip up support. Story Continued Below Losing the repeal vote would be a huge blow to President Donald Trump’s fledgling administration and could significantly undercut House Speaker Paul Ryan’s power and his relationship with the White House. "I believe this is it. It's do or die," said Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump ally. "If this goes down, we don't get tax reform, we don't get infrastructure … We may lose the Senate. We may lose the House." Moderate Republicans huddled with GOP leaders on Wednesday night but emerged from the two-hour meeting without reaching a deal. A sign of how perilous things appear: Rep. Charlie Dent, leader of the centrist Tuesday Group, is opposing the bill. “After careful deliberation, I cannot support the bill and will oppose it,” Dent said in a statement after leaving Ryan’s office. Mo’ changes, mo’ problems: After a push from the White House, GOP leaders tried to placate conservatives by offering to gut minimum coverage requirements (like maternity care and mental health services) insurers must provide under Obamacare. But the move backfired big time: Not only did moderates push back, but many Freedom Caucus members still refused to commit to the bill, instead pushing for more changes like nixing protections for folks with preexisting conditions. Inside the minds of moderates: Moderates are still not sure how a possible last-minute rewrite of the bill could impact their constituents; and without an updated CBO score, just what kind of attack ads Democrats will throw at them in 2018. The other big issue for them: Centrists wonder why they should have to “walk the plank” on a risky vote for a bill that could either be stripped down by the Senate or die altogether in the upper chamber. Kyle, Rachael and Bres bring you the latest: http://politi.co/2nfgJC9 Across the Capitol: “This is merely a plot to get the bill out of the House. Provision won't ultimately survive in the Senate,” tweeted Matt House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s communications director. The magic number: With Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush expected to be absent today, there will likely be 429 voting House members. Since no Democrats will back the bill, Republicans need to secure the support of 215 lawmakers out of their 237-member caucus. That means they can only lose 22 votes and still pass the bill. If things weren’t already complicated enough, the all-powerful Koch network is promising to spend millions to protect Republicans who vote against the bill. Kevin Robillard reports: http://politi.co/2nfm8tf LATER THIS MORNING: The House Freedom Caucus will huddle with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House at 11:30 a.m. And GOP leaders insist the House will vote on the repeal at some point today. Rachael, Bres and Kyle have all the details on how Trump is wooing hesitant Republicans, including charming them with the Oval Office: http://politi.co/2nfZcK4 NUNES RILES UP INTEL DEMOCRATS — House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes surprised many Wednesday by announcing that members of Trump’s transition team, possibly including the president himself, were under inadvertent surveillance after the presidential election. Trump and his allies immediately seized on the news as vindication for the president’s widely rebuked claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones. Nunes made clear that he doesn’t have evidence to support Trump’s wiretapping allegations. But his unusual decision to go straight to the White House -- and the press-- before briefing Intel Democrats had the panel’s minority members fuming. Intel ranking member Adam Schiff said Nunes, a member of the Trump transition team, needs to decide whether he’s a surrogate for the White House or the leader of an independent, fair probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. “Because he cannot do both,” Schiff told reporters. Austin with more: http://politi.co/2nfZX61 Related: Information from U.S. officials suggests Trump associates may have coordinated with the Russians, CNN reports. Separately, Schiff said Wednesday there is “more than circumstantial evidence now” to prove Trump's campaign may have colluded with Russia, Madeline Conway reports. WHAT THE HILL IS READING — President Trump’s interview with Time, posted at 6:20 a.m. Trump defends his wiretapping allegations: “I have articles saying it happened.” And says he will “be proved right” about baseless claims that millions of people illegally voted against him in the election. Trump also highlights House Intel leader Devin Nunes’ surprise Wednesday press conference multiple times throughout the interview, even reading Austin’s story aloud. Quote du jour: "I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not. You know. Say hello to everybody OK?" Much more: http://ti.me/2nazjde TAKE ON THURSDAY. Welcome to March 23 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. WEDNESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: The Rachael, Bres and Kyle story about the current whip count for the House GOP repeal plan GORSUCH: FOCUS SHIFTS TO OUTSIDE WITNESSES — Across the Capitol, senators are heading into the final day of Neil Gorsuch’s marathon, four-day confirmation saga. Gorsuch survived nearly 20 hours of questioning over two days, doing little to damage his confirmation prospects, Josh Gerstein and Seung Min report. Now the focus shifts to outside witnesses, 26 of whom will testify for and against Trump’s SCOTUS nominee today. Get smart fast: Perhaps recognizing they won’t be able to keep Gorsuch off the highest court, Democrats spent much of Wednesday making impassioned pleas about issues dear to them, including abortion rights. But Democrats did dig in on Gorsuch’s evasiveness, dinging the nominee for refusing to provide detailed answers on hot-button issues. Josh and SMK with Wednesday’s top takeaways: http://politi.co/2ng3GR6 Just a little food for thought… A half-dozen Senate Democrats are going around their leadership and mulling a deal to allow Gorsuch’s confirmation in exchange for other concessions from Republicans, Burgess reports. “The deal Democrats would be most likely to pursue, the sources said, would be to allow confirmation of Gorsuch in exchange for a commitment from Republicans not to kill the filibuster for a subsequent vacancy during President Donald Trump’s term.” Much more: http://politi.co/2nfY89p -Conservative groups including the Judicial Crisis Network immediately panned the idea saying Republicans “would be fools” to agree to such a plan. ** A message from the Coalition to Protect America’s Health Care: The current bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act could slash the number of Americans that are able to afford or maintain health coverage. Speak up today and tell Congress: Don’t support the ACA replacement bill. http://politi.co/2nJDiMQ ** CAUGHT IN A BAD ROMANCE — Former Vice President Joe Biden had his own thoughts on the ongoing Russia saga when he was at the Capitol Wednesday. Biden said the public should absolutely be concerned about the “the notion that there’s still this romance with Putin.” And he specifically called out Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who plans to skip a NATO meeting in April and head to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin later in the month. “What in the hell are we doing?” Biden asked. CAPITOL CUTENESS ALERT — Your Huddle host was knee deep in a Biden scrum Wednesday when I felt something furry – yes, furry — rub up against my leg. The interloper turned out to be a ball of golden retriever fluff named, you guessed it, Biden. As it turns out, the pup belongs to a GOP staffer on the Hill and even has his own Instagram. And while we try to stay neutral at Huddle, let’s just say Biden might be giving Tilly, Sen. Thom Tillis’ office mascot, a run for the money. GIMME THE DEETS MAN — House Oversight leaders Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings are jointly requesting the White House hand over any security clearance applications filed by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The duo “sent letters Wednesday requesting information on Flynn from the White House, FBI, Defense Department and the director of national intelligence,” Austin reports. More: http://politi.co/2nflRGt ARRIVAL LOUNGE — Paul Tencher is joining Sen. Ed Markey’s office as chief of staff, the Boston Globe reports. Tencher was the architect behind Sen. Joe Donnelly’s upset win in 2012 and the campaign manager for Evan Bayh’s crash-and-burn Indiana Senate bid last year. TODAY IN CONGRESS — The Senate meets at 9:30 a.m. with a roll call vote to nix an Obama-era internet privacy rule possible before lunch. The House meets at 9 a.m. with votes on the Obamacare repeal expected at some point today. AROUND THE HILL — The AARP will have a human sized squirrel outside the Capitol South Metro starting at 8:30 a.m. to protest the “nutty” treatment of older people in the House GOP repeal bill. Sen. Bob Casey holds a conference call at 9:15 a.m. to announce how he will vote on Neil Gorsuch’s nomination. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi holds her weekly press conference at 10:45 a.m. in HVC Studio A. House Speaker Paul Ryan holds his press conference at 11:30 a.m. in HVC Studio A. House Democrats hold a press avail at 1:30 p.m. on the GOP repeal bill in HVC 215. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairmen Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison hold a press conference on the Obamacare repeal at 4 p.m. in the House triangle. OFF THE HILL — President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence meet with the House Freedom Caucus at 11:30 a.m. at the White House. WEDNESDAY’S TRIVIA WINNER — Claude Marx guessed that Rep. Mo Udall was a basketball star at the University of Arizona and later played for the Denver Nuggets. All the folks who also named Rep. Tom McMillen, a player at the University of Maryland and for several NBA teams, were also correct. TODAY’S TRIVIA — Claude with today’s question: Name the only person to have served as both a senator and a Federal Trade commissioner. The first person to correctly answer gets a shout out in tomorrow’s Huddle. And don’t forget, send suggestions for trivia questions my way: hcaygle@politico.com GET HUDDLE emailed to your phone each morning. ** A message from the Coalition to Protect America’s Health Care: The American Health Care Act could create tremendous uncertainty for families and individuals looking for affordable coverage. The health care bill could also limit benefits for current Medicaid enrollees and harm programs for our most vulnerable Americans — including children, the elderly, and the disabled. And these health care changes could affect us all by reducing our community hospitals’ ability to provide essential quality care. A decrease in health coverage and continued cuts to hospital funding will impact patient access to care and hospital services. Tell your senators and representative: Protect patients and access to care. Don’t support the American Health Care Act. http://politi.co/2n3wKeS ** « View Archives This story tagged under: Congress Most Read Republicans wonder whether Trump's heart was in healthcare fight Top Trump TV surrogate to leave high-profile post Paul Ryan Failed Because His Bill Was a Dumpster Fire Trump tweets: 'Do not worry' on health care; urges followers to watch Fox News host, who trashes Ryan How a secret Freedom Caucus pact brought down Obamacare repeal Need to reach Trump?

The company also announced new capabilities giving industrial manufacturers the power to leverage hardware-based security technologies and automated digital certificate management to harden devices and effectively enable scalable IoT deployments. Hundreds of companies, including Schneider Electric, Wind River, Intel, Infineon Technologies AG, DDC-I and GE have integrated Mocana's effective cybersecurity software into industrial control systems, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), cloud platforms, remote terminal units (RTUs), intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), device gateways and controllers. With the new platform, customers and partners are further protecting IoT devices and industrial clouds against sophisticated cyberattacks that are shutting down power grids, forcing massive segments of the Internet offline and threatening the safety of critical infrastructures. "When it comes to mission-critical IoT security, there is no middle-ground or acceptable margin for error. Hackers have demonstrated their ability to get behind firewalls and take over IoT devices. Once a hacker has control of an IoT device or controller behind a firewall, they can wreak havoc by manipulating flow controls, valves, compressors, power systems and engine controls that result in loss of critical services and loss of life," said William Diotte, CEO of Mocana. "The Mocana IoT Security Platform is the most comprehensive IoT security solution for industrial manufacturers that are concerned about cyberattacks on embedded systems, IoT devices and industrial cloud systems." The Mocana platform provides a full-stack solution for securing IoT systems from the endpoint, to the gateway, to the cloud and back again. The platform includes a unique, inside-out hardening approach that ensures endpoint and gateway trustworthiness, data and device integrity, authentication and confidentiality. The new Mocana IoT Security Platform provides software capabilities, a set of simple APIs and a path to utilize Mocana's planned management and analytics capabilities. The new Mocana IoT Security Platform builds upon the Mocana Security of Things Platform and includes significant innovations: Mocana Trust Engine: A vendor-agnostic trust abstraction layer that allows device manufacturers to take advantage of the latest security chip technologies, such as the Infineon OPTIGA® Trusted Platform Module (TPM), ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX and Intel EPID. Automated Certificate Management: Support for automated certificate management using Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) and trust chaining to ensure a lifecycle of trust for secure boot, secure firmware updates and trusted operations. Full Stack Platform: The full-stack architecture and strong cryptographic engine ensure authentication, integrity, confidentiality, visibility and control for devices, gateways and cloud applications. Simple API: The software abstracts the underlying hardware, enabling applications to call cryptographic functions through a single API. OpenSSL-compatibility interface allows customers to replace OpenSSL with a lightweight defense-grade crypto library. Mocana is trusted by more than 200 manufacturers and IoT companies, and its software is integrated with more than 70 chipsets, 30 operating systems and supports networking environments such as SSL, SSH, multicast, IPsec and wireless. Mocana plans to introduce management and analytics capabilities later this year to provide a new level of visibility and control into IoT devices. Industry analysts and leaders have validated Mocana's comprehensive approach to IoT security: "It has never been a better time to address security in IoT devices at the earliest stages of their development, because attackers are quickly learning that the systems supporting our critical infrastructure are increasingly interconnected," said Rob Westervelt, research manager, IDC. "The tools provided by Mocana are rooted in its long history of equipping engineers with the ability to harden devices that perform mission-critical operations. Manufacturers can now be equipped to leverage the power of the embedded chips in their products to support the security and privacy requirements of these emerging data-driven IoT ecosystems." "The need for end-to-end security has never been greater, particularly as legacy infrastructure and industrial systems are upgraded for greater connectivity," notes Steve Hoffenberg, director of IoT & embedded technology at industry analyst firm VDC Research. "Industrial IoT engineers must take it for granted that their systems will be under attack, and structure their defenses in a layered approach assuming that hackers may gain entry to the network. Paranoia is warranted." "As the IoT continues to grow, an increasing number of backdoors and vulnerabilities are discovered every day," said Joerg Borchert, VP of Chip Card Security of Infineon Technologies. "If enterprise-grade companies expect their users to trust in the inherent safety of their technology, they must ensure that advanced security is embedded directly into the device. Our partnership with Mocana focuses on this type of comprehensive security as we work toward providing customers with an easy and effective way to harden their operational technologies." "Mocana's new IoT software brings trusted, military-grade security, and cloud-based communications to safety-critical applications like connected commercial and military aircraft," said Greg Rose, vice president of marketing and product management at DDC-I. "We are excited to be working with Mocana and our joint customers to provide an integrated platform for safety-critical avionics applications that combines key pieces of their IoT software with our best-in-class DO-178 real-time operating system."

Intel released several Kaby Lake-based processors and 200 series chipsets including the Z270 in January. AMD's 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 were launched in early March and Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 Ti also hit store shelves in March. Intel also cut the prices for several of its previous-generation processors including Core i7-6950X and G328. Nvidia's GTX 1080 graphics cards also saw pricing drop from US$699 to US$499. Because of weak graphics card demand especially from China, players have already started cutting prices for their GTX 1060 (starting US$249) and GTX 1070 (starting US$379) graphics card to stimulate demand. Asustek Computer and Gigabyte Technology are expected to ship less than four million motherboards each in the first quarter, the lowest quarterly record in the past few years, while second- to third-tier players are expected to have even worse performances. Although AMD has already prepared new Ryzen 5 series processors, Polaris-based RX500 series GPUs and next-generation Vega series GPUs for the second quarter, the sources believe these products are unlikely to have a significantly contribution overall because AMD only has a limited market share currently. The sources pointed out that motherboard/graphics card players' overall shipments and revenues will see significant drops in the first half, but Asustek and Gigabyte are expected to see declines not as steep as the market's average thanks to demand from the gaming market.

At Aon, diversity isn’t just for International Women’s Day ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT MACHINES Revolution 4.0: Why the industrial internet of things is the perfect storm by John Kennedy 2 days ago89 Shares Image: John D Sirlin/Shutterstock The industrial internet of things could help to unlock economic growth in the 21st century. At the dawn of the machine age, debates are raging about robots stealing our jobs and how the internet of things (IoT) will automate our lives. The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is at the nexus of this debate. There are fears that robo-advisers, with algorithms rather than blood (or coffee) pulsating through their veins, will outwit their human counterparts in the race for office jobs or jobs on the factory floor. The evidence is convincing. ‘It is a perfect storm culminating in compute everywhere’ – BRIAN QUINN At Amazon, the number of robot workers taken on in the 2016 calendar year was up 50pc compared with a 46pc growth in human workers. In Japan, Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance is to replace 30pc of its existing workforce with AI bots powered by IBM’s Watson. Before we arm ourselves with hammers and pitchforks and start taking machines apart, the industrial future powered by IoT may not be quite as dystopian as we fear. There are parallels with history. In the early 19th century, English textile workers – remembered in history as the Luddites – smashed up machines because they feared for their livelihoods. And yet, within decades, the very automation they feared actually created more jobs in the long run. So maybe there is hope? IIoT is about making humans super Likewise, with IIoT, the key is greater efficiency and levels of productivity. In some cases, entire factories earmarked for closure because they are too expensive to run could be saved by reduced energy costs, for example. “We believe that the real power of artificial intelligence is to augment what humans are great at and make them better at what they do,” said Accenture CTO Paul Daugherty in an interview with Siliconrepublic.com two years ago. And this could be the bonus that industrial IoT offers: the ability to do more, at less cost and with greater efficiency. Lauren Morris, IoT country manager for Ireland and the Nordics at Vodafone. Image: Vodafone ‘Our studies show that businesses are seeing a 20pc improvement in cost management after enabling IIoT’ – LAUREN MORRIS The magic key here is the data that can only be gathered at the edge, from sensors in assembly lines and smart meters in electricity grids to IoT gateways on buses, motorways and in smart buildings. The IIoT is a new badge on something that has been happening for some time. In the 1990s, putting sensors on buses, cars and lorries was known as telematics. It was used as a way of ensuring assets such as trucks weren’t costing too much by idling in traffic or taking inefficient, fuel-draining routes. As the mobile revolution unfolded, sensors in trucks, lifts and factory floors were given SIMs and the area became known as machine-to-machine (M2M). This unleashed new opportunities. Formed above a shop in Terenure in 2004, Irish company Fleetmatics embraced this transition of telematics into the cloud and today, it connects close to 800,000 vehicles worldwide. Fleetmatics, the epitome of an IIoT play, was acquired last year by US telecoms giant Verizon for $2.4bn. Silicon on the edge Industry 4.0. Image: Zapp2Photo/Shutterstock And now, the silicon that sat in data centres and on PCs and smartphones is moving out to the edge, paving the road for the IIoT world to embed deeper into our lives and at a faster pace. Important advances in silicon technology, such as the move to 14nm and 10nm scale chips coupled with the advent of new wide-area, low-energy communications networks such as Sigfox, or the soon-to-be-deployed narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) standard by mobile operators, are accelerating the pace. Two years ago, Intel opened the latest of its Ignition Labs focused on IIoT in Leixlip. One of five across Europe, the Ignition Lab is focused specifically on areas such as smart homes and buildings, smart cities, smart cars, energy and utilities, and smart agriculture. It is working with Irish companies such as Glen Dimplex and Keenan to bring IIoT projects to life. Brian Quinn, director of European research programmes at Intel. Image: Intel ‘Look at the amount of data tech jobs that exist today as distinct from 10 years ago. Data analytics and data science as an industry didn’t exist before. The jobs are moving up the stack and becoming more challenging for humans’ – BRIAN QUINN Brian Quinn, director of European research programmes at Intel, explained that the IIoT is really a culmination of a number of technologies, from the silicon to the middleware and particularly wireless. “It is a perfect storm culminating in ‘compute everywhere’. Intel is putting technology into a lot of things. Gateways are a key component of an architectural topology for the IIoT, but also, silicon is going to the edge devices, like mechanical machines and robots. This is making machine learning and AI possible in places it wasn’t before, giving workers and employers greater flexibility and insight. “Compute at the edge is also important for the machine to make its own decisions.” Quinn cited the RealValue energy grid project that Intel is collaborating on with Glen Dimplex and SSE, which involves smart meters and data modelling in more than 1,250 homes. “By putting compute in edge devices like smart heaters and radiators, we will employ data fusion and data modelling to interpret the real energy needs of homes. Traditional energy grids were designed to handle peak load and coal stations had to be built to capacity to handle peak demand, and that was inefficient. Compute can predict demand better and understand consumer behaviour. “This will be complicated by the arrival of renewable energy. By being able to better predict and react to demand, utility operators will have a real sense of what they need to generate. We are also seeing an evolution in battery technology where electric cars can become a storage device in the home, power walls can be applied in homes and factories; and this is enabled through IIoT.” Quinn also cited the example of Trinity College spin-out SureWash, which use Intel RealSense cameras in hospitals to ensure medical staff wash their hands correctly using smart visual tagging and analytics. “The technology will make sure employees go through the tutorials, and the technology will determine if they are doing it right.” Is Ireland ready for the next industrial revolution? The old lament was that for various historical reasons, Ireland missed out on the industrial revolutions of the past. It was only in the latter decades of the 20th century that the country’s industrial policy began to take shape. And it has done so at an astonishing pace, becoming home to some of the world’s most advanced electronics and biotech manufacturing hubs. Aidan Quinn, PhD and deputy head with responsibility for materials and devices at Tyndall National Institute. Image: Tyndall ‘IIoT is going to change manufacturing and Ireland is well positioned to take advantage of this trend’ – AIDAN QUINN According to Aidan Quinn, PhD and deputy head with responsibility for materials and devices at Tyndall National Institute, there are around 4,000 manufacturing enterprises active in Ireland that, between them, employ more than 220,000 people directly. An additional job is created in the wider economy for each one of these manufacturing jobs. “Manufacturing is the backbone of the Irish economy. IIoT is going to change manufacturing and Ireland is well positioned to take advantage of this trend. “Smart manufacturing is adding intelligence to enable real-time decision-making, improve the quality of the process and reduce maintenance. This creates self-aware manufacturing systems.” Quinn said that when it comes to smart manufacturing readiness, Ireland is among the most advanced in the world. He pointed to a recent Roland Berger report, which showed that in Europe, only Germany had a slightly higher manufacturing share (percentage of GDP) than Ireland and a higher readiness level. Switzerland has the highest readiness level and a manufacturing share comparable to Austria.   Ireland is among the forerunners for Industry 4.0. Image: Roland Berger The report indicated that to assume a leading role in ‘Industry 4.0’, Europe will have to invest €90bn a year over the next 15 years. “The opportunity is there to keep Ireland at the forefront of manufacturing, and IIoT will be pivotal in terms of sustaining jobs, improving the productivity and competitiveness of manufacturing, as well as attracting new opportunities. “Smart manufacturing through IIoT positions Ireland at the crest of a wave. The Luddites and weavers became more productive once they automated the looms, going from manual weaving to increased productivity and, in turn, more employment. “Because of the global opportunity around IIoT, Ireland can lead and sustain jobs by reskilling and identifying new opportunities around services,” said Quinn. Already, AI and IIoT are creeping into the workplace in Ireland in various, unexpected ways, resulting in new business models for established companies. Nicola Mortimer, head of business products, marketing and operations at Three Ireland. Image: Three ‘It is not just the data that is valuable but entire new industries that are springing up around the data’ – NICOLA MORTIMER Nicola Mortimer, head of business products, marketing and operations at Three Ireland explained: “IIoT is enabling businesses to be proactive rather than reactive. Information coming from the sensors is fuelling new opportunities.” Mortimer cited TireCheck, an Ennis-based software company that is using IIoT sensors to help truck firms achieve greater efficiency by monitoring the condition of vehicles, from individual vehicles to an entire fleet. “It is not just the data that is valuable but entire new industries that are springing up around the data,” she said. According to ComReg, 12pc of mobile connections in Ireland are M2M-based and Three is responsible for 50.1pc of that figure. Three CTO David Hennessy recently confirmed that the company will be deploying NB-IoT in the coming year. Mortimer said that Three is gearing up for a wave of industrial digital transformation, and is establishing partnerships with players such as Cisco-owned Jasper to create an ecosystem to help businesses cope with IIoT. “The key thing for us is working with the partner ecosystem to help businesses, from start-ups to established companies, embark on the innovation journey. We can also access resources from our parent [company CK Hutchison Holdings], such as IIoT management platforms. IIoT is definitely a global play that helps businesses transform.” Data is king Image: Zapp2Photo/Shutterstock One example of an IIoT player growing fast in Ireland is Johnson Controls. Following a 2016 merger with Irish security systems company Tyco, Johnson Controls – a leader in the building technology space in energy, HVAC, fire and security – moved its global HQ to Cork. The company also leverages IoT to deliver intelligent buildings, efficient energy solutions, integrated infrastructure and next-generation transportation systems that work seamlessly together to deliver on the promise of smart cities. Donal Sullivan, country manager, Johnson Controls Ireland. Image: Johnson Controls ‘To me, it is an exciting time to be in IIoT because of the amount of compute that is becoming available at the edge’ – DONAL SULLIVAN Country manager Donal Sullivan agreed that the key here is greater levels of efficiency through data. “Smart buildings and smart cities are our core business,” he said. “Our Cork operation is primarily focused on engineering and innovation and, increasingly, our work is becoming like software engineering. Cybersecurity is also becoming more important.” Sullivan added that the magic of IIoT is efficiency and knowledge. “50pc of the running cost of a building is heating and cooling. Our challenge is to deploy the smart sensors and the intelligence to enable building owners and maintenance firms to use sensor arrays to detect people’s movements and pinpoint optimal comfort levels and never waste energy. This requires sensors, software platforms and data analysis. It is relatively easy to deploy in a brand new building but in reality, we are working with buildings that can be 30 or 40 years old. This requires different sensor layers that can gather the intelligence, compute, calculate and deliver a level of precision around heat and light. “To me, it is an exciting time to be in IIoT because of the amount of compute that is becoming available at the edge. “These new levels of functionality add to the asset value and reduce the operating costs. “If you look at the overriding trends in the world, such as growing populations and increased urbanisation, you need to minimise the impact on the world’s resources and provide comfort at the lowest cost. Inexorably, the promise of IIoT is integral to that.” Efficiency at scale Image: Zapp2Photo/Shutterstock Two years ago, mobile operator Vodafone joined forces with EMC (now owned by Dell) to invest €2m in an IIoT testbed to enable businesses to test potential IoT deployments. Lauren Morris, IoT country manager for Ireland and the Nordics at Vodafone, explained that interest in IoT among business leaders is at an all-time high. She cited Vodafone’s latest IoT Barometer, which showed that 63pc of businesses expect to have live IoT projects within a year, and that businesses now spend 24pc of their IT budget on IoT, ahead of mobile, cloud and analytics. “The key word here is ‘efficiency’. As well as automating the supply line, 42pc of customers save money and gain efficiency by monitoring the assets in their supply line; for example, in the case of carmakers, the process of moving a car from manufacturing to the showroom. “There is a huge focus on asset management, reducing system downtime and ensuring that heavy plant machinery and equipment is always optimised. “Our studies show that businesses are seeing a 20pc improvement in cost management after enabling IIoT.” Vodafone is working on IIoT in Ireland with agriculture equipment maker Keenan. “They are focusing on ensuring that agribusinesses can operate in a very precise way to optimise food production and ensure the best possible milk and beef output.” Globally, Vodafone is also working with lift company Kone. “IIoT enables them to know in advance if something is about to go wrong with their lifts or travelators, and proactively prevent downtime.” Morris said that Vodafone is planning to commercially launch NB-IoT in Ireland this summer. “The key difference that NB-IoT will bring is that it will connect assets that were previously hard to reach such as underground. “Companies like Ryanair and Sisk rely on IIoT to support their growth by ensuring high availability of critical assets. “IIoT is very much a part of the Gigabit Society, and will be key to businesses being efficient and taking the cost out of their business.” As the march of the machines continues, proponents of IIoT believe that the opportunities to come from data will create new jobs, not take them away. “IIoT is about producing more things – better things – and more cost-effectively,” said Brian Quinn. “Look at the amount of data tech jobs that exist today as distinct from 10 years ago. Data analytics and data science as an industry didn’t exist before. The jobs are moving up the stack and becoming more challenging for humans. “The industrial internet of things is at the heart of this.” Updated, 4.32pm, 23 March 2017: This article was amended to clarify that CK Hutchison Holdings is the parent company of Three.

The Linux Foundation Persistent memory, unlike volatile memory, retains its contents even if the server has a power failure. However, as Tomasz Kapela, Software Engineer at Intel, points out during his LinuxCon Europe 2016 talk, persistent memory is hard to achieve. Since persistent memory programming is non-trivial, they have been focused on making it easier for the end user and for applications to use persistent memory correctly.  Kapela starts off by describing the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) programming model created by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), which is an organization focused on standards for storage and networking. The NVM programming model basically describes using a persistent memory device that allows you to mmap a file to your virtual memory inside of the process where you can do loads and stores and flushes onto the memory device without really involving the kernel of the file system.  As part of the NVML team, they have a set of open source libraries designed to work on Linux and tackle the problem of persistent memory programming. The libraries include: libpmem: The basic library, flush to persistence libvmem: Volatile Memory Allocator libvmmalloc: Transparent use of libvmem libpmemblk: Persistent memory carved into blocks libpmemlog: Log file (append-mostly) libpmemobj: Transactional Object Store To address some of the pain points and limitations of using C for persistent memory, Kapela discussed how they are using C++ to develop persistent memory extensions to libstdc++ and libc++. He talked in detail about how they are encapsulating type info into a smart pointer, and making life easier with RAII and lambdas for transactions. With the increase in container usage, they are also working on a proof of concept for persistent memory containers.  Watch the video of Kapela’s entire talk to get all of the details about the persistent memory extensions to libstdc++ and libc++.

The AMD Ryzen 7 1700 is the entry option in AMD’s new range of Ryzen 7 CPUs. Priced at just £330, it still offers an identical feature set to the £500 Ryzen 7 1800X and is by far the cheapest current-generation, eight-core processor you can buy. However, its clock speed is lower than the 1800X and lower still than its most direct competitor the quad-core Intel Core i7-7700K. Naturally this means it’s less suited to fast, single-threaded applications such as games, but it will happily power through multi-threaded workloads such as video encoding. As such, it’s an intriguing proposition. AMD Ryzen 7 1700 – Design and Features The Ryzen 7 1700 is almost identical to the Ryzen 7 1800X in every way. It looks the same, it has the same number of cores (8), it can deal with the same number of threads (16), it’s unlocked for easy overclocking and it fits in the same motherboards. There are just three differences between it and AMD’s current flagship CPU. The first is clock speed. The 1700 has a base clock speed of 3.0GHz and can boost its cores to 3.7GHz. The 1800X, on the other hand, starts at 3.6GHz and boosts to 4.0GHz. That may not sound like much of a difference given the similar boost clock speeds, but since boost clocks aren’t guaranteed for any given workload, it’s the base clock that's more important. This applies even more so when you compare the 1700 to its nearest price competitor from Intel, the Core i7-7700K. This is only a quad-core chip but it has a base clock of 4.2GHz and boost of 4.5GHz – that’s a huge advantage in raw clock speed. Related: Best Graphics Cards However, this allows for the second key difference between the 1700 and 1800X, which is that the latter has a TDP of just 65W. That’s an astonishingly low amount of power for an eight-core processor. By comparison, the 7700K has a TDP of 91W, the 1800X's is 95W and the eight-core Intel Core i7-6900K is 140W. The final difference between the 1700 and 1800X is that "X" on the end, which signifies that the 1800X can further boost the clock speed of one core by 100MHz, while the 1700 can only do so by 50MHz. And that's your lot; this is simply a relatively low clock speed version of the 1800X. So if you’d like to learn more about what makes this processor actually tick then you can read the 1800X's review, which includes more of an overview of AMD’s new Zen CPU architecture at the heart of the chip. The upshot is that the 1700 is potentially ideal for those seeking huge eight-core multi-threaded processing power for tasks such as video encoding, batch photo editing, file compression, encryption, professional 3D rendering or scientific calculations – but on the cheap. However, it's less suited for what most home users actually need from a CPU: fast, single-threaded performance. Most programs, including the majority of games, still benefit most from having a single-core run as fast as possible, which is the reason that the majority of laptops can still get away with having just dual-core processors. As such, a potentially crucial aspect of the 1700 is how well it overclocks. If it can be pushed closer to a 4.0GHz base clock speed then potentially it will still be a great option for single-threaded tasks. Note, however, that when talking about the 1700 not being as good as faster-clocked alternatives, it’s all relative. This processor will still provide close to all the performance that most home users will ever need, even in single-threaded tasks. For general day-to-day tasks it’s more than powerful enough, while the difference in gaming will only come to light in situations where you’re not otherwise limited by the speed of your graphics card and are running at ludicrous frame rates. In such situations, where you'd achieve 180fps from a higher clocked chip, you'd get "only" 140fps with the 1700. Related: Best pre-built desktop PCs AMD Ryzen 7 1700 – The AM4 platform The Ryzen 7 1700 is, along with the rest of the Ryzen 7 lineup and the upcoming Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 processors, meant to fit in motherboards with the new AM4 socket. Although this will mean having to buy a new motherboard now, AMD has committed to continuing to support the platform with future CPUs. In addition, when Ryzen 5 (quad and six-core) and Ryzen 3 chips launch later this year, you'll be able to buy a motherboard and entry-level dual or quad-core processor safe in the knowledge that you can upgrade all the way to an eight-core chip without having to change the rest of your system. This isn't possible with Intel’s current CPU lineup; its six- and eight-core chips are only available if you buy more expensive LGA 2011 motherboards. AM4 is supported by five new chipsets: the X370, B350, A320, X300 and A300. All will support the range of Ryzen processors but only the X370, X300 and B350 will support overclocking; and only the X370 and X300 will support SLI/Crossfire. There are currently only X370 and B350 boards available and they range in price from £80-100 for a B350 board to £150-£300 for X370 boards. AMD Ryzen 7 1700 – Zen Architecture The Ryzen 7 1700 is based on AMD’s new Zen CPU architecture, which replaces the Bulldozer architecture that the company has relied on for the past several years. The main focus of its development has been to improve power efficiency and instructions per clock (IPC) – the number of calculations the chip can do with each core for each tick of the processors clock. The results – as seen in our 1800X review – are pretty spectacular, with the company improving IPC by 52% and hugely reducing power consumption. The new architecture also introduces simultaneous multi-threading, which is a similar technology to Intel’s Hyper-Threading, which allows each core of the processor to handle two workloads/threads at a time. As a result, and thanks to moving to the latest 14nm manufacturing, the 1800X was the first CPU from AMD that could truly claim performance parity with the competition from Intel – and, in turn, the first we’ve been able to outright recommend in the past ten years or so.

Actually, the older FX series from AMD are the cheapest 8 cores you can buy. Ed March 23, 2017, 1:12 pm Oh, you got me there. Will change to clarify - cheapest you'd consider actually buying! Thoughts March 23, 2017, 4:16 pm In the Cinebench R15 single-threaded benchmark, the Ryzen 7 1700 was actually 31% slower than the 7700K (as opposed to 44%). (7700K - 1700) / 7700K OR (193 - 134) / 193 = 0.3057 :) Paul17041993 March 24, 2017, 10:54 am I dunno, seems like the consumer interest for the FX's sparked when ryzen arrived, probably because of how cheap they are combined with clearance specials... Tyrann March 24, 2017, 5:59 pm wait till Ryzen 5 series comes out next month, it will annihilate the old FX on price/performance ratio even further lol Paul17041993 March 24, 2017, 7:41 pm of course, hence why the FX's would be on clearance specials Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant's purchase last week of Mobileye, which specialises in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. "A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns," said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. "Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location." The price was about 21 times Mobileye's expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix , an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York's Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded. Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defence tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signalled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. "It's an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies," said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung's Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as the "startup nation", Israel is maturing into a "scale-up nation", said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said. Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar's Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent. Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies "going the distance" by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. AUTOMOTIVE CENTRE Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. "All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources," said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. "If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product." With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing centre for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised $681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been "making the pilgrimage" to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential acquirers "will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either," Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel's most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company's growth. "There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A," he said. Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centres in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D centres in Israel, including Intel. "Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level," he said. "It's a win-win for both companies."

(AMD) Will Change the PC Industry Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War Recent Posts: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War AMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCs The New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You Think View All Posts When you think PCs, two companies always come to mind: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). During most of the Wintel partnership between these two companies, however, there has been a second supplier of computer CPUs. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has barely made a dent on Intel’s business, but that could change with AMD’s new Zen architecture chips. Source: AMD The newest version — the Ryzen 5 — is aimed at mainstream computing and Intel’s Core i5 lineup. AMD recently announced the new CPU will launch on April 11. Intel Dominates the CPU Market for PCs There is no question that Intel dominates the world’s PC market. Nearly nine out of 10 CPUs sold for use in computers carry the Intel logo. It’s the exclusive supplier for makers of premium computers, such as those from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), while rival AMD has tended to be shunted to the side as a less expensive option on some budget PCs. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, Intel was showing off its new Kaby Lake processors. The 7th generation of the company’s Core CPUs represent a slight improvement over last year, as part of Intel’s new three-phase “Process, Architecture, Optimization” product development cycle. In other words, a relatively boring year for Intel upgrades leaves an opening for the competition to make some noise, and AMD is doing just that with its new Zen architecture CPUs. The Ryzen 7 has already been released, but it is the Ryzen 5 that could really cause problems for Intel. AMD’s Zen Architecture and Ryzen 5 Built for PC Future AMD set out to win big with its new Zen architecture. While Intel has been content with delivering single-digit gains in performance per clock cycle, AMD says Zen offers a 52% improvement over its previous generation. The Zen chips –including the new Ryzen 5 — still lag Intel’s Core CPUs on single-thread performance. That means with software that’s not written specifically to take advantage of more than one or two simultaneous threads for faster processing, Intel still has the raw power edge and will offer superior performance. However, AMD is looking at high-processor-demand applications and the future of computing. That means software that takes full advantage of multiple cores and multiple threads per core — meaning multiple instructions can be processed simultaneously. The top of the line Ryzen 5 CPU has six cores and 12 threads, for $249. It goes up against an Intel Core i5 CPU priced at $240 with four cores and four threads.

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 BENGALURU: Intel is willing to collaborate with the Indian government and share its learnings to bring about a policy framework for flying drones in India. "I see the market in India is very scalable. But, of course, regulation and other policies have to come into view [for the industry to thrive]," said Anil V Nanduri, GM, Intel Unmanned Aviation Systems. The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had released a draft paper last year, which laid out certain guidelines for obtaining permission to operate drones in the homeland. However, a final draft policy is yet to be released by the DGCA. Nanduri said from an application standpoint, local needs for drones in each country is vastly different from others. From industry inspections to photography, rescue missions to remote surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a breadth of applications they cater to. "Having some kind of industry-government framework would be the best approach," he said.

Recently, the company made headlines for its light show at the Super Bowl halftime performance by Lady Gaga in which a swarm of 300 drones equipped with LED lights formed an American flag in the sky. Nanduri said the Super Bowl performance has brought in global attention for its UAVs. "You can create even brands and logos in the sky and can be used for advertising," he said, adding, Intel holds the current world record for the most number of UAVs airborne simultaneously. Nanduri believes that light drones are in many ways better than other sky lighters because of the pollution and the noise that accompanies fireworks. "Everything you see with the lights of the fireworks can be recreated in the sky using light shows," he said. While drones can be used for multiple applications, airspace regulations differ from place to place. "It is important that people who are building drones have a homogeneous framework in place," he said. For instance, the US lets people fly a drone under 400 feet and one has to obtain a license to be a commercial drone pilot. On the other hand, the draft po licy in India re quires the pilot to ob tain permis sion from local administration even to fly within 200 feet. If the airspace rules for drones are consistent worldwide, it would help drone companies scale operations quickly. “Having different rules for every country becomes a burden for development and drones have to be modified for different regions," Nanduri said. He added: "This is not going to be viable for manufacturers since there would be a manufacturing burden. The rules have to be consistent." Intel's RealSense technology helps in navigation and collision avoidance in drones. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Vaughan-Nichols (New Zealand Reseller News) 23 March, 2017 06:44 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Com1 International Dicker Data Hills Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Microsoft really wants all of us on Windows 10. And it's done asking nicely. For many users of Windows 7 and 8.1, upgrade cajolery just morphed into something that looks a lot like upgrade coercion. (It had already tried upgrade trickery.) I’m sick and tired of this. Windows 10 is OK, but I still prefer Windows 7, thank you very much. I’m not the only one. The Federal Digital Analytics Program (DAP), which gives the broadest and most accurate reading on operating system popularity, showed in mid-March that Windows 7, with 24.6 per cent of all users, is still far more popular than Windows 10, with which sits at 17.3 per cent while Windows 8.x comes in third, with 3.7 per cent. In short, there are still a heck of a lot more Windows 7 and 8.x users than there are Windows 10 users. But Microsoft has made it clear it wants everyone on a single operating system - namely Windows 10. Sure, Windows 7 will keep getting updates until Jan. 14, 2020 and Windows 8.1 will be supported until Jan. 10, 2023. That’s the good news. The bad news is that if you’re running either operating system on a PC with a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor or an AMD Ryzen Bristol Ridge CPU, your end-of-support date just became … today. Is that great news or what? We were warned this was coming. Microsoft told us last year that it wouldn’t keep supporting its older operating systems on AMD’s and Intel’s newest processors. Microsoft also won’t be supporting these operating systems on Qualcomm’s 8996 or newer processes. Read more ​Huawei pledges $400m to NZ innovation efforts Adding insult to injury, Microsoft got AMD and Intel to go along with this idea. An Intel spokesperson even said, “No, Intel will not be updating Win 7/8 drivers for 7th Gen Intel Core per Microsoft’s support policy change.” Thanks, AMD and Intel. We really appreciate you having our backs. Will Windows 7 and 8 even run on these hot new processors? I don’t know about AMD’s best and brightest, but I’ve had Windows 7 running on Kaby Lake. It runs just fine. There’s only one little problem. When Microsoft finally got around to releasing its latest patches, instead of getting them I got a message saying: “Unsupported Hardware — Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” Read more Ingram Micro brings NetEnrich to A/NZ Golly, Microsoft was serious. No soup — ah, old Windows for you! By the way, this latest patch package? It’s Windows’ largest ever and includes nine — count ’em, nine — critical patches. Thank you so very, very much, Microsoft. Is it reasonable of me to expect continued support? Well, when I look at Microsoft’s Windows Lifecycle support FAQ, I read, “All desktop operating system products, whether used for personal or business, receive a minimum of 10 years of support (minimum of five years Mainstream Support and minimum of five years Extended Support) at the supported service pack level.” But the relevant Microsoft Knowledge Base article states, “Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update.” Read more How IBM wants to bring blockchain from Bitcoin to your data centre Does anyone else see a little cognitive dissonance here? I see grounds for a lawsuit. If I were running a company that had paid Windows 7 and 8.1 licensing fees to keep getting support for a few more years, I’d be ticked. I’m not sure what the breakdown is for consumer versus business Windows users. But, given how conservative companies are, I’m sure most Windows corporate users are still running the tried and true Windows 7. Now that Microsoft is rubbing the enterprise’s nose into its refusal to support the most popular operating system on the fastest, newest hardware, I see this backfiring on Microsoft. Microsoft really, really wants to make Windows 7 and 8.x obsolete. Its customers, however, aren’t ready to let go of them anytime soon. Read more Melbourne cloud migration specialist to acquire WA's Cirralto Business Services If Microsoft doesn’t budge on this, I see corporate users giving Chromebooks and the Linux desktop more consideration. After all, neither of them will cut hardware support just to make you “upgrade” when you don’t want to.

The Venus is “believed to be the very first rugged small form factor single-board-computer” based on Intel’s 6th Generation “Skylake” Core processors, says Diamond Systems. This may well be true, depending on how you define “rugged” and “SBC.” Venus, front and back (click images to enlarge) Around the same time as Diamond Systems’ Embedded World announcement of the Venus, ADL announced a similarly 3.5-inch, Skylake based ADLQ170HDS SBC, which offers -20 to 70°C or optional -40 to 85°C support, the standard temperature range for the Venus. The same week, VersaLogic unveiled its Skylake-based Blackbird SBC, which offers optional -40 to 85°C and standard MIL-STD-202G compliant shock and vibration resistance. However, it’s a dual-layer, sandwich style board paired with a COM Express module rather than a classic SBC.   Venus details In addition to offering industrial temperature support, the Venus board furnishes latching connectors and a 2.3mm thick PCB. It also provides Diamond’s rugged RSODIMM RAM “for enhanced protection against vibration.” There are no specs or compliance claims for shock and vibration, but the newly updated Raptor embedded computer based on the Venus provides MIL-STD-202G compliant shock/vibration specs (see farther below). Venus detail view (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The 3.5-inch form factor, 146 x 102mm Venus supports one of two dual-core U-series Skylake chips: the 2.6GHz Core i7-6600U and the 2.4GHz Core i5-6300U. The processors are supported with Linux or Windows 10 BSPs, optionally preloaded on SATA DOM. The SBC provides 4GB of soldered DDR4-2133 RAM, as well as up to 16GB more DDR4-2133 RSODIMM RAM for up to 20GB total. The Venus is notable for supporting PCIe/104 OneBank expansion, which Diamond has also used on its Atom N2800 based Atlas, and which has appeared on other boards like VersaLogic’s recent, Intel Kaby Lake-based Lion SBC. The stackable, PCIe/104-Express compatible OneBank format includes both a legacy PCI connector and a high-speed PCIe connector. Here, the interface supports up to 4x I/O modules. The Venus also provides three mini-PCIe expansion sockets. There’s a half-size socket, as well as dual full-size sockets, one of which is dedicated to mSATA. The board also provides two SATA 3.0 interfaces, one standard and one designed for SATA DOM storage. Venus bottom view with heatspreader (left) and corner view showing thick PCB and latching connectors (click images to enlarge) The Venus provides triple display support with VGA and HDMI ports, as well as dual-channel LVDS with backlight support. Diamond claims that each is 4K ready on its own. The SBC provides dual GbE ports, as well as 6x to 10x USB ports overall, depending on how you count them. You get 4x 3.0 ports and 2x USB 2.0 ports, as well as two more 2.0 ports via OneBank, and two more via mini-PCIe. The Venus is further equipped with 4x RS-232/422/485 ports, audio I/O, MIPI–CSI, and 16x GPIO. You also get an RTC and a TPM module. The board runs at a typical 14W with a 9-18VDC input. Various cable kits are optional.   Raptor blasts off to Venus The Venus is also available on one of Diamond’s rugged Raptor embedded “mission” computers. While the Raptor systems are highly customizable, this appears to be the first processor upgrade since a 2014 model based on Diamond’s Vega, a COM Express module built around an Intel 3rd Gen “Ivy Bridge” Core processor. Raptor computer with Venus board (click image to enlarge) The Raptor computer with Venus offers MIL-DTL-38999 connectors, MIL-STD-202G shock/vibration conformance, MIL-STD-461 compliance, and an IP67 environmental rating, says Diamond. The 7.5 x 6.5 x 2.8-inch Raptor provides a variety of storage options, and enclosure customizations. Modifications include changes to the case size and finish, the connector types and finishes, as well as optional protection caps, additional heat sinks, custom mating cables, and custom labeling.   Further information The Venus will be available in May at an undisclosed price. Presumably, the revised Raptor will be ready around then as well. More information may be found on the Diamond Systems Venus product page.   Related posts: Rugged, Linux-ready sandwich style SBC packs Skylake CPUs Compact, rugged, Kaby Lake SBC features robust expansion PC/104 "OneBank" option targets SoC-based SBC… Rugged PC/104 SBC offers ISA, PCI, and PCIe expansion Rugged sandwich-style SBC runs Linux on Core Rugged, Linux-ready PC/104-Plus SBC offers onboard DAQ Rugged PC/104 SBC offers on-board analog I/O Rugged embedded box gets tough with Kaby Lake 3.5-inch Skylake SBC offers 4x SATA, 4x PCIe, and 5x USB 3.0 Rugged, Linux-friendly SBCs tap Atoms of today and yesterday (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 March 2017 by Military News Look Out NVIDIA, Intel Is Setting Its Sights on the AI Industry Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced last week that it would spend $15.3 billion to acquire Israeli computer vision and machine learning specialist Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY) in a move that will take the company further into the field of autonomous vehicles. Mobileye developed machine-vision software that would detect obstructions or hazards that a driver might not see to employ „collision avoidance technology” — all with a single camera. Its technology has evolved to employ a full set of cameras in pursuit of autonomous driving. Intel appears to be pursuing an end-to-end solution in self-driving cars, from software to hardware. This acquisition, along with several other recent moves by the CPU giant, indicate that the company is no longer content to cede the enormous potential of the artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving markets, and it is taking the fight to the one company that has the most to lose : NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) , the industry leader in graphics processing technology, which has experienced staggering growth as a result of the AI revolution. NVIDIA GPU Hyperscale Accelerator. Image source: NVIDIA. PC market slowing Intel’s CPUs have been the company’s flagship product for years, but that market has been falling along with worldwide demand for personal computers. Shipments of PCs were down 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of such declines. Successful penetration into new markets has been a priority for the company, which has made numerous acquisitions to bolster its AI credentials and allow the company to better compete in the market with NVIDIA. GPU Market booming In its most recent quarter , NVIDIA saw its data center revenue triple to $296 million from just $97 million in the prior-year quarter, largely because of the deployment of its GPUs in AI applications. The massive parallel processing capabilities of the graphics processors made them the early choice for AI applications. But Intel controls an estimated 99% of the non-AI data center market and is positioning itself to succeed in AI as well. AI Nervana Before this week’s Mobileye acquisition, AI start-up Nervana was Intel’s most high-profile move in the space to date. Nervana’s unique approach was the development of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the Nervana Engine, which eliminated elements from the GPU not necessary for AI processing. Coupled with a reengineered memory, the company claimed it could achieve 10 times the computing power than what was currently available on GPUs. Intel believes this product, combined with its existing platforms, will be able to compete directly with NVIDIA in AI applications. Intel Unleashing the Next Wave of AI. Image source: Intel. Soon after acquiring Nervana, Intel announced several additional products tailored for AI. Its Lake Crest CPU chip was designed for the workloads necessary to train deep neural networks and increase its mathematics operations by 10 times. The next generation of the company’s Xeon Phi processor, codenamed Knights Mill, was customized for deep learning, and it would produce four times better performance than the previous version. These products are scheduled to begin shipping in mid-2017. Intel has made numerous other acquisitions in the AI space: cognitive computing company Saffron focused on deep learning and data analytics; Itseez, a software company specializing in autonomous driving, drones, and cameras; and Movidius, which provides system-on-a-chip technology used in computer vision and AI deep learning. These acquisitions further illustrate that Intel is intent on increasing its foothold in this nascent but growing industry. Final thoughts Much of NVIDIA’s recent growth resulted from the adoption of its GPUs in AI applications. In its most recent quarter, revenue from its data center and auto segments — where AI revenue is reported — totaled $424 million, nearly 20% of the top line. Intel doesn’t break out revenue from AI or autonomous driving, so no apples-to-apples comparison is available. However, the company reported revenue of $16.4 billion in its most recent quarter, which illustrates that while similar gains from AI would only move the needle slightly for Intel, they would have a much greater impact on NVIDIA. So while the emerging technology represented by AI presents a long runway for growth and both companies stand to gain, depending on how things shake out, NVIDIA has much more to lose. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The idea is that purchasing a Surface Pro 4 or any of the devices that resembles it means you don’t have to purchase both a notebook and a tablet. Since Microsoft announced its first tablet that can be a notebook, all we’ve heard about are those types of 2-in-1s. We’ve all ignored another benefit of purchasing a Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro 4 doesn’t just make a great  tablet and notebook. It also makes a pretty great Windows 10 desktop PC. As a Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4 user, I’ve spent some time with the form factor at my desk. The way I see it, there are couple of different scenarios to get Surface Pro 4 users the best desktop experience. Pick The Right Surface Pro 4 Desktops are powerful, bulky beasts. They’re big because transporting them isn’t really that much of a concern. The Surface Pro 4 is a mobile powerhouse, a machine that was designed to be portable. At first, one might assume that it wouldn’t be that great at doing the things that desktops do: playing video games and editing video. Read: Which Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Should You Buy? That’s absolutely true of the entry-level Surface Pro 4 for $899. It’s not really great at playing the latest games at all since it doesn’t have a fan and uses less powerful internals. The Surface Pro 4s with Intel Core i7 and Intel Core i5 processors are better at those activities. Any Surface Pro 4 plan that involves the device doubling as a powerful desktop Windows 10 PC starts with those two models. The Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 Processor and 4GB of RAM starts at $999. If you really want the best performance possible, investigate purchasing a Surface Pro 4 with at least 8GB of RAM. The Microsoft Store sells all versions of the Surface Pro 4, including a model with 16GB of storage. Buy a Surface Pro 4 Dock Once you’ve acquired a Surface Pro 4, you need a way to charge the device and connect to accessories. Microsoft makes two docks for this task, both of which have advantages and disadvantages. The Surface Pro 3 Docking Station is a typical dock. There are no cables to connect. Instead, its two arms encapsulate the Surface Pro 4, on three sides. Built into it are three USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, Ethernet out and a Mini DisplayPort. The Surface Pro 4 Dock isn’t built specifically for the Surface Pro 4, which is why users need a free spacer from Microsoft to enjoy the $199 accessory. The Microsoft Surface Dock is this year’s docking option for the Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro 3 and Surface Book. It too costs $199. There are two front-facing USB 3.0 ports, a power port, Gigabit Ethernet, two more USB 3.0 ports and 2 Mini DisplayPorts on its rear. With this dock, you need to physically plug in a cable, but just the one. The dock itself does the rest. Other companies make compatible port replicators, but in those cases you’d need to plug your Surface Pro 4 into a charger, then have a separate USB cable running from the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft’s solutions are expensive, but simplistic. Use A Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse The next thing you’ll need are the typical accessories that desktops require. The Surface Pro 4 has two pretty loud speakers, but don’t hesitate to pick up external speakers if you feel like you need to. The Surface Pro 4 and Windows 10 support Bluetooth audio profiles. The docks and device itself all have 3.5mm headphone ports built-in. Bluetooth headphones work too, that’s what I use at my desk when playing music late at night and early in the day. Microsoft used to make a Bluetooth keyboard accessory for its Type Covers. It’s long since killed that device, betting that users would rather purchase separate keyboards and mice that offer better battery life and bigger keys. For the best results, go with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Microsoft makes the, entry-level Wireless Keyboard 850 for Bluetooth users. I personally use the Wedge Wireless Mobile Keyboard. It’s $79.95 – not cheap – but does have a thin profile. For a mouse, I recommend the $69.95 Surface Arc Mouse because it becomes very portable when you need it to be. That being said, anything you have around the house works fine too. You can go with USB mice and keyboards, but if you do you’ll need a USB hub or a Surface Dock. Remember, the Surface Pro 4 only has a single USB port.   I actually skipped the mini adapters, displays and docks in the early days. Instead, I purchased a Surface Pro Power Supply for $79.99 and a tablet stand that held up my Surface Pro 4. This method does hinder viewing angles somewhat, but it’s cost effective and keeps me from being surrounded by screens and accessories I don’t need. The stand I purchased from Amazon is long gone, but there are more available from other makers. Disable Tablet Mode Finally, remember to set your device to either ask you before switching in and out of Tablet Mode or turn off switching entirely. Read: How to Use Tablet Mode in Windows 10 Windows 10 is able to detect physical keyboards and make the switch, but not with Bluetooth accessories. My solution to this has been to manually toggle Tablet Mode on and off when I’m done with work using the Action Center. The Action Center is always a left swipe from the right edge of your display. Optional: Get a Monitor, Maybe With Touch On its own, your Surface Pro 4 is a great all-in-one PC in its own right. At least, it is if you’re comfortable with using a 12-inch display. If you aren’t, consider adding a widescreen monitor to your desktop setup to get more screen real estate. Which display you get really does depend on your tastes as a user. Some people like to get large monitors, then hide the Surface Pro 4 somewhere in their setup because they don’t need to monitors. Others prefer to keep the Surface Pro 4 and external monitor sitting side by side. If you’re going to hide the Surface somewhere in your setup, like a desk drawer, be sure that it has plenty of ventilation. Be sure that whatever monitor you do go with has matching connections for whatever dock you use too. Stay away from any monitor that has a VGA cable. For consistency, it might be better to with a monitor that supports touch. The Surface Pro 4 can be connected to a monitor even without a docking accessory. For this you will need a MiniDisplay Port adapter for whatever plug the display features. Microsoft makes a line of Surface Mini DisplayPort Adapters and a Wireless Display Adapter. Two monitors connect through the Surface Dock, but you can add a third running straight from the Surface pro 4’s body too. Microsoft frequently runs specials on Surface Docks and monitors at the Microsoft Store. Read: The Best Surface Pro 4 Deals Available The Surface Pro 4 gained a reputation for being a great tablet and a decent notebook. I’d make the argument that it’s also a terrific Windows 10 all-in-one with the right accessories. 16 Responses 02/13/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I understood that the pro 4 could handle 3 external monitors – 2 from the dock and 1 from the tablet. You say it is restricted to 2 monitors. Will it not handle a third monitor from the tablet’s mini DP port? 02/29/2016 Leander Reply Yeah it does, 2 monitors from the docking station. One from the surface it self. So 3 screens at the same time. I got the configuration running at this very moment. Two normal monitor’s and big presentation screen. 02/29/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply Thanks. I’m going to give the SP4 i7 16gb a try with three 27″ monitors. 03/05/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I bought the SP4 with dock and cables. Win 10 shows 4 displays, but will only use three, one of which is always the tablet. So I can get two of my three externals, but not three at once. Surface support told me I have to use a video hub to go to three. Is this what you have done? Or is a splitter enough? 03/22/2016 Matt Smith Reply What’s the recommended settings for the larger monitor, I’ve currently got it connected to another screen and the icons are massive and there’s black banding down the sides. 04/19/2016 Molly Hampel Reply This is a question not reply – i have a surface pro 4 with the docking station. The surface will go to sleep and when we wake it backup the external large monitor will not work. We thought it was the docking station but after trying two others it’s not. Any suggestions? Could the monitor not be compatible? 04/19/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I now run two ASUS 27″ monitors and the Surface tablet screen. The primary display is set as one of the 27″. When my Surface wakes up, the two large monitors also come alive – usually, but not always. Very occasionally, I have to go to display settings on the tablet screen and “extend the desktop” to the two large monitors. This does not happen often.

Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Mar 22, 2017 at 9:22PM Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced last week that it would spend $15.3 billion to acquire Israeli computer vision and machine learning specialist Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) in a move that will take the company further into the field of autonomous vehicles. Mobileye developed machine-vision software that would detect obstructions or hazards that a driver might not see to employ "collision avoidance technology" -- all with a single camera. Its technology has evolved to employ a full set of cameras in pursuit of autonomous driving. Intel appears to be pursuing an end-to-end solution in self-driving cars, from software to hardware. This acquisition, along with several other recent moves by the CPU giant, indicate that the company is no longer content to cede the enormous potential of the artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving markets, and it is taking the fight to the one company that has the most to lose: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the industry leader in graphics processing technology, which has experienced staggering growth as a result of the AI revolution. NVIDIA GPU Hyperscale Accelerator. Image source: NVIDIA. PC market slowing Intel's CPUs have been the company's flagship product for years, but that market has been falling along with worldwide demand for personal computers. Shipments of PCs were down 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of such declines. Successful penetration into new markets has been a priority for the company, which has made numerous acquisitions to bolster its AI credentials and allow the company to better compete in the market with NVIDIA. GPU Market booming In its most recent quarter, NVIDIA saw its data center revenue triple to $296 million from just $97 million in the prior-year quarter, largely because of the deployment of its GPUs in AI applications. The massive parallel processing capabilities of the graphics processors made them the early choice for AI applications. But Intel controls an estimated 99% of the non-AI data center market and is positioning itself to succeed in AI as well. AI Nervana Before this week's Mobileye acquisition, AI start-up Nervana was Intel's most high-profile move in the space to date. Nervana's unique approach was the development of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the Nervana Engine, which eliminated elements from the GPU not necessary for AI processing. Coupled with a reengineered memory, the company claimed it could achieve 10 times the computing power than what was currently available on GPUs. Intel believes this product, combined with its existing platforms, will be able to compete directly with NVIDIA in AI applications. Intel Unleashing the Next Wave of AI. Image source: Intel. Soon after acquiring Nervana, Intel announced several additional products tailored for AI. Its Lake Crest CPU chip was designed for the workloads necessary to train deep neural networks and increase its mathematics operations by 10 times. The next generation of the company's Xeon Phi processor, codenamed Knights Mill, was customized for deep learning, and it would produce four times better performance than the previous version. These products are scheduled to begin shipping in mid-2017.  Intel has made numerous other acquisitions in the AI space: cognitive computing company Saffron focused on deep learning and data analytics; Itseez, a software company specializing in autonomous driving, drones, and cameras; and Movidius, which provides system-on-a-chip technology used in computer vision and AI deep learning. These acquisitions further illustrate that Intel is intent on increasing its foothold in this nascent but growing industry. Final thoughts Much of NVIDIA's recent growth resulted from the adoption of its GPUs in AI applications. In its most recent quarter, revenue from its data center and auto segments -- where AI revenue is reported -- totaled $424 million, nearly 20% of the top line.  Intel doesn't break out revenue from AI or autonomous driving, so no apples-to-apples comparison is available. However, the company reported revenue of $16.4 billion in its most recent quarter, which illustrates that while similar gains from AI would only move the needle slightly for Intel, they would have a much greater impact on NVIDIA. So while the emerging technology represented by AI presents a long runway for growth and both companies stand to gain, depending on how things shake out, NVIDIA has much more to lose.

But it won’t tell the world what’s inside. The company calls this new creation 3D XPoint—pronounced “three-dee cross-point”—and this week, after touting the stuff for a year-and-a-half, Intel finally pushed it into the market. You can think of the new technology as a computer building block that can serve more than one purpose—a single thing that can replace several others. Popular Searches Syngenta AG SYT ▲ 88.12 +0.06 +0.07% Exxon Mobil Corp XOM ▼ 81.23 -0.63 -0.77% DNF Co Ltd 092070 ▲ 12,900.00 +200.00 +1.57% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 140.73 -0.20 -0.14% RELATED: Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived But the new tech also serves as a way for Intel to shift multiple markets in its favor. That’s probably why it won’t say what the memory is actually made of. Certainly, Intel doesn’t want others duplicating the technology, which it developed alongside hardware maker Micron. This chess game is worth watching because it could indeed change the way machines are built, most notably inside big internet companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies now build machines on a massive scale. They’re hardware markets unto themselves. And more than anyone else, they stand to benefit from Intel’s new technology. But a built-in tension exists here as well. Because they operate on such a scale, Google and Facebook don’t want their fate controlled by just one hardware supplier. They want choice, which brings efficiency by driving down prices. This dynamic is shaping the worldwide market for data center hardware. And Intel is pushing in the opposite direction. Traditionally, computers stored data in two ways. They stored most of it on hard drives, which could hold large amounts of information for long periods of time, even as machines were powered on and off—and do it pretty cheaply. But computers also used separate memory systems called DRAM to store the data they needed right now. This memory was much faster, but it was also more expensive and held less data. 3D XPoint can replace all those pieces—or so Intel says. “This is truly transformational,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich tells WIRED. “It allows architects—both at the PC level and the data center level—to rethink how they build the system.” Krzanich sees this technology redefining gaming machines and other personal computers. But that’s almost beside the point. A PC is a PC. Where this could really change things is inside the massive data centers operated by the internet’s biggest companies. As their online empires continue to grow, these companies always need faster and cheaper ways of storing ever-larger amounts of data. Over the past several years, they’ve already moved beyond hard drives to significantly faster flash solid state drives, or SSDs. Since even these drives aren’t fast enough in some cases, they’ve created a new breed of database that pushes massive amounts of data into memory. 3D XPoint could help in both those areas. According to Intel, it’s about 1,000 times faster than flash and can store about 10 times more data than DRAM. What Goes Inside But right now, neither of those numbers really apply. On Sunday, Intel released the first 3D XPoint product, a storage device marketed under the name Optane that can replace hard drives or flash SSDs. But this device is only about five times faster than flash SSDs—not 1,000—because of the standard interface that connects the drive to the rest of the machine. Eventually, Intel will offer products that plug straight into the heart of the machine, removing this bottleneck, but that won’t happen until at least the second half of the year. RELATED: Microsoft and Intel’s Decades-Long Alliance Has Started To Fray When that happens, the likes of Google and Facebook really could build new kinds of systems—systems that can hold data in memory even when powered down, that merge memory and storage or mix and match them in new ways—all in an effort to create vast networks of machines that can more efficiently juggle information. This is no small undertaking. If they significantly reorganize their hardware, they must also rewrite their operating systems and other software to accommodate the changes. According Krzanich, Intel is already working with “almost all of the big cloud service providers” to explore these possibilities. These companies, he says, have been testing sample hardware since early last year. Still, so many questions remain. Intel now says that 3D XPoint is only about one percent as fast as DRAM. Even if that improves, says Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective Analysis who follows the memory and storage markets, the technology only makes sense as memory if it’s significantly cheaper than DRAM. Whether it will be remains unclear. It’s also unclear when Intel will allow this technology to plug straight into processors offered by competitors—though Krzanich indicates it will. “We will always have options that can fix with anybody’s architecture,” he says. “With something as ubiquitous as memory, you’ve got to have it work with everybody.” What Krzanich does make clear is that Intel will not sell raw 3D XPoint memory to anyone else. “We won’t sell this in any other form but a finished product,” he says. Today, Intel is one of so many companies that sell flash, and that means its opportunities are slim. It wants to build a market for 3D XPoint where other options are scarce. Will the internet giants embrace that kind of arrangement? It’s an important question. As Google, Amazon, and Microsoft expand their cloud computing businesses, offering services where others can set up their own online empires without buying their own hardware, these internet giants will account for more and more of the worldwide hardware market. Increasingly, these are the main customers for parts suppliers such as Intel. In 2012, Intel vice president Diane Bryant told WIRED that Google bought more server chips from Intel than all but about four other companies. As Krzanich points out, Micron will also sell 3D XPoint hardware. So some competition will exist, eventually. And others are developing alternatives. It’s possible competition will push down prices, and the internet’s biggest companies will bite. But for now, the dance goes on to decide what really winds up inside.

Many people had expected the laptop/tablet hybrid to be released in April. Unfortunately, there are some reports that indicate the device will be released in October. This could be true as Tech Report says Microsoft may include the latest AMD Ryzen processor in the Pro 5, and those aren’t abundantly available now. “Our newest rumour about the Surface Pro 5 is an interesting one indeed. Despite plenty of talk about the device getting Intel’s latest Kaby Lake chips, it appears the Pro 5 might actually run on an AMD Ryzen processor instead. The theory has emerged due to a trailer for Alien: Covenant, which appears to show a Surface device” The article notes that the film is sponsored by Intel’s rival, and the description suspiciously reads, “Intelligence powered by AMD, Ryzen, and Radeon.” Most sources still have the Surface Pro 5 featuring Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor, better battery life, a rechargeable Surface Pen, and a new keyboard base. According to International Business Times, the Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. “HoloLens support was earlier reportedly not said to be included in the Surface Pro 5, since HoloLens is not a consumer device. But with the company rolling out the technology to more affordable VR headsets, the tablet is expected to offer HoloLens support.” The Surface Pro 4 already has a very high resolution screen. [Image by Daryl Deino] Other sources point to the Surface Pro 5 having a 4K screen. That may be overkill for some since a 4K screen (especially on a 12-inch device) may not be worth the extra battery power it requires. The current Surface Pro 4 has a 2736 x 1824 pixel resolution screen, which gives viewers an incredible 267 pixels per inch. Some people expressed their disappointment at the possibly delayed Surface Pro 5 on social media. So upset that @Microsoft isn't releasing Surface Pro 5 until October. Almost want to kill myself (not really, but you know what I mean) — Prince Rules (@PrinceMyBaby3) March 22, 2017 WTF? No new Surface Pro until OCTOBER? Go to hell #microsoft — Gillian (@gillianlemy1) March 23, 2017 Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 is their biggest hit in years. Cynics initially laughed off the Surface Pro, but the device has become the go-to laptop/tablet hybrid that other companies are trying to copy. Samsung, who released the TabPro S in 2016, came pretty close by delivering a 12-inch device, but one with a Super AMOLED screen — something that has barely been seen on a Windows 10 device. Though a lot of people loved Samsung’s device, they said the only thing keeping them buying a Surface Pro 4 instead was the fact that Samsung’s device was powered by an Intel Core M processor, which is known to be very slow. However, that is about to change with Samsung’s soon-to-be-released Galaxy Book. The 12-inch version of the Galaxy Book has an AMOLED screen. [Image by Kathy Willens/AP Images] As Trusted Reviews notes, the Galaxy Book will come in two flavors — a 10-inch (1080p) device and a 12-inch (Quad HD) device, with the latter including Samsung’s gorgeous AMOLED sceen. The 12-inch Galaxy book will now run a regular Intel Core i5 processor rather than a slow mobile one. It can actually reach speeds up to 3.1GHz, so those who want to edit photos and videos on the go will be able to without much trouble. However, those who do editing may want to get the version with 8GB of RAM instead of the cheaper one with 4GB RAM. The 10-inch version of the Galaxy Book runs a slower Core M3 processor, but could be good enough for those just looking to consume media or do office tasks. This will compete with the iPad and Microsoft’s regular Surface Tablet, which is hard to find due to being discontinued at the end of 2016. Which laptop/tablet would you rather have — the Surface Pro 5 or the Galaxy Book? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

Privacy concerns that are worth debating get sucked into White House fight. Scott Shackford|Mar. 23, 2017 1:15 pm Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/NewscomIt looks like whatever House Intel Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California) might have been attempting to accomplish yesterday when he held a press conference to reveal some post-election surveillance of Trump's transition team may have backfired. Nunes, a Trump ally, was clearly attempting to draw attention to the argument that the intelligence community was violating the privacy of the incoming Trump administration in its data and information collection. He said the information he had received showed that the surveillance and data collection of Trump team communications was "incidental," meaning they likely were not surveillance targets themselves. But Nunes running to the press and not actually informing the rest of his peers in the House Committee first subsequently made the story about Nunes and what he was trying to accomplish instead. Trump's critics, both on the left and the right, worry that Nunes' behavior is an attempt to interfere with a congressional investigation of any possible ties between Trump and the Russian government and whether anything possibly illegal has happened. Was this all about trying to help Trump? Trump himself immediately jumped on Nunes' comments in a Time interview to defend his wiretap conspiracy tweets, which at least suggests some interesting timing. Nunes has since apologized to his Democratic counterparts in the House for not telling them first before going to the press. There is likely a very noncontroversial explanation for the data collection that implicates nobody in particular and helps inform Americans about how federal surveillance actually works if people are willing to—for however briefly—set aside their feelings about Trump. Folks may recall that prior to taking office, Trump and his transition team decided to start contacting and communicating with world leaders. In all likelihood the National Security Agency (NSA) had active permission to engage in surveillance of such people. It's not necessarily an indicator of a criminal investigation; it's the business of international intelligence. So members of Trump's team may have ended up dragged into "incidental" surveillance because of the people they were talking to. As such, what happened with Trump's folks is a perfect opportunity for Americans to understand how "incidental" surveillance of citizens' works, what happened to the data, and the inherit risks of this level of collection for all of our privacy so at least we're all informed about how all of this works. Privacy and civil liberties activists are calling for reforms to surveillance authorities in order to reduce the likelihood that private data or communications get retained and exposed the way it might have happened with Trump's team. Also of interest: Nunes has said that actually, some of the names in these reports were still "masked" (redacted), but he was able to tell who the reports were talking about based on the context. In the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations about mass collection of data from Americans' phone and online communications, government officials (all the way up to President Barack Obama himself) attempted to assure people that nobody was reading through all of our emails or listening in to all of our phone calls. But they were collecting loads of metadata (where and who we were communicating with, for how long, when and how frequently, et cetera), and experiments have shown that enough metadata is available out there to extrapolate a lot about our private behavior. But as long as this is a fight only over the behavior of Trump and his team, it's going to be tough to have a discussion or call for reform of these tools. As I noted yesterday, even vocal Democratic critics of the extent of federal surveillance are using all this to try to attack Trump's administration as potentially breaking the law even knowing full well that's not necessarily what the information collection means. Mind you, it could very well be that Nunes is indeed trying to taint an investigation and that the Trump team might have been involved in some unseemly, even illegal behavior. That he's doing a terrible job at it probably says more about Nunes' poor political savvy than anything else. I'm not here to assist in defending Trump (not that he needs me to). I'm here to warn about the politically driven false choices tainting the debate. What the two "sides" in this fight are presenting to the public are not contradictory claims, and I'm going to keep trying to hammer that through. It's possible that Trump and/or his allies are involved in corrupt or illegal dealings with a foreign country and that it's normal and expected for our federal intelligence agencies to be using surveillance tools to get at the truth. It's also possible that the intelligence community is abusing access to surveillance data and leaking information for the deliberate purpose of discrediting and hamstringing the Trump administration. And this administration is—like it or not—legally and democratically in charge of the executive branch of the government. If Trump's foes are fine with data collected by surveillance possibly being abused to discredit him, that doesn't bode well for the possibility of ratcheting back the surveillance of all the rest of us.

But the left is the only side that can still get agitated, in theory, about past concerns (Hoover, Watergate, the stuff that led to FISA in the first place).

Everyone spies on everyone else; some agents are caught, and some of those are punished. Neither changes the magnitude of spying activity. "Spying" has been, historically, and probably still is only a tiny (although necessary) part of intelligence collection and analysis. Most CIA analysis is reported to be based on public sources like newspapers and television or radio broadcasts. In the past, up to the time of satellite communications, most NSA collection was from broadcast radio telecommunications. Once satellites were in common use beginning in the 1960s, NSA (and the other Five Eyes agencies, and their counterparts in other countries) added collection from spillover in the coverage ellipse from the satellites, and they doubtless still do both. They, and signals intelligence agencies from other countries, have added collection from internet backbones and other sources as communications shifted to use those facilities. In reality, the main change in the 65 year history of the NSA is the exponential growth in communication volume that accompanied the reduction in cost to nearly zero. There probably is far less communication surveillance per person now than there was in the late 1940s through the early 1970s; the hardest problem for all signals intelligence agencies almost certainly is ignoring what they do not care about, which is the uninteresting communications of nearly all of us. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply ATXChappy|3.23.17 @ 2:02PM|# "Will the Prospect of Taking Trump Down Ruin Chances for Surveillance Reform?"

"Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked." So it was given to a lot of people even though it had no foreign intelligence value. Why? And names were unmasked, which may be illegal. So did this information make it's way to the Obama White House, or not?

Both fueled post-election stock surge Freedom Caucus founder: GOP health plan did not meet campaign promises Former US envoy: No good military options against North Korea MORE regrets throwing his support behind Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanCotton: House 'moved a bit too fast' on healthcare Budget chief: 'Powers that be in Washington' won healthcare fight Schumer: Dems 'willing' to work with GOP if they stop 'undermining' ObamaCare MORE’s healthcare proposal before his administration could propose a tax reform plan that more Republicans would favor, according to a Thursday New York Times report.  Trump reportedly questioned his decision to several allies, saying he should’ve prioritized tax reform after seeing the immediate Republican fallout from the GOP healthcare proposal. Trump responded to the healthcare chaos with an ultimatum. He sent Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to announce that either Republicans hold a vote on the bill Friday, or he would move on and they would be stuck with ObamaCare. The "Art of the Deal” business mogul prides himself in being a skilled negotiator and has been working behind the scenes to whip up votes for the health legislation. But after throwing his support behind the bill, Trump found himself pinned between Republicans who find the bill does not do enough to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Democrats and some moderate Republicans who are worried about the expected rise in the number of uninsured people and the rollback of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.  Trump suggested earlier in the week that Republicans who vote against the bill could suffer in the next elections. Two of Trump’s closest White House advisers, his chief strategist Steve Bannon and top economic adviser Gary Cohn also reversed their position on the healthcare bill, first favoring it, and then deciding they did not like the compromise version coming out of meetings this week, the Times reports.  The Times reports Trump did not realize when he agreed to the agenda late last year just how intense of a fight healthcare would be until this week, following harsh criticism and Congressional Budget Office estimates that showed millions more would be uninsured. This realization has led him to pine about the tax cut plan he should've pursued instead.

Trump named former Rep.

That step means the committee can more forward with a confirmation hearing, possibly as soon as next week, according to Defense News. ADVERTISEMENT Wilson remains the only official nominee in place for the military branches. Army Secretary nominee Vincent Viola and Navy Secretary nominee Philip Bilden both withdrew from consideration last month. They both have vast financial holdings, which would have made it difficult to meet Pentagon requirements against conflicts of interest. Defense Secretary James Mattis also pulled his pick for undersecretary for policy, Anne Patterson, earlier this month, after the White House implied it would not fight a likely battle for Senate confirmation Wilson, 56, graduated from the Air Force Academy and earned master's and doctoral degrees as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. She served in Congress from 1998 to 2009 and is currently the president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Wilson does not come without baggage. It was found in 2013 that a company she ran collected nearly $500,000 from the Energy Department’s facilities with no evidence it actually did the work. Wilson denied the charges but reportedly repaid most of the money.  McCain told Defense News he was unaware of that past issue, while Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said in a statement that she would ask Wilson whether she would prioritize cuts to government waste. Tags John McCain   View the discussion thread.

The rules, which the FCC passed in a party-line vote in October, require internet service providers such as AT&T and Verizon to obtain customers' permission before using their personal information for advertising purposes. If passed by the House and signed by President Trump, the bill would use an obscure law called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to eliminate the rules before they go into effect. The CRA would also prevent the FCC from passing "substantially similar" regulations in the future, though no court has ruled on what agencies can pass under those standards. Critics of the privacy regulations say they are too onerous, and subject service providers to stricter regulations than websites such as Facebook and Google, which also collect consumer data. The vote immediately drew criticism from privacy and consumer advocates like the ACLU, Public Knowledge and Free Press, while trade groups praised the move.

PAI DODGES 'FAKE NEWS' QUESTION: Federal Communications Commissioner Chairman Ajit Pai said on Thursday that President Trump's charge that media outlets including The New York Times, CNN and NBC are "fake news" is a "political debate," that he would not "wade into." When asked by separate reporters during the FCC's monthly open meeting if those organizations were "fake news," as Trump has repeatedly dismissed them, Pai said both times that he would not comment. "Well look, that's a political debate that people in the political arena have been debating back and forth," Pai said. "My job is to not to be a political actor. It is simply to be somebody at the FCC who, as I said, is administering the laws of the United States. I'm simply not going to wade into that kind of political debate." Read more here. FCC VOTES TO CRACK DOWN ON ROBOCALLS: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday took its first step to crack down on illegal robocalls. The often-fraudulent calls disguise the phone numbers they call from -- a move known as spoofing -- to circumvent existing rules. Scammers take advantage of spoofing by posing as government agencies, like the IRS, and tricking consumers into believing they owe outstanding fines. The proposed rules, which the FCC voted unanimously to move forward with, would allow telecom providers to block calls from numbers that are not assigned to phones and that are no longer in use. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai noted that robocallers typically target those who are least equipped to sniff out scams. Read more here. WIKILEAKS REVEALS NEW CIA DOCS: WikiLeaks on Thursday released new documents from its CIA leak outlining how the agency hacked Apple products. "Dark Matter" is the second batch of leaks from a CIA archive WikiLeaks has nicknamed "Vault 7" that describes hacking techniques the agency used. So far, all of the techniques have been for targeted surveillance instead of bulk surveillance, which the NSA would conduct. Many of the techniques require the CIA to have physical access to devices to attack them. The documents also range in age and may no longer describe current threats. Apple announced after the first release of documents that many of the security flaws mentioned in that archive had long since been patched. One user manual released in Dark Matter describes a "Sonic Screwdriver" -- a technique taking its name from Doctor Who's utility tool -- as a way to use a modified Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet network adapter or, potentially, other modified hardware to load malware while a Mac is booting. That document is dated 2012. Read more here. APPLE TO START MANUFACTURING IN INDIA: The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple is set to start manufacturing the iPhone 6 and 6s in India.

Blast in Bangladesh kills six 26-Mar-17 637 DHAKA: Two separate bomb blast ... TEL AVIV: Intel's $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector's other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant's purchase last week of Mobileye, which specializes in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. "A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns," said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. "Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location." The price was about 21 times Mobileye's expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix, an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York's Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded. Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defense tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signaled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. "It's an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies," said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung's Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date.

Flynn speaks at the White House on Feb. 1, less than two weeks before he was ousted as the White House’s national security adviser. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) President Trump’s ousted national security adviser did not seek permission from the U.S. government to work as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests, U.S. defense officials said, raising the possibility that the Pentagon could dock the retirement pay of Michael T. Flynn. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Defense Department is reviewing the issue. It arose after Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, registered retroactively this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work that his company, Flynn Intel Group, carried out on behalf of Inovo BV, a Netherlands-based company. It is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is not a part of the Turkish government, but has links to it. The Inovo assignment centered on researching Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric whom Ankara blames for fomenting a coup attempt last summer and wants extradited from the United States, where he has lived in exile for years. That led Flynn’s company to conclude that the work “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” according to a letter sent by Flynn’s attorney, Robert K. Kelner, to the Justice Department, along with the filing. [Read: The Washington Post’s 2016 profile of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn] Flynn Intel Group received a total of $530,000 in three payments between September and November from Inovo BV before discontinuing the arrangement after Trump was elected president, according to Flynn’s filings. It is unclear from the paperwork how much Flynn personally profited from the deal, but he is the majority owner and chief executive officer of the firm. Kelner, reached by phone Wednesday night, declined to comment on the deal. Flynn filed the foreign agent paperwork March 7, about three weeks after being removed as national security adviser after revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn’s company previously disclosed its role in lobbying for Inovo BV, but did not file any paperwork as a foreign agent for Turkey because it had concluded that its client was a foreign corporation, rather than a foreign government. It changed course and filed as a foreign agent to “eliminate any doubt” about the issue, Kelner wrote. Individuals who represent foreign governments must register with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. [Flynn in FBI interview denied discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador] Flynn’s work for Inovo came as he prepared an opinion piece for The Hill newspaper that appeared on Election Day and criticized the Obama administration while arguing that “from Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden.” Flynn’s new filing acknowledges that the piece used information gathered through work for Inovo, but denies that either Inovo or the Turkish government requested it or had a hand in writing it. However, Inovo did receive an advance copy of it for review, the filing said. An Army spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, said that the service has no record of Flynn ever requesting permission before accepting any kind of “foreign employment” — something that Defense Department guidelines, separate from the Foreign Agents Registration Act — explicitly require when former officers work for a foreign government. The Pentagon’s guidelines were established to comply with the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which states that no individual holding any office “of profit or trust” can accept any pay or gift from a foreign government or official without the permission of the U.S. government. It applies to retired officers and enlisted service members because they are subject to recall to active duty, according to a Defense Department assessment of the issue. Defense Department guidelines warn that the department’s top financial officer, the comptroller, “may pursue debt collection” if they do not do so. Any debt collection due to an emoluments clause violation would be capped at no more than what an individual makes in retirement pay during a period of unauthorized employment. In Flynn’s case, that is more than $35,000 for the three months of the Inovo project. The position of Defense Department comptroller is held on an acting basis by Andrew Roth, a former Obama administration official who was held over to help with budget issues. David Norquist, who served as chief financial officer in the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, was nominated last week as his replacement. The Defense guidelines do not specify whether representing the interests of a foreign government while paid by a private corporation is a violation of the rules. Violations of the Emoluments Clause also are rarely enforced. “This is not something that has generally been enforced, but I do think we are at a phase where people are thinking about the remedies for this issue a lot more carefully,” said William Baude, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. The issue comes as some lawmakers continue to press for information about whether Flynn violated any laws by accepting money to appear with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization. Flynn received $45,000 for the December 2015 appearance, according to documents released recently by the House Oversight Committee. Jennifer Werner, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the committee, said the Army told committee members that it has found no documents suggesting that Flynn asked the service for permission to speak at the RT gala. But Kelner suggested that isn’t so clear-cut: Flynn briefed members of the Defense Intelligence Agency about his trip to Moscow before and afterward, Kelner said Wednesday. Asked if he sought approval through Army Human Resources Command, as the guidelines stipulate, Kelner declined to comment. On Wednesday, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), its ranking member, requested that the White House, the Defense Department, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence furnish documents related to Flynn’s foreign contacts. Chaffetz and Cummings said in a letter that the committee is reviewing whether Flynn “fully disclosed his payments from Russian, Turkish, or other foreign sources,” specifically mentioning the RT payment without limiting the request to it.

Nunes urged Comey to get the bottom of things fast.   People “who have very important work to lead this country,” he declared, needed to have the matter resolved forthwith. Who could have imagined that Nunes’s next step would be to take a running big bellyflop into the cloud himself?  Because that is precisely what he achieved by briefing President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpFundamentals or euphoria? Both fueled post-election stock surge Freedom Caucus founder: GOP health plan did not meet campaign promises Former US envoy: No good military options against North Korea MORE on information he had seen showing conversations involving Trump associates and possibly Trump himself had been collected by U.S. intelligence gatherers.  This information, which was “incidentally” gathered  — that is, the material turned up inadvertently in collection on other targets that had been approved in a warrant by a judge — had not been presented to the Intelligence Committee beforehand.   ADVERTISEMENT To be clear: This information was acquired through entirely legal means and, so far as anyone knows, has never been used for inappropriate purposes.  It does not in any way validate Trump’s claim that President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaCotton: House 'moved a bit too fast' on healthcare Obama to travel to South Pacific island to work on memoir: report Sanford: 'Testosterone can get you in trouble' MORE had him wiretapped. But it sounds close enough to that to be remarkably useful to a president who painted himself into corner with that reckless charge.   Even in the rich annals of Congressional fecklessness, Nunes’s move was an instant classic.  Consider the damage done:  In a single trip to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the representative may well have broken the law by leaking classified material acquired under a FISA wiretap.  This came less than 48 hours after a hearing in which he and his fellow Republicans spoke of virtually nothing but the evils of leaking classified material acquired under a FISA wiretap.   #BREAKING: Nunes signals regret for decision to brief Trump before Intel committee https://t.co/vkCLC9EA4C pic.twitter.com/ByPD8ILugy— The Hill (@thehill) March 23, 2017 It remains unclear where the information came from. Any information from the FBI and NSA would be supplied to both Nunes and Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: Nunes needs to decide if he wants to lead a credible investigation on Russia Sunday shows preview: Aftermath of failed healthcare bill Schiff urges Trump to avoid baseless accusations MORE, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.   But Schiff had not seen the new material, and Nunes would not say where it came from. The California Republican, however, has not ruled out what many suspect: That the ultimate source was the Trump White House itself, and this was, to use a Trumpian phrase, a ruse to help the president extricate himself from the Twitter-induced quandary created by his allegation against Obama. The ironies proliferate.  After urging Director Comey to act quickly, Nunes likely extended the life of a controversy that threatens to paralyze Washington.  Although the heads of the FBI and NSA have said they know of no basis for President Trump’s charge that his predecessor had his phones tapped, the information Nunes delivered yesterday led Trump to say he felt “somewhat” vindicated.  Instead of nailing the coffin of Trump’s preposterous charge that Obama had him surveilled, Nunes breathed new life into the controversy.   Senate Intel Dem suggests Nunes leaked classified info when he told reporters about surveillance revelations https://t.co/l31pSPcIc5 pic.twitter.com/JeVs0eTYo0— The Hill (@thehill) March 22, 2017 Nunes also undermined his committee and probably did fatal damage to its investigation of the Trump-Russia connection by scurrying to brief Trump instead of presenting the material to his fellow committee members.  By doing so — and his explanation for this is to dismiss it as a “judgment call” — he has demonstrated a striking obliviousness to the function of Congressional oversight of the executive branch.   Who does he, as chairman of House Intelligence, serve — the public or the president?  Is he someone entrusted by the Congress with investigative powers or a presidential supplicant? For an eight-term member to be confused on this point is staggering.  To echo CNN commentator Jeff Toobin, Devin Nunes appear to be a man in way, way over his head. Wednesday, Nunes apologized to his committee for yesterday’s screw-up.  But the damage is done and far-reaching:  No one can now truly believe that the House Committee can manage the investigation it has undertaken — and as Senator John McCainJohn McCainDemocrats step up calls that Russian hack was act of war McCain: Trump admin must fill State Dept. jobs McCain says he hasn't met with Trump since inauguration MORE has been saying, Congress “no longer has the credibility” to do this.  It is simply too partisan, and after, if Nunes is any indication, too amateurish.  The best alternative is a bipartisan inquiry along the lines of the 9/11 Commission.  It remains to be seen if the Nunes affair makes the politics for that ripen. Finally, there is also damage that may prove longer lasting and more injurious to a political culture already in real distress.  Congress, like all democratic legislatures, can only work if there is trust that both sides will play by agreed rules. With Nunes’s flight to the White House, that trust looks like its been torn — and another norm of our political life may have just gone out the window.   Ambassador Daniel Benjamin is director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College and served as coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department 2009-2012.

Requirements, and Offers Customizable Solutions Built with the Latest Technology Advancements and Components News provided by GammaTech Computer Corporation Mar 23, 2017, 14:24 ET Share this article FREMONT, Calif., March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Regardless of what level of government you work in – be it some massive federal agency or a small rural township, you face the same challenges when it comes to purchasing computers to fit your agency or department's needs. It pretty much comes down to: will it do what you need it to do; is it adaptable to your unique requirements; how secure is it; will it stand up to harsh use and/or environments; can it be used here, there, and everywhere; and – maybe most important – how much is it going to cost you? That's a lot of boxes to check, and unless this is your first day on the job, you already know there are as many choices out there as there are constituents with opinions. So, how do you choose the best match for your requirements? GammaTech's DURABOOK rugged computers would provide a great solution! Continue Reading GammaTech's DURABOOK rugged computers offer the functionality, security, durability, capability and mobility necessary for government professionals to get their jobs done from virtually anywhere GammaTech is a major international, award-winning manufacturer and supplier of innovative notebook and tablet computers. Its line of DURABOOK rugged products has long been a trusted name and resource, well known for its reliability, durability, and mobile capabilities. Further setting DURABOOK apart from its many competitors is its ability to both provide more advanced configurations and offer a more complete solution through its renowned customization program.  "Our R11 fully rugged tablet, R8300 fully rugged notebook, and S15AB and SA14 rugged notebooks make ideal solutions for use in any government application," stated Tom Wang, GammaTech president. "Each offers the functionality, security, durability, capability, and mobility necessary for government workers to do their jobs securely, efficiently, and from virtually anywhere. Each may be customized exactly to the user's specifications, and are covered by the DURABOOK Peace of Mind (POM) three-year warranty."   Security The DURABOOK R11 features the latest TPM2.0 technology, assuring sensitive data and critical workflows are securely accessible. Integrated CAC readers or fingerprint scanners in models SA14, R8300, and R11 protect data access from unauthorized users, while FIPS validation assures sensitive information security. A quick release HDD protects data security in case of an emergency; while with just one click, all sounds and emitting lights can be turned off with all programs remain running in the background. Functionality The R11 features a dual RFID option that provides a wider user scenario as well as more productivity and flexibility. A special reader board supports both low and high-frequency technologies simultaneously. A native Circuit Card Interface Device (CCID) implementation supports Windows®, LINUX®, and Mac® operating systems, eliminating the need to install special drivers. The R11 also has the ability to support 1D/2D barcode scanning with higher resolution and reading ability. It also has a class-leading motion tolerance of 400 in/s that delivers a distinct performance advantage, resulting in snappier scans and less hassle. Backlit keyboards and sunlight-readable displays, found in models R11, SA14, and R8300 are especially useful for working in bright sunlight or under glaring-lighting indoors. Durability All four models meet MIL-STD-810G rating, assuring shock, drop and vibration protection. They also have various IP ratings to ensure there is no water and dust intrusion. Each also operates in high altitude (up to 15,000 feet) and in weather conditions to -22°F. The R11 also carries an ANSI ISA standard 12.12.01 certification, meaning it is fit for use in hazardous locations. Capability The advanced Intel CPU included in SA14 ensures top-notch performance by providing 10% more CPU performance and a huge 22% increase in memory performance as well as 1.5 hours-longer battery life. It also includes Intel® HD Graphics 520 that features ultra-low-voltage power consumption, a significant improvement compared to Intel HD 4000. The unit's Advanced DDR4 represents more efficiency and more speed than DDR3, using up to 20% less power while being twice as fast. Mobility Mobility is often a key ingredient in government work. The SA14 offers the latest Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip and dedicated GPS software, and supports LTE high-speed wireless communications to provide real-time information exchange. Both R11 and SA14 also offer vehicle and dock options that support RF pass through for seamless work as it happens. All four models provide several connection options such as Ethernet, WI-FI, Bluetooth, or even Gobi technology with 4G and GPS connection/navigation capability. Some federal agents must stay connected with the data center, which requires all-day battery power. An advanced CPU chip using ultra-low power, and either a hot-swappable battery (SA14, R8300) or extended battery pack (R11) enable these DURABOOK products to provide up to 16 hours of power. Both the R11 and S15AB are the lightest and thinnest models in their respective categories: the R11 at just 2.7 pounds and 0.78" in thickness, and the S15AB at only 5.7 pounds and 1.16" in thickness, despite having a large 15.6" display. An ergonomic hard-handle design, found on models SA14, S15AB, R8300, makes the units easier to move.

Each may be customized exactly to the user's specifications, and are covered by the DURABOOK Peace of Mind (POM) three-year warranty."   SecurityThe DURABOOK R11 features the latest TPM2.0 technology, assuring sensitive data and critical workflows are securely accessible. Integrated CAC readers or fingerprint scanners in models SA14, R8300, and R11 protect data access from unauthorized users, while FIPS validation assures sensitive information security. A quick release HDD protects data security in case of an emergency; while with just one click, all sounds and emitting lights can be turned off with all programs remain running in the background. Functionality The R11 features a dual RFID option that provides a wider user scenario as well as more productivity and flexibility. A special reader board supports both low and high-frequency technologies simultaneously. A native Circuit Card Interface Device (CCID) implementation supports Windows®, LINUX®, and Mac® operating systems, eliminating the need to install special drivers. The R11 also has the ability to support 1D/2D barcode scanning with higher resolution and reading ability. It also has a class-leading motion tolerance of 400 in/s that delivers a distinct performance advantage, resulting in snappier scans and less hassle. Backlit keyboards and sunlight-readable displays, found in models R11, SA14, and R8300 are especially useful for working in bright sunlight or under glaring-lighting indoors. Durability All four models meet MIL-STD-810G rating, assuring shock, drop and vibration protection. They also have various IP ratings to ensure there is no water and dust intrusion. Each also operates in high altitude (up to 15,000 feet) and in weather conditions to -22°F. The R11 also carries an ANSI ISA standard 12.12.01 certification, meaning it is fit for use in hazardous locations. Capability The advanced Intel CPU included in SA14 ensures top-notch performance by providing 10% more CPU performance and a huge 22% increase in memory performance as well as 1.5 hours-longer battery life. It also includes Intel® HD Graphics 520 that features ultra-low-voltage power consumption, a significant improvement compared to Intel HD 4000. The unit's Advanced DDR4 represents more efficiency and more speed than DDR3, using up to 20% less power while being twice as fast. Mobility Mobility is often a key ingredient in government work. The SA14 offers the latest Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip and dedicated GPS software, and supports LTE high-speed wireless communications to provide real-time information exchange. Both R11 and SA14 also offer vehicle and dock options that support RF pass through for seamless work as it happens. All four models provide several connection options such as Ethernet, WI-FI, Bluetooth, or even Gobi technology with 4G and GPS connection/navigation capability. Some federal agents must stay connected with the data center, which requires all-day battery power. An advanced CPU chip using ultra-low power, and either a hot-swappable battery (SA14, R8300) or extended battery pack (R11) enable these DURABOOK products to provide up to 16 hours of power. Both the R11 and S15AB are the lightest and thinnest models in their respective categories: the R11 at just 2.7 pounds and 0.78" in thickness, and the S15AB at only 5.7 pounds and 1.16" in thickness, despite having a large 15.6" display. An ergonomic hard-handle design, found on models SA14, S15AB, R8300, makes the units easier to move.

The move may signal its intention to enter into similar licensing agreements with other auto makers as well. Microsoft’s portfolio of automotive technology includes car operating systems, wifi, motion sensors, voice recognition, and autonomous driving systems. “The connected car represents an enormous opportunity for the auto industry and, at the core, it’s a software challenge,” said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft, in a prepared statement. As the convergence between cars and computers continues, companies like Intel, Google, Qualcomm and NXP are searching for new business relationships with auto makers. In fact, Intel just agreed to buy self driving innovator MobilEye in a deal worth $15.3 billion. Qualcomm last fall agreed to buy NXT, the world’s largest supplier of computer chips to the automotive industry, for $47 billion. Microsoft’s patents for connected cars includes tools to store and transfer files, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. The company says it sees driving becoming far more personalized and convenient in the future. Connected cars will be able to predict when they need maintenance, eliminating breakdowns while on the road. They can also anticipate a driver’s intended route based on a connected digital calendar or personalized entertainment device. Gartner Research predicts that new vehicles equipped with data connectivity will increase from 6.9 million per year in 2015 to 61 million per year in 2020. The research firm predicts the total cumulative shipments of automobiles equipped with data connectivity will be 250 million by 2020. The Microsoft licensing agreement is a natural result of an earlier joint project between Toyota and Microsoft. Last April the two companies created a data analytics company which focused on bringing new connected services to cars without overwhelming the driver with technology. Called Toyota Connect, the project uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service to analyze data and help develop new products for drivers, businesses with car fleets, and dealers. Toyota Connect expanded on an earlier partnership with Microsoft designed to research and develop connected car services. Microsoft has also forged relationships with other vehicle manufacturers including BMW, Volvo, Ford, and Nissan. Earlier this year, Volvo announced it will integrate Skype for business in its 90 Series cars and Nissan agreed to use Microsoft’s connected vehicle platform — a set of services built on its Azure cloud.

Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers Display Drivers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Close Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Intel's Vulkan Driver Working On VK_KHX_multiview Support Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 23 March 2017 at 11:33 AM EDT. 3 Comments Intel's open-source "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver is prepping support for the experimental VK_KHX_multiview extension. Key Intel Vulkan driver contributor Jason Ekstrand has published his initial patches for VK_KHX_multiview support within the ANV code-base. This also includes SPIR-V support for the related SPV_KHR_multiview extension. VK_KHX_multiview is the Vulkan equivalent to OpenGL's GL_OVR_multiview, the Oculus-led OpenGL extension. Yes, both the OpenGL and Vulkan extensions are important for VR. "This extension seeks to address the inefficiency of sequential multiview rendering by adding a means to render to multiple elements of a 2D texture array simultaneously. In multiview rendering, draw calls are instanced into each corresponding element of the texture array. The vertex program uses a new ViewID variable to compute per-view values, typically the vertex position and view-dependent variables like reflection." VK_KHX_multiview premiered with the big Vulkan 1.0.42 update at GDC but as indicated by the "KHX", it's currently considered an experimental Vulkan extension. This is one of the extensions currently used by Valve's SteamVR Linux implementation. The 12 patches published today by Ekstrand implement the SPIR-V and ANV Vulkan changes for basic support for VK_KHX_multiview and SPVR_KHR_multiview. He commented with the patch series, "This implementation is good enough to get us going with the extension and passes the currently available CTS tests. However, it does not yet support input attachments." We'll see though if they end up landing these KHX extensions prior to Khronos finalizing the specifications in a future Vulkan release. It's also likely not particularly pressing since Intel graphics will likely not be fast enough for Linux VR gaming. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Download Current Issue Dell EMC and Intel have teamed up to launch a cloud ecosystem hub to provide more support for service providers and users to help partners put themselves in the shop window and users find the right supplier. As well as providing a platform for customers to choose the right service partner those service providers that use the hub can get access to training, marketing support and leads. The ecosystem has been developed by the vendor because all the signs point to significant growth coming from the cloud service provider community in the next few years. “Historically, vendors have failed to support Service Providers in their campaigns and the Dell EMC Cloud Ecosystem represents a game-changing development for both Service Providers and customers alike,” said Eric Velfre, senior vice president, compute and networking sales Dell EMC EMEA. “By simplifying access to the Dell EMC Cloud value proposition and offering content and support for co-marketing projects, we can generate awareness and enable new capabilities to achieve greater profitability for our partners. Through the Dell EMC Cloud Community we can also drive demand from the customer towards Service Providers and capture feedback to help develop future Dell EMC Cloud technologies," he added. The ecosystem will give partners the chance to work with each other and find complementary skills that can be combined to build a more complete solution. “We are looking for business partners with the ability to deliver significant business impact and offer comprehensive support to the customer," said Cedric Mermilliod, co-founder and managing director of online document specialist Oodrive. From a customer point of view the hub is being positioned as a resource to help those looking at going through a digital transformation process. They will be given a chance to select partners that meet their specific needs. MicroScope+ Content Find more MicroScope+ content and other member only offers, here.

The downturn was even more unexpected, given the recent release of new processors and graphics cards released by major manufacturers. From the DigiTimes: Despite Intel, AMD and Nvidia having all launched new processor or graphics chip products for the first quarter, motherboard players continue to suffer decreased shipments in the quarter and demand is also unlikely to pick up in the second, according to sources from the upstream supply chain. Intel released several Kaby Lake-based processors and 200 series chipsets including the Z270 in January. AMD’s 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 were launched in early March and Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080 Ti also hit store shelves in March. Motherboard shipments are considered an indicator for semiconductor sales. Motherboards often contain on-board graphics and processing chipsets, and those that don’t require separate graphics cards and CPUs to function. On the ETF side of things, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) was trading at $78.48 per share on Thursday morning, down $0.27 (-0.34%). Year-to-date, SMH has gained 9.55%, versus a 4.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. SMH currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #19 of 54 ETFs in the Technology Equities ETFs category. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) was trading at $135.55 per share on Thursday morning, up $1.42 (+1.06%). Year-to-date, SOXX has gained 10.45%. SOXX currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #11 of 54 ETFs in the Technology Equities ETFs category.

It hasn’t helped any that the argument has been bitterly partisan, with Nvidia GPUs often showing minimal benefits or even performance regressions, while AMD cards have often shown significant performance increases. [H]ardOCP recently compared AMD and Nvidia performance in Ashes of the Singularity, Battlefield 1, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Hitman, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Sniper Elite 4, and Tom Clancy’s The Division. Bear in mind that this was specifically designed as a high-end comparison that would compare the two APIs in GPU-limited scenarios at high resolutions and detail levels, and with a Core i7-6700K clocked at 4.7GHz powering the testbed. The GTX 1080 Ti was tested in 4K, while the less-powerful 1080 and RX 480 were tested in 1440p. Before you squawk about comparing the GTX 1080 and the RX 480, keep in mind that each GPU was only compared against itself in DX11 versus DX12. Sniper Elite 4 was a rare game with very strong results in DX12 versus DX11 on Polaris. Data and graph by [H]ardOCP.The answer to whether DirectX 12 was better or worse than DirectX 11 boils down to “It depends.” Specifically, it depends on whether you’re using an AMD or an Nvidia GPU, and it depends on the game itself. AMD GPUs were less likely to show a performance delta between the two APIs, while Nvidia cards still tended to tilt towards DX11 overall. [H]ardOCP notes in its conclusion that DX11 is still the better overall API option, but that DX12 support has improved from both companies, performance deltas between the two APIs have dropped, and in a few cases, DX12 pulls out strong wins. Why DirectX 12 hasn’t transformed gaming A few years ago, when low-overhead APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan hadn’t been released and even Mantle was in its infancy, there were a lot of overconfident predictions made about how these upcoming APIs would be fundamentally transformative to gaming, unleash the latent power in all of our computers, and transform the gaming industry. The truth, thus far, has been more prosaic. How much a game benefits from DirectX 12 depends on what kind of CPU you’re testing it on, how GPU-limited your quality settings are, how much experience the developer has in the API to start with, and whether the title was developed from the ground up to take advantage of DX12, or if its support for the API was patched in at a later date. And the components you choose can have a significant impact on what kind of scaling you see. Consider the graph below, from TechSpot, which compares a variety of CPUs while using the Fury X. Data and graph by TechSpot Intel’s Core i7-6700K barely twitches, while the Core i3-6100T has an average frame rate 1.14x higher and a minimum frame rate less than half as high. AMD’s FX-6350 and FX-8370 both see average frame rates rise by nearly 27%, but, again, minimum frame rates drop severely. A similar point is demonstrated below, with a graph of Hitman results. The 6700K is capable of driving the Fury X almost as fast in DX11 as it is in DX12, while the FX-8370 improved enormously. One reason why we see things playing out the way they do is because the goal and performance-improving functions of low-overhead APIs have been misunderstood. It’s been known for years that Nvidia GPUs are often faster with lower-end Intel or AMD CPUs (pre-Ryzen) than AMD’s own GPUs are. Part of the reason for this is because Nvidia’s own DX11 drivers implement multi-threading, whereas AMD’s do not. That’s one reason why, in games like Ashes of the Singularity, AMD’s GPU performance skyrocketed so much in DX12. But fundamentally, DX12, Vulkan, and Mantle are methods of compensating for weak single-threaded performance (or for spreading out a workload more evenly so it isn’t bottlenecked by a single thread). This article from Eurogamer is older, but it still makes an important point — the improvements to performance shown by Mantle and DX12 come from allowing the CPU to process more draw calls per second. If the GPU is already saturated with all the processing it can handle, stuffing more draw calls into the pipe isn’t going to improve anything. Now, having said all this, was there any point to DirectX 12 at all? Absolutely yes. Games, as a category of applications, have been among the slowest to embrace and benefit from multi-core processors. Even today, the number of games that can scale above four cores is quite small. Giving lower-end CPUs the freedom to utilize their resources more effectively can absolutely pay dividends for consumers on lower-end hardware. DirectX 12 is also still fairly new, with just a handful of supporting titles. It’s not unusual for a new API to take several years to find its feet and for developers to begin supporting it as a primary option. Game engines have to be developed to work well with it. Developers have to become comfortable using it. AMD, NV, and Intel need to release drivers that use it more effectively, and in some cases, may make hardware changes to their own GPUs to make low-latency APIs run more efficiently. Neither the fact that DX12’s gains against DX11 are less dramatic than many would prefer nor its limited adoption at this point in time are unusual for a new API that makes as many fundamental changes as DX12 makes relative to DX11. How those changes will shape games of the future remains to be seen.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Corsair’s ‘category-defying’ gaming PC is here The company's first ever gaming PC 0 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Mar 23, 2017 at 13:41 GMT3 days ago Corsair, the company behind some of the best mechanical keyboards and mouses on the market is launching its own PC today. Meet the new Corsair One, a gaming PC from Corsair that is supposed to redefine the PC. Corsair is touting the One as a fast, quiet and compact gaming PC that is VR-ready and starts at only $1,799. The device sports Intel’s latest Core i7 (7700K) processor, 16GB of “Corsair’s award-winning” DDR4 RAM, and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080. The device is able to cool down with liquid cooling, and it is able to operate at “20 dBa at idle” which is pretty impressive for a gaming computer. As for the motherboard, Corsair is including the Z270 with the One. You will also get up to 960GB SSD with the One. Corsair’s One comes in 4 different variants: the regular One, One Pro, One Pro with 960GB SSD, and One Ti. The regular One comes with the Core i7-7700, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, 240GB SSD and 1TB HDD for internal storage. The regular One is the only variant where the GPU isn’t water cooled. The One Pro comes with Intel’s i7-7700K CPU, 480GB SSD, 2TB HDD and the GPU is liquid cooled, too — all of this will cost you $2,199. With only $100 extra, you will be able to get a 960GB SSD for the storage on the One Pro, but there isn’t any HDD included on this model. And lastly, the most powerful variant of the One is essentially the One Pro but you will get the NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU and 960GB of SSD for $2,599. A big disappointment for some users on the Corsair One might be the fact that it doesn’t come with Windows 10 Pro — instead, Corsair is shipping the One with Home which is probably fine for most gamers, but if you want some more controls over your PC, you would probably prefer the Pro SKU of Windows 10. The Corsair One is available right now, and you can get it from Corsair’s official website here. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

(AMD) Stock If You Hate Money Recent Posts: Count Out Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock If You Hate Money 3 Reasons Sprint Corp (S) Stock Has Even MORE Upside Why Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) Stock Has Staying Power View All Posts After some bumpy trading based on valuation concerns, shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have rebounded, gaining 12% from lows earlier this month. Two-thirds of the gains in NVDA stock have come since the surprising acquisition of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). That deal was of tremendous importance to Nvidia, given its competition with Mobileye in automotive applications. And, for now anyway, investors appear to see the INTC-Mobileye tie-up as good news for Nvidia and for NVDA stock. Source: Nvidia I’m not quite so optimistic. There are reasons to see Intel’s entrance into automotive as a positive for NVDA stock and as a negative. Nvidia now is competing with two giants in the automotive space, which could be a near-term problem. But the entrance of both Intel and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) into the automotive space seems to validate the long-term opportunity for Nvidia, and the long-term potential for NVDA stock. Intel & Mobileye: The Good News for Nvidia The most obvious piece of good news for Nvidia in the INTC-Mobileye merger is that it validates the market opportunity in automotive. NVDA stock has more than quadrupled in just 18 months in large part due to optimism about the potential for revenue and profits in autonomous driving and other applications. With giant Intel paying a whopping 31 times Mobileye’s estimated 2017 sales, those gains don’t look nearly as outlandish. From a fundamental standpoint alone, the comparison between NVDA stock and MBLY would seem to imply sharp upside for NVDA. Nvidia’s revenue multiple is about one-fifth of that being paid for Mobileye by Intel. And its automotive revenue is higher than that of Mobileye. NVDA drove $487 million in automotive revenue in fiscal 2017 (ending January 2017), per its 10-K. Mobileye’s entire revenue for calendar 2016 was just $358 million. Meanwhile, the entrance of both Intel and Qualcomm into automotive seems to prove how valuable the business really can be. Qualcomm has agreed to pay $46 billion for NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI). Intel is paying over $15 billion for Mobileye. Clearly, there’s some logic to the optimism toward the automotive space — at least if the semiconductor industry’s giants are to be believe. Intel & Mobileye: The Concerns for Nvidia Stock The most obvious problem is that NVDA now has to compete directly with those giants. The Qualcomm/NXP partnership no doubt has a smaller direct impact on Nvidia, but will still be a force in the space. As for Intel-Mobileye, Cowen & Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri put it best in calling it a “two horse race“. It would seem NVDA’s chances of winning that race were stronger against Mobileye — a company just a few years past being a startup — than Intel. Intel is well-funded and is looking to leverage its success in data centers, even calling autonomous cars “data centers on wheels.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/03/nvidia-corporation-nvda-big-fat-question-mark/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second Quarter 7 Consumer Stocks to Lead Your Portfolio 3 High-Yield REITs Offering 7% or More 3 Inflation-Proof Stocks to Buy Now How Much Will AAPL Fall If iPhone 8 Flops?

Image: VanderWolf Images/Shutterstock Autonomous vehicles are heading our way, with a general attitude of inevitability apparent throughout the automotive industry. The race for a driverless future is best exemplified by the diverse range of companies currently investigating their own solutions to the transport problem. Nissan, BMW and Audi represent some of the more active, traditional automotive companies pumping huge resources into this field. They have been joined by Airbus, adding an aeronautical dimension with optimistic plans for ‘air taxis’, and Tesla, pioneering an electric future. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, has been a creative force in the past two years, acquiring stakes in some companies many expect to be powering the future of transport. Then there are the tech giants Apple and Google, the most vocal proponents of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the duo most likely to be willing to pour endless amounts of money into innovations facing significantly longer lead-in times than traditionally encouraged in transport. But really, where are we with regard to autonomous transport? And where will we be by the end of the decade? On trial For the truth about that, the Autobahn likely holds the first clue. As far back as October 2015, Daimler initiated a successful trial of autonomous trucks, negotiating 14km of motorways around Stuttgart. With the easily mapped roads and continuous traffic, the ingredients were perfect for such trials. In fact, it has been a similar set-up for studies ever since. For example, there are early-stage plans for Dublin to trial a similar project at the Port Tunnel area, again full of perfect, contained, continuous elements. However, Ireland is hardly up to speed in this industry, with a Dublin City Council source telling Siliconrepublic.com that not one government policy exists in this sphere. “It’s pretty embarrassing,” said the source. Keeping away from the blue riband autonomous cars we hear so much about, trucks are but one example of innovation. And in the years since the Daimler trial, other modes of transport have edged closer to market. In January, a trial for a fully autonomous shuttle bus service in Nevada was unveiled, with Navya, the company making the buses, and Keolis, a fleet logistics provider, behind the move. The cost to run the shuttles is estimated at $10,000 per month but, if it is structured in a way similar to New York City’s LinkNYC internet booths, then advertising could well finance the whole thing. Up and away But if buses are too 20th century, then perhaps air taxis are the way of the future. That’s according to Airbus CEO Tom Enders, who recently spoke of plans to create a fleet, with testing being discussed for this year. “100 years ago, urban transport went underground. Now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,” he said. “With flying, you don’t need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads.” Perhaps put that project into the ‘maybe’ pile. Then there are the outlandish – yet entirely feasible – ideas, such as Elon Musk’s Hyperloop, or South Korea’s planned tube-enclosed train that can travel at speeds of up to 1,000kph. It all, in the end, comes back to cars though. And since the turn of the year, things have sped up considerably. For example, Christmas had barely passed when BMW revealed that its alliance with Intel and Mobileye would result in 40 self-driving test cars hitting the road by the second half of this year. Between then and now, the latter two have become one, with Intel spending $15.3bn on Mobileye’s computer vision technology expertise. Intel previously bought a 15pc stake in Here, the mapping and location software firm formerly owned by Nokia, which is now co-owned by Audi, BMW and Daimler. To match that, Alibaba was revealed as the lead investor in an $18m splurge on smart car technology developer WayRay, a company that develops holographic displays on car windshields. None of these companies are purely positioned for AVs but, as electric vehicles and OS dashboards inevitably fill the space between today’s crewed cars and the driverless future, multiple vendors represent far likelier success outcomes than one huge gamble. For example, Audi isn’t pushing for its own autonomous car; it is recruiting additional expertise though the likes of Nvidia. 2020 is when it plans to reveal a driverless release. The auto piloted car Audi S7 at the Paris Motor show 2016. Image: Frederic Legrand – COMEO/Shutterstock Assist, not replace? Nissan has approval to test driverless cars in the UK, while restrictive rules to only allow car manufacturers to test in certain US states is already under the spotlight by peripheral businesses. Educational institutes are also getting in on the action. For example, IBM partnered with University College Dublin (UCD) for a pretty cool study into driver assistance, rather than replacement. Utilising Watson, as always, IBM and UCD essentially created a piece of software that “mitigates risk”, according to Robert Shorten, who led the study. “The idea is to produce something that doesn’t intrude, doesn’t require any input from the driver, but is there, watching the car, ready to intervene if it senses any risk to the journey,” said Shorten of a screen that sits on the dashboard advising drivers where to go, adapting to known variables such as opening and closing times, road blockages and peaks in traffic. It’s electric. It’s always electric. Cars are going electric. But should these end up on the streets of Cork, Cheshire, Charlemont or Szczecin come the end of the decade, can the current infrastructure cope? Interior of the Mercedes Benz autonomous concept car at the 86th International Geneva Motor Show in Palexpo, Geneva. Image: VanderWolf Images/Shutterstock Call to action According to the European Federation for Transport and Environment (T&E), governments need to act – and some are certainly doing that. This is best displayed in the gradual roll-out of electric charging stations across Europe, any lack of which completely undermines a shift away from petrol-based cars of old. “Actions from both the private and public sectors are required,” said Yoann Le Petit, clean vehicles and mobility officer with the T&E. “To ensure there is a mutual interest in developing charging points and speeding up EV production, a zero-emission vehicle mandate (similar to the one in place in California) offers a good solution,” said Le Petit. “On top of that, official bodies at EU, national [and] local levels should keep providing incentive schemes (such as grants or tax rebates) to promote charging infrastructure deployment.” Incentive schemes for infrastructure builds are needed to attract innovation from companies in the electric vehicles space to satisfy the investment they have already made in transport, which will operate on this unfinished infrastructure. It’s a strange world but, given the enthusiastic innovation, acquisitions and public trials of all things autonomous, a driverless future seems nearer than ever.

Scotland Yard said the 52-year-old was not the subject of any current investigations and there was "no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack". However, he was known to police and has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. [timgcap=Khalid Masood]KhalidmasoodMarch2017_large.jpg[/timg] Masood was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. He was also known by a number of aliases, the Metropolitan Police said. Masood's first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He has not been convicted for any terrorism offences, the Met said. Update 3.45pm: The man police believe to be behind the terrorist attack in Westminster has been formally identified as 52-year-old Khalid Masood. Update 12.35pm: The Islamic State group has said through its Aaamaq news agency that the London attacker was a "soldier of the Islamic State". According to the SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, the IS statement said: "The attacker yesterday in front of the British Parliament in London was a soldier of the Islamic State executing the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations." Earlier: The Westminster attacker was a British citizen who was known to the police and security services and had been investigated some years ago over violent extremism, British Prime Minister Theresa May has revealed. Three people and the attacker died yesterday, with a further 29, including one Irish person, taken to hospital. Seven of those remain critically ill. Mrs May told MPs he was a "peripheral" figure, adding: "He was not part of the current intelligence picture." Delivering a defiant message to a packed House of Commons, Mrs May said: "We will never waver in the face of terrorism." Flowers outside the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London. Pic: PA The Prime Minister addressed MPs as they gathered at the usual time inside the Palace of Westminster, which a day before had come under attack from the knife-wielding terrorist. An hour after MPs had stood for a minute’s silence in honour of the innocent people killed in the attack, Mrs May delivered a statement with details of the atrocity. Paying tribute to Pc Keith Palmer, who died after being stabbed, she said: "He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten." Describing the terrorist, Mrs May said: "What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. "The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot." Mrs May concluded her statement by saying: "Our values will prevail." Anti-terror police have arrested eight people in the wake of the attack. Several addresses were raided overnight in London and Birmingham as Mark Rowley, the Met’s senior anti-terror officer, said he believed the attacker was working alone. Director General of MI5 Andrew Parker also condemned the attack as "appalling and disgusting" and said the agency’s operational response is "fully mobilised in support of the police". A minute’s silence was held nationwide at 9.33am, including in the Palace of Westminster and at New Scotland Yard, to commemorate the three innocent people who were killed. The timing of the silence was chosen in honour of Pc Palmer’s shoulder number - 933. MPs said they wanted to attend the House of Commons to show a commitment to freedom and democracy, and get "back to business". Thursdays are often a quiet day in Parliament, with MPs travelling back to their constituencies or making trips elsewhere, but the chamber was packed for the minute’s silence. Aysha Frade was the first member of the public to be identified as a victim, with her principal at DLD College London describing her as "highly regarded and loved". She died along with Pc Palmer and a man in his mid-50s after the knife-wielding attacker ploughed a car through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, before storming the Parliamentary estate. He was shot dead by police. Forty people were hurt in the attack with 29 treated in hospital, where seven remained in a critical condition on Thursday. The injured included 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, two Greeks, and one each from Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and the United States. Three police officers were also hurt, two of them seriously. At the scene of one of the police raids, a flat in Hagley Road, Birmingham, one witness told the Press Association: "The man from London lived here." In London, swathes of Westminster remained cordoned off to the public on Thursday, with the site of the attack desolate except for crime scene tents, including one where the car crashed into the railings surrounding the Palace of Westminster. Four people were killed in the attack in Westminster yesterday. These were: Aysha Frade, 43; a man in his mid 50s, PC Keith Palmer and the attacker; 29 people were treated for their injuries in hospital; seven of these are critically ill; numbers of ‘walking wounded’ are still being collated; The attacker has not yet been publicly identified, and police have asked the media to not yet do so; Eight people have been arrested in raids at six addresses in connection with the investigation overnight; The raids took place in London, Birmingham and at other, undisclosed, locations; Metropolitan Police say the attacker acted alone, but was ‘inspired by international terrorism’; British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has said the working assumption is that the Westminster attack is linked to Islamic terrorism; The Islamic State group has said through its Aaamaq news agency that the London attacker was a "soldier of the Islamic State".

They were competing in the finals of the Hong Kong Youth Science and Technology Innovation Competition (HKYSTIC), an annual event organised by the Hong Kong New Generation Cultural Association. With nearly 4,000 applicants from more than 350 local schools, it’s the city’s most popular science competition. “Most important is the creativity and innovation – how they apply their skills from the classroom in tackling a real-life problem,” says Dr Jimmy Wong Kam-yiu, the association’s director. Hong Kong group urges parents, teachers to work harder to close gender gap in STEM subjects This year, the overall champions were three Form Five boys from Po Leung Kuk Ngan Po Ling College in To Kwa Wan, who invented oil-absorbing materials in a gel-like form, which could be used for marine oil spills. It’s cheap to manufacture and once the oil is absorbed, it can be extracted. Both the oil and the absorbing materials can be recycled and reused. It’s just the sort of technical ingenuity that could form the basis of the government’s vision of a knowledge-based economy, based on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). STEM is a new buzz-phrase in education, and a new survey commissioned by the Croucher Foundation – a local independent organisation that promotes STEM – reveals much of it is taught outside the classroom. The report’s authors compiled a digital map featuring “a rich and vibrant ecosystem for out-of-school STEM education in Hong Kong” consisting of 1,074 activities, unrelated to tutoring or exam-focused services. Typically run by retired academics, volunteers and enthusiasts, these activities range from field trips and camps to exhibitions, workshops, talks and competitions. They are all designed to engage students in science and technology, and are often delivered in Hong Kong’s country parks, nature reserves and streets. Concerns raised over HKU’s ditching of maths-physics and astronomy degrees “To engage in science is an adventure; from this landscape will emerge the future science leaders of Hong Kong,” says Professor Tak Wah-mak, chairman of the Croucher Foundation. Many experts think engaging youngsters in hands-on science at an early age is vital to stimulate learning. The chief executive’s policy address in January underlined the role of STEM as key to the city’s hi-tech future, with a HK$200,000 one-off grant for every secondary school. However, there was no special support announced for science education outside the classroom, despite its record of success. Stark Chan Yik-hei is one example. He had never been considered a gifted student at C.C.C. Tam Lee Lai Fun Memorial Secondary School. In 2004, after performing well at the HKYSTIC, the 15-year-old progressed to the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) held in the US. Competing against about 1,750 of the world’s finest young scientific minds, he was awarded first runner-up prize in the engineering category for his “Total Equip” project – a sophisticated, multifunctional robot developed for domestic security. As part of the award, Chan had a minor planet named after him. Local media dubbed Chan “son of the star”, and he was accepted for an undergraduate course at HKUST in 2006, despite not having adequate formal qualifications. He wrote a bestselling autobiography and now runs a successful tech start-up company in the city called Bull.b. Hong Kong’s smart city vision must be backed by support for start-ups and imported talent, tech players say Despite the government’s hi-tech vision for the city and Chan’s success story, HKYSTIC and other extracurricular STEM programmes struggle to get government cash. “We are getting surprisingly little support,” says Wong. “It’s the bare minimum. The funding is a big challenge, as is recruiting the right staff.” It’s a key finding of the Croucher Foundation report. Even though the public’s awareness of Stem has been growing since the Education Bureau’s promotion of such a curriculum in 2015, organisers say it has been difficult to obtain funding. This difficulty even applied to well-established NGOs and well-recognised competitions that had been organised for more than a decade. The challenge is recognised by organisers of other highly respected STEM activities, such as RoboCup Junior, a scientific research-oriented open educational tournament where young students aged six to 19 design and build their own robots. “We have not received a penny of government money in over 12 years,” says Maverick Luk Che-chung, chairman and founder of the RoboCup Junior Hong Kong Association. He says his family-owned SME contributes about HK$100,000 every year to keep the event running. The venue is usually donated for free but he still needs to cover costs such as insurance, power, lighting, promotion and event staffing. RoboCup Junior is part of an international organisation that converts hands-on STEM training into competitive fun, with the home-made robots using artificial intelligence for tasks such as playing soccer, performing synchronised dance routines and completing rescue missions. Too few Hong Kong secondary pupils taking advanced maths and science courses, researchers say “This is a corporate social responsibility project to encourage kids to get interested in electronics. They are fully engaged in electronic engineering but they think they are just building a robot,” Luk says. Since an encouraging start to the programme 12 years ago, the number of competitors has declined, he says. At its peak, the competition attracted about 800 local youngsters but only 400 are expected for this year’s event, in May. He says that artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced rapidly, leaving local students behind, and a Hong Kong team has not been sent to the world championships since 2007. Luk claims there are very few teachers or instructors who understand robotics or artificial intelligence, and if they don’t understand it, they can’t inspire the students. This lack of knowledge is a common complaint in the world of STEM, he adds. Wong Chi-kin, a senior member and project organiser for the Hong Kong Association of Science and Mathematics Education, organises extracurricular STEM activities for students and teachers. Founded in 1964 and with about 500 members, the association liaises with local community leaders to take STEM programmes to the streets, often aimed at kindergarten and primary school pupils. HK RoboCup team makes all the right moves in Osaka “The first challenge is obtaining money and the second is recruiting experienced staff,” he says. There is an acute scarcity of science-trained teachers and few want to work on a project-by-project basis with no job security, he adds. The official survey backs up this view. “Many of our staff, like me, are retired university lecturers who want to do something positive for their community,” Wong says. He thinks that while Hong Kong students still compare well with others in the region, society places “too much emphasis on finance, and not science and technology. So even if kids are interested in science, they tend to choose a career in banking or finance”. “We can only arouse students’ interest and enhance the professional development of the teachers,” he says. No students pick physics any more, but without physics in the modern world, what can you do? Maverick Luk Luk agrees there are some wider challenges. He says the RoboCup Junior event encourages teamwork and friendship, but “in Chinese culture you have to win or there is no point in participating. Only one student can win first prize. I think 80 per cent of the problem is cultural – this need to win in Hong Kong stifles creativity in STEM,” he says. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology seeks funding for new HK$500m innovation centre Luk also points to the current secondary school curriculum, which places great emphasis on the four core subjects (English, Chinese, liberal studies and mathematics) at the expense of science, technology and engineering. “No students pick physics any more, but without physics in the modern world, what can you do?” “The new curriculum is a big problem,” agrees C.K. Wong, making STEM training outside school even more essential. The survey also highlighted parental objections to extracurricular STEM training as another key challenge for organisers. Some parents in Hong Kong, they say, think STEM has little relevance to daily life and/or significance to the career path of their child. Wong says many parents disapprove of competing in HKYSTIC, despite its international reputation, because they fear the time spent will undermine their child’s exam performance. “We probably have to negotiate with about 20 to 30 per cent of parents,“ he says.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Will 2017 see the return to dominance of BlackBerrys and Nokias? 2 Leaving home?

Harshal Agrawal and Arsh Banerjee will bring their winning projects to Los Angeles in May to compete in the Intel Science and Engineering Fair as Hudson County delegates. Harshal, of McNair, has been working on his project "Harmful Algae Bloom Prevention using Stropharia Mycofiltration" for two years. He began experimenting as an eighth grade student at Academy One Middle School. His early work done at the Jersey City reservoir in the Heights was "elementary testing" with mushrooms, he said. He plans to continue his research in two more phases. When asked how he felt when he received the call he was named a delegate, Agrawal said he was "speechless. "It's always been a dream to go to Intel," the sophomore said. The 59th annual expo was sponsored this year by Jersey City Medical Center in partnership with New Jersey City University. Other sponsors for this year's expo included Comcast, Liberty Savings Federal Credit Union, with support from PSE&G. Arsh, of Bayonne High, developed a computer app that helps diagnosis the Zika virus through a retinal scan. The freshman swimmer consulted with researchers in Brazil as part of his project. Though he's competed in the STEM showcase as a student at Nicholas Oresko School, winning the high school division as a freshman is "exciting," Banerjee said. He's now focused on preparing for May's international competition. "I'm basically going to present my project however I can," he said. At Bayonne High School yesterday morning, the nearly two dozen students who competed at the STEM Showcase were treated to a celebratory breakfast with their teachers and school officials. The school also recognized junior Cisco Espinosa, who earned a gold medal at the showcase for his research in ADHD. This is the third straight year Espinosa has won gold and is hoping to be only the second Bayonne student to win four in a row. Banerjee said Espinosa helped and supported him through the showcase this year. Teachers and administrators at both schools lauded their students' work. Jeremy Stanton, a chemistry instructor at McNair and Agrawal's research teacher, said he remembers judging the now sophomore's work when he was in elementary school. Harshal, he said, spent long hours at school researching and enhancing his projects. "Harshal cares deeply and is motivated not just for the glory of prizes, but to innovate and make the world a better place than when he started his work," he said. Science teachers at Bayonne High School said it's great to see the hard work their students have done get recognized on a prestige level. "I think it really drives home a point that there is hidden potential in a lot of these kids," said Alex Kuziola, a biology teacher at Bayonne High School.

To smoothly play such heavy-duty videos, a powerful player is an essential investment. However, the criteria to evaluate the power of a player should cover all aspects, instead of only graphics capability on the processor. That is, data transfer rate should be considered as well. Higher-bandwidth data transfer interfaces between CPU, GPU, memory, display and storage devices are required to prevent video playback from stuttering or frequently buffering. 4K Support in Both Graphics Processing Capability and Data Transmission To address such a challenge mentioned above, Quanmax launches a brand-new digital signage player, named QDSP-7000 Series. First of all, powered by Intel® Skylake / Kaby Lake ULT processors with Intel® HD Graphics 520 /620 integrated GPU inside, it has sufficient processing and graphics capability to deal with 4K videos. As for data transmission, it is equipped with several next-generation interfaces, including two DDR4 SO-DIMM memory sockets, one HDMI2.0 video output port and one 2.5" SATA3.0 HDD / SSD Slot. All of them have higher bandwidth and can double the data rate in comparison with previous-generation ones. Data transmission will not be a problem anymore when a 4K video file is captured from a storage device, then transferred to CPU, GPU along with memory for processing, and finally output to display. Storage and Functionality Expansion QDSP-7000 Series reserves space for one mPCIe socket and one M.2 Key B socket. Especially, M.2 socket is a highly-integrated expansion interface and allows users to add extra SSD memory space or expand possible functionality, such as Wi-Fi, WiGig, Bluetooth, 3G/4G, NFC, GPS, TV tuner. Fanless, Ventless and Suitable for Outdoor Applications In many scenarios, digital displays are deployed outdoors. Sand and dust can pose a major threat to the systems. Even though the players are installed within a custom cabinet or something alike, dust may invade through any possible gap. Dust accumulation will then clog the fan or reduce heat dissipation efficiency from sensitive components. QDSP-7000 Series is powered by an ultra low-power Intel® ULT Series processor under fanless architecture and enclosed within a ventless aluminum chassis, making it an ideal platform for outdoor digital signage applications and even for 24/7 operation. For detailed specifications of QDSP-7000 Series, please refer to http://www.quanmax.com/site/intel-skylake-kaby-lake-ult-b....

A $1,000 PC from a year ago will not be the same as today. Even though these devices tend to offer minimal upgrades each year. Unfortunately, it seems like everything is going to get much worse later in the year. According to Digitimes, PC vendors across the globe will be implementing price hikes on majority of their products. This move is brought about by the even increasing cost of materials to make a PC or electronic device. The report also mentioned that parts like the RAM, display panel, and storage are likely to increase in cost before the end of 2017. A number of companies have expressed their plans to increase their product pricing by the third quarter of 2017. Intel, with its upgraded Kaby Lake processor will be implementing a price hike on the said product at the same period. In addition to Intel, OEM and ODM companies like Lenovo and Asustek are also implementing the said hike. Typical high-end PC build (via geforce.com) This new report is however in direct contradiction to the earlier report made by the same website. According to a report last March 16, Microsoft will be introducing the new Surface Book 2 with an accompanying price reduction. While this may seem a bit weird, since Surface Books are normally priced above $1,300, Microsoft intends to sell the laptop starting at $1,000. However, since the price hike will take place in the third quarter of the year, perhaps Microsoft’s pricing will not be affected after all. That said, it is probably best to invest on a decent PC or laptop during the middle of the year in order not to be hit by the impending price hike. At the moment, many third-party component providers have expressed the possibility of price hikes within the coming months. This too will ripple down as more and more products are released on a daily basis and the market faces shortages in components. If the global supply chain fails to meet production volumes, there is a strong chance that electronic gadgets this year will become even more expensive.

Rep Devin Nunes (Intel Cmte Chmn): There was “Incidental collection” of @realDonaldTrump thru IC surveillance <- BOMBSHELL — Eric Bolling (@ericbolling) March 22, 2017 As we detailed earlier, it appears Trump may have been right, yet again. Two days after FBI director Comey shot down Trump’s allegation that Trump was being wiretapped by president Obama before the election, it appears that president Trump may have been on to something because moments ago, the House Intelligence Chairman, Devin Nunes, told reporters that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of President Trump’s transition team, possibly including Trump himself, and the information was “widely disseminated” in intelligence reports. As AP adds, Nunes said that President Donald Trump’s communications may have been “monitored” during the transition period as part of an “incidental collection.” Nunes told a news conference Wednesday that the communications appear to be picked up through “incidental collection” and do not appear to be related to the ongoing FBI investigation into Trump associates’ contacts with Russia. He says he believes the intelligence collections were done legally, although in light of the dramatic change in the plotline it may be prudent to reserve judgment on how “incidental” it was. “I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community collected information on U.S. individuals involved in the Trump transition,” Nunes told reporters. “Details about U.S. persons involved in the incoming administration with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reports.” The information was “legally brought to him by sources who thought we should know it,” Nunes said, though he provided little detail on the source. The FBI is not cooperating with the House of Representatives’ investigation into the NSA’s surveillance of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, the chairman of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), said today. “And I’ll tell you, NSA is being cooperative,” Nunes continued, “but so far the FBI has not told us whether or not they’re going to respond to our March 15th letter, which is now a couple of weeks old.” Nunes also reported that as of now, he “cannot rule out” President Obama ordering the surveillance. No wonder Obama took a “vacation” by himself to the other side of the world.

Compact devices are very popular in the business sector. The trend of the last few years is ongoing and the compact devices are becoming increasingly more powerful. Lenovo’s ThinkPad 13 lineup starts very conservatively at 759 Euros. The manufacturer installs Intel’s Core i3-7100U and 4 GB of DDR4 RAM for this price. However, only an HD panel is offered here. 819 Euros are due for the FHD model. Lenovo also offers Intel’s Core i5-7200U and the premium Intel’s Core i7-7500U as alternative processors. The latter is also in our review sample alongside 16 GB of working memory and a 512 GB SSD that is connected via PCIe. Lenovo installs the FHD panel here. The ThinkPad 13 is also available with a multi-touchscreen. Our review sample is a Campus Special Edition for 999 Euros. The corresponding configuration costs approximately 1230 Euros in Lenovo’s online shop at test time… Post navigation Road-rager punches window, uses pepper spray!

Photos by Tanya Terry FLINT — About $12,500 in Amazon gift cards, five fully paid trips to Los Angeles for the Intel International Science & Engineering Fair in May and scholarships for the University of Michigan-Flint and Kettering University were among many other exciting prizes awarded at the 60th Annual Flint Regional Science Fair held March 17-20 in the Kettering University Campus Center. There were about 300 students in the event this year. The students are awarded in these and other manners. “The science fair empowers kids to do projects on topics of interest to them. They learn how to do research, develop critical thinking skills, come up with neat ideas and learn how to present their ideas to judges and others,” said Tom Cerny, vice president of the Flint Regional Science Fair. Cerny said the confidence that comes from doing those things is very empowering. “They are skills used throughout a lifetime,” he said. Ibraheem Najjar, 13, who is a seventh grader at Genesee Academy in Swartz Creek and resides in Flushing won the grand prize of $750 for the junior division in the earth science/ chemistry category. He also received certificates from the Flint River Watershed Coalition and the City of Flint Water Treatment Plant and Facilities and was awarded by the city of Flint office of the mayor. “My project was about cleaning water with the sun using plastic bottles,” Najjar said. For his project Najjar explored the SODIS method, partially because part of his family lives where the water infrastructure has been destroyed because of war. “I learned about this method when researching cheap ways to clean water,” he said. “We also have some family in Syria who do not have access to clean water. I learned they can do this anywhere.” Najjar did research for his project at McLaren Flint’s lab. “I thought the lab was high-tech and intriguing,” he said. Najjar, who was not expecting to win, said he participated in the science fair because he was required to for part of his grade in school. “It was fun, though,” he said. He said the science fair can help things that need scientific process and research, and he may use science to follow in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps, as a doctor. Najjar was not the only student whose project involved water issues. Water was, in fact, a popular topic at the fair. “Last year, the Flint water was contaminated,” said Mesk Abdulhay. 14, who is in ninth grade at Grand Blanc High School and resides in Grand Blanc. “So, I went to the Flint River and got samples of the water and got samples of water in Genesee County, filtered and unfiltered.” Abdulhay said she is interested in the environment and has focused on it for all her science fair projects through the years. She received a sixth-place award in the earth science/chemistry category wants to be an eye doctor. For this project, she went to Hurley Cancer Institute to use the electron beam radiation on water from each sample. She later got a pH test kit online and tested the hardness, iron, pH test, TD5 and chlorine of the water. “I added smell and color when I got the water out the Flint River because it smelled really bad and was yellow,” Abdulhay said. “I wanted to see if radiation affected that.” Her conclusion was that the more dose of radiation used on contaminated water, the less contaminated it would be. She said she felt this information could be helpful. “I feel we should open a factory that has radiation that has water go through it,” she said. Andrew Meikle, 13, who is an eighth grader at Davison Middle School and resides in Lapeer won multiple awards for his project which involved testing multiple water treatment methods for bacteria, as well as total suspended solid. He was a fourth-place winner in the junior division in the physical science/engineering category. He also received a certificate from the city of Flint Water Treatment Plant and Facilities, a certificate and medal from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and a plaque and cash award from the Michigan Association of Hazardous Material Professionals. He was one of over 30 winners from the school. “I choose this project because I enjoy camping and I was interested in finding what I’d have to do to treat water to make it safe,” Meikle said. Meikle got the water from Hasler Creek, in Lapeer County. He worked on his project at KAMAX manufacturing plant in Lapeer. Meikle found through his experiment that distillation is the most effective treatment method. The method performed well in both tests. “I think the science fair gives us knowledge on how to write scientific papers, as well as conduct experiments we come up with,” Meikle said. “We are going to have to work on projects when we’re older. I probably want to do something like engineering for a career.” Andrew Shorkey, 11, who is a fifth grader at Hahn Intermediate School in Davison and resides in Burton, focused on a different water-related matter. He did a project on water conservation and received certificates from The City of Flint Water Treatment Plant and Facilities and The Flint River Watershed Coalition. He was also named research fellow and received a ribbon for that. “My hypothesis was that visual reminders would be better at improving water conservation than verbal reminders,” he said. To prove his theory, Shorkey timed four people’s showers for two weeks to obtain base line data. Then, he did the process again, adding verbal reminders. Afterwards, he repeated the process with visual reminders. “I collected all the data and found my hypothesis was correct, that visual reminders were better than verbal reminders at improving water conservation,” Shorkey said. Shorkey said he also found out both visual and verbal reminders help improve water conservation. He said visual and verbal reminders can help students learn in classrooms and help people break bad habits. “I think that could be helpful because everyone has bad habits,” he said. Shorkey did his project at home, with the help of his parents, on Christmas and summer breaks, and every other school break. Shorkey does not know what he wants to do for a career, but said he enjoys trying new things at science fairs. Not all science fair projects at the event were pertaining to water. Sarah Abdelhay, 11, who is in sixth grade at Genesee Academy and resides in Flushing explored how light get absorbed and is reflected and why people see colors the way they see them. She received a fifth place award. Nour Almounajed, 10, who is in fifth grade at Genesee Academy and resides in Grand Blanc, found her hypothesis in which stated if the concentration of baking soda is increased, then the rate of photosynthesis in a plant will also increase, was correct. She received a second place award and a special award from Genesys Regional Health Center. Taylor Fields, 11, who is in fifth grade at Dye Elementary in Flint Township and resides in Grand Blanc, investigated whether rooftop gardens could make a house cooler than regular roofs. She discovered it did. “The soil at the bottom of the soil kept it cooler and the grass helped absorb the heat,” Fields said. She said she believes this information could be valuable to people. “I think what I learned will help people because if rooftop gardens keep their houses cooler, they’ll save energy, save on their bills and save money,” she said. Fields, who received a fifth place award and a special award on behalf of the MIDHHS Explore Lab Science Program, said she would like to be an herbalist one day. “I like to grow plants,” she said. “I like to do science and mix stuff.” Saria Saeed, 10, who is in fifth grade at Genesee Academy and resides in Grand Blanc was the first-place winner for the elementary division and was also awarded by the city of Flint office of the mayor. She examined what antioxidant was the best for her project. She used apple slices to represent the human body. “Without antioxidants, we would be like the apple when it’s brown,” she said. Saeed said free radicals are like waste in the body, but antioxidants can neutralize or kill free radicals, helping to prevent lung disease, cancer, kidney problems, brain problems and aging skin. She left apple slices by themselves and in water, blackberry juice, green tea, blueberry juice, goji berry juice or coffee with no sugar. She found the goji berry juice to be the best antioxidant, which she said is helpful for people to know. Saeed would like to be a music producer one day. “I didn’t think I would actually win, but being in the science fair showed me if I work hard on anything, I can be successful,” she said. Nour Almounajed came in second in the elementary division and Samuel Gagnon came in third. First place for the junior (middle school) division was Ibraheem Najjar for the earth science/chemistry catergoy, Nick Shepich for the physics/ engineering category and Sinan Lal in the life sciences category. Second place winners were Serena Ahmad and Affan Ahmed for life sciences, Hamza Alam for physics/engineering and Matt Davidson for earth science/chemistry. Third place winners were Jack Banes and Steven Maurer for physics/ engineering, Natalie Benjamin for life science and Akshanth Bandla for earth science/chemistry. First place for the senior (high school) division was Clara Wagner, with Neehal Tumma coming in second and Samuel Maher in third. “The experience from competing in the science fair in high school greatly improved my interviewing and report writing skills,” said Noah Gagnon, a former science fair second place winner who competed in the international science fair in the past and was a judge this year. “This proved invaluable both during my college engineering classes and in the job market as well. The Flint Regional Science Fair was one of the major components that helped me achieve the career I have today,” said Gagnon, who works as a hardware design engineer. Hopefully, the science fair will continue to enrich the lives of participants who enter scientific careers, and those who do not, for years to come.

Devin Nunes, who is accused of sucking up to the White House Tim Molloy, provided by Published 5:31 pm, Wednesday, March 22, 2017 Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Joe Scarborough: ‘Remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman’ 1 / 1 Back to Gallery “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough called on Republicans to drop Rep. Devin Nunes as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee after a chain of events that suggested Nunes was sucking up to the White House instead of working in the interests of Congress. “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman,” tweeted Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida. The tweet continued the “Mean Girls”-pattern of friendliness and fighting that has characterized the Trump-Scarborough relationship for months. Last week, things got so tense that the president unfollowed Scarborough on Twitter. Also Read: President Trump Unfollows 'Morning Joe' Hosts on Twitter If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman. — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 22, 2017 How did Nunes awaken Scarborough’s (and other people’s) Twitter fury? As The Hill explains, he announced that he had seen evidence that U.S. intelligence had come across information on members of President Trump’s transition team while conducting routine surveillance of foreign targets. Trump — who famously claimed, without offering any evidence, that President Obama had wiretapped his Trump Tower office — said he felt “somewhat” vindicated by Nunes’ statement about the surveillance. Also Read: Why Even Donald Trump Can't Save Twitter (Of course, Nunes’ statement Wednesday didn’t refer to Trump Tower, and he and FBI Director James Comey have said there’s no evidence such surveillance occurred. But in fairness, Trump only said he felt “somewhat” vindicated, not vindicated.) Nunes made his comment about the surveillance without consulting the top Democrat on his committee, Rep. Adam Schiff. Then Nunes went to the White House to brief the administration about them, which Democrats said was weird, and suggested Nunes was working for Trump’s team, not his own branch of government. “Today, Chairman Nunes shared information with WH still withheld from our committee. He cannot conduct a credible investigation this way,” Schiff tweeted. Nunes said the surveillance didn’t involve probes into Team Trump’s possible Russian ties. Scarborough has alternately been accused of being too cozy and too standoffish with Trump, though they’re currently in a less-friendly phase. Scarborough also retweeted a sharp Wall Street Journal editorial Wednesday that says Trump is clinging to his tapped-phones assertion “like a drunk to an empty gin bottle.” Read original story Joe Scarborough: ‘Remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman’ At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

In an interview on MSNBC with Chuck Todd, California Rep. Adam Schiff was asked about former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s recent statement that he had seen no evidence by the time he left office on Jan. 20 that Trump’s team had cooperated with the Kremlin. (RELATED: Obama’s Intelligence Director Says No Evidence Of Trump-Russia Collusion) “Reviewing the evidence that I have, I don’t think you can conclude that at all, far from it,” Schiff told Todd of Clapper’s recent remarks. “But you admit…all you have right now is a circumstantial case,” Todd replied. “Actually, no Chuck, I can tell you that the case is more than that. I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now,” said Schiff. “So you have seen direct evidence of collusion?” Todd asked. “I don’t want to go into specifics, but I can say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and that is very much worthy of investigation.” Schiff’s interview came just after Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes held two press briefings announcing that Trump’s personal communications may have been incidentally collected during routine surveillance of unnamed foreign targets. (RELATED: House Intel Chair: Trump’s Personal Communications May Have Been Captured By Obama Admin) Nunes also said that the Obama administration may have improperly unmasked the identities of Trump advisers whose communications were picked up during the surveillance. Like Schiff, Nunes declined to give more details about the information he has seen. Schiff criticized Nunes for giving the press briefings, saying that the Republican should have briefed other members of the committee on the new information. Instead, Nunes shared the information with reporters before going to the White House to brief Trump.

BAZ RATNER/REUTERS U.S. charges two Israeli residents with Mobileye insider trading Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli startups Opinion Why men are terrified of the rise of driverless cars Every week, Prof. Amnon Shashua convenes his class on the Givat Ram campus of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. A computer science professor and newly minted billionaire, Shashua teaches an advanced seminar on deep learning. The class is theoretical, but he could tell them a thing or two about turning theory into fact, and how much their research could change the world one day. That is what Shashua aims to do with Mobileye, which he founded over 17 years ago with Ziv Aviram. Mobileye developed driving-aid systems and today its technology is being used to develop autonomous cars. That’s why Intel just offered to buy it for $15.3 billion. Shashua came from MIT, where he did his PhD in brain and cognitive sciences, and post-doc in biological and computational learning, then joined the Hebrew University in 1996 – three years before establishing Mobileye. Mobileye’s technology is based on his research, which raised questions about intellectual property at the company’s beginning. The norm at universities is that IP developed during research doesn’t belong only to the researchers but to the institution employing them. But though some of the development of Mobileye’s technology began at Hebrew University, it’s not getting much from the company’s meteoric growth and imminent sale in the biggest takeover in Israeli history. Compare that with the Weizmann Institute of Science, which over the years enjoyed large royalties from Copaxone, a proprietary drug made by Teva for multiple sclerosis. What happened? “Mobileye wasn’t exactly a Hebrew University venture. It started as a private venture by Shashua and Aviram, and there was an argument to what degree the university had a part in it,” says Prof. Menachem Magidor, the university’s president at the time. Complicated “That’s because much of the venture was done outside the university. Shashua claimed some of the research had been done while he was at the Technion [in Haifa], some on sabbatical and some at Mobileye itself. It was complicated.” Universities protect their intellectual property through in-house technology transfer companies. Tel Aviv University has Ramot; Weizmann has Yeda; and Hebrew University has Yissum to commercialize research. Transfer companies may operate by royalties, which is often the model used with drug development – the university keeps the patent and sells usage rights, in exchange for say 30% or 40% of sales. Or the university may hand over its technological rights in exchange for shares. In Mobileye’s case, the Hebrew University elected for shares – though not before a dispute over its stake, which was settled by arbitration in the early 2000s. The compromise left Hebrew University with only a few percent. But the university didn’t want to battle on and sue its own staffer; they held Shashua in the highest regard and wanted him to stay on, Magidor says. And the shares they got were diluted over time because the university didn’t invest more in the company. He adds that the university isn’t in the business of making money, but of conducting research and teaching, and that the academic consideration must prevail. Hebrew University commented that the controversy is long over. Mobileye declined to comment. How many percent the university actually got isn’t known; it also may have sold shares some before Mobileye floated in New York. Anyhow, it arrived at the IPO owning 0.6% of the company. From the flotation to date, Hebrew University has made $40 million from selling shares. Prof. Shmuel Peleg, Shashua’s colleague in the computer science and engineering department, says Hebrew University is very supportive of its researchers founding companies, certainly compared with other universities. When a researcher founds a company – as he himself has done twice – he negotiate with the university over its share in it. When selling a drug patent to a company, the scientist simply shares the income with the university. Technology is different. “In such cases, the researcher invents a mathematical formula, which is useful mainly for publishing a paper,” says Peleg. “Somebody else comes along and suggests using the formula in automated driving, for example – a new technology of unproven demand; even the formula’s ability to solve a problem hasn’t been proved. A company is set up, it applies the formula to the problem and persuades the world to move to automated driving. The argument will be over the university’s part in its success, what is its part in the idea, the implementation and the marketing.” Some investment formulae tie stakes to future investment in the company’s research: if the future investment is high, then the technology is based less on know-how gained at the university and its share will be smaller. “Some universities demand 40% of any company and no companies get set up there,” says Peleg, who advocates negotiation. Granted, arguments ensue, but the fact is that Hebrew University people produce a lot of companies, showing it’s on the right track, he says. Furthermore, income from intellectual property rights is a tiny fraction of any university’s total budget, adds Magidor. Most universities that made anything from IP did it through two or three blockbuster successes, and Hebrew University is in a very distinguished position from that perspective – though Magidor admits that Weizmann beats it hand over fist. “In principle, as a proportion of the budget, the return on the investment in research is usually far from covering it,” says Magidor. “It doesn’t pay, economically speaking. Hebrew University owns thousands of patents that it doesn’t try to commercialize. It isn’t good at it and that isn’t its relative edge. We try to commercialize a few dozen things that we believe may proffer commercial potential. Sometimes you miss. It’s like a venture capital fund. In Mobileye’s case, it’s hard to say we were confident.” Secret agreement The university uses such income to improve labs, etc. Some years ago, a dispute arose between the computer science school and the university administrtration. The school claimed the administration owed it tens of millions of shekels and some senior teachers at the school took an unusual step: They sued. The case was settled out of court in secret. It’s well documented that technology giants also fund the school. “We’re very strong in computer vision. The company that’s invested the most in us is Intel, but Google also gives research grants,” says Peleg. And what do they get in return? “From the perspective of IP, they don’t get anything,” responds Peleg. “Intel’s condition is that everything developed will be open to the public and everyone can use it – meaning developments can’t be patented. The companies do get access to the researchers who give lectures, and to the students, who join then afterward.” They’re not contractors, he notes, but researchers. The companies can’t just ask them to develop projects, says Peleg, “because we’d refuse to do it for them.” Hagai Amit Haaretz Contributor Hagai Amit Send me email alerts for new articles by Hagai Amit Send Close Email * Please enter your email Hagai Amit For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

It's irresponsible to do otherwise,” added conservative Rep. Justin AmashJustin AmashObamaCare gets new lease on life Top Republican: The healthcare bill is dead House GOP abandons ObamaCare repeal effort in stunning defeat MORE (R-Mich.) in a tweet Thursday night. Republicans on Thursday night announced that they would make some significant changes to the bill, known as the American Health Care Act, with the intention of winning over conservatives. The most prominent of those changes is to repeal ObamaCare’s essential health benefits, which mandate which health services an insurance plan must cover, including areas like mental health, prescription drugs, and maternity care. The GOP will also add $15 billion to a “stability fund” to the bill in order to provide mental health and maternity coverage, which will be paid for by keeping ObamaCare's 0.9 percent Medicare tax on high earners for six years. Repealing the essential health benefits could have far-reaching consequences for the legislation and for the U.S. healthcare system, but the CBO will not have time to release an analysis of the change before the vote on Friday. “With these amendments, no,” House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyTrump, GOP look to tax bill for lifeline The right approach to promoting competition in the health care marketplace GOP rushes to vote without knowing full impact of healthcare plan MORE (R-Texas) told reporters Thursday night when asked if there would be a new CBO report. He defended moving forward, though. “We will continue to ask the CBO for a score,” Brady said. “We anticipate that they'll have to look at the coverage issues. The stability fund is pretty straightforward so we don't anticipate major changes that way.” Asked about releasing changes the night before the vote, Brady pointed to comments from White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who said President Trump is finished negotiating and is threatening to leave ObamaCare in place if the bill doesn't pass Friday. “We've been discussing these solutions with members for several days now and so has President Trump,” Brady said. “Mr. Mulvaney made it clear the president is done negotiating, that this is a conservative package that lowers healthcare costs, and so at his request and the leadership's, we're moving forward with the vote tomorrow.” Some Republicans downplayed the importance of a full nonpartisan analysis of the bill’s effects before voting on it. “I know this will all make the deficit better,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a leadership ally. Pressed on how he knows that if there’s no CBO score, Cole said: “Because it doesn’t take the CBO — because I know the range, what the initial CBO score was, and I know the range of changes that they’re talking about.” Members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus who have been opposed to the legislation say leadership shouldn’t rush the process. “We’ve been saying for a while that we need to slow down,” said Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho). “Let’s get it right. It’s better to get it right than to get it fast.” The House voted late Thursday night to fast-track consideration of the GOP healthcare plan. The procedure approved on a largely party-line vote waives a House rule that requires lawmakers to wait a day before considering a measure produced out of the Rules Committee, which determines parameters for how legislation is considered on the floor. That means the Rules Committee will be able to tack on an amendment, known as a "manager's amendment," to the repeal-and-replace bill with a litany of changes that haven’t all had time to be reviewed by the CBO. Four Republicans broke with their party to oppose adoption of the waiver: Reps. Amash, Thomas Massie (Ky.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and David Young (Iowa). All four have come out against the legislation. The House Rules Committee is expected to meet early Friday morning to tack on the last-minute changes to the legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Thursday night the floor vote on passage of the bill could wrap up by the afternoon.

GOP leaders plan to bring up the legislation meant to fulfill a seven-year campaign pledge on Friday, even though they are struggling to win over enough votes after marathon negotiations and dealmaking behind closed doors.  The House normally has to wait a day before considering a measure produced out of the Rules Committee, which determines how legislation is considered on the floor. ADVERTISEMENT The fast-track procedure approved in a largely party-line vote Thursday night waives that requirement and speeds things up. This way, the House can consider a rule establishing parameters for floor debate on the same day it comes out of the Rules Committee. Four Republicans opposed to the GOP healthcare plan voted against the rule in an unusual break with leadership on a procedural vote. GOP Reps. Justin AmashJustin AmashObamaCare gets new lease on life Top Republican: The healthcare bill is dead House GOP abandons ObamaCare repeal effort in stunning defeat MORE (Mich.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and David Young (Iowa) have all come out against the bill. "We must have the opportunity to read and understand the final bill before we vote. It's irresponsible to do otherwise," Amash tweeted. Lawmakers typically vote by party lines on procedural votes even if they might defect on the underlying legislation. That’s because procedural votes are viewed by leadership as a referendum on how they run the floor. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on the floor late Thursday that it’s expected the vote could wrap up by Friday afternoon. The House Rules Committee is expected to meet Friday morning to add an amendment to the legislation that, among other provisions, would eliminate ObamaCare’s minimum insurance coverage requirements. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued an updated analysis earlier Thursday based on proposed changes unveiled earlier in the week. Those provisions will also be added to the bill by the Rules Committee. But it’s not expected to have time to issue another analysis in time for Friday’s vote to assess how repealing the minimum insurance requirements will affect the nation’s healthcare system. Democrats blasted the GOP for rushing ahead with a major healthcare overhaul without waiting for the CBO’s full analysis. “The rules are there are no rules. It’s Lord of the Flies day here in the House of Representatives. They want to make us vote on a bill that no one’s even read. No one can find it. Anything goes,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said.

Military Military: The Intel Obsession, jealousy: Navy SEAL embroiled in rape court-martial Navy SEAL insignia Navy SEAL insignia ( ) Navy SEAL insignia ( ) Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter A rare general court-martial taking place this week includes allegations of rape, violence and adultery in a community usually known for its discipline: the Navy SEALs. A married SEAL is on trial in Norfolk, Virginia, on four counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault and single counts of aggravated assault and battery. Other charges are violating a general regulation and making a false official statement. Prosecutors allege that the longtime affair Chief Petty Officer Stephen Varanko III was having with a woman in his unit exploded into jealous violence when the SEAL discovered the woman had dated someone else. Defense attorneys are arguing that the alleged victim was simply gunning for automatic reassignment and for revenge after Varanko refused to leave his wife for her. The two had been carrying on an affair for two years, including during an Afghanistan deployment and prior to the SEAL’s marriage. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The alleged events occurred in February 2015 while Special Reconnaissance Team Two was in Fort Knox, Kentucky, for training, according to coverage of the trial by the Virginian-Pilot and Navy Times. The woman is an analyst who worked with the Little Creek, Virginia-based SEAL unit. She hasn’t been named, as general media policy is not to identify people who report sexual assault. The group was returning to their hotel from a Kentucky strip bar when Varanko used the woman’s cell phone and saw texts revealing a sexual encounter with another man eight months prior. When the pair went to Varanko’s room, he exploded. Prosecutors allege that the SEAL threw the woman against the wall with his hands around her neck, nearly choking her. He also put her in a “submission hold,” with her arm behind her and his knee in her back. The SEAL reportedly admitted to investigators that he “lost a little bit of control,” but he maintained that he didn’t hit the woman. The disagreement ended in two rounds of sex, which is where the rape allegations come in. The woman testified that she only went along with it because she feared further violence. Varanko’s attorneys deny it was rape. The defense touted an estimated 1,000 text exchanges between the two after that night to bolster the SEAL’s side of the story. “I stayed because I still love you,” she texted him the next day. Two weeks later, the woman allegedly sent Varanko a video in which she appeared in uniform and held up cards with a written message professing her love for him. On the other hand, the SEAL texted her afterwards that he was “embarrassed and ashamed” and that what he did “terrified” him. If convicted, Varanko could face a life sentence without parole. The court-martial is not being handled as a jury trial and will be decided by a military judge, Cmdr. Heather Partridge. The proceedings are expect to continue through Friday.

 'What the hell is Nunes doing at the White House?': Former top CIA, NSA lawyer stunned House Intel chair shared info with Trump Allan Smith Mar. 23, 2017, 8:13 PM 33,078 facebook linkedin twitter email print Rep. Devin Nunes. Getty Images A former top lawyer for the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Department of Defense expressed shock in an interview with Business Insider that the House Intelligence Committee chair, Devin Nunes, went to the White House to share information with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, even as Nunes' panel had been looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Robert Deitz, who held those posts in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and of President George W. Bush, said Nunes' Wednesday trip to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was "unbelievable." "What the hell is Nunes doing at the White House?" Deitz, who is now a professor at George Mason University, said. "The idea that a person working in a committee that down the road at least is supposed to be looking into Russian influence in US elections ... would go racing to the White House — and to do what? Get his tummy rubbed? I just find unbelievable. "Moreover, he could well be disclosing information that is of course highly classified," he continued. "Of course, not that Mr. Trump doesn't have the proper classifications — by definition he does — but, you just don't pass that information on willy-nilly. So I don't get that scene at all." Nunes, a California Republican, caused a stir Wednesday when he told a press gathering that the intelligence community had "incidentally collected" information on the Trump transition team during the transition period. He went on to say the collection occurred on "numerous occasions" and was not related to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. "Details about US persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting," Nunes said, adding that the information he spoke of was collected legally, in his view, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Trump administration was not aware of what he was describing to the press at that point, so he then went to the White House immediately following the press briefing to discuss his findings, a situation that many observers found odd. A member of Trump's transition team, Nunes finds himself leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's effort to manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. It was during a hearing Monday in front of Nunes' committee that FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the bureau had been investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government since late July. Comey also said the FBI and the Department of Justice could provide no evidence to back up Trump's explosive Twitter claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped him, an item that Nunes insisted Wednesday his new revelations did not prove. President Donald Trump. Evan Vucci/AP Images Following his meeting at the White House, Nunes told the press he found nothing wrong with briefing the president on information that could be related to an ongoing investigation into members of his administration and campaign team. "Because what I saw had nothing to do with Russia and the Russian investigation," Nunes said. "It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities, and the president needs to know these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that." Nunes hadn't shared the information he was discussing publicly and with the White House with his fellow intelligence committee members. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, blasted him in a press conference early Wednesday evening, saying Nunes' moves compromised the independence of the investigation the committee was attempting to conduct. Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat on the committee, told CNN on Thursday that Nunes apologized at their Thursday meeting. Speaking with reporters Thursday, Nunes said it was a "judgment call" to deliver the information to the president. He later said he would not do things differently if he had a second chance. "There was a lot going on yesterday," he said. "It was a judgment call on my part. Sometimes you make the right decision, and sometimes you make the wrong decision, but you’ve got to stick by the decisions you make." Late Thursday, in a reversal, a spokesman for Nunes told ABC News that the congressman did not know "for sure" whether Trump or members of the transition team were caught up in the communications he cited Wednesday. Deitz told Business Insider that he didn't think the episode would lead to something such as Nunes having his intelligence clearances revoked. But, as Deitz put it, intelligence officials may be "less than wholly forthcoming about information" they share. "Once Mr. Nunes does something like this, people in the intel community might be reluctant to, for example, share the true crown jewels," he said. Vindication? Following his meeting with Nunes, Trump told reporters he felt "somewhat" vindicated by Nunes' revelations, as the president has spent the better part of March defending his earlier claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped by Obama. He's backed away from the claim slightly, saying he meant wiretapping to mean more broad surveillance, but he has not distanced himself from the original claim, which was rebuked by many across the political spectrum. Deitz said the revelation was "far from a vindication." "In some ways it's almost the reverse," he said. "That is, if, and let's assume for a moment that someone getting [intelligence] collection from overseas [and] is getting a Trump person on the other line. It can be totally innocent. On the other hand, it could completely validate the notion that Trump people are talking to Russians." "So I don't get the partial vindication argument at all," he said. "To me, it raises more questions than it resolves." He added that "nobody" had claimed that members of Trump's circle hadn't been captured on such surveillance before, naming Michael Flynn, the ousted national security adviser, specifically. "And so why it's somehow 'good news' for Mr. Trump that some of his people have been captured in collection," he said. "I don't see how that is ever good news."

Skip to content GPS Tracking Info Just another NEWS site Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Everything you need to know about VR By admin in Uncategorized March 23, 2017 Virtual reality has been around for decades, but it’s only of late that the technology has properly matured with reliable consumer-grade headsets, room-scale tracking, high quality touch controllers and a library of games worth exploring.So now that people can get into virtual reality in a range of ways – from mobiles to consoles to the top-end headsets – what’s changed? Here’s everything you need to know about VR. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Part of VR’s trick lies in the immersion, which is generated by having a wide field of view. Photo: Kotaku Presented by 7th Generation Intel® Core™ processors will immerse you in gaming and entertainment like never before. Desktop PCs and mobile devices start faster, work longer, and support higher-res graphics and video.How Does It Work? The building blocks of virtual reality is a set of displays, typically one for each of your eyes, built into a headset that wraps around your head. A set of lenses are then placed in front of each screen, creating a stereoscopic 3D image by angling the flat 2D images from each screen into something more akin to how the human eyes have slightly different perspectives on the world.You can get an idea of the principle by looking at an object and then looking at it with just one eye. The picture above shows the raw images beamed onto each screen, and you can see this in the flesh by taking a VR headset off and looking individually through each lens.Part of VR’s trick lies in the immersion, which is generated by having a wide field of view. Humans naturally have a field of view of around 170 degrees, but early head-mounted devices only had a field of view of less than 50 degrees. That’s been greatly expanded since then: the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive have a FOV of around 110o, a good deal less than what humans see normally, while PlayStation VR is a fraction less at approximately 100o. Advertisement But it’s wide enough to trick the brain into buying into the experience, and there’s a practical benefit too: the wider your field of view is, the more sensitive you are to motion. So having just enough field of view is actually better, because it gives developers more leeway when building their games without sending users’ stomachs into a spin.The complete illusion needs appropriate visuals and audio to work, however, and getting the visuals right has been one of virtual reality’s bugbears in the past. Not only was the quality too low, but the delay between moving your head and the response from the image inside the headset left people nauseous in minutes. The latest generation of VR headsets has vastly increased refresh rates and frame rates, however, eliminating two of the main problems that sent users searching for a barf bag. Headsets these days also have an advanced array of accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes for precise head tracking. The amount of tech varies from headset to headset; you’ll find more advanced tracking in OSVR and the Vive than the Samsung Gear VR.Each headset will have its own means of tracking the user in the virtual world as well. For low-end devices like Google Cardboard and Gear VR, you’ll mostly be restricted to looking around the in-game environment. More expensive devices will have touch controllers and room-scale capabilities, although the precision of the Rift and the Vive, with their wireless sensor boxes, is significantly higher than PSVR .Why Virtual Reality? Photo: Kotaku Developers and manufacturers often throw around the word “immersion” a lot, so much so that it can start to lose meaning. It’s something you have to experience, rather than something you can explain, and the best way to do that is often by trying a headset on yourself. Alternatively, a really good image will do the trick: above is Amanda Yeo, Kotaku’s erstwhile morning sub-editor, trying virtual reality for the first time.It’s one of my favourite pictures of the “VR reaction”. Being closed off from the rest of the world and transported into a virtual environment has a lot of utility, and when done right it can create an experience that you simply can’t match with a regular 2D or 3D screen.Right now, it could be argued that the technology is currently more helpful for developers making applications that have nothing to do with gaming. The construction industry is already using VR headsets to help visualise and manage projects. IKEA released a free VR app on Steam that lets users explore a virtual kitchen in 3D, and the furnishings giant has already indicated it might introduce VR experiences in-store down the road.Tourism Australia has published an app for Google Cardboard that gives people first person views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, and the National Museum of Australia recently wrapped up a virtual reality experience featuring David Attenborough. You can even view a surgery in VR, although I’d avoid it if you’re the squeamish type.Intel also showcased a future for sports at CES earlier this year, with attendees given the chance to view a live college basketball match from multiple cameras in the stadium. Directors have even begun using VR to help them direct scenes, as Gareth Edwards did with Rogue One.As for games, VR can transform existing titles that weren’t originally built for the hardware. VorpX is a third-party driver for the Rift and Vive that makes games, including Grand Theft Auto 5 and Skyrim, VR compatible. Thumper is perfectly playable on a regular screen, but playing it in VR adds a degree of intensity that rhythm games haven’t had.Most people won’t be able to recreate it in their homes, but the best illustration of VR gaming right now is Zero Latency in Melbourne. Using backpack VR PCs to eliminate the problem of being tethered to a PC on the floor, Zero Latency puts players into a warehouse space and lets them duke it out in futuristic environments. There’s missions where players duke it out against waves of zombies and enemies, but there’s also a puzzle game and the co-op sci-fi shooter Singularity, complete with jump scares and intense firefights. It’s as much of a physical experience as a virtual one. Oculus Rift The Rift, courtesy of its Kickstarter and the subsequent development kits that followed, helped bring virtual reality back into the mainstream. And while it’s not the only option for those who want to live on the cutting edge, it’s not a bad choice.But with the Touch controllers finally shipping at the end of last year and having just gotten a discount that brings the cost of the headset and base stations below $850 ex. shipping.One thing the Rift has in spades as well is content, either through the Rift-compatible games on Steam or the exclusives available through the Oculus Store. The best example is probably SUPERHOT VR, the VR version of the slow-mo bullet dodging indie that was one of my favourite games of 2016.The Rift doesn’t necessarily have an advantage in content, but the recently shipped Touch controllers are pretty outstanding. They’re light and built around a counterblanace that sits comfortably in the palm of each hand. Each controller runs off a single AAA battery that lasts for weeks, according to Kirk’s testing, and the Rift’s integrated headphones are also excellent. The hardware requirements have dropped a fraction since launch too, and the latest graphics cards have meant that you don’t need to spend as much on your PC as before to enjoy the cream of the VR crop.The advantage of investing in a high end headset like the Rift means you can enjoy games like Elite: Dangerous in the best possible fashion, games that are too graphically demanding for the mobile or PS4-powered alternatives. The better tracking also means shooters like Arizona Sunshine are vastly superior, since you won’t be plagued with jitters or a lack of precision when you’re trying to mow down the waves of zombies coming at you.Rift’s main issue is one of tethering: if you’re going to move around, you’ll need to be careful you don’t trip on the multiple USB cables necessary to power the device. The HTC Vive, by comparison, will get a wireless peripheral later this year called TPCAST. There’s a third-party peripheral called KwikVR due to launch this month that supports both the Rift and the Vive, but KwikVR says it will add just under 12ms of latency to the minimal lag that’s already built into the Rift. TPCast, by comparison, claims it will add less than 2ms to the Vive experience, which isn’t enough to add any jutter or distortion to the end product.It’s not the only third-party wireless solution, however, and don’t rule out Oculus announcing their own product later this year.A headset developed jointly by Valve and smartphone manufacturer HTC, the Vive is currently the most popular of the high-end headsets. Like the Rift, it supports room-scale tracking through two wireless base stations and ships with two decent controllers with dual-stage triggers, trackpads and plenty of their own sensors. The Vive also has the benefit of a front-facing camera, which solves the awkward problem of trying to find your drink when you’re immersed in VR.There’s a lot of subtle differences between the Vive and the Rift that you’ll want to take note of. The Vive and Rift output at the same resolution, but the Vive has a larger vertical field of view than Oculus’s offering. The extra visibility adds to the experience, but it’s not cost-free: because the Vive is displaying an image over the same screen size, the taller field of view results in a slightly more pronounced screen-door effect .The Vive also shipped with Chaperone, a technology that scans your real-world space and displays a virtual grid to the user in-game. It’s designed to stop you from accidentally walking into your TV, wall, or table. The Vive also has the benefit of being part of a more open platform, and there are nearly double the amount of Vive-compatible games on Steam compared to the Rift. And to further ensure you don’t miss real life when you’re in VR, HTC has an app that flicks notifications from your phone through to your Vive’s dashboard.Like the Rift, the Vive requires users be tethered to a base station via a USB cable. It’s far from ideal, and the VR experience will be massively improved once the TPCast wireless receiver launches later this year. HTC has also announced that it will support full body tracking with two trackers placed on top of the users’ feet. The trackers can be used in other ways though, so expect some virtual guns and Rock Band-style guitars in the near future. The Vive’s Deluxe Audio Strap will also add integrated audio and a more rigid strap, which should resolve some of the comfort issues people had with the original model. Google Cardboard What VR experience you get will depend on how much you pay. If you just want to dive into a virtual world for as little as possible, there’s the Google Cardboard viewer. As the name implies, it’s largely built out of cardboard and is designed to work with any smartphone on the market.The selling point of Cardboard is that it’s absurdly cheap – the viewers can be shipped flat in minuscule packaging, allowing people to experience VR without shelling thousands on a high-end headset and PC. But the quality of the experience wildly varies, and due to the low-end cost you still have to deal with a low resolution and a smaller focal range. Some of the games also require a separate bluetooth controller, which not everyone has.If you want to see what some of the Cardboard experiences are like, YouTube has an auto-generated playlist of stereoscopic 360 VR films that you can view on a regular screen here. As for the games, Chair in a Room is a little hidden item puzzle game with a dark storyline. There’s also a curious app called TrinusVR, which lets you play games on your PC in Google Cardboard. Here’s a video of how that works.Google Daydream View Google’s other foray into VR is called Google Daydream View, a headset made out of jersey fabric. It’s exceedingly comfortable; perhaps the most comfortable headset on the market, thanks to the weight, lack of cables and the materials. And while it’s still a device that leverages the power of your smartphone, it’s a more powerful piece of kit and subsequently more powerful than Google Cardboard.Available from $119 through Google or traditional retailers, Daydream ships with a Bluetooth motion controller that acts as a pointer that lets you control, interact and navigate your VR environment. Cecilia thought it was one of Daydream’s best features, and it’s great if you want to lie in bed and have your VR too.Daydream’s biggest flaw at the moment is a lack of content, particularly games. It only shipped in late November, and at launch it was only supported by the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. This year’s lineup of flagship and medium-tier phones are supporting Daydream, however, and as it becomes compatible with more devices the range of available content will increase, too.Gear VR Built in conjunction with Oculus, Gear VR has been through a few iterations since it first shipped in 2015. The current model has a field of view roughly on par with PSVR, USB-C and micro-USB connectors for support with multiple Samsung devices, and a darker tint to reduce reflections and glare on the final image. The 2560 x 1440 resolution is pretty decent, although the refresh rate is capped to 60HzThe Gear VR has a flat trackpad on the side of the headset, along with back and home keys. It’s akin to how you’d use your phone normally, although having your elbow raised all the time while playing EVE: Gunjack or Darknet can get tiring.Gear VR’s biggest advantage is content, with hundreds of games, experiences and support for streaming services like Netflix. Your mileage might vary when it comes to watching a two or three-hour length feature in VR, but it’s something everyone should try regardless.The Samsung Gear VR, which supports Samsung phones from the Note 5 up to the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, is available for $159 from local retailers.PlayStation VR Photo: Gizmodo Don’t want to pay over $1000 for a headset but want something more exhaustive and immersive than what your smartphone can deliver? PSVR is the answer: a $549.95 headset that leverages the PlayStation Camera and Move controllers as well as the power of your PS4 or PS4 Pro. It comes with integrated audio, which is essential for selling the VR… Post navigation Carlton coach Brendon Bolton leaves Jacob Weitering guessing Cooper made me reach next level: McIntyre Search for: Recent Posts Phillauri box office FAILURE will not affect Anushka Sharma in any way!

Lubell, opinion contributor - 03/23/17 04:40 PM EDT 85   © Greg Nash “America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again.” That was the label President Trump slapped on his fiscal year 2018 spending plan. At least, where science is concerned, the president’s request falls far short on both accounts. It would guarantee that America wouldn’t be first, and far from making America great, it would turn the clock back to the time when American scientists had to travel abroad to carry out any serious research. By slashing support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Energy’s Office (DOE) of Science — both of which would see a fifth of their budgets vaporize — the president’s plan would send the United States packing in science and innovation competitiveness. It would sell Americans short on economic growth and national security.   And it would make the nation a far less desirable destination for the world’s best and brightest minds, whom President Trump has said he wants to attract with a merit-based immigration policy. For a president who touts his ability to think big, his science request reflects incredibly small thinking. It’s possible he delegated the details of deep discretionary spending cuts to Mick Mulvaney, his Office of Management and Budget director, who simply followed the Heritage Foundation’s playbook. Otherwise, it’s difficult to reconcile his spending plan with his twin goals of boosting economic growth, which largely depends on science and technology, and strengthening the military, which relies overwhelmingly on advanced technologies for its might and global reach. It’s worth a quick but deeper dive into both of those objectives. First, the economy. During his campaign, President Trump repeatedly faulted Barack ObamaBarack ObamaCotton: House 'moved a bit too fast' on healthcare Obama to travel to South Pacific island to work on memoir: report Sanford: 'Testosterone can get you in trouble' MORE for being the ‘first president in modern history not to have a single year of three percent growth.” And he pledged to produce a better outcome. Eliminating regulations and reducing corporate tax burdens might help him get partway there. But as economists of every stripe note, science and technology have accounted for more than 50 percent of economic grow since the end of World War II. And today, some economists assert that number could be more than 75 percent. You don’t have to look far for a prime example. Federal support of basic physics in the post-war years laid the foundation for the laser. When it was invented in 1961 — following research efforts that had begun a decade earlier — the device had no obvious application. But today, from supermarket scanners and DVD players to guided missiles and telecommunications, its presence on the American landscape is unmistakable. In fact, in 2010, when physicists Thomas Baer and Alfred Schlachter examined the impact of the laser on modern life, they found that fully a third of the American economy relied on the device and the technologies it enabled. Now to the military. Personnel aside, science and technology are its heart and soul. Stealth aircraft, satellite reconnaissance, precision guided weaponry, GPS-enabled drones, and body armor are just a few examples. And not all of those technologies originated from research sponsored solely by the Defense Department. The National Science Foundation, DOE and NASA have all been contributors. So, when President Trump proposes to balance a boost in defense spending by delivering a body blow to the non-defense side of the ledger, he is recklessly placing the nation’s security at future risk. If economic growth and national security impacts are not enough to change the president’s mind on his budget blueprint, he should consider where America’s vaunted scientific prowess will be headed with the draconian reductions he has proposed. Once the envy of the world, U.S. research facilities have been on a steady slide downward for some time as a result of budgetary strictures. The center of high-energy physics and fusion science have shifted to Europe. And within five years, no state-of-the art X-ray synchrotron light sources — which are crucial for materials science and biomedicine — will be located in the United States. Guillotining the DOE Office of Science, which has the prime responsibility for building and operating major U.S. research facilities will only spill more of America’s research lifeblood. Finally, a comment about the proposed budgetary hit to NIH. President Trump has made reducing the costs of healthcare a signature feature of his first 100 days in office. Those costs are driven heavily by end-of-life care often associated with cancer and other lengthy, debilitating diseases for which there are no known cures. Finding remedies for such diseases could have a profound impact on healthcare spending. Slashing NIH research by a fifth is a bad prescription for reaching that elusive goal. Making America great requires making American science great. The bottom line: the president’s budget plan won’t deliver for him or for the voters who elected him. Michael S. Lubell is the Mark W. Zemansky Professor of Physics at the City College of the City University of New York. He writes and speaks widely about scientific research and science policy. His book on science and technology policy is due out at the end of the year. The views of contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.

Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters WASHINGTON — The House intelligence committee chairman privately apologized to his Democratic colleagues on Thursday, yet publicly defended his decision to openly discuss and brief President Donald Trump on typically secret intercepts that he says swept up communications of the president’s transition team in the final days of the Obama administration. GOP Rep. Devin Nunes’ decision to disclose the information before talking to committee members outraged Democrats and raised questions about the independence of the panel’s probe of Russian interference into the 2016 election and possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia. RELATED LINKS Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe GOP lawmaker: Donald Trump’s communications may have been ‘monitored’ Comey: FBI is investigating possible links between Russia, Trump associates “It was a judgment call on my part,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told reporters Thursday morning. “Sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make wrong decision.” A congressional aide familiar with Nunes’ meeting said the chairman apologized to Democrats and pledged to work with them and share information related to the investigation. “A credible investigation cannot be conducted this way,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House panel. The White House quickly embraced Nunes’ revelations and the president said they “somewhat” validated his wiretapping allegations. Nunes’ critics also questioned whether the California congressman was coordinating with the White House in order to give the president cover for his explosive claims that Barack Obama wire tapped Trump’s New York skyscraper. Nunes, who served on Trump’s transition team, ducked questions about whether he was parroting information given to him by the White House, saying only that he was “not going to ever reveal sources.” He maintained that Trump’s explosive wiretapping allegations against Obama were false. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed questions about whether the White House planted information with Nunes, saying “I believe that the information he shared with the president was new.” Some Democrats on the House intelligence committee remained unconvinced. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., told reporters on Capitol Hill that she doesn’t know where the information came from, but recalled a comment Trump made in a Fox News interview earlier this month where he said the White House “will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasn’t been submitted as of yet.” Obama administration officials disputed the suggestion that the outgoing administration was improperly monitoring its successors. Former Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on Twitter, saying the chairman of a committee investigating the White House can’t share information with that White House. “Need select committee!” he wrote. Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice had tough words in The Washington Post for President Trump and his administration on Wednesday, warning about the “profound dangers” of making false statements. In her first interview since leaving the White House, Rice joins Judy Woodruff to discuss the importance of U.S. credibility, as well as the intelligence probe into Russian interference. Nunes’ disclosure came two days after FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the bureau’s own investigation into the Trump campaign’s connections with Russia. Comey’s comments came during the intelligence committee’s first public hearing on Russia’s election interference, an investigation being overseen by Nunes. Nunes said he received the new intelligence information after that hearing. He said it revealed that Trump’s transition associates — and perhaps Trump himself — had their communications picked up through legal surveillance. The surveillance was conducted legally, Nunes said, and did not appear to be related to the FBI’s Russia investigation. He said his concern was that the identities of the Trump officials were improperly revealed and the contents of their communications were “widely disseminated” in intelligence reports. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Nunes said, “What I’ve read bothers me, and I think it should bother the president himself and his team.” Nunes briefed reporters on the new information without consulting with Schiff or other Democrats on the committee. Speier said Nunes’ disclosure could be a “weapon of mass distraction” in light of allegations of coordination between Russians and the Trump campaign during the 2016 campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. “This could be a lot of theatrics,” said Speier. “This is a bizarre situation,” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in an interview on MSNBC. “I’m calling for a select committee because I think this back-and-forth shows that Congress no longer has the credibility to handle this alone.” Later, in an interview with MSNBC, Schiff said evidence “that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of an investigation” exists of Trump associates colluding with Russia as it interfered in last year’s election. He did not outline that evidence. It’s common for Americans to get caught up in U.S. surveillance of foreigners, such as foreign diplomats in the U.S. talking to an American. Typically, the American’s name would not be revealed in a report about the intercepted communications. However, if there is a foreign intelligence value to revealing the American’s name, it is “unmasked” and shared with other intelligence analysts who are working on related foreign intelligence surveillance. Schiff disputed Nunes’ suggestions that there was improper “unmasking.” He said that after speaking with Nunes, it appeared that the names of Americans were still guarded in the intercepts though their identities could be gleaned from the materials. Matthew Waxman, a national security law professor at Columbia University, said Nunes’ actions “in this case are contributing to, rather than alleviating concerns, about politicization of intelligence.” Nunes said the information on the Trump team was collected in November, December and January, the period after the election when Trump was holding calls with foreign leaders, interviewing potential Cabinet secretaries and beginning to sketch out administration policy. He said the monitored material was “widely disseminated” in intelligence reports. Asked whether he believed the transition team had been spied on, Nunes said: “It all depends on one’s definition of spying.” Nunes did not identify any of the Trump associates he said were “unmasked,” but they are believed to include Michael Flynn, who was fired as White House national security adviser after misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.

Donald Payne Jr. (D-N.J.) said Thursday that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) should relinquish his role as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. “Nunes has failed in his responsibilities as chairman,” he said in a statement Thursday. "I strongly believe that Chairman Nunes should step down immediately.” “It’s clear that Chairman Nunes, a member of the Trump transition, is still playing for the president’s team at the expense of properly performing his job.” ADVERTISEMENT Payne added Nunes is “incapable of leading a fair investigation into Russia’s election interference and any ties between Russia and this administration.” Nunes, whose committee is investigating Russia's meddling in the presidential election and potential ties between Trump's campaign and Moscow, told the press Wednesday he had seen documents suggesting that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of Trump’s transition team. “Details about U.S. persons involved in the incoming administration with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reports,” he told reporters, later briefing president Trump on the information. “I want to be clear — none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team,” added Nunes, noting he believed the information was obtained legally. Nunes’s remarks added a new wrinkle to the controversy over Trump’s claims former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaCotton: House 'moved a bit too fast' on healthcare Obama to travel to South Pacific island to work on memoir: report Sanford: 'Testosterone can get you in trouble' MORE wiretapped Trump Tower in New York City last year. Trump said he felt "somewhat vindicated" by Nunes's announcement, although the California lawmaker stressed that he still did not believe that Trump was wiretapped by his predecessor. He also said it was unclear whether information incidentally collected originated in Trump Tower. Rep.

Nunes said Thursday he regrets informing Trump of the surveillance revelations before updating the committee he chairs. “At the end of the day, sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you don’t,” he told reporters, adding he could not show the panel information that was given to him by a source. Nunes reportedly apologized earlier Thursday to Schiff and other committee Democrats who were offended he went public before speaking with them.

Page 1 of 4. 33 Comments Given there is just one month to go until the official Ubuntu 17.04 "Zesty Zapus" release and past the ordinary freezes and nearly at the final development milestones, I decided to take a test drive this morning of Unity 8 with Mir atop the latest daily Zesty packages. With Ubuntu 17.04, Unity 7 with the X.Org Server remains the default desktop environment, but Unity 8 and Mir can be found on the default ISO and it's just a matter of logging out and into the experimental Unity 8 session. It's really easy to try out for those interested. For my tests today I was using an Intel Xeon box with a Radeon RX 470 graphics card atop Ubuntu 17.04's default Mesa packages and kernel. Overall it was an interesting experience and while a lot of bugs remain, the Unity 8 experience was much better than the last time I tried it a few months ago and is almost up to being usable for a daily Linux desktop. The first thing you may notice are the pictures in this article rather than proper screenshots... That's bug #1. When hitting the screenshot key on the keyboard, the system would immediately become unresponsive. When trying to pull up the screenshot utility under Mir, it wasn't working. Thus for this article and when testing these latest daily Ubuntu Zesty packages, I resorted to taking pictures of the display. The second issue I encountered was either botched 4K/HiDPI support or some combination of Unity8/Mir not liking the Radeon RX 470 paired with this particular display. The rendering was all botched using these latest packages -- there weren't any of these display problems when making use of Unity 7 + X.Org nor have I encountered any other similar display problems with this card/monitor on other distributions. Even when switching to a VT after launching Mir, the display was still garbled. So I resorted to connecting the system to a 2560 x 1440 display. When doing so with this alternative monitor, the mode was properly set and there weren't any display problems. With those two main issues out of the way, onward to the working Unity 8 experience.

Posted 24 Mar 2017 04:00 Updated 24 Mar 2017 06:50 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Two Israeli residents have been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading in Mobileye NV before the maker of sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles agreed to be acquired by Intel Corp for US$15.3 billion. According to a complaint filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman made "remarkably timed" purchases of Mobileye shares and call options prior to the March 13 merger announcement. The SEC said the purchases resulted in about US$427,000 of profit for Darvasi and US$4.5 million for Waldman, after the announcement caused shares of Jerusalem-based Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day. According to the SEC, both defendants were connected to Mobileye insiders through the scientific academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and produced at least 11 Mobileye directors and officers. Darvasi, of Mevasseret Zion, Israel, is a genetics professor at the university, while Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, the SEC said. It was unclear whether Darvasi and Waldman have hired lawyers. Darvasi did not immediately respond to an email request for comment after normal business hours in Israel. Waldman could not immediately be reached for comment. Neither Mobileye nor Santa Clara, California-based Intel was accused of wrongdoing. Mobileye did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel declined to comment. Reuters obtained a filed copy of the complaint, which was not immediately available in online court records. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan on Thursday temporarily froze the defendants' assets in two accounts at Interactive Brokers LLC, finding "a basis to infer" they violated U.S. insider trading laws, court records show. The SEC said Waldman conducted most of his Mobileye trading in the six weeks before the merger was announced, starting on the day Intel and Mobileye signed a non-disclosure agreement, and generated a 1,883 percent return. Darvasi began buying Mobileye stock on March 2 after selling 40,000 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the only securities in his account, the SEC said. The case is SEC v Darvasi et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02088.

While some other gaming companies have tried to imitate the Mac Pro’s cylindrical design, Corsair has opted for more of a cuboid shape with plenty of vents for airflow and LEDs, the true signature of a gaming product. Inside the case, you will find Corsair RAM, a Corsair liquid cooler and power supply. The chassis was also engineered by Corsair itself. As for everything else, you will find a Z270 motherboard, Intel Kaby Lake desktop processor and a GTX 1080, 1070 or 1080Ti depending on which model you go with. Speaking about the launch of the Corsair One series, CEO Andy Paul said that after 22 years of building expertise, he knew that “now was the right time to bring together all our knowledge to create a truly exceptional PC”. The aim with this prebuilt system is to offer a compact, quiet system with the highest levels of performance. In total, there are three Corsair One configurations. The standard Corsair One, the One Pro and the One Pro GTX 1080Ti, which as the name suggests, includes Nvidia’s latest flagship gaming card. There are a few Corsair store exclusive variants that tempt you into buying directly from them by offering higher capacity SSDs.   CORSAIR ONE: Processor: Intel Core™ i7 7700, 4.2GHz Max Turbo Frequency, Liquid-Cooled Graphics Card: NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1070 8GB, Boost Clock 1,721MHz, Base Clock 1,531MHz, Air Cooled Memory: 16GB CORSAIR VENGEANCE LPX 2,400MHz Storage: CORSAIR FORCE LE 240GB SSD, 1TB HDD Motherboard: Custom MSI Z270 Mini-ITX PSU: CORSAIR SF400 80PLUS GOLD SFX Chassis: Black, Aluminum, VR-Ready OS: Windows 10 Home and future Microsoft updates MSRP: $1,799.99 Exc.

TAX We don’t have exact UK pricing or availability information just yet, but pre-orders should be going live for the EU, US and Australia via the Corsair website and select partnered retailers this week. The first shipments are expected to go out in late March and will be backed by a two year warranty. KitGuru Says: Corsair dipped its toes into the prebuilt PC market with the Bulldog back in 2015 and now it seems to be upping the ante with a new custom chassis and nothing but high-end gaming hardware.

Arjuna Capital, an investment company based in Boston that focuses on sustainable and impact investing, says the big banks are in the Stone Age when it comes to issues of gender pay equity. Arjuna forced pay equity investor votes at tech companies last year, and is taking on the big banks and credit card companies this year. The firm has filed resolutions with Bank of America, MasterCard, American Express, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The companies, with the exception of MasterCard, are opposing the resolutions. The resolutions, if approved by investors, would require the banks to reveal whether there is a gender gap in their compensation structures and to take steps to correct it if there is. The resolution filings were announced Thursday during a web conference. The firm forced resolution votes last year at eBay, Intel, Apple, Amazon, Expedia, Microsoft and Adobe. The firms revealed data on pay standards and, at the companies where gaps were found, steps are being taken to correct the situation, says Natasha Lamb, managing director and lead filer of gender pay resolutions at Arjuna Capital. “Big tech stepped up in 2016 and took real action to address the legitimate concerns of long-term shareholders and women,” Lamb says. “Yet the banks are sticking their heads in the sand, which makes you wonder: What do they have to hide?” The financial services industry is one of the biggest offenders when it comes to a lack of pay equity and transparency, Lamb says. Companies that have equity in their hiring and pay practices are better retainers of talent, which boosts the bottom line for the firms, says Evelyn Murphy, the former lieutenant governor of Massachusetts  and founder and president of the WAGE Project Inc., a nationwide, grassroots activist organization dedicated to eliminating the gender wage gap. “The median income for women working full time in the United States is reported to be 79 percent of that of their male counterparts,” Murphy says. “That $10,800 disparity can add up to nearly half a million dollars over a career. The gap for African-American and Latina women is even wider at 60 percent and 55 percent, respectively. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059.” To read more stories , click here Loading Other Articles... « Previous Article | Next Article » 0 Comments Login in order to post a comment Quick Poll Do you think comprehensive tax reform will be passed in 2017?

It is the number one hardware platform developed for supporting open source IPMI developments from OpenBMC.     Portwell Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit Built with Facebook’s OpenBMC   Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: * Openbmc Development Kit * Open Source Ipmi * Open Source Bmc Industry: * Computers Location: * Fremont - California - USFREMONT, Calif. - March 23, 2017 - PRLog -- American Portwell Technology, Inc. (http://www.portwell.com) announces its new Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit, designed with Portwell's Type 6 COM Express Basic module and carrier board in microATX form factor, featuring the 6th generation Intel® Core™ processor family, DDR4 memory support (both ECC and non-ECC), Gen3 PCIe interface and 30 percent faster graphic performance than its predecessor. "Our new Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit is built with the latest OpenBMC from Facebook®," says Robert Feng, American Portwell's product marketing director. "This is an open software framework designed to build a complete Linux® image for a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). Portwell's Neptune Alpha OpenBMC development platform has been reviewed and tested by Facebook, Inc. and ASPEED Technology, Inc., and incorporates ASPEED's AST2500 Advanced PCIe graphics and remote management processor that completely supports these advanced BMC features." "By developing custom BMC from open source," Feng continues, "means Portwell's Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit enables customers to verify their custom-built BMC for speeding up time to market. And," he adds, "because the development kit is designed with a COM Express module, it offers customers a flexible choice for future upgrades." Other benefits of the Portwell Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit include the ability to load open source IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) code and support video debug mode. "Facebook validated OpenBMC on our development kit," Feng confirms, "and it also features a reference board designed to allow customers to develop their own platform, including IPMI design." Driven by the mobile Intel QM170 chipset, the 9.6˝ x 9.6˝ (243.8 mm x 243.8 mm) kit supports dual channel memory up to 32GB DDR4; a watchdog timer programmable via the software from one second to 255 minutes; 3x SATA (6GB/s) and 1x M.2 storage interface; Intel Ethernet Controller I219 LM; 1x PCIe x16, 1x PCIe x4 and 2x PCIe x1; 4x USB 3.0 and 1x USB 2.0; 1x serial TX/RX port (supported from onboard EC) and 1x serial port for BMC; plus video support for HDMI, DP (DisplayPort), DVI and VGA. Portwell's Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit is the ideal choice for effectively implementing and maintaining a dynamic data center for applications in network server, network switch, network storage system and communication appliances. The Number One Hardware Platform According to American Portwell's product marketing director, Robert Feng, what makes Portwell's new Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit different is that most of the existing IPMIs are pre-built, created and offered by IPMI providers with high license fees and development NRE (non-recurring engineering) charges. "The new Neptune Alpha OpenBMC Development Kit," Feng explains, "is the number one hardware platform designed and developed for supporting open source IPMI developments from OpenBMC. What's more, we designed it with our inherently flexible and upgradeable COM Express module, a versatile embedded computing solution of separating the CPU-upgradable module from system specific I/O carrier board to further safeguard development investments and lowers total cost of ownership."

Maxine Waters that Trump should be impeached. After the House Intel Committee hearings began on Monday, probing Russian interference in the 2016 election, Waters tweeted out: From Chao’s professional Twitter account there was a response on Wednesday that read: Get ready for impeachment. — Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) March 21, 2017 Trending An Ultimatum of Doom: Failure is Not an Option on Obamacare Repeal Josh Kimbrell “SUE HIS VERY SOUL MAXINE!!!” It was quickly deleted. It looked curious, and even concerning. According to a report from POLITICO, it wasn’t Chao. But according to a Transportation Department spokesperson, the tweet was “posted by an employee with access to the account” who “took action outside of his scope of work and duties and without any approvals.” “We are taking appropriate action,” the spokesperson said. “We regret that this transpired and have taken steps to prevent any future occurrence.” This is somebody who either didn’t realize they were accessing the secretary’s professional account, or they really didn’t care about their job. Considering how swiftly it was removed, I’m going to say it was a mistake. I’m curious about that particular employee’s job status, today.

Fuel DataRobot's Surging Revenue The machine learning co. just raised $54M at a pre-money valuation of over $250M 3.7K Dylan Martin - Staff Writer, Tech 3/23/17 @1:56pm in Tech 3/23/17 @1:56pm When a tech company raises a $54 million round, it says a lot about how much promise investors see. But when the financing round is led by the same big-name venture capital firm for the third time in a row, it says even more. And yet, for all the promise investors see in DataRobot, the Boston machine learning startup has been very quiet and even cautious about sharing any figures showing its traction. But thanks to a source close to the company, we now know why New Enterprise Associates, which led the first close of DataRobot's Series C round, could be so enthusiastic. DataRobot announced the financing round on Wednesday, which brought the company's pre-money valuation to over $250 million, according to the source. The $54 million round brought the company's total funding amount to $111 million. Other investors have included Accomplice, Intel Capital and New York Life Insurance. Here are some numbers fueling investor excitement: The company's revenue in the fiscal year 2016 grew nearly nine times over from the previous year, going from roughly $2 million in 2015 to close to $20 million last year, according to my source. It now has over 400 customers, with half of them Fortune 500 companies and many of them large banks and insurance companies, the source added. One of its larger customers is Bank of America. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. The company declined to comment on its valuation, revenue and customers. Related DataRobot's Surging Revenue Revealed | Inside Next Step Living’s Downfall | Google Exec Joins Northeastern Prior to BostInno receiving this information, Razi Raziuddin, vice president of strategic business development at DataRobot,  declined to discuss these items in an interview. Instead, he pointed to the New Enterprise Associates leading a financing round for the company a third time as a sign of its success. “That should give you an idea,” he said. DataRobot plans to use the new funds to double the size of its research and development, expand its global footprint to support its growing number of international customers, and increase support for its global channel and technology partners, which includes Cloudera and Alteryx. The company has about 150 employees right now. While Raziuddin declined to provide specific hiring plans, DataRobot co-founder and CEO Jeremy Achin told Xconomy it could reach 250 people by the end of the year. If the company continues to grow its sales, Achin said the company could reach profitability without raising more capital. However, he also told Xconomy that the company could add another $12 million to $15 million from investors for this round. DataRobot’s machine learning software helps large companies glean predictive insights from massive amounts of data by automating many of the tasks performed by data scientists. Raziuddin said the company is “democratizing data science,” an overused phrase, he admitted, that nevertheless helps illustrate how business analysts and other professionals with less technical expertise can use DataRobot to build predictive models. “The goal here is to get data science into the hands of everyone in a business environment, so they can optimize every business process instead of having to rely on a data scientist for every model,” he said. Besides banking and insurance, DataRobot is also targeting the healthcare and financial technology industries. Chris Lynch, who funded DataRobot’s seed round through Accomplice, the VC firm he left earlier this year, told me the company’s progress validates "Boston as a force to be reckoned with in data science." He said it also validates the original vision behind Hack Reduce, the big data startup incubator Lynch runs that admitted DataRobot in its earliest days. Lynch said he remembers originally turning down Achin and his co-founder Tom DeGodoy when they pitched to join Hack Reduce. But after Achin and DeGodoy managed to find Lynch at Tryst, an Arlington restaurant that was near Lynch's house, they pitched him again and Lynch agreed to fund DataRobot's seed round. "He didn't give me a choice," Lynch said of Achin.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Asus Chromebook Flip C302 review: standard issue The new baseline for Chrome OS convertibles by Dieter Bohn@backlon Mar 23, 2017, 2:51pm EDT Photography by Vjeran Pavic share tweet Linkedin Using the Asus Chromebook Flip C302, you can almost see how Chrome OS devices are going to stop being education machines or backup couch computers and become something different for a lot of people. Just computers (or, well, maybe just tablets). It's a "premium" Chromebook, which these days basically means it's well-built, has a fast processor, and costs around $500. That puts it in the same class as the Samsung Chromebook Plus and forthcoming Samsung Chromebook Pro. The C302 is all of those things, but to me it's a sign that both Google and its manufacturing partners are stretching to redefine how you typically think about a Chromebook. Google, for its part, is working feverishly to make the Android app on Chrome OS viable (they're not ready yet). Asus, for its part, produced the excellent machine I'm reviewing right now. It's rare to use a Chrome OS laptop that genuinely feels fast, well-built, and worth more than the $300 asking price that most Chromebooks cost. But if all those companies are going to succeed at this, it can't be rare anymore, it has to be standard. And the C302 sets the standard — for now. First and foremost: the C302 is fast enough for most tasks you'd imagine doing on a Chromebook, and perhaps fast enough for some stuff you wouldn't consider, like photo editing. It has an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. I regularly use it with 15 or so tabs and web apps, and often more, without any problems. Android apps, however, are still in beta and are as much of a mess today as they have been for the past few months I've been trying it. When they come out of beta (presumably next month), I'll be eager to see if they are any better. Don't get the C302 for Android apps until we see what they really look like. Making Chrome OS feel like a PC One of the reasons that people tend to prefer "real" computers to Chromebooks is that they have apps with their own icons in the dock. On Chrome OS, you can drag any tab to the dock, but it still launches in a tab in a web browser. That's annoying because you can’t just Alt-Tab to email. Except you can! Chrome OS has a feature called "Open as Window" that takes any webpage and turns it into a separate app, so you don't lose it in your tabs. Here's how to use it: Open the web app you want to use, like Gmail Click the Three Dot menu in the upper-right of the Chrome window Click "More Tools" Click "Add to Shelf…" Here's the key trick: check the box for "Open as Window" before you click "Add" It works really well and makes Chrome OS feel a lot more like a Mac or Windows PC. The only real problem with it is that if you switch Chromebooks, your app's icon doesn't sync over to the new computer (Google promises that a fix for that is coming). The C302 does a better job at nailing most of the physical aspects of a good laptop than other devices you'll find in this price range. It's got a thin aluminum body (just over half an inch thick), and weighs just over two and a half pounds. There are some nice, subtle touches like a magnet in the base that secures the screen more firmly when you use it in tablet mode. To get to that mode, you just rotate the screen on its hinges, which are firm enough to stand up to tapping the screen when in laptop mode. The screen is 12.5 inches with a max resolution of 2400 x 1350, but you need Superman-like vision to handle the size of text at the native scaling, so most people should settle for something less extreme. On the whole, I'm happy with the keyboard, which is full sized and has long key travel. I find it a bit mushier than I'd like, but it's backlit like a keyboard really should be (unlike Samsung's Chromebooks). The trackpad is a little on the small side, but it's accurate and doesn't suffer from mis-taps. Battery life is really good, too, cracking the 10-hour mark in our looping website rundown test and hitting seven or eight hours in heavier day-to-day work. In between, you're charging over USB-C — and though people will gripe a bit about that, I'm over it: it's the port every laptop is going to be using from here on out. Plus, I love that there is one port on the left and one on the right, so you can plug in on either side. Expandable storage is via microSD. But there are compromises: for example, though the screen is good, it doesn't get nearly bright enough to use outdoors. Even inside, I find myself ratcheting up the brightness up to 80 or 90 percent most of the time. The speakers are astonishingly weak for a computer this size, which is disappointing when you consider one of the use cases for a convertible is watching Netflix in Tent or Tablet mode. Oh, and I already managed to nick one of the squared-off edges just through normal use. The obvious comparison to the C302 are Samsung's two new Chromebooks, the Plus and the Pro. (In fact, when I reviewed the Plus so many people asked about the C302 that I felt like I had to try it out.) So lots of people just want to know which is better and I don't have definitive opinions. I slightly prefer the Plus: it's a bit cheaper and has a bit nicer hardware (minus the backlighting on the keyboard) without too much reduction in speed. The Chromebook Pro might be my favorite of the three, but I haven't had a chance to review the final devices that consumers will be able to buy. If you can wait until next month to buy a Chromebook, I probably would, just to see how it compares. If all goes well, this C302 is just going to be an anonymous member of a vast horde of high-quality, near-identical Chromebooks with good screens, Android apps, and enough speed to do 90 percent of what you expect from them. They'll be a little more expensive than you're used to, maybe, but they'll deliver as much value as a comparably priced iPad or Windows PC — if not more. We're not there yet, and so the highest praise I can give Asus is that this fairly innocuous and forgettable computer is innocuous and forgettable in the best ways: it looks good, it works well, and I don't have to worry about it. It's a great baseline for future Chromebooks to either match or try to beat. It's not necessarily the best one, but it's a solid starting point for what you should expect. It's standard-issue.

Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) meets with reporters outside the White House in Washington on Wednesday, following a meeting with President Trump. by Karoun Demirjian and Ellen Nakashima, Washington Post Close icon Karoun Demirjian and Ellen Nakashima Washington Post WASHINGTON — House Intelligence Committee Democrats say Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) apologized to them Thursday during a closed-door meeting for his handling of revelations about surveillance that potentially could have been collected about President Trump and his associates during the transition period. Nunes's apology was "generic," Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jackie Speier (D., Calif.) said on CNN, adding that it was "not clear" which part of his actions for which he was sorry. House Intel Chair Devin Nunes apologizes to committee members for going to Trump first https://t.co/BnSEX4otYZ https://t.co/z04atVM5My — CNN (@CNN) March 23, 2017 Nunes came under heavy fire from Democrats Wednesday after going first to the press, then to the White House, and then to the press again before consulting with colleagues about what he said was fresh intelligence about the president and his campaign aides. On Thursday, Nunes said it was a "judgment call" to personally brief Trump before speaking with his Intelligence Committee colleagues, who are actively investigating allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and suspected links between Trump aides and the Kremlin. The California Republican also promised colleagues they would see the documents he was referring to on Friday, which is when Nunes is expecting the NSA, CIA and FBI to respond to a request for a full list of names of people whose identities were disclosed through "incidental collection," or legal collection by U.S. intelligence agencies of communications by foreign entities that could involve American citizens. Nunes said Wednesday the information he has seen may show that Trump or his aides were picked up in such incidental collection during the transition. Some Democrats have accused Nunes of speaking publicly in an attempt to deflect attention away from Monday's congressional hearing, at which FBI Director James Comey not only confirmed the FBI is looking into allegations that the Trump team coordinated with Russian officials during the election, but said flatly that Trump's accusation that he was being wiretapped by the Obama administration was false. Said one Democratic committee official: "This looks like the President got in hot water over his wiretapping claim, and the White House had to find a way to give him an off-ramp." Nunes would not say whether his source was affiliated with the White House or what type of incidental collection had occurred — whether it was direct conversations between Trump or his team and a foreign agent, or whether two foreign entities were simply picked up discussing the president. He only said that the communications did not involve Russia. The intelligence community regularly monitors the communications of foreign individuals acting as agents of a foreign government, as they do some people suspected of terrorism, pending court approval. The communications of Americans who are in touch with those foreign agents can thus be "incidentally collected" - as happened when former national security adviser Michael Flynn was picked up talking to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who was under surveillance. The problem potentially arises when the identities of those Americans are "unmasked" — that is, revealed to others in the government. There are legal procedures allowing for such unmasking when it is deemed to be necessary for understanding the context of the intelligence in communications. Nunes said Wednesday he was concerned about the unmasking in the information he viewed. But after speaking with Nunes, Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that only one name in the report Nunes viewed was "unmasked" — and that name had nothing to do with the Trump team. Nunes told reporters that it was "very clear to me" who the identities of the individuals in the report were, and that they were members of the Trump team. That has sparked charges that if anybody is revealing more than they should, it is Nunes — for potentially telling the public that hidden names in surveillance reports referred to the president and his advisers, something that is likely classified information. Nunes said the information itself was classified, but argued that disclosing the existence of intelligence reports and the nature of them was not improper. Nunes said the information was classified, but argued that disclosing the existence of the report and the nature of it did not reveal any classified information. Nunes's own staff members were not aware of the chairman's decision to go public and brief the president and was dismayed by his actions, said several individuals familiar with the matter. "He betrayed the independence that our committee must show to get to the bottom of what happened with Russia's interference in our elections," Rep. Eric Swalwell (D., Calif.) said. "He should have come to the committee first. He never under any circumstances should have gone to the president, whose campaign is under federal criminal and counterintelligence investigations." Swalwell said Nunes's actions prove the need for an independent commission to investigate the Russia-related allegations because "the people we have been counting on to be impartial in getting to the bottom of what happened have shown that they cannot be." Swalwell has co-authored legislation to establish such a commission with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.). But Democrats are not the only ones calling to take this investigation away from Congress following Nunes's actions on Wednesday. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R., Ariz.) said on MSNBC Wednesday that despite his continued faith in the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation, the House Intelligence Committee's process had become so politicized that "no longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone." He called for either a select committee or an independent commission to look into the matter.

The rules, which the FCC passed in a party-line vote in October, require internet service providers such as AT&T and Verizon to obtain customers’ permission before using their personal information for advertising purposes. ADVERTISEMENT If passed by the House and signed by President Trump, the bill would use an obscure law called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to eliminate the rules before they go into effect. The CRA would also prevent the FCC from passing “substantially similar” regulations in the future, though no court has ruled on what agencies can pass under those standards. Critics of the privacy regulations say they are too onerous, and subject service providers to stricter regulations than websites such as Facebook and Google, which also collect consumer data. The vote immediately drew criticism from privacy and consumer advocates like the ACLU, Public Knowledge and Free Press, while trade groups praised the move.   In a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday night, Sen.

The vote was a major win for the internet service providers who have been pushing the Trump administration to undo rules passed under Tom Wheeler, the FCC’s previous chairman. The new CRA action is also the latest in the deregulatory campaign the GOP has undertaken since gaining control of the White House. Before Trump took office, the CRA had only been used once before, during the early days of President George W. Bush’s administration. But in February alone, Trump signed three more CRA bills, overturning rules that would have prevented some mentally ill people from buying guns, protected waterways from coal pollution and required mining and drilling companies to disclose certain financial information to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the privacy rules were to go into effect, consumers would have to give their consent for service providers to use and share “sensitive information” such as location tracking, social security numbers, browsing data and app usage.

Source: Shutterstock The eye-popping $15.3 billion deal buys the Silicon Valley chipmaker a seat at the high-rollers’ table of the self-driving car market. For sensor maker Mobileye, with adjusted net income of $173.3 million in 2016, Intel is paying a 34.5% premium, that for a company that was only recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. Tel Aviv-based website builder Wix.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:WIX) went public in November 2013, in the then-largest ever IPO for an Israeli company, raising $127 million. The share price has almost tripled since the debut. Caesarstone Ltd (NASDAQ: CSTE), which IPO’d a year earlier, has returned almost 450% to investors. The 2009 book “Start-Up Nation” gave Israel its nickname. Israel-domiciled companies represent the third-largest foreign contingent on Nasdaq, behind Canada and China, And three exchange-traded funds present opportunities to ride the country’s technology sector. Small ETF Finds Large Return The BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Technology ETF (NASDAQ:ITEQ) is on a tear in March, up 4.6% so far, and contributing to an almost 14% advance this year. It is an index of approximately 60 Israeli technology companies listed on the Tel Aviv, Nasdaq, NYSE and Singapore exchanges. Mobileye was the largest of the fund’s holdings, at 14.5% weighting, as of March 22. Wix was the ninth-largest, at 3.3%. In between are names such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP), Verint Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:VRNT) and Nice Ltd (ADR) (NASDAQ:NICE). It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and is rebalanced twice a year. Fund assets were just shy of $10 million at the end of last week. The index managers define tech broadly and it shows in the stocks included. These companies are at the forefront of most technologically disruptive industries, including cyber security, Big Data hardware and analytics, autonomous driver assistance and safety, clean energy, biotechnology and medical devices. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas last week included the fund among his picks of those that are smaller-sized, but with larger returns. More Drama With Pharma For those seeking more pharmaceutical industry exposure in their Israel investment, VanEck Vectors Israel ETF (NYSEARCA:ISRA) tracks a cap-weighted index of Israeli and Israeli-linked companies and competes with iShares MSCI Israel Capped Investable Market Index Fund (NYSEARCA:EIS). ISRA assets totaled $40 million as of March 17, while EIS held $114 million. ISRA has returned 7.7% over the past year while EIS has delivered almost 12%. Expense ratios are 0.59% and 0.62%, respectively. BlueStar’s Steven Schoenfeld said recently that pharma holdings have led to the fund underperforming other Israel ETFs, describing it as “pharma drama.” The fund’s underlying index puts drug companies Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) and Perrigo Company plc Ordinary Shares (NYSE:PRGO) among its top 10 holdings, and includes Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TARO) and RedHill Biopharma Ltd – ADR (NASDAQ:RDHL), among its nearly 140 constituents. So as a growing chorus of investment managers are beginning to believe that Israel tech stocks are not only under-owned, but also underappreciated, a trio of ETFs can provide entry into an economy that is more about clicks than bricks. As of this writing, Robert Lakin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Meanwhile, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) have all introduced new products, some of which have already seen price cuts.

DigiTimes added that although AMD has already prepped its Ryzen 5-series processors, the new product is unlikely to significantly contribute to AMD's bottom line given its limited market share. Some Optimism For Q3 Sources close to the matter told DigiTimes that while motherboard/graphics card players' overall shipments and revenue will be poor in the first half of 2017, at least two firms, Asustek and Gigabyte could see declines that are not as steep as the market's average due to stronger demand from the gaming market. In addition, the PC do-it-yourself market could also rise in the third quarter due to seasonality factors, partially aided by Intel's launch of the top-end Skylake-X and Kay Lake-X processors and X299 chipsets, along with AMD's Ryzen 3 series processors.

Sue Mountstevens has taken the unusual step of sending out an open letter, along with chief constable Andy Marsh, to reassure people in the Avon and Somerset area. The letter begins: "In the wake of the tragic events in London yesterday we want to take the unusual step of writing an open letter to reassure you that we will do everything we can to keep people safe." Apparently members of the public have been going to police stations in the area to thank officers for their support. You can read the letter from Sue Mountstevens IN FULL at the bottom of this article. Chief Superintendent Colin Searle, of Dorset Police, said police advice to the public remained the same. He added: "Members of the public should always remain alert to the danger of terrorism and report any suspicious activity to police on 999 or the anti-terrorist hotline 0800 789 321." READ MORE: Somerset children trapped in Parliament are 'astounding' according to head teacher Earlier the so-called Islamic State terror group claimed that the Westminster attacker was one of its "soldiers". The man, a British citizen who was known to the police and security services, had been investigated some years ago over violent extremism. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs he was a "peripheral" figure, adding: "He was not part of the current intelligence picture." Delivering a defiant message to a packed House of Commons, Mrs May said: "We will never waver in the face of terrorism." A statement released through IS's Aamaq news agency said the attacker was a "soldier of the Islamic State". According to the SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, the IS statement said: "The attacker yesterday in front of the British Parliament in London was a soldier of the Islamic State executing the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations." The Prime Minister addressed MPs as they gathered at the usual time inside the Palace of Westminster, which a day earlier had come under attack from the knife-wielding terrorist. An hour after MPs had stood for a minute's silence in honour of the innocent people killed in the attack, Mrs May delivered a statement with details of the atrocity. BELOW: Theresa May has given a message of defiance to Parliament. Paying tribute to Pc Keith Palmer, who died after being stabbed, she said: "He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten." Describing the terrorist, Mrs May said: "What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. "The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot." BELOW: The Birmingham flat which was raided by police overnight, left, and the car involved in the attack, right. Anti-terror police have arrested eight people in the wake of the attack. Several addresses were raided overnight in London and Birmingham as Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan Police's senior anti-terror officer, said he believed the attacker was working alone. A minute's silence was held nationwide at 9.33am, including in the Palace of Westminster and at New Scotland Yard, to commemorate the three innocent people who were killed. The timing of the silence was chosen in honour of Pc Palmer's shoulder number - 933. READ MORE: All today's newspaper front pages after Parliament terror attack Aysha Frade was the first member of the public to be identified as a victim, with her principal at DLD College London describing her as "highly regarded and loved". Forty other people were injured in the attack, with 29 treated in hospital, where seven remained in a critical condition on Thursday. The casualties included 12 Britons, three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, two Greeks, and one each from Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and the United States. Three police officers were also hurt, two of them seriously. At the scene of one of the police raids, a flat in Hagley Road, Birmingham, one witness told the Press Association: "The man from London lived here." Surrey Police would not comment on whether there was police activity in their county as part of the investigation into the Westminster attack, instead directing queries about the matter to the Metropolitan Police. A Met spokesman said the force would not discuss locations "for operational reasons". BELOW: Sue Mountstevens. The open letter from Sue Mountstevens and Andy Marsh of Avon and Somerset Constabulary: An open Letter from Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Andy Marsh and Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens. In the wake of the tragic events in London yesterday we want to take the unusual step of writing an open letter to reassure you that we will do everything we can to keep people safe. We have all been shocked by the events that have taken place over the last 24 hours and are immensely proud of the bravery shown by PC Keith Palmer and his colleagues. Today, our thoughts are with Keith and his family together with all those affected by this tragic event. We have been deeply heartened and are very grateful to everyone who has visited our stations or sent in messages of support today. Thank you, I know every member of the police family feels the warmth of this support as we grieve together. In Avon and Somerset we stand shoulder to shoulder with colleagues in the Metropolitan Police Service and the communities we serve. All forces have long established and well-rehearsed plans in place to deal with attacks of this nature as illustrated by colleagues in the Metropolitan Police Service yesterday. We must remain united in our communities, stand together and not allow terrorism or hatred to prevail. We are aware that following incidents such as this, there can be an increase in hate crimes within our communities. Over the coming days and weeks we will be reaching out to reassure and strengthen bonds with the communities we serve. Let us be clear, there can never be any excuse for hate crime in any shape or form and this criminality will not be tolerated. More than ever in these uncertain times we want those who are victims of hate crime to feel confident that we'll take your reports seriously, protect you and make sure you get all the support you need. So, if you are a witness or a victim of hate crime or feel vulnerable please contact someone to report it. More people are reporting hate crime than ever before but it is still significantly underreported. Don't suffer in silence; there are people who can help you. Call the police on 101, Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or via their website at www.crimestoppers-uk.org, or visit the True Vision website (www.report-it.org.uk) for information, advice and to report online. In an emergency, always dial 999. We promise to continue to work together every day to keep you safe.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    MSNBC's Joe Scarborough says Republicans should drop the ax on Rep. Devin Nunes for his "extreme form of day trading" -- kowtowing to the White House instead of working for Congress in his investigation into Russia's interference in American politics. The "Morning Joe" host, a former Republican congressman from Florida, fired off a series of tweets Wednesday evening recommending the ouster of Nunes, a California Republican: If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman. — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 22, 2017 It's the most extreme form of political day trading. Nunes has disqualified himself and proven the critical need for a select committee. https://t.co/vF8jcu1BQt — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 23, 2017 Senate Republicans like McCain, Graham and Sasse have shown the type of independence on Russia that Americans expect. Nunes has not. https://t.co/n4O62ZtlFq — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 23, 2017 Earlier Wednesday, Nunes told reporters about incidentally collected information on members of President Donald Trump's transition team, data he said was "widely disseminated" in intelligence reports. He also went to the White House to brief Trump's inner circle about the findings. But the California Republican's revelation blindsided Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on his committee, with whom he hadn't yet shared the information. Nunes' disclosure seemed to lend credence to Trump's much-discredited claim that his Trump Tower skyscraper in New York City had been "wiretapped" by President Barack Obama during last year’s presidential race. Scarborough retweeted a Wall Street Journal editorial that slammed Trump for continuing to hold onto the debunked wiretapping assertion "like a drunk to an empty gin bottle." Sen. John McCain has called for a select committee to probe Russia's meddling because "what the American people have found out so far, that no longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone." "I don't say that lightly," the Arizona Republican told Greta Van Susteren on MSNBC. Related Stories: Trump Defends 'Wiretap' Claim Against Obama Sen.

The precious minerals needed to produce our phones often fuel violence and human rights abuses... Business & Tech Tantalum - one of the 3Ts used in electronic devices / Fairphone / Flickr 15:15 23 Mar 2017 Joseph Conroy 3 days ago Almost every computer, phone and tablet we own depends on minerals which can only be found in African regions which have been dogged by conflict and the control of these resources has become one of the factors fueling this violence. Tackling this issue can be a matter of life or death. According to Intel militias and rebel groups who have been funded by the sale of these minerals have killed over 5 million people since 1998. These mines are also a source of serious human right abuses - Amnesty International has documented children from the age of seven being forced to work in mines supplying multinational tech firms including Apple, Microsoft and Vodafone. Last week, the EU approved legislation which requires new due diligence checks for importers of tin, tungsten, tantalum (the 3T's) and gold - with the aim of making sure that these minerals are not bought from mines and suppliers linked to armed groups in central Africa, mainly in Eastern Congo. Fairphone is a Dutch start-up which has taken on the task of building a smartphone with only ethically sourced materials - but even it can't say that its devices are "100% fair yet."   Fairphone / Flickr The company has been trying to source all of the components needed to create a smartphone without any potential conflict minerals entering its supply chain. "The supply chains of electronic products are very complex and it is very hard to even investigate where the minerals that are used in smartphones or other products come from," a Fairphone spokesperson told Newstalk.   Mining in DRC / Enough Project "The tech industry uses a lot of resources such as minerals - these are necessary in order to build products like smartphones or computers. "This is fuelled by ever shorter life cycles of products that are hard to repair. There are some 7 billion smartphones on the planet - only 16% have been recycled," which contributes to demand for these minerals. "It is difficult for consumers to immediately grasp the complexity of global supply chains and the problems that are associated with it," the start-up added.   The project began as an awareness raising exercise: "Fairphone was started in 2010 as a campaign to raise awareness about problems in electronics supply chains before it became a company in 2013. Since then we have been working hard to make this issue more known. More and more people realise that there are issues in  supply chains, such as conflict, and are willing to invest in alternatives." Its current device is the Fairphone 2 - it's a decent mid-spec phone which retails for €529. That's a bit more than a similar model from its competitors would cost - but one of its goals is to make a phone which will last longer. Its 'modular' design makes it easy to take apart and means it can be repaired making it less likely that you will need to invest in a new handset if something goes wrong - which in turn reduces demand for these minerals. "We want to reconnect people to the story that is behind electronic products. So there are people that want to make a difference and are aware of those problems that buy Fairphone," the company continued. EU action Fairphone describes the new EU rules as a "great first step" - but it adds that it will remain to be seen if it can make a real impact when it comes to dealing with this murky issue. Fairphone highlights the fact that the EU law, "excludes small importers from the due diligence requirements" as being a significant potential loophole which could allow these minerals to continue to legally come into the EU. The company supports buying from ethical producers in these areas and is worried that legislation could result in businesses being afraid to buy any raw materials from these regions, taking money out of fragile local economies. "Mining sites in high-risk areas often provide a significant income for the surrounding communities. However it requires significant efforts, time and engagement to facilitate a long-term development from high to low-risk mine sites," it commented. Crushing Tungsten, Rwanda / Fairphone / Flickr "In order to avoid whole regions depending on mining income will be drawn further into a poverty cycle, market access and investments in local communities are crucial. Market access itself requires that systems are in place to enable the tracing of a certain material to its origin and monitor the production circumstances," Fairphone added. Self-regulation  Tech firms are already responding to shifts in approaches to policing conflict materials and consumer sentiment. Last year Apple announced that its supply chain is now 100% audited - with the aim of ensuring that no minerals sold by militias end up in its factories. "We could have very easily chosen a path of re-routing our supply and declared ourselves conflict-free long ago, but that would have done nothing to help the people on the ground ... We chose to engage with as many smelters as possible because the only way to have an impact here is to reach critical mass," Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams commented. The company has stopped short of calling its goods conflict free, as it is yet to establish reporting procedures to police the very beginning of its supply chain and to ensure that no armed groups are benefiting from mineral sales. Apple also supports finding clean producers in these regions rather than leaving them, citing the economic impact that this decision would have on local communities. Intel is the only major global tech brand which says it is "using only Conflict Free mineral resources" in some of its microprocessors. It's developed a tracking system which has established a network of 200 'conflict free' mines in the Congo working with the Enough Project - an NGO partnered with Amnesty International and Oxfam which is focused on ensuring that groups who abuse human rights do not profit from selling raw materials. 15:15 23 Mar 2017 Joseph Conroy 3 days ago 4 Related articles Ulster Bank is closing 22 Irish branches LinkedIn now offering "Trending Storylines" to users Just why is Tetris so addictive?

Moreover, Nunes said the collection was unrelated to allegations of Russian collusion and widely disseminated within the US government. "[I]t was a judgment call on my part and that’s at the end of the day that’s sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make the wrong one, but you got to stick by what… decisions you make," Nunes stated.

On March 4, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election, describing this as the former administration's "new low. The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. The US House and Senate Intelligence Committees have found no credible evidence to support Trump's claims. ...

Devin Nunes told journalists that between November 2016 and January 2017 US intelligence "incidentally " intercepted some conversations of President Donald Trump’s team. © AP Photo/ Alex Brandon Unintentional Wiretapping of Trump Was 'Legal' as He Wasn't Subject of Probe - House Intel Commitee"I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored. It looks to me like it was all legally collected, but it was essentially a lot of information on the president-elect and his transition team and what they were doing," Nunes was quoted as saying by Politico. He noted that the surveillance was not related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team. "I think the President is concerned and he should be," Nunes added. The committee still needs more time to investigate, but some of the espionage activity "seems to be inappropriate." He also said that the committee would launch a probe to investigate who was aware of the "incidental" wiretapping and who ordered to keep the information secret. © AP Photo/ Pablo Martinez Monsivais Nunes' Information Does Not Support Trump's Wiretapping Claims - LawmakerOn March 4, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Former President Barack Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election. The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. Commenting on Nunes’ statements, Trump noted that he felt "somewhat vindicated" on his claims against Obama. "I must tell you, I somewhat do. I very much appreciated the fact they found what they found," Trump said at the White House. The fact that Nunes first spoke to journalists and then reported at the White House outrages Democrats and members of the intelligence community. For example, Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the Committee, said that first of all Nunes should have briefed him. He also expressed confidence that Nunes’ actions may challenge the credibility of the investigation as well as the probe into Trump’s team alleged connections with Russia. "The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House because he cannot do both," Schiff said. © AFP 2017/ PAUL J. RICHARDS Trump Administration Unaware of White House Officials Under FBI Investigation - SpokesmanHe was echoed by Jim Himes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee. "What if it’s one of the president’s people who is being investigated. Is he going to damage the investigation? It all feels very, very odd," Himes said. Eric Swalwell, another member of the intelligence panel, also expressed concerns over the situation. "The House Intelligence Committee is charged with investigating Russia's interference into our election and whether any U.S. persons were involved. The chairman's actions and closeness to a president whose campaign is under federal investigation have gravely damaged the Investigation's credibility," Himes said in a statement cited by Politico. Nevertheless, Nunes did not officially confirm Trump’s accusations against Obama. Initially, Trump insisted that it was Obama who ordered the wiretapping at Trump Tower during the electoral campaign, in October 2016. Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also rejected Trump’s claims against Obama, saying there was no evidence.

Curly hair should be healthy, frizz-free, defined, and effortlessly fabulous. Consequently, as a beauty advocate and product innovator, Dellinger worked passionately to produce an award-winning line of organic hair care products for women and girls with natural waves, curls and kinks. Frustrated with the lack of effective products for her newly natural, curly hair, Dellinger left her post as marketing manager at Intel Corporation to pursue her passion to giving consumers with naturally curly hair effective and eco-conscious products that are natural and safe for all ages to use. In 2002, Dellinger pioneered the newly natural market when she launched CURLS, a family of organic hair care products targeted for women embracing their natural textures … a market previously unanswered by the beauty industry. Dellinger’s astute business acumen and natural talent for delivering market-driven products gave way to an instant demand for her product line. Soon thereafter, CURLS was available all over the United States, Canada, Brazil, Africa and the U.K.. As CEO and founder of CURLS, Dellinger singlehandedly built a strong demand for her brand and products. Soon Target, Sally Beauty, Wal-Mart and CVS came knocking at her door. CURLS has partnered with these national retailers and is currently in negotiations with Boots in the United Kingdom. Dellinger, who was recently honored by rolling out as one of the Top 25 Women of Dallas, shared her journey and valuable tips on hair and haircare maintenance for “CURListas.” Were you always interested in hair/hair care? If not at what point in your life did you develop an interest? As long as I remember, I’ve always had a fascination with hair. I started to comb and maintain my hair from the age of 5 on. … I taught myself how to French braid by the age of 6. My mom didn’t have to do my hair for picture day, I preferred to do it myself! Taking great care of it and always looking my best was important. CURLS is just an extension of that fascination. There on so many natural hair care brands and products in the market right now. You entered the category early, how do you continue to grow and sustain the CURLS brand and differentiate yourself from the others? Very true! My motto is “you must innovate or you will evaporate.” We have been in the industry for 15 years. Keeping the brand fresh, customers excited and sales high don’t happen by sheer luck, it is all hard work, innovation, and being authentic. This is why CURLS, a pioneer in the natural hair care category is not only still relevant, we are still thriving and growing. Best tip/tips for women transitioning from processed to natural hair? I created my Blueberry Bliss Curl Collection for natural and transitioning CURListas. Blueberry Extract, the key ingredient in the entire collection, is clinically proven to repair damage, prevent breakage, AND encourage hair growth! Very important note: the point where your natural and your relaxed hair meet is the most vulnerable — therefore is more likely to break if not properly handled and taken care of. You want to keep your hair well conditioned and hydrated to ensure a smooth, breakage free transition. Here are a few key steps that you must commit to: 1. You definitely want to start by giving yourself a weekly deep treatment with heat for the next few months. 2. It is imperative that you moisturize your hair daily with a rich leave-in conditioner to soften the hair, ease combability, moisturize and condition. 3. Over shampooing (with traditional shampoos) and under conditioning are common culprits for dry, breakage-prone hair. Therefore, shampooing more than [once] a week is not recommended. On the other “shampoo-less” days do a conditioning rinse — rinse hair to remove styling products (this is where using the right products that are water soluble come in), apply an ample amount of conditioner, comb through, rinse and proceed with styling. Doing so will pump much-needed moisture back into your hair without stripping away essential nutrients, rinse away unnecessary dirt and oil and give yourself a fresh, clean start. 4. Using the right products, with quality ingredients is absolutely necessary. Avoid products with mineral and/or petrolatum oil in them…as both of these synthetic oils coat and suffocate the hair shaft, blocking moisture out thus drying out the hair. Remember, dryness leads to breakage. If applied directly to the scalp, mineral and petrolatum oil can actually retard growth. If your hair requires oil, always opt for a natural oil such as olive, jojoba, coconut, almond oil, etc. These natural oils actually penetrate and moisturize the hair. 5. Avoid drying products such as gel, hairspray and mousse with drying alcohol. If you need curl enhancement, opt for curl enhancers, lotions and creams. 6. Reduce the number of times per month you heat process your hair. If you currently are doing so three times a month, cut back to two times a month with a goal of [once] a month max! This will ensure the health and integrity of your hair. 7. Make sure you get regular trims … starting off with an inch or two is a great idea! Dellinger (right) with her Mom, Mrs. Turner at FSF Top 25 Women of Dallas. Photo provided by Xavier Jordan Photography CURLS has been featured in a host of beauty publications, including lnStyle, Essence, Glamour, Ebony, Modern Salon, and various other hair and salon trade publications. Additionally, Dellinger made an appearance on The Real daytime talk show. Discerning celebrity consumers like Halle Berry, Alicia Keys, Nia Long, Tia Mowry, Chili of TLC, Blair Underwood, Ashanti, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Echo Kellum seek out the superior quality and natural components of CURLS products.

After an era in which the internet powered the global economy, landmark developments in areas like machine learning have made data the centre of the technology world, Ma told a business conference in Malaysia. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence – the idea that computers can be programmed to emulate sentient behaviour. Machines are going to be more powerful and smarter than people...in 30 years Alibaba Group executive chairman Jack Ma “In Asia we are now moving from the IT time to the DT time. It’s not Donald Trump time. Data Time,” said Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba – the owner of the South China Morning Pos t. “With the IT time, Asia lost our chance. We don’t have an IBM, we don’t have a Microsoft, we don’t have Cisco, we don’t have an Intel. But on the DT time, we have a chance to win,” he said. “Look at Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. So many farmers are using mobile phones. If we can use the mobile technology to collect data, things are going to change.” Speaking to a full house at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, Ma said “these changes are going to come faster than you thought”. The 52-year-old founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant said the technology evolution was going so fast that data analysts who are currently buoyed by the notion that they picked the right field may find themselves disappointed. “I am going to tell you there is going to be no data analysis in the next 10 years. The machines can do a much better job than you are,” he said. “Machines are going to be more powerful and smarter than people...in 30 years, the best CEO of the year or the cover man of Time Magazine will be a machine. “So if you in the future want to compete with the machine on who is more knowledgeable, you have no chance to win.” But culture and values will set human beings apart in the machine era, he said. “Imagination, creativity and teamwork. These are the things we should teach our kids,” Ma said. “If we are not going to change our education system, our kids are going to complain, and it’s not their fault. It’s our fault.” Ma’s speech was the closing keynote at the two-day Global Transformation Forum organised by the Malaysian government. The Chinese technologist in November agreed to Prime Minister Najib Razak’s request to act as the country’s digital economy adviser. “I think I will come here more, and when he [Najib] comes to China I will grab every opportunity to talk to government officials on what we believe and what we want to share,” Ma told reporters after his speech.

Operationalising threat intelligence will, of course, take time and requires thorough planning Nick Ismail Hurricanes, much like there namesake, represent those attacks you can see coming and, for the same reason, earthquakes are those you can’t. Both are inevitable, and organisations need to plan and take action accordingly. This starts with an understanding of what threat intelligence is and how to make it relevant and actionable. The key is being prepared for both the foreseeable attacks as well as the ones that sneak up on you. This is where threat intelligence comes in, helping your organisation transition from constantly just reacting to threats to become more proactive in its approach. Threat Intel allows you to prepare for the hurricanes and respond to the earthquakes with an efficient, integrated approach. Eliminate noise Mention threat intelligence and most organisations think about multiple data feeds to which they subscribe — commercial sources, open source, and additional feeds from security vendors — each in a different format and most without any context to allow for prioritisation. >See also: The value of sharing threat intelligence This global threat data gives some insight into activities happening outside of your enterprise; not only the attacks themselves, but also how attackers are operating and infiltrating networks. The challenge is that most organisations suffer from data overload. Without the tools and insights to automatically sift through mountains of disparate global data and aggregate it for analysts and action, this threat data becomes noise; you have alerts around attacks that aren’t contextualised, relevant, or a priority. To make more effective use of this data, it must be aggregated in one manageable location and translated into a uniform format so that you can automatically get rid of the noise and focus on what’s important. Focus on threats With global threat data organised, you can focus on the hurricanes and earthquakes that threaten your organisation. Hurricanes are the threats which you know about, can prepare for, protect against and, anticipate based on past trends. For example, based on research, say that we know a file is malware. This intelligence should be operationalised; turned into a policy, a rule, or signature and sent to the appropriate sensor so that it can prevent bad actors from stealing valuable data, creating a disruption, or causing damage. As security operations become more mature, you can start to receive alerts on these known threats in addition to automatically blocking them so that you can learn more about the adversary. This allows you to focus on the attacks that really matter. Earthquakes are unknown threats, or threats that you may not have adequate countermeasures against, which have bypassed existing defences. Once they’re inside the network, your job is to detect, respond, and recover. This hinges on the ability to turn global threat data into threat intelligence by enriching that data with internal threat and event data and allowing analysts to collaborate for better decision making. >See also: What’s next for threat intelligence? Threat intelligence helps you better scope the campaign once the threat is detected, learn more about the adversary, and understand affected systems and how to best remediate. By correlating events and associated indicators from inside your environment (e.g., SIEM alerts or case management records) with external data on indicators, adversaries, and their methods, you gain the context to understand the who, what, when, where, why, and how of an attack. Going a step further, applying context to your business processes and assets helps you assess relevance. Is anything the organisation cares about at risk? If the answer is no, then what you suspected to be a threat is low priority. If the answer is yes, then it’s a threat. Either way, you have the intelligence you need to quickly take action. Make intelligence actionable Intelligence has three attributes that help define “actionable.” Accuracy: Is the intelligence reliable and detailed? Relevance: Does the intelligence apply to your business or industry? Timeliness: Is the intelligence being received with enough time to do something? An old industry joke is that you can only have two of the three, so you need to determine what’s most important to your business. If you need intelligence as fast as possible to deploy to your sensors, then accuracy may suffer and you might expect some false positives. If the intelligence is accurate and timely, then you may not have been able to conduct thorough analysis to determine if the intelligence is relevant to your business. This could result in expending resources on something that doesn’t present a lot of risk. Ultimately, the goal is to make threat intelligence actionable. But, actionable is defined by the user. The security operations centre typically looks for IP addresses, domain names, and other indicators of compromise – anything that will help to detect and contain a threat and prevent it in the future. >See also: Pay attention to your threat intelligence’s shelf life For the network team, it’s about hardening defences with information on vulnerabilities, signatures, and rules to update firewalls, and patch and vulnerability management systems. The incident response team needs intelligence about the adversary and the campaigns involved so they can investigate and remediate. And the executive team and board need intelligence about threats in business terms, the financial and operational impact, in order to increase revenue and protect shareholders and the company as a whole. Analysts must work together and across the organisation to provide the right intelligence in the right format and with the right frequency so that it can be used by multiple teams. Operationalising threat intelligence will, of course, take time and requires thorough planning. Many organisations are already beginning to move from a reactive mode to become more proactive. But, in order to make time to look out at the horizon and see and prepare for hurricanes while also dealing with earthquakes, organisations need to move to an anticipatory model with contextual intelligence, relevance, and visibility into trends in the threat landscape.

We've mentioned on many occasions that it's possible to build a really good gaming system without the need for a small power station nearby. A very pertinent case in point is our standard gaming test system, comprising an overclocked Core i7 chip, 32GB of RAM, dual SSDs and, of course, a premium graphics card. If built with due care and attention, a PC featuring a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti consumes less than 300W at the wall when gaming at 4K. And it's quiet into the bargain, too. So, in early 2017, it makes perfect sense to take advantage of the enviable performance-per-watt characteristics to build systems small in size but big on performance. Guess what, that is exactly what a well-known company has done, and it happens to be Corsair. Let's take a look at the 'category defying' Corsair One, shall we? Corsair says it wanted to 'create the fastest, quietest, and smallest PC possible that makes no compromises in ease-of-use or user-upgradeability.' Lofty words indeed, especially after the anaemic response to the first-generation Bulldog living room PC. The company has taken a completely custom approach to the One. Some may think why Corsair, but with its pedigree in producing RAM, cooling, PSUs, fans and chassis, plus a close tie-up with MSI and Intel, the question really is one of why not. The fruit of such labours is a rectangular unit measuring 380mm tall, 200mm deep and 176mm wide, or a 12-litre volume in old money. First impressions are favourable on this 7kg gaming machine. The chassis uses a high grade of anodised aluminium throughout, curved around the corners, and is very well put together. There are no squeaks nor rattles, and it looks equally good on a desk or the floor. Rather than opt for a gaudy 'gamer' aesthetic, the One is minimalist and refined. A couple of light strips run up each side, lit in a pleasant blue, and while their brightness can be controlled - from off to a piercing luminosity in even steps, plus static, breathing and flashing modes - there's no RGB capability. That's not necessarily a bad thing in our book. The only other interruptions on the front are a USB 3.1 port and HDMI 2.0, ostensibly for connecting a virtual reality headset. Around back, the One is well stocked with modern connectors. On top of Gigabit Ethernet and baked-in 802.11ac WiFi, there are six USB ports - 1x 3.1 Gen2 Type-C, 2x 2.0 Type-A and 3x 3.1 Gen 1 - as well as another HDMI 2.0 and a couple of DisplayPort 1.4. Corsair has been able to achieve this plethora of ports by teaming up with MSI, who supplies the custom Z270I Mini-ITX motherboard - that looks very much like the Pro Carbon AC - as well as a watercooled GeForce GTX 1080 card - more on that later. Chassis cooling is deliberately limited to a single ML140 fan housed at the top of the unit that comes away by depressing the single button on the back. It pulls hot air, circulating around the radiators, out of the chassis while the intricate meshing pattern on either side provides an opportunity for more air to be pulled in to cool the radiators. Building a high-performance, potentially overclocked PC into a confined space without risking throttling or surfeit noise is no easy task. The exploded picture gives an at-a-glance indication of how the One is put together. A modified SF400 80 PLUS Gold sits at the top. Its small fan is on at all times, due to the potential for heat build-up in such a small area, and it can be heard as a very low hum. A little below sits the MSI Mini ITX motherboard. Corsair populates both DIMM slots with 16GB of DDR4-2,400 memory (2x8GB) and there is no option, for now, to choose more at the time of purchase. A custom Corsair all-in-one watercooler is connected to a slim 240mm radiator and the combination is tasked with keeping the CPU in check. On that front, it's either a Core i7-7700 (65W TDP) or Core i7-7700K (91W), with the option of having the K-series chip overclocked out of the box. There's room for two 2.5in storage drives and an M.2 slot on the underside of the motherboard. Corsair, unfortunately, opts to run with its SATA-connected Force Series LE drives this time around, meaning that peak speed is limited to 560MB/s or so. When asked why M.2 wasn't used for this high-performance rig, even though the company has such a variant in the MP500 range, the answer was that it will be available as an option at a later date. On the other side is the GPU horsepower. Corsair's previous collaboration with MSI has lead to the Seahawk range of boards being used in the Bulldog. The One uses the same basic idea and the GPU's radiator mirrors the 240mm slim version used on the CPU. Indeed, both look identical on first blush. Though watercooled, the GPU retains a blower-style fan to keep the VRMs and memory cool, just like the standard Seahawk. Corsair One has the capability of housing a 10.5in-long graphics card that's either dual slot if watercooled or up to three slots wide if aircooled. That opens up the possibility of having a partner GeForce GTX 1080 Ti as a future option.

(AMD) Will Change the PC Industry Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War Recent Posts: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War AMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCs The New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You Think View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was expecting to be celebrating right about now. The beginning of its campaign to grab back marketshare from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is underway. The new Ryzen 7 CPU was released with considerable fanfare at the start of March, the Ryzen 5 is coming in a matter of weeks, and its new Naples CPUs for data centers have been announced. Source: AMD Unfortunately, there’s a snag and it’s a pretty serious one. Those new AMD Ryzen CPUs are causing PCs to lock up. Advanced Micro Devices has confirmed the issue and is working on a fix. AMD Ryzen Chips Are a Critical Launch This is a critical time for Advanced Micro Devices. The company has been competing against Intel in the market for computer CPUs for decades, and AMD has slipped into single-digit marketshare. However, 2017 marks a potential turning point for AMD, an opportunity to hit its rival hard. Intel has abandoned its “tick tock” CPU release strategy, meaning that this year’s seventh-generation Core processors are a modest improvement over last year’s. Advanced Micro Devices, on the other hand, is going all out with significant improvements to its chips, making them much faster than before. On top of that, AMD’s strategy of pushing multiple cores and multi-threading across its CPU line-up is beginning to pay off with the growing popularity of PC software that can take advantage of this capability — virtual reality, video games and video editing software, for example. Intel’s decision to more or less coast this year combined with the surge in popularity of VR and other applications that perform better with multi-threading CPUs gives AMD an opening. The AMD Ryzen 7 is taking on Intel’s Core i7 for performance desktops, the soon-to-be-released Ryzen 5 is aimed at the mainstream Intel Core i5. And the recently announced AMD Naples is coming in the second quarter to take on Intel’s Xeon processors in data centers. The high performance, 128-core Naples is claimed to outperform the Xeon by as much as 2.5 times on key tasks. But there’s a problem. AMD Ryzen 7 Is Locking Up PCs The press around AMD’s new generation of processors had been largely positive. However, potential disaster struck when reports began to surface that PCs equipped with the new AMD Ryzen 7 chips were locking up.

The man, a British citizen who was known to the police and security services, had been investigated some years ago over violent extremism. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs he was a "peripheral" figure, adding: "He was not part of the current intelligence picture." Delivering a defiant message to a packed House of Commons, Mrs May said: "We will never waver in the face of terrorism." A statement released through IS's Aamaq news agency said the attacker was a "soldier of the Islamic State". According to the SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, the IS statement said: "The attacker yesterday in front of the British Parliament in London was a soldier of the Islamic State executing the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations." The Prime Minister addressed MPs as they gathered at the usual time inside the Palace of Westminster, which a day earlier had come under attack from the knife-wielding terrorist. An hour after MPs had stood for a minute's silence in honour of the innocent people killed in the attack, Mrs May delivered a statement with details of the atrocity. Paying tribute to Pc Keith Palmer, who died after being stabbed, she said: "He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten." Describing the terrorist, Mrs May said: "What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. A woman holds a placard up during a candlelit vigil at Trafalgar Square on March 23, 2017 in London, England. (Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images) "The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot." Anti-terror police have arrested eight people in the wake of the attack. Several addresses were raided overnight in London and Birmingham as Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan Police's senior anti-terror officer, said he believed the attacker was working alone. A minute's silence was held nationwide at 9.33am, including in the Palace of Westminster and at New Scotland Yard, to commemorate the three innocent people who were killed.

An hour after MPs had stood for a minute’s silence in honour of the innocent people killed in the attack, Mrs May delivered a statement with details of the atrocity. She said it was still believed that the attacker acted alone and there was “no reason to believe” further attacks on the public were planned. She added: “His identity is known to the police and MI5 and when operational considerations allow, he will be publicly identified. “What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. “He was a peripheral figure.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Katie Mettler By Katie Mettler March 23 Follow @kemettler In Feb. 2012, Joey Hudy and former president Obama created a stir when they shot a marshmallow across the State Dining Room at the White House Science Fair. (Youtube/The Obama White House) When Joey Hudy went to the White House in 2012, the eighth grade science whiz captivated President Barack Obama — and the world — with his large, orange marshmallow cannon. He and Obama primed the homemade contraption and then blasted its sugary ammo across the room, much to the dismay of the Secret Service. “Ohhh,” Obama yelled, before retrieving the marshmallow and Hudy’s business card, “just in case.” It made for a memorable moment, an Obama administration favorite, and put Hudy, then 14, into the national spotlight. He became a jet-setting inventor of 3-D body scanners and solar-powered computers, a promoter of STEM programs at Maker Faire and the youngest ever corporate intern at Intel. In 2015, he returned to the White House as Michelle Obama’s State of the Union guest to promote his personal motto: “Don’t be bored. Make something.” Brilliant.org once named him one of the “10 Smartest Kids in the World.” But this year, Hudy’s mind betrayed him. He had graduated from Arizona State University and moved to Hong Kong, his parents told TV station Fox 10, when he began experiencing paranoia and psychosis. He believed the Chinese government was following him and that his apartment was bugged. “It was something I never dreamed of hearing,” Hudy’s mother, Julie Hudy, told Fox 10. In January, the young man was admitted to a psychiatric hospital overseas and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Joey Hudy (Screen grab from Go Fund Me) Schizophrenia is a disease of the mind that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves. Symptoms usually manifest anywhere from age 16 to 30, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, and can cause those affected to hear and see things that aren’t real. Doctors still aren’t sure what causes schizophrenia, so treatment focuses on eliminating symptoms with antipsychotic medications and psychosocial therapy. But treating schizophrenia, or any mental illness, can be financially crippling. To help offset the expenses, Hudy’s older sister, Elizabeth Hudy, created a GoFundMe account on her parents’ behalf. “Anyone who knows my mother and father knows that they are some of the most generous and caring people you will ever meet,” Elizabeth Hudy wrote on the fundraising site. “They fill the lives of others with so much love and support and they deserve the same, especially in such a difficult time.” While their son got help at an Ohio treatment center in February, Julie and Victor Hudy lived in a nearby hotel, Elizabeth Hudy wrote. His condition deteriorated and last week, Joey Hudy’s doctors recommended he be transferred to a long-term care facility in Tennessee. “You may not be aware of the significant cost of mental health care in the United States for such a diagnosis, and neither was I,” she wrote. Ten days at the Ohio facility cost $19,500. A month in Tennessee will cost more than $25,000. “Joey will likely have to stay for a minimum of three months,” Elizabeth wrote. “After this time we still don’t know how long it will take for the medications to be effective or what will be the next steps.” As of Thursday morning, the family had raised $18,400 of its $50,000 goal and the GoFundMe had been widely circulated on social media among those in the Maker Faire community of tech and science enthusiasts and former Obama White House staffers. Among those who had donated was Paulette Aniskoff, a deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Public Engagement in the Obama White House. The family said that any excess funds will go toward helping other families burdened by the cost of mental health care. I met @Joey_Hudy at Maker Faire NY in 2011.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Neurala Enables Developers to Quickly Add Powerful AI Software Into Drones, Toys and Other Products Neurala Enables Developers to Quickly Add Powerful AI Software Into Drones, Toys and Other Products Posted on March 23, 2017 by neurala in Press Releases Neurala Enables Developers to Quickly Add Powerful AI Software Into Drones, Toys and Other Products Neurala’s new Developers Program makes sophisticated deep learning neural network AI software, originally developed for NASA, easy to use and deploy (PRUnderground) March 23rd, 2017 Product developers can significantly accelerate the deployment of AI applications without a team of Ph.D. researchers, an extensive evaluation of different tools or years of costly R&D with the Neurala Developers Program, announced today by Neurala.  Neurala makes The Neurala Brain, a deep learning neural networks platform that is making smart products like toys, cameras and self-driving cars more autonomous, interactive and useful. The Neurala Developers Program has everything a software developer needs to integrate The Neurala Brain into a target application. It includes a set of C++ APIs, testing tools, code examples and a working program with source code. Mobile wrappers are provided for Android and iOS to make integration easier on those platforms. The software behind the magic Neurala’s neural network software—originally developed for NASA—uses a bio-inspired approach to mimic the way the human brain learns and analyzes its environment. This software enables a variety of smart products—from self-driving cars and industrial drones to toys, consumer electronics and smart cameras—to learn, adapt and interact in real time. For example, toys can learn to identify their owners, security cameras can identify specific threats, drones can learn how to diagnose problems at the tops of cell towers, saving humans considerable danger and drudgery, and self-driving cars can be safer and learn to avoid obstacles. One significant differentiator of Neurala’s deep learning software is that it scales from embedded hardware to powerful servers. Neurala calls this an “Anywhere Brain.” By operating “on the edge” and locally on the device, toys can entertain without communicating personal information to a third party, and applications like self-driving cars need not rely on the internet—which can be slow or unavailable—to avoid accidents. Neurala’s software development kit (SDK) supports industry-standard NVIDIA, ARM and Intel processors, so teams can develop for the processor that is best for their product instead of being forced to select a high-priced proprietary processor. AI for all! “The artificial intelligence capabilities we once saw as futuristic possibilities are becoming realities. Now anyone can easily integrate a deep learning neural network in an app,” said Massimiliano “Max” Versace, Neurala co-founder and CEO. “We’ve spent years developing The Neurala Brain so that a variety of devices can benefit from bio-inspired brainpower. As we make this technology available to developers for everyday projects, we look forward to witnessing the resulting proliferation of products that can learn, see and act more autonomously.” Teal Drones is the first in the drone industry to bundle Neurala technology in every drone built, a powerful and unique differentiator. “The Neurala Brain is giving our drones autonomy and control that would not otherwise be possible,” said George Matus, founder and CEO of Teal Drones. “Neurala’s real-time, deep learning software is powerful and versatile—and we believe it will find many compelling applications in the hands of the larger developer community.” Neurala: making AI easy Building a drone, car or robot is difficult; building AI is even harder, with different skill sets and extensive resources required. Companies wishing to integrate AI into a product or service have historically faced a long and costly process that involves assembling a team, R&D, deploying, testing and optimizing. With the “zoo” of hardware platforms and software tools available, developers traditionally have found choosing the right fit difficult until after development and testing are done—often taking years and involving an investment of millions of dollars. Neurala’s Developers Program eliminates the need for any of that. Neurala’s new offering allows developers to build and deploy their own AI “brain” immediately. The offering is C++-optimized for real-time control of machines and allows for: ·       Edge learning on-the-fly ·       Enhanced cloud learning ·       Both custom and off-the-shelf “brains” ·       Cloud post-processing About Neurala Neurala, Inc. (http://www.neurala.com) is a software company that developed The Neurala Brain—deep learning neural network software that makes smart products like robots, drones, toys, self-driving cars and smart cameras more autonomous, engaging and useful. Neurala provides off-the-shelf and customized solutions ranging from high-end applications to inexpensive everyday consumer products.

Name: Subject: Message: Even more Galaxy S8 leaks: batteries, US model branding, and gold version! Newsby Bogdan Petrovan3 days ago 58 1894 34 Do you prefer to be surprised by phone launches? It’s probably too late now, but if that’s the case, you should stop reading now. Yes, we have more leaks of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, the most thoroughly leaked devices in recent memory. Read: What to expect from the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus Gold version As with many Galaxy S8 reports from the past weeks, we owe the images below to Evan Blass. The professional leaker recently revealed the black, grey, and silver versions of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, and now he’s back with the beautiful golden version. Check it out below, along with two new press renders of the black and orchid grey versions. Also, here’s another brief video showing a working Galaxy S8: US model branding and retail box The same Evan Blass also revealed an interesting, though minor detail that pertains to the way Samsung brands its devices in countries from around the world. As you can see in the images above, global models lack the “Galaxy S8” text on the back of the device. Assuming Blass’ intel is correct, US versions – including, presumably, unlocked and carrier models – will have the “Galaxy S8” branding on the rear. We can only speculate about the rationale behind this small difference, though we’re sure Samsung has the market studies and focus groups to justify it. As a piece of related trivia, Samsung does the opposite thing in Japan: The phones it sells there are branded “Galaxy” with no mention whatsoever of the Samsung name. Out of China, here’s what the Galaxy S8 Plus’ retail box will look like: Batteries: are they too small? The last leak on our list is the most important, because it strongly affects user experience. From several older rumors, we suspected that the Galaxy S8 would come with a 3,000-mAh battery, while the larger Galaxy S8 Plus would go up to 3,500-mAh. Now we have some actual evidence supporting these rumors, in the form of images showing the batteries that will likely power the two phones. The images tell us that at least some of the batteries for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will be manufactured in Vietnam by Samsung SDI, the Samsung group affiliate that was initially blamed for the Note 7 recall. The actual problem turned out to rest in the design of the Note 7’s battery. According to several reports, Samsung tried to diversify its battery supply chain, in order to avoid overreliance on one manufacturer and another fiasco like the Note 7. Still, SDI will probably remain the main supplier for the Galaxy S8. The capacities of the two batteries might raise concerns, as they bring no improvements over the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, or Galaxy Note 7. In fact, the 3,500 mAh battery of the Galaxy S8 Plus is actually 100 mAh smaller than the Galaxy S7 Edge’s from last year. Only time will tell if the concerns are warranted. Battery life depends on many more factors than battery capacity alone. For instance, the 10 nm Snapdragon 835 processor that will power the S8 and S8 Plus is said to be more efficient than its predecessors. Software optimization and tweaks like setting the default screen resolution to Full HD+ could also help improve battery life. Let us know your thoughts!

The company also announced new capabilities giving industrial manufacturers the power to leverage hardware-based security technologies and automated digital certificate management to harden devices and effectively enable scalable IoT deployments. Hundreds of companies, including Schneider Electric, Wind River, Intel, Infineon Technologies AG, DDC-I and GE have integrated Mocana's effective cybersecurity software into industrial control systems, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), cloud platforms, remote terminal units (RTUs), intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), device gateways and controllers. With the new platform, customers and partners are further protecting IoT devices and industrial clouds against sophisticated cyberattacks that are shutting down power grids, forcing massive segments of the Internet offline and threatening the safety of critical infrastructures. "When it comes to mission-critical IoT security, there is no middle-ground or acceptable margin for error. Hackers have demonstrated their ability to get behind firewalls and take over IoT devices. Once a hacker has control of an IoT device or controller behind a firewall, they can wreak havoc by manipulating flow controls, valves, compressors, power systems and engine controls that result in loss of critical services and loss of life," said William Diotte, CEO of Mocana. "The Mocana IoT Security Platform is the most comprehensive IoT security solution for industrial manufacturers that are concerned about cyberattacks on embedded systems, IoT devices and industrial cloud systems." The Mocana platform provides a full-stack solution for securing IoT systems from the endpoint, to the gateway, to the cloud and back again. The platform includes a unique, inside-out hardening approach that ensures endpoint and gateway trustworthiness, data and device integrity, authentication and confidentiality. The new Mocana IoT Security Platform provides software capabilities, a set of simple APIs and a path to utilize Mocana's planned management and analytics capabilities. The new Mocana IoT Security Platform builds upon the Mocana Security of Things Platform and includes significant innovations: Mocana Trust Engine: A vendor-agnostic trust abstraction layer that allows device manufacturers to take advantage of the latest security chip technologies, such as the Infineon OPTIGA® Trusted Platform Module (TPM), ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX and Intel EPID. Automated Certificate Management: Support for automated certificate management using Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) and trust chaining to ensure a lifecycle of trust for secure boot, secure firmware updates and trusted operations. Full Stack Platform: The full-stack architecture and strong cryptographic engine ensure authentication, integrity, confidentiality, visibility and control for devices, gateways and cloud applications. Simple API: The software abstracts the underlying hardware, enabling applications to call cryptographic functions through a single API. OpenSSL-compatibility interface allows customers to replace OpenSSL with a lightweight defense-grade crypto library. Mocana is trusted by more than 200 manufacturers and IoT companies, and its software is integrated with more than 70 chipsets, 30 operating systems and supports networking environments such as SSL, SSH, multicast, IPsec and wireless. Mocana plans to introduce management and analytics capabilities later this year to provide a new level of visibility and control into IoT devices. Industry analysts and leaders have validated Mocana's comprehensive approach to IoT security: "It has never been a better time to address security in IoT devices at the earliest stages of their development, because attackers are quickly learning that the systems supporting our critical infrastructure are increasingly interconnected," said Rob Westervelt, research manager, IDC. "The tools provided by Mocana are rooted in its long history of equipping engineers with the ability to harden devices that perform mission-critical operations. Manufacturers can now be equipped to leverage the power of the embedded chips in their products to support the security and privacy requirements of these emerging data-driven IoT ecosystems." "The need for end-to-end security has never been greater, particularly as legacy infrastructure and industrial systems are upgraded for greater connectivity," notes Steve Hoffenberg, director of IoT & embedded technology at industry analyst firm VDC Research. "Industrial IoT engineers must take it for granted that their systems will be under attack, and structure their defenses in a layered approach assuming that hackers may gain entry to the network. Paranoia is warranted." "As the IoT continues to grow, an increasing number of backdoors and vulnerabilities are discovered every day," said Joerg Borchert, VP of Chip Card Security of Infineon Technologies. "If enterprise-grade companies expect their users to trust in the inherent safety of their technology, they must ensure that advanced security is embedded directly into the device. Our partnership with Mocana focuses on this type of comprehensive security as we work toward providing customers with an easy and effective way to harden their operational technologies." "Mocana's new IoT software brings trusted, military-grade security, and cloud-based communications to safety-critical applications like connected commercial and military aircraft," said Greg Rose, vice president of marketing and product management at DDC-I. "We are excited to be working with Mocana and our joint customers to provide an integrated platform for safety-critical avionics applications that combines key pieces of their IoT software with our best-in-class DO-178 real-time operating system."

Five patches published on Wednesday add HDMI 2.0+ video mode handling in DRM core and allow for user-space for enabling of HDMI 2.0+ features. Though there is already some feedback to the patches on potentially just limiting the non-default aspect ratios behind a compatibility flag while letting the other HDMI 2.0 modes/features through that wouldn't break user-space compatibility. 64:27 and 256:135 are two of the new aspect ratio flags exposed in the HDMI 2.0 mode. There is also DRM EDID additions for HDMI 2.0 CEA video modes. The patch series is under a "request for comments" flag on the dri-devel list. Intel OTC developers have also been working on i915 DRM HDMI 2.0 changes with Geminilake supporting HDMI 2.0. That Intel work is coming together. On the AMD side, their HDMI 2.0 functionality is being worked on within the DC (DAL) code. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

We won't compete with you Microsoft drives deeper into connected car territory with Toyota patent deal and a new tech licensing program. By Liam Tung | March 23, 2017 -- 10:52 GMT (03:52 PDT) | Topic: Internet of Things Microsoft's new patent program underlines its vast range of technologies essential for internet-connected vehicles. Image: Microsoft Microsoft has created a new patent licensing program for car manufacturers to use its technologies in connected vehicles. Toyota is the first company to take up the new program, which Microsoft announced on Wednesday as an invite to other car manufacturers to join, too. Google might be the first tech firm that comes to mind when discussing self-driving cars, but it's not alone. Intel just made a $15.3bn bet on its growth with Mobileye, while Qualcomm and SoftBank with ARM are also gearing up for growth. CES 2017: Microsoft Connected Car 2.0 rolls along Microsoft's 'Connected Car' strategy now has a new name: Microsoft Connected Vehicle. But the goal is the same: Linking cars to Microsoft cloud services. Read More Microsoft's new patent program is a reminder that it too has a vast range of technologies that will be essential for internet-connected vehicles and which are available to manufacturers to license. And, unlike Google, Microsoft stresses it doesn't build cars, but wants to partner with car manufacturers. Connected car innovations that Microsoft lists in its new auto licensing page include Windows, its exFAT file storage system, Wi-Fi and mobile connectivity, sensors, Kinect for gesture computing, its Cortana voice-recognition system, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. In a new video promoting itself as a connected car partner, it even touts Outlook Calendar as an assistant for drivers and vehicle repairers. Microsoft also boasts that since 1995 it's worked with Ford, BMW, Tesla, and Nissan to spur the development of connected cars. Tesla has even nabbed a few of Microsoft's HoloLens engineers, while the pair have teamed up on Elon Musk's OpenAI, which is using Azure N-Series virtual machines to target deep-learning applications. All these technologies would help anticipate when cars need maintenance, connect drivers to roadside assistance, and power tomorrow's infotainment systems. "When you look across telematics, infotainment, safety, and other systems in today's connected cars, you find Microsoft technologies and innovation," said Erich Andersen, corporate vice president and chief IP counsel of Microsoft's intellectual property group, highlighting that Microsoft spends $11.4bn a year on R&D. Microsoft's executive vice president of business development, Peggy Johnson, said the connected car market is huge for the auto industry, and that software is the key to achieving it. Analyst firm Gartner forecasts there will be 250 million connected cars on the road by 2020, which will need technologies for telematics, automated driving, infotainment, and mobility services. It expects connected car production to increase from 21 million per year in 2017, to 61 million per year by 2020. As for Toyota, the licensing arrangement builds on a recent partnership with Microsoft to run Toyota's Connected Car data-science initiative on the Azure cloud platform. The pair envisage future services such as a steering wheel with a built-in heart-rate monitor, a seat that doubles as weight scales, networking with other vehicles to predict traffic conditions, and automated calendar scheduling to lock in an appointment with the car maintenance service.

Image Credit: Screenshot / Microsoft video Microsoft has agreed to license its patents for Internet-connected cars to Toyota, its first such deal with an automaker and a signal that it may be willing to partner with others. The tech giant, which announced the deal on Wednesday afternoon, holds a treasure trove of patents that include car operating systems, Wi-Fi, motion sensors, voice recognition, and navigation. Cars are increasingly morphing into computers with wheels, and Microsoft sees the same opportunity that a number of other tech companies do, including Intel, Google, Qualcomm, and NXP. “The connected car represents an enormous opportunity for the auto industry, and at the core it’s a software challenge,” Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft, said in a statement Wednesday. Microsoft’s patents for connected cars — a broad term for vehicles with Internet connectivity — includes tools to store and transfer files, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. The company says that it sees driving becoming far more personalized and convenient in the future. Technology would predict when cars need maintenance so that drivers can get the problem fixed before a breakdown on the road. They would also anticipate drivers’ intended routes based on their calendars along with personalized entertainment for whoever is driving. Microsoft sees a big growth in demand for connected car services. Gartner Research has forecast that new vehicles equipped with data connectivity will increase from 6.9 million per year in 2015 to 61 million per year in 2020. The research firm predicts the total cumulative shipments of automobiles equipped with data connectivity will be 250 million by 2020. The move is a natural progression from the auto-related services Microsoft already provides. While Toyota is the first automaker to get access to these licenses, Microsoft has worked with automakers and auto-related companies for years, including BMW, Harman, Ford, Nissan, and Volvo. Earlier this year, Volvo announced it will integrate Skype for business in its 90 Series cars, and Nissan agreed to use Microsoft’s connected vehicle platform, a set of services built on its Azure cloud. Microsoft’s licensing agreement follows an earlier tie up with Toyota in April 2016 to create a data analytics company focused on bringing new Internet-connected services to cars without overwhelming the driver with technology. The entity, Toyota Connect, uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service to crunch data and help develop new products for drivers, businesses with car fleets, and dealers. Toyota Connect marked an expansion of an even earlier partnership with Microsoft to research and develop connected car services. Toyota Connect is the data science hub for the Toyota, serving its robotics and artificial intelligence research. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

X Sales of ebooks slide as readers prefer a book in the hand Net Results: But 10 years after Amazon launched the Kindle measuring ebook readership is tricky Thu, Mar 23, 2017, 06:00 Karlin Lillington Nielsen and AAP figures show ebook consumers falling away from ebooks and ereader devices. Photograph: Getty Images         Guess what’s back? Physical books that you can hold in your hand, open wide to breathe in that satisfying ink-on-paper bouquet, and carry without fear into the bath.  Sales of ebooks have continued to gently power down in the US and UK, with physical book sales outstripping those of digital downloads in the UK for the first time since 2011. According to industry research firm Nielsen, ebook sales were down 4 per cent in 2016, while physical books sales rose 2 per cent.   In the US, a report from the Association of American Publishers (AAP) released in November last year indicated sales of digital books were down a very significant 20 per cent. In 2015, a similar AAP report noted a 10 per cent decline in ebooks.   Yet the ebook category once saw explosive growth, jumping 1,260 per cent between 2008 and 2010, according to the New York Times. Though ebooks had been available for many years online – thousands for free, via Project Gutenberg, if you felt like sitting in front of your desktop computer while perusing Proust – the arrival of specialised reading devices helped drive mass interest in the format.  Amazon released its first Kindle model in 2007. Priced at a hair-raising $399, it nonetheless sold out within 5½ hours. Other competitors entered the market, too, such as the Nook, and the Kobo reader.  Sony was in the market years earlier, with its first ereader debuting in 2004. After handling one of the Sony devices around the time the Kindle was introduced, I was smitten with the concept, but not enough to pay for such a luxury item. Irish Jesuits to dispose of rare book collection worth €2m Better late than never? Library book due in 1949 returned Catholic library board members resign in row over DCU takeover Geek hit Once prices dropped – thanks to Amazon’s ruthless determination to control this market – I got my first ereader, an early generation, grey-screen Kindle. I had debated getting one for a while, and researched the various devices on offer, but wondered whether I’d actually use it after the initial geek hit wore off. I am not a gadget person, and have boxes full of briefly exciting electronic fossils to prove it. ADVERTISEMENT A post-interview conversation in 2011 with Intel futurist Genevieve Bell – a big fan of the Kindle – convinced me to take the plunge. I bought a lovely leather cover tooled with a pleasingly ironic image of a typewriter, but found over time that I used my Kindle more for travel than for general reading. An ereader is fantastic for travel, because you can bring a gazillion books in one lightweight format.   My quibbles with my Kindle? The grey screen was great in direct light – including sunlight, which would wash out a tablet or mobile screen. But my eyes struggled in dimmer lighting, such as under reading lights on aircraft. Grey wasn’t very paper-like, either. I also found it disconcerting not to have the physical sense of where I was in a book, having to rely on a percentage indicator instead.  Overall, I preferred a book in the hand. That seems to place me in the current Nielsen and AAP zeitgeist, an ebook consumer falling away from ebooks and ereader devices (there has been a decline in ereader sales, it seems, too).  But perhaps the ebook and ereader picture isn’t quite that neat and tidy. We read more on tablets and mobiles. And what are Nielsen and AAP figures actually counting? Mostly, mainstream, or AAP-member publisher sales, according to a sceptical article in Fortune in late 2015 that took issue with a big New York Times piece on the AAP figures.   The writer – noting the Times story “had more than a whiff of anti-digital Schadenfreude about it” – said AAP and Nielsen figures are based on a limited number of publishers and excluded small, independent publishers, and the self-published books that make up a significant portion of ebook sales on Amazon (which has the lion’s share of the ebook market, over 70 per cent in the US). He also noted that many traditional publishers had raised ebook prices after reaching an agreement with Amazon that allowed them to set their own ebook prices.  More recent, exhaustive and fascinatinganalysis of 2016 book sales figures by the AuthorEarnings site (http://authorearnings.com/report/dbw2017/) came to this conclusion: the only reason print book sales are up (slightly) is because Amazon began discounting prices on print books in mid-2015, after publishers raised ebook prices and eliminated retailer ability to discount ebooks.   Not then for all those reasons – digital “fatigue”, adult colouring-book popularity, a waning ebook “fad”  – suggested in 2015, 2016 and again in the wake of last week’s figures.  As for me, I decided last month to call time on my six-year-old Kindle, and splurged on a Kindle Voyager with a vastly improved reading experience. I love it. No longer will my Kindle be consigned to holiday reading.  Bottom line? Readers just like reading. Format will be increasingly flexible. Really it’s about the words not about the technology, or lack of it.       Topics: Genevieve Bell Association Of American Publishers Intel Sony Nielsen Amazon United States United Kingdom Read More Library staff to vote on industrial action over out-of-hours access Planned library at Mary Robinson’s former home delayed Sligo libraries face closure due to council staff cuts National Library ‘on our way back up’, says director London bookshops rebel against online frenzy and go wifi-free Beyond the book: a whole new chapter in the role of public libraries The National Library: online and on the shelves Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Media & Marketing Second INM whistleblower made disclosure over Newstalk row Retail & Services Stench lingers after Natrium’s peace deal with Clerys staff International Martin O’Neill confirms Séamus Coleman surgery a success Innovation MOF Technologies to license material that captures greenhouse gases Sponsored Our trip North: ‘I couldn’t believe how much it had changed’ Who are the ‘Leaders of Tomorrow’?

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory CNN’s Don Lemon blasted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes for acting like “a shill for the White House” when he told Donald Trump and reporters on Wednesday that the president may have been “incidentally” surveilled by intelligence agencies. Former Rep. Jack Kingston tried to argue that Nunes was justified in going directly to the president with information about incidental surveillance on individuals connected with the Trump transition team–prior to notifying fellow members of the House Intelligence Committee. The crux of Kingston’s argument was that Nunes and ranking House Intel member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) were provided a closed-door briefing by FBI Director James Comey on the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and thus know more about the investigation than the public. “How does that justify what he did today?” and incredulous Ryan Lizza asked Kingston. “As someone on the transition team, someone trying to lead a nonpartisan investigation, in made [Nunes] look like a shill for the White House,” Lemon said. Earlier in the segment, exasperated panel members tried in vain to explain how Nunes’ announcement does not validate Trump’s claims that he was wiretapped by former President Barack Obama, with former CIA analyst Phillip Mudd at one point burying his head in his hands in frustration. “It doesn’t vindicate him,” host Don Lemon began. “And I keep hearing this and it infuriates me” Kingston attempted to argue that Nunes confirmed the Trump transition team was “being spied on” by the government with his statement on Wednesday. This prompted outrage on the panel. “I don’t know why this is so hard,” Kristen Powers said, as Mudd threw his hands in the air. “Mr. Mudd, can you please explain this people, it’s not that difficult,” Lemon said to the former CIA analyst. “Do you mind if I break down into tears first?” Mudd quipped, before clarifying difference between incidental surveillance and government spying. After a heated back and forth, Lizza jumped in with some perspective.  “Can we just stand back a second and look at the absurdity of the chairman of the house intelligence committee going to the White House and making a public statement and making all of this public today?” he asked. :This is not how you conduct an investigation.” “What about the head of the FBI going public with all of the stuff he’s been doing, frankly starting with Hillary Clinton,” Kingston replied. “Now you’re upset about that?” Powers and other panel members asked, amused, as Lizza pointed out that the difference is Nunes went directly to the White House, which is, in fact, “the subject of the investigation!” Watch the video below, via CNN: Report typos and corrections to corrections@rawstory.com About the Author Next on Raw Story > Conservative pundit: The only president with a worse 100 days than Trump is the one who died the first month By commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy.

Speaking to ToI’s diplomatic correspondent Raphael Ahren and Chinese editor Yifeng Zhou as he wrapped up his visit to Beijing, Netanyahu said he raised the issue during his meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping. “It is my hope that over time we’ll see a greater consonance between China’s superb relations with Israel on the bilateral side and its votes in multinational forums,” Netanyahu said. Interviewed by The Times of Israel on the 18th floor of Beijing’s St. Regis hotel, the prime minister made no claim to have changed China’s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Iranian nuclear agreement, which are markedly at odds with Israel’s own. But he did see bilateral relations strengthening, and noted that “President Xi said he believes that strong economic ties help diplomacy.” Stressing the economic part of the trip, he talked at length about how Israeli technology can dramatically improve the lives of the 1.3 billion Chinese people. Giving just one example, Netanyahu said there are 100 million cars in China, which causes traffic jams, accidents and heavy pollution. “All of that is changing with new technology, a lot which emanates from Israel,” he said, referring to Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based company that computer chip giant Intel bought last week for the staggering amount of $15 billion, and Waze, a crowd-sourced innovation app that was acquired by Google in 2013. (Netanyahu said at the airport later that 2 billion worth of deals were signed during his China trip.)

(AFP Photo/Pool/Etienne Oliveau) Netanyahu’s trip was officially timed to mark 25 years since Israel and China established diplomatic relations, and was replete with ceremonial elements. Arriving on Sunday, Netanyahu was welcomed at Beijing airport by an honor guard. Before his meeting with Prime Minister Li Keqiang in the Great Hall of the People, the national anthems were played. Israeli flags fluttered on lampposts at Tiananmen Square throughout the three-day visit. On Tuesday, Netanyahu and his wife Sara laid a wreath at the Monument to the People’s Heroes, making him the first Israeli leader to be granted such an honor. But the ceremonial aspects were not the focus of the visit. Rather, Netanyahu and his delegation — which included four ministers and dozens of businesspeople — signed more than a dozen bilateral agreements, agreeing to cooperate chiefly in the fields of technology and innovation. “Israel is renowned, precisely as President Xi said, as a leader in technology,” Netanyahu told The Times of Israel. “In many of these areas, we can have a very fruitful cooperation between Israeli technology and Chinese marketing and industrial power.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center left, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stand on the podium as they listen to the national anthems during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Monday, March 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) On Tuesday, Beijing announced the creation of a China-Israel “innovative strategic partnership.” “As President Xi himself said, this particular designation applies only to Israel, and to Israel only,” Netanyahu enthused. “And it shows the primacy of Israel’s position in innovation. We’re a small country (of 8.6 million people). We could fit twice, or maybe even more, into Beijing (21.5 million) or Shanghai (24.5 million), in terms of population. But we have a predominance in many areas of technology that are changing the lives of people.” Here is a full transcript of our interview: The Times of Israel: President Xi Jinping said you told him Israel is hoping for China to take a more active role in Middle East affairs. What exactly do you have in mind? Prime Minister Netanyahu: Well, actually I was talking about the economic side and the logistical possibility. China wants to increase the access of Asia — China specifically — to the world. There are two ways of doing it: One is the mutual exchange of Israeli technology with Chinese business. I think we’re well en route to doing that. A third of the investment in Israeli high technology is Chinese. We welcome more. And we would like to advance the free trade association, which would enable a two-way movement to proceed. We agreed that we’d accelerate it. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a business / economic in Beijing, China, March 20, 2017 (Haim Zach/GPO) Secondly, there is a transportation route that we’re planning now, which is a rail connection between Asia and between the Red Sea and Mediterranean ports (such as Eilat and Ashdod). We think it could be of interest to China. So we’ve been discussing that as well. But you envision no role for China in the Middle East peace process? Well, we’re going to a pursue our attempt to achieve both a broad peace with the Arab states and Palestinian-Israeli peace. And China is always seen as a valued supporting party. The Chinese president said he “appreciates Israel’s adoption of the two-state solution.” In recent weeks you have refrained from using this terminology. Was that a point of contention? ‘President Xi said he believes that strong economic ties help diplomacy’ First of all, I’d say that the overwhelming part of our conversation talked about economy and technology and the various possibilities of Israeli-Chinese cooperation. To the extent that we discussed this, I reiterated my position that the Palestinians would have to recognize a Jewish state and that Israel would have overriding security control over the territory west of the Jordan. These are not new positions. I have said that for many years; that hasn’t changed. But the thrust of our conversation overwhelmingly was on economic and technological cooperation. When can we expect the excellent scientific and technological relations to be translated into diplomatic support at international forums such as the United Nations? I raised my hope that extraordinary bilateral relations would also be reflected in multinational forums. President Xi said that he believes that strong economic ties help diplomacy. It is my hope that over time we’ll see a greater consonance between China’s superb relations with Israel on the bilateral side and its votes in multinational forums. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara at the Monument to the People’s Heroes in Beijing on March 21, 2017. (Haim Zach / GPO) You said at the UN last year that in 10 years, the UN will cheer Israel. You’ve since said it could happen even sooner. How long will it take until China switches its traditional voting patterns in the UN [which consistently support Arab-sponsored anti-Israeli initiatives]? I wasn’t speaking specifically of China. But I was speaking of a great number of countries that we see dramatically broadening and deepening relations their relations with Israel. And I expect, there, to see a change fairly quickly. I was specifically talking about the large mass of African countries. Prime Minister Netanyahu meets with Chinese Prime Minister Li in Beijing, March 20, 2017. (Raphael Ahren/Times of Israel) We discussed, quite apart from that, the possibility that Israel and China will have trilateral cooperation in third countries. We specifically spoke about Africa. China is in Africa, it has a big presence in Africa. And Israel’s coming back to Africa with great dynamism. In fact, I intend to take a second trip to Africa in a few months, this time to West Africa. We’re already cooperating with other countries, like Germany and Italy. There’s no reason why Israel and China shouldn’t cooperate, bringing our mutual expertise to the help of African countries. We agreed that our respective foreign ministries would begin discussions to that effect. Let’s speak about Iran, which is a strong ally of China. After your meeting with Prime Minister Li, a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official told reporters that Beijing still believes the 2015 nuclear agreement “will be very conducive for regional and international peace.” Clearly you disagree with this characterization. Yes, that’s no secret. I made my views known in every forum possible, from the United Nations to the US Congress. And I obviously have not changed my view. And Iran’s actions since the signing of the agreement have not lessened this concern. Not to me or to many of the countries of the region, who view Iran as a source of a great deal of aggression. To what extent were you able to convince the Chinese of your assessment? They plainly don’t see Iran as destabilizing factor but rather as a stabilizing factor. Time will tell. But I have not changed my mind. What benefits do you see Israel reaping from the innovative strategic partnership with China that was announced on Tuesday? ‘Every part of life, every area of human affairs, is now being technologized. This is what Israel specializes in’ It’s a remarkable announcement. It gives Israel a unique position. As President Xi himself said, this particular designation applies only to Israel, and to Israel only. And it shows the primacy of Israel’s position in innovation. We’re a small country. We could fit twice, or maybe even more, into Beijing or Shanghai, in terms of population. But we have a predominance in many areas of technology that are changing the lives of people. We have [expertise in] such areas as water, digital health, cybersecurity, agriculture. Israel is renowned, precisely as President Xi said, as a leader in technology. In many of these areas, we can have a very fruitful cooperation between Israeli technology and Chinese marketing and industrial power. In fact, I would say, and I recognize now a clear understanding of this in the leadership of China, that once you’ve established basic infrastructure — roads, utilities, factories — the way that you can sustain growth is only by consistently adding value to your products and services. The only way to do that, beyond a certain point, is with the addition of technology. Every part of life, every area of human affairs, is now being technologized. This is what Israel specializes in. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (third from left) meets with Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich (to his left) and Mobileye founders Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram , respectively first left and first right (Courtesy: Haim Zach, GPO) We had a lengthy discussion over a very fruitful dinner about the changes that are happening for example in the car industry. China has a 100 million cars. There’s a problem of congestion. Road accidents. Air pollution. The new automotive technology — autonomous vehicles — and the computer networking makes driving a lot more efficient. All of that is changing with new technology, a lot of which emanates from Israel. Intel just bought an Israeli company [MobilEye] for $15 billion that deals with driverless car technology. But there are hundreds of other such companies in Israel. So it’s become a world leader in this effort. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) walks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Monday, March 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) China is a classic, perhaps the preeminent country, that could apply this technology for the benefit of its people. Fewer road accidents. Less pollution. And you get more quickly to your destination, without the need to spend exorbitant amounts of money on a clumsy car that costs a bundle and is 95 percent of the time idle. These changes are all the products of technology. So it’s one of the areas that we spoke about. We also spoke at great length about digital health, which means for example that the medical records of all Chinese citizens could be computerized so that every time you go to a different hospital you don’t have to go through the whole battery of tests to establish your medical record. We in Israel have a computerized card, so that’s not necessary. You can go to any doctor, anywhere, and he knows instantly your medical record; what medicines you need, what medicines you should avoid. This is a tremendous saving and a tremendous improvement in health.

The risky move, part gamble and part threat, was presented to GOP lawmakers behind closed doors Thursday night after a long and intense day that saw a planned vote on the health care bill scrapped as the legislation remained short of votes amid cascading negotiations among conservative lawmakers, moderates and others. At the end of it the president had had enough and was ready to vote and move on, whatever the result, Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers. "'Negotiations are over, we'd like to vote tomorrow and let's get this done for the American people.' That was it," Rep. Duncan Hunter of California said as he left the meeting, summarizing Mulvaney's message to lawmakers. "Let's vote," White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said as he walked out. ___ Analysis: Trump the dealmaker struggles to seal the deal WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump often points to his best-selling book, "The Art of the Deal," as proof of his persuasive powers. But his deal-making abilities are being put to the ultimate test. House Republican leaders announced Thursday they would delay a planned vote on the GOP-backed health care bill embraced by Trump, placing the legislation on the brink of failure and jeopardizing the new president's vow to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's health care law. In the weeks leading up to Thursday, Trump did his best to arm-twist resistant conservatives and moderates opposed to the legislation. He revived his campaign rallies to remind the voters, and their representatives, of the GOP's promises. He invited Republican lawmakers to the White House, having his advisers join them for bowling and pizza nights and cajoling them over the phone. Famous for his lack of sleep, the president called lawmakers late into the night Wednesday in search of votes. On Thursday, the president met with the hard-line House Freedom Caucus at the White House - but the lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill without a deal. White House officials met with House Republicans on Capitol Hill Thursday night and a vote on the proposal was expected Friday. Trump dismissed the deadlock as pure "politics." But, even allies noted, politics is his new business and he may still have a learning curve. ___ 10 Things to Know for Friday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Friday: 1. WHITE HOUSE: TIME FOR TALK HAS PASSED Abandoning negotiations, Trump demands a make-or-break vote on health care legislation in the House, threatening to leave "Obamacare" in place and move on to other issues if Friday's vote fails. 2. AUTHORITIES ID UK ATTACKER The 52-year-old Briton who was shot dead during the rampage near Parliament had a long criminal record and once was investigated for extremism - but was not on a terror watch list. ___ South Korean divers remove dangling ramp from sunken ferry SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - South Korean efforts to bring a sunken, 6,800-ton ferry back to land cleared an obstacle on Friday after divers cut off a vehicle ramp that had been dangling from the ship and hindering efforts to raise it. Removing the ramp will allow workers to raise the ferry to a height where it can be loaded onto a semi-submersible transport vessel for transportation to a port. More than 300 people - most of whom were students on a high school trip - died when the Sewol sank on April 16, 2014, touching off an outpouring of national grief and soul searching about long-ignored public safety and regulatory failures. Public outrage over what was seen as a botched rescue job by the government contributed to the recent ouster of Park Geun-hye as president. Salvage crews plan to raise the Sewol until its upper side is about 13 meters (42 feet) above the water's surface so that it can be loaded onto the transport vessel about a mile away. It was just short of that height early Friday, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. It would not have been possible to fit the ferry into the transport vessel with the ramp hanging down, and a government official says removing it should give workers enough time to load the ferry by midnight Friday. ___ London defiant as IS claims attack by British ex-con, 52 LONDON (AP) - Authorities on Thursday identified a 52-year-old Briton as the man who mowed down pedestrians and stabbed a policeman to death outside Parliament in London, saying he had a long criminal record and once was investigated for extremism - but was not currently on a terrorism watch list. As millions of Londoners returned to work a day after a rampage that killed four victims and injured at least 30, British Prime Minister Theresa May had a message for other attackers: "We are not afraid." "Today we meet as normal - as generations have done before us, and as future generations will continue to do," she said to lawmakers' cheers in the House of Commons. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which police said was carried out by Khalid Masood, a U.K.-born resident of the West Midlands in central England. Masood plowed a rented SUV into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, killing an American man and a British woman and injuring more than 30 people of almost a dozen nationalities. He then fatally stabbed a policeman inside the gates of Parliament before being shot to death by an officer. A 75-year-old victim on the bridge died late Thursday of his wounds, police said. ___ Iraqi-American composer musically translates wartime letters DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) - Rahim AlHaj cried every time he read the letters of eight Iraqis sharing personal, harrowing tales of love, loss and hope in wartime since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Rather than retreat, the Iraqi-American composer and musician immersed himself in the stories and emerged with a collection of songs to illustrate them. AlHaj is touring the United States in support of the resulting album, "Letters from Iraq," which is set to be officially released next month on the Smithsonian Folkways label. "I felt obligated to make these stories," he told The Associated Press during a phone interview from the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, where he will perform Friday at the Arab American National Museum. "It has to be heard - it has to be seen. ... This is what the Iraqi people went through during that time period." For AlHaj, who plays a stringed instrument with ancient Iraqi roots called the oud, the tears still fall when he recounts the stories behind the music. One is about a teenage boy who was returning home when a car bomb exploded and leveled his home, sending his homing pigeons skyward with nowhere to land and destroying the alibi that allowed him to see his girlfriend while he cared for his birds and she hung laundry. Another is of a man who returns to Baghdad after living in exile - and finding a place that no longer feels like home. Then, there is the letter written by AlHaj's nephew, Fuad, who inspired and encouraged the musical project. Then a teenager, Fuad was getting a haircut at a barbershop when a bomb went off nearby and militants opened fire. Fuad, who could not run because his legs never fully developed, detailed the horror and carnage around him. He ends by writing, paradoxically, what a beautiful day it had been. ___ Maryland high school thrust into immigration debate BETHESDA, Md. (AP) - A Maryland high school has been thrust into the national immigration debate after a 14-year-old student said she was raped in a bathroom there by two classmates, including one who authorities said came to the U.S. illegally from Central America. Protesters on both sides of the debate converged on a nearby elementary school Thursday during a visit by U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. And the White House has weighed in, saying the president has made a crackdown on illegal immigration a priority "because of tragedies like this." The Montgomery County school system has been besieged by hundreds of racist and xenophobic calls. In response, schools beefed up police presence in an attempt to reassure the anxious community. "Now we're starting to receive calls that are threatening, saying they're going to shoot up the illegals in our school," said Derek Turner, a school system spokesman. He noted that the calls marked "a whole new level of vitriol that we haven't seen before." The latest flashpoint in the immigration debate started out as a sexual assault case. Last Friday, 18-year-old Henry Sanchez and 17-year-old Jose Montano were charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. ___ Israel arrests hacker linked to threats on US Jewish centers JERUSALEM (AP) - A 19-year-old American-Israeli Jew was arrested Thursday as the prime suspect in a wave of bomb threats against U.S. Jewish community centers, a startling turn in a case that had stoked fears of rising anti-Semitism in the United States. The surprising arrest of the man, a hacker who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, came after a trans-Atlantic investigation with the FBI and other international law enforcement agencies. U.S. Jewish groups welcomed the breakthrough in the case, which had drawn condemnation from President Donald Trump. Israeli police described the suspect as a hacker, but said his motives were still unclear. "He's the guy who was behind the JCC threats," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said, referring to the scores of anonymous threats phoned in to Jewish community centers in the U.S. over the past two months. Police banned publication of his name, but said he was a dual citizen and would remain in custody until at least March 30. During the arrest raid, they said he tried to grab an officer's gun but was stopped by another officer. ___ Utah getting toughest drunken driving limit in the US SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Utah's governor signed legislation Thursday giving the predominantly Mormon state the strictest drunken driving threshold in the country, a change that restaurant groups and representatives of the ski and snowboard industry say will hurt tourism. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said lowering the blood alcohol limit for most drivers to 0.05 percent from 0.08 percent will save lives. The change means a 150-pound man would be over the 0.05 limit after two beers, while a 120-pound woman could exceed it after a single drink, though that can be affected by a number of factors, including how much food a person has eaten, according to the American Beverage Institute, a national restaurant group. Opponents, including the group, had urged Herbert to veto the bill , saying it would punish responsible drinkers and burnish Utah's reputation as a Mormon-centric place unfriendly to those who drink alcohol. "People are going to try to say this is a religious issue. And that is just absolutely false. This is a public safety issue," the governor, who is Mormon, said at a news conference. ___ 1-seeds Kansas, Gonzaga top Thursday's NCAA Sweet 16 slate KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Top seeds Gonzaga and Kansas are among the teams preparing to play in Thursday's Sweet 16 games of the NCAA Tournament. The Jayhawks are the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region, which holds its semifinals in Kansas City, Missouri. The Jayhawks will face fourth-seeded Purdue, while No. 3 seed Oregon meets surging 7-seed Michigan in the region's other game. Gonzaga tops the West bracket and faces No. 4 seed West Virginia in games set for San Jose, California. The other regional semifinal features No. 2 seed Arizona and 11-seed Xavier, the lowest-seeded team left in the field. The winner of Thursday's games advance to the Elite Eight and will play Saturday for a trip to the Final Four. ___ Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

John McCain said Wednesday that a special committee was needed to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials because the House Intelligence Committee lost "the credibility to handle this alone." The Senate Armed Services Chairman was highly critical of the public feuding between House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, and ranking Democratic member Rep. Adam Schiff, who traded explosive statements Wednesday regarding their panel's investigation into Trump-Russia ties. Story Continued Below "It's a bizarre situation," the Arizona Republican senator, speaking to MSNBC's Greta Van Susteren, said of the ongoing probe. "I think that this back and forth and what the American people have found so far is that no longer does Congress have the credibility to handle this alone." The topic burst into the limelight earlier Wednesday when Nunes (R-Calif.) declared that Trump transition officials, and potentially President Donald Trump himself, had been inadvertently brought under surveillance following the president's victory in November. Schiff (D-Calif.) panned the comments during a press conference later Wednesday, questioning their legitimacy and Nunes' decision-making. Schiff questions if Nunes is acting as ‘surrogate of the White House’ By Madeline Conway “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both,” Schiff said. McCain, however, said both men had erred in their statements, while stressing that he did not feel Russia achieved their goal of "affecting the outcome" of the 2016 election. "There is no substantiation for what Chairman Nunes said, nor is there substantiation for what Congressman Schiff said," McCain added. In an interview Thursday on the "Today" show, McCain reiterated that Nunes' public statements were highly unusual. "I have not seen anything like it, and it’s very disturbing," McCain said.

Ted Lieu scorches Trump for hoping Obamacare ‘explodes’ Kayleigh McEnany smacked down after claiming other CNN panelists are hypocrites about surveillance laws Elizabeth Preza 22 Mar 2017 at 22:43 ET                    CNN Panel Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory A CNN Panel on Wednesday smacked down Kayleigh McEnany as she tried to claim her fellow panelists don’t care about the Fourth Amendment. The panel was discussing House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes’ (R-CA) decision to go directly to the White House and make a public statement with new information indicating Donald Trump’s associates may have been “incidentally” surveilled. Kirsten Powers suggested Nunes’ behavior was “a little shady” considering the chairman shared the information with Trump prior to informing the House Intelligence Committee or ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), arguing he would have “had more credibility had he done that.” “This really calls into serious question the objectivity and the independence of this Congressional investigation,” Daily Beast reporter Matt Lewis said, noting Nunes “unilaterally” decided to approach Trump first with the new information. “It creates the appearance of impropriety,” Lewis added. McEnany chimed in, arguing Lewis and Powers were “missing the forrest for the trees,” because “U.S. citizens were spied on”—a point immediately refuted by the panel. “Maybe you guys don’t think that Fourth Amendment rights apply to people who have a ‘R’ behind their name, but they certainly do,” McEnany said, calling the left “hypocritical” for not caring about the government “spying” on Americans. Christine Quinn immediately smacked down her CNN colleague, pointing out that she had the facts totally wrong. After a heated back and forth, McEnany tried to corner her fellow panel members. “Maybe this panel does not know about the Fourth Amendment rights in this county,” she began. “You’re not outraged over the fact that [Nunes] went to the White House … and you also keep saying that Americans were being spied on and that’s not what happened,” Powers said. “They were unmasked,” McEnany retorted. “That’s not spying!” Powers shot back. “We have laws in this country,” McEnany started again, before Powers cut her off. “Kayleigh, seriously you really need to stop with telling us that we don’t care about the laws,” Powers said.

Live Watch Trump continues defense of 'wiretap' claims through Twitter By Adam Kelsey Close Follow on Twitter More from Adam Mar 22, 2017, 10:19 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJim Lo Scalzo/Pool Image via AP WATCH President Trump feels 'somewhat' vindicated by intelligence announcement 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump continued his defense Wednesday evening of his unsubstantiated claim that he was "wiretapped" by former President Barack Obama in a series of retweets from his @realDonaldTrump account. In back-to-back posts, Trump retweeted conservative radio host Bill Mitchell, an outspoken Trump supporter, who earlier tweeted about an assertion by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., that information about Trump associates was “incidentally collected” by the intelligence community. House intel chair says Trump transition team 'incidentally' surveilled Top Dem says evidence 'more' than circumstantial in Russia probe In the first, Mitchell links to a story by the conservative outlet Gateway Pundit -- a blog that has previously perpetuated conspiracy theories and published factually incorrect information -- that carries the headline, "BOOM=> House Intel Chair: We Cannot Rule Out That Sr. Obama Officials Were Involved in Trump Surveillance." The piece discusses Nunes' comments. EXACTLY AS I SAID - House Intel Chair: We Cannot Rule Out Sr. Obama Officials Were Involved in Trump Surveillance https://t.co/ernZeDQIfy— Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) March 23, 2017 Specifically highlighted in the article is Nunes' claim that the involvement of "senior Obama administration officials" in surveillance cannot be ruled out. The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, D-Calif., blasted Nunes' announcement today. "The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the white house because he cannot do both," Schiff said today. "And unfortunately I think the actions of today throw great doubt into the ability of both the chairman and the committee to conduct the investigation the way it ought to be conducted." Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team, working on the executive committee. Trump's tweets over two weeks ago specifically accused former President Barack Obama of involvement in "wiretapping." The White House has since maintained that Trump was referring to surveillance in broader terms than just wiretapping. The second retweet, again of Mitchell, is the radio hosts proclamation that "Trump always ends up being right." Trump always ends up being right. It's almost a little freaky.— Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) March 22, 2017 "It's almost a little freaky," tweeted Mitchell, himself a promoter of conspiracy theories such as "Pizzagate." Asked, following Nunes' remarks whether he felt "vindicated" by the information, Trump told reporters he "somewhat" did and "very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found." At no point in Nunes' statement to the press did the congressman definitively confirm an effort to surveil Trump or campaign officials involving the prior administration, nor did he provide evidence to support his claims. Last week, Nunes said, "We don't have any evidence that that took place... I don't think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower." FBI Director James Comey rebuffed Trump's claims in congressional testimony: "No individual in the United States can direct electronic surveillance of anyone," he said. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Trump continues defense of 'wiretap' claims " Book excerpt: Roger Stone's 'The Making of the President 2016' " 'No conversation' happening on replacing Speaker Paul Ryan: House Freedom Caucus chair " Trump shifts blame to conservatives on failure of health care bill " New EPA chief slams Paris climate pact as 'a bad deal' " 'This Week' Transcript 3-26-17: Sen.

In quick succession, Trump twice retweeted Mitchell, a radio host who became notorious on social media for his vocal support of Trump and for predicting his win. "Trump always ends up being right. It's almost a little freaky," Mitchell tweeted, a post that was shared by Trump. President Trump is retweeting Bill Mitchell who's tweeting links from The Gateway Pundit ... and ... pic.twitter.com/8Q3tFxYdiB— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 23, 2017 The president also retweeted Mitchell's share of a link to a Gateway Pundit article titled: "BOOM=>House Intel Chair: We Cannot Rule Out Sr. Obama Officials Were Involved in Trump Surveillance." The tweets follows House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes's revelation to reporters earlier Wednesday that he had learned from a source that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of Trump’s transition team and then “widely disseminated” the information internally. The Gateway Pundit post includes a clip of a reporter asking Nunes if he can "rule out the possibility that senior Obama administration officials were involved," to which the Intel chairman responds: "No, we can not." Nunes said Wednesday it wasn't clear whether intel on Trump himself was collected as intelligence agencies surveilled foreign actors. And he reiterated that there is still no evidence that Trump was wiretapped by President Obama or anyone else, as Trump had alleged. "I said the day after or two days later to all of you that I was quite confident that President Obama did not order a wiretap on Trump Tower," Nunes said on CNN Wednesday. "However, I have said for a long time that I was worried about incidental collection because we knew that was already an issue."    View the discussion thread.

Five people were killed, including the assailant, and 40 others were injured in what Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as a "sick and depraved terrorist attack." Lawmakers, lords, staff and visitors were locked down after the man was shot by police within the perimeter of Parliament, just yards (meters) from entrances to the building itself and in the shadow of the iconic Big Ben clock tower. He died, as did three pedestrians on the bridge, and the police officer. A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had "catastrophic" injuries. Three police officers, several French teenagers on a school trip, two Romanian tourists and five South Korean visitors were among the injured. Police said they were treating the attack as terrorism. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley said police believed there was only one attacker, "but it would be foolish to be overconfident early on." He said an unarmed policeman, three civilians and the attacker died. Forty others, including three police officers, were injured. ___ AP Exclusive: Before Trump job, Manafort worked to aid Putin WASHINGTON (AP) — Before signing up with Donald Trump, former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to "greatly benefit the Putin Government," The Associated Press has learned. The White House attempted to brush the report aside Wednesday, but it quickly raised fresh alarms in Congress about Russian links to Trump associates. Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit President Vladimir Putin's government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. "We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success," Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, "will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that President Trump had not been aware of Manafort's work on behalf of Deripaska. ___ Manafort has served top US pols and a sketchy cast abroad WASHINGTON (AP) — Pick any decade over the past half-century, and Paul Manafort has had a starring role in the rise (and maybe fall) of somebody big. This lobbyist/political operative/hired gun has been there for prominent American politicians including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, George H.W. Bush and, more recently, Donald Trump. He's also been at the service of a global cast of sketchier characters like Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and, more recently, leaders of Ukraine's ruling pro-Russian political party. Manafort, 67, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Manafort also represented a Russian billionaire a decade ago with the goal of advancing the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The latest disclosure adds new intrigue as the FBI investigates whether Russia attempted to influence last year's U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, and whether the Trump campaign cooperated in such an endeavor. ___ Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe WASHINGTON (AP) — Private communications of Donald Trump and his presidential transition team may have been scooped up by American intelligence officials monitoring other targets and improperly distributed throughout spy agencies, the chairman of the House intelligence committee said Wednesday — an extraordinary public airing of often-secret information that brought swift protests from Democrats. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes' comments led the committee's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, to renew his party's calls for an independent probe of Trump campaign links to Russia in addition to the GOP-led panel's investigation. Schiff also said he had seen "more than circumstantial evidence" that Trump associates colluded with Russia. In back-to-back news conferences at the Capitol and then the White House — where he had privately briefed the president — Nunes said he was concerned by officials' handling of the communications in the waning days of the Obama administration. He said the surveillance was conducted legally and did not appear to be related to the current FBI investigation into Trump associates' contacts with Russia or with any criminal warrants. And the revelations, he said, did nothing to change his assessment that Trump's explosive allegations about wiretaps at Trump Tower were false. Still, the White House immediately seized on his statements in what appeared to be a coordinated public display. ___ Gorsuch to Democrats: No return to 'horse and buggy' era WASHINGTON (AP) — Assured of support from majority Republicans, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch wrapped up two days of Senate questioning Wednesday to glowing GOP reviews but complaints from frustrated Democrats that he concealed his views from the American public. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, refused repeated attempts to get him to talk about key legal and political issues of the day. But he did tell Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who worried that Gorsuch would vote to restrict abortion, that "no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days." The Supreme Court itself threw one surprise Gorsuch's way when it ruled unanimously Wednesday in a case involving learning-disabled students, overturning a standard for special education that Gorsuch had endorsed in an earlier case on the same topic. The decision prompted sharp questioning from committee Democrats in the second of two days of testimony that spanned 20 hours. "Why in your early decision did you want to lower the bar so low?" Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois asked. ___ Facebook rape stirs questions about witnessing crimes online CHICAGO (AP) — The case of a 15-year-old Chicago girl who authorities say was raped while around 40 people watched on Facebook raises questions that have come up before in other attacks: What's the obligation of bystanders who see a crime unfolding? And why do they not intervene? None of those who watched the sexual assault involving five or six men or boys called police. The girl knows at least one of her attackers, and investigators reported making good progress toward identifying the others. A closer look at what laws in the United States say about people who witness crimes: ___ THE LAW IN GENERAL There is no all-encompassing legal obligation in the United States that a bystander who sees an act of violence must intervene or call police. But there are exceptions to that idea, dubbed the no-duty rule. Many states have laws requiring intervention when the victim of an ongoing attack is a child. The relationship of the witness to the victim is also a factor in assessing criminal or civil liability: Bosses may have a duty to intervene on behalf of employees, teachers for students and spouses for spouses. ___ Leaders need votes for health bill on eve of House showdown WASHINGTON (AP) — The top Republican legislative priority in peril, President Donald Trump dangled possible changes to the health care bill Wednesday aimed at placating conservatives threatening to torpedo the legislation. The White House seemed to make progress after GOP opposition had snowballed a day before a showdown House vote. Trump huddled at the White House with 18 lawmakers, a mix of supporters and opponents, Vice President Mike Pence saw around two dozen and House GOP leaders held countless talks with lawmakers at the Capitol. The sessions came as leaders rummaged for votes on a roll call they can ill-afford to lose without diminishing their clout for the rest of the GOP agenda. Most GOP opponents were conservatives asserting that the legislation demolishing former President Barack Obama's health care law did not go far enough. They were demanding repeal of the law's requirements that insurers pay for specified services like maternity care, prescription drugs and substances abuse treatment. Late Wednesday night, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., met with moderate Republicans from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maine and New York as well as members of leadership. Any changes on essential health benefits would likely trigger an immediate backlash from patient advocacy groups and doctors. In early meetings with Trump and Pence and later discussions with the White House, talks focused on language addressing conservatives' concerns that those coverage requirements drive up premiums. Details were unclear, but members of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-line group spearheading the opposition, were expected at the White House early Thursday. ___ Police: White sword killer went to NY to attack black people NEW YORK (AP) — A white U.S. Army veteran from Baltimore bent on making a racist attack took a bus to New York, the "media capital of the world," randomly picked out a black man who was collecting bottles on the street and killed him with a sword, police said Wednesday. James Harris Jackson turned himself in at a Times Square police station early Wednesday, about 25 hours after Timothy Caughman staggered into a police precinct bleeding to death. "I'm the person that you're looking for," Jackson told police, according to Assistant Chief William Aubrey. Jackson, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, told police he'd harbored feelings of hatred toward black men for at least 10 years, authorities said. He traveled to New York on March 17 and had been staying in a Manhattan hotel. "The reason he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement," Aubrey said. ___ LAPD: Latinos report fewer sex crimes amid immigration fears LOS ANGELES (AP) — The police chief of Los Angeles, a city that is half Latino, found himself in the middle of the national immigration debate on Wednesday after saying there's a correlation between the Trump administration's call for stiffer immigration policies and a drop in the number of Hispanics reporting sexual abuse and domestic violence. "Imagine your sister, your mother, not reporting a sexual assault for fear that their family will be torn apart," LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday. Since the beginning of this year, sexual assaults reported by Latinos in Los Angeles have dropped 25 percent, and domestic violence reports by Latinos have decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year. Crime statistics show there were 164 sexual assaults reported by Latinos in the first two months of 2016, compared to 123 in the first two months of 2017. There was also a decrease of 118 reports of domestic violence during the same periods among Latinos. Beck said there was a "strong correlation" between the timing of the decreased reporting and fears about President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S. ___ Serial numbers, game photos may help verify Brady jerseys BOSTON (AP) — Now that authorities believe they have recovered the jersey stolen from Tom Brady's locker following the Patriots' Super Bowl win last month, the next step will be determining whether it is in fact the MVP quarterback's missing grass-stained garment. So how exactly does that happen? Old-fashioned detective work. Experts in the sports memorabilia industry, including one that has worked directly with NFL teams, say it is a tedious process that involves comparing photos and videos that captured degradation to the jersey during the game. They also compare the jersey to team-issued serial numbers and other player-specific customizations that authentic jerseys typically have. "Every jersey is like a fingerprint. No two jerseys are alike," said Barry Meisel, president of the MeiGray Group, which has authenticated game-worn sports memorabilia since 1997. "They're hand-stitched, full of dirt, mud, helmet stains, turf skids and burns. When you look at jersey after a game it's unique."

ADVERTISEMENT In nearly 20 hours of grilling over the course of two days, Gorsuch declined to answer questions on issues ranging from the Second Amendment, to President Trump’s authority to defy congressional bans on warrantless wiretapping and enhanced interrogation, to whether the constitutional ban on accepting gifts from foreign powers would apply to the president’s real-estate empire. The strategy left Senate Democrats frustrated as they repeatedly failed to draw out answers on hot-button political issues. But Gorsuch’s strategy may backfire — Democrats are beginning to point to his lack of candor and transparency as a potential reason to filibuster his nomination. “He looked like he was playing dodgeball with the Senate Judiciary Committee, bending over backwards to avoid revealing anything that might constitute a judicial philosophy or give hints about how he’d approach the legal issues of our day,” Senate Democratic Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerDem to Trump: 'You truly are an evil man' Dem senator: GOP controls all of gov't, so success or failure is on them Trump tweets: We’ll put together a great plan after Obamacare explodes MORE (N.Y.) said from the floor Wednesday. While Supreme Court nominees going back to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 have drawn a line against sharing personal views on legal issues to avoid the appearance of prejudice in future cases, Gorsuch took it to a new level this week. Supreme Court nominees have become increasingly cautious in their testimony to the Senate since Robert Bork’s unguarded and candid remarks before the Judiciary Committee helped sink his nomination in 1987. Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to set a new standard for blandness 11 years ago that Gorsuch now seems to have surpassed.  He refused to comment on his personal views of three landmark cases: Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned school segregation; Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right of married couples to use contraception; and Eisenstadt v. Baird, which established the right of unmarried couples to use contraception. When Sen. Richard BlumenthalRichard BlumenthalSenators introduce new Iran sanctions Senators demand Pentagon action after nude photo scandal Gorsuch rewrites playbook for confirmation hearings MORE (D-Conn.) asked Tuesday if Gorsuch agreed with the result of Brown v. Board of Education, the nominee would only say it’s “a correct application of the law of precedent.” But more than 10 years ago, when the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) asked Roberts whether he agreed with the court’s conclusion in that case, Roberts unequivocally responded, “I do.” And in 2010, Elena Kagan, a nominee under President Obama, warmly embraced the Brown v. Board of Education decision. “I hope and I know that the principles of Brown v. Board are still relevant today,” Kagan told the Judiciary panel at the time. “The idea of equality under law is a fundamental American constitutional value.” Blumenthal continued to press Gorsuch during a second round of questioning Wednesday on the landmark desegregation decision, demanding to know, “Why will you not say you agree with the result?” Gorsuch finally relented, saying, “We’re on the same page on Brown v. Board of Education, senator. It’s a great and important decision.” He also criticized the court’s 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the doctrine of “separate but equal” and was overturned by Brown, as “a dark, dark stain” on the court’s history. Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne FeinsteinDems get it wrong: 'Originalism' is mainstream, even for liberal judges Human rights leaders warn against confirming Gorsuch Feinstein sees slipping support among California voters: poll MORE (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she doesn’t understand why Gorsuch would criticize Plessy but not endorse Brown, labeling him less forthcoming than other recent nominees. “You can carry that too far,” she warned. She argued that speaking about his judicial philosophy “would help people understand that he is open for the ability for growth to happen in the law.” At least one Republican said he, too, wanted Gorsuch to share his thoughts on specific cases.  “Some have criticized my friends on the other side for asking you how you would rule in specific cases, and I don’t think that’s an appropriate question,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. “But if I’m going to be honest, I have to say I’d love to know the answer to that, too, because we live in a real world.”  Kennedy said a number of his constituents voted for Trump because of the type of judge he promised to name to the Supreme Court. If Gorsuch is confirmed and starts siding with the more liberal members of the court, Kennedy said those voters won’t be pleased. “I don’t want the fact that I’m still asking you questions to be misunderstood, but this is a big deal,” he said.  Other Republicans, however, said Democrats were demanding answers from Gorsuch that they did not seek from nominees of past Democratic presidents. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group running a $10 million advertising campaign in support of Gorsuch, seized on that and has launched a video highlighting 70 times Ginsburg, who was nominated by President Clinton, declined to answer questions. Panel Republicans argued that it would be wholly improper for Gorsuch to reveal any personal views. “If we’re going to vote against a nominee because they won’t tell us things that we want to hear about issues important to us, then the whole nominating process has become a joke,” Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey GrahamGraham: 'I'm glad' Ivanka will be working in the White House Trump tweets promotion for Fox News show GOP senators pitch alternatives after House pulls ObamaCare repeal bill MORE (R-S.C.) argued. But Gorsuch’s strategy may become a liability with Democrats as Republican leaders try to round up the needed votes. Senate Democratic Whip Dick DurbinDick DurbinThe Hill’s Whip List: Where Dems stand on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch rewrites playbook for confirmation hearings Gorsuch: I'm 'sorry' for ruling against autistic student MORE (Ill.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CNN on Wednesday that “we have no idea where Judge Gorsuch is on Roe v. Wade, on women’s healthcare and critical issues.” When asked if he agreed with the result of Griswold and Eisenstadt, Gorsuch said those cases have “been settled for 50 years” and he did not “see a realistic possibility that a state would pass a law attempting to undo that.” But when asked simply if he agrees with the results, Gorsuch would only say: “I give you the same answer.” But a decade ago, Roberts said he agreed with the court’s conclusion in Griswold. And Justice Samuel Alito similarly told the Judiciary Committee that there is a constitutional basis for the finding in Griswold and explained he felt “an ability to comment” because the right to contraception was unlikely to be relitigated. Alito plainly said 10 years ago, “I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt.” Gorsuch further declined to personally embrace the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas that struck down laws that made sex between gay couples illegal, only acknowledging it as “the precedent of the United States Supreme Court.” Blumenthal said those answers leave doubt in a lot of minds. “Your declining to be more direct and give the same answer about these cases as you did Brown leaves doubt in the minds of millions of Americans that rely on privacy rights,” he warned. Gorsuch argued that stating agreement with even a widely accepted decision would trample on his impartiality as a judge. “My personal views have nothing to do with my job as a judge,” he said, his voice rising as he debated with Blumenthal. “I’ve drawn a line that I think is required of a good judge to be fair and respect the separation of powers,” he added.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said he had learned from a source that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of Trump’s transition team and then “widely disseminated” the information internally. ADVERTISEMENT Democrats on the committee were blindsided, as were many Republicans. By the end of the day Wednesday, Nunes was still the only committee member to have seen the intelligence in question, according to the committee’s top Democrat. The move outraged Democrats and threatened to plunge the committee into open partisan warfare. “The unprecedented comments of Chairman Nunes are an act of diversion and desperation,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “The Chairman’s highly irregular conduct with the White House raises serious questions about his impartiality, especially given his history as part of the Trump Transition team. “Chairman Nunes is deeply compromised, and he cannot possibly lead an honest investigation.” Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team’s executive committee and has in the past raised eyebrows with his apparent willingness to follow White House requests. In February, Nunes agreed to a White House request to call a reporter to dispute a report that the FBI had uncovered contact between Russian officials and the president’s campaign. He had already made a similar statement publicly. Nunes defended his decision to go directly to the president with the information because “what I saw has nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with the Russia investigation.” “It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities, and the president needs to know that these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that,” Nunes said. But alleged surveillance of the Trump campaign became part of the committee’s investigation after the president’s claim early this month that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower — making Nunes’s decision to cut out members of his own committee unusual. Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: Nunes needs to decide if he wants to lead a credible investigation on Russia Sunday shows preview: Aftermath of failed healthcare bill Schiff urges Trump to avoid baseless accusations MORE (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said Nunes’s action “impedes our ability to do this investigation the way we should.”  “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or if he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House — because he cannot do both,” Schiff said. “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman,” MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted. The exact nature of Nunes’s pronouncement remains unclear. Yet it closely tracks with the longstanding contention of Republicans that the “real story” when it comes to the Russia investigation is the “unmasking” of individuals caught in surveillance and the leaks of sensitive information to the press. Nunes, who described himself as “alarmed” by what he had learned, said that the collection had been perfectly legal — but raised questions about who requested that the names of Trump associates be “unmasked.” Under U.S. surveillance law, intelligence agencies may legally use information gathered on Americans as long as it is intercepted “incidentally” — meaning that the U.S. person is not the target of the surveillance.  But personally identifying information is supposed to be hidden to protect the identities of U.S persons, unless officials request that those names be exposed internally.   During a marathon public hearing Monday on the Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, Republicans repeatedly pressed FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers on who has that authority. In one exchange, Rep. Trey GowdyTrey GowdyGowdy: Nunes briefed president on matters 'unrelated' to Russia probe Sunday shows preview: Aftermath of failed healthcare bill Has Putin already won? He divides US intel from political leaders MORE (R-S.C.) ran through a list of senior Obama administration officials, demanding to know if they had access to unmasked names — appearing to suggest that they may have been the source of media leaks about the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. Democrats have tolerated the Republican focus on leaks — but that patience may be short-lived after Wednesday. Last week, Nunes and Schiff together said that they were pressing the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency for information on Trump associates who may have been incidentally spied on and whose names were later unmasked and the intelligence details leaked to the media — such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But on Wednesday afternoon, committee member Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) called Nunes’s announcement “political theater.” Some committee Republicans backed the beleaguered chair. Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) told reporters that the discovery “raises very serious questions” about the unmasking and dissemination of names. According to Nunes, the intercepted communications had “little or no apparent foreign intelligence value” and had nothing to do with either Russia or the FBI’s eight-month-old probe into coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both Nunes and Schiff maintained that the discovery — whatever it entails — does not substantiate the president’s claim that Obama wiretapped him.  Trump said Wednesday that he felt “somewhat vindicated” by Nunes’s statement.  The White House has tried to argue that Trump meant “wiretap” as in surveillance generally, though Republicans and Democrats have largely rejected that assertion. Comey on Monday rebutted those claims, part of a one-two blow to the White House that day. He also confirmed the FBI’s investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.  The timing of Nunes’s announcement did not escape Democrats.  “I’m not sure what the point of this extraordinary process is and I have to hope this is not a part of a broader campaign by the White House aimed to deflect from the director’s testimony earlier this week,” Schiff said.

Devin Nunes: WATCH PreviousPrevious StoryTrump Has a ‘Shadow Government’ of Appointees to Watch Cabinet Officials NextNext StoryBlondie Releases ‘Long Time’, Written by Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes: LISTEN by Andy Towle March 22, 2017 | 8:34pm Share242 Comments The FBI is getting a clearer picture of information that indicates that associates of Donald Trump coordinated with Russian during the 2016 campaign, CNN reports: This is partly what FBI Director James Comey was referring to when he made a bombshell announcement Monday before Congress that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, according to one source. The FBI is now reviewing that information, which includes human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings, according to those U.S. officials. The information is raising the suspicions of FBI counterintelligence investigators that the coordination may have taken place, though officials cautioned that the information was not conclusive and that the investigation is ongoing. Rep. Adam Schiff this afternoon told Chuck Todd this afternoon that the case was now “more than circumstantial:” “I can tell you that the case is more than that. And I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now. I don’t want to go into specifics, but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of investigation. So that is what we ought to do.” Schiff on collusion btw Trump associates and Russians: "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" pic.twitter.com/JvPv74ROiM — David Mack (@davidmackau) March 22, 2017 Schiff’s remarks came after a whirlwind afternoon during which his counterpart, House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes took information directly to Donald Trump — the subject of the investigation — which should have been shared with members of the intelligence committee first. Nunes then held a breathless press conference about what he did: Nunes’s shocking action shows that a credible non-partisan investigation into the connections between Trump and Russia is impossible and reveals that Nunes’s motives are purely political. Many are today reiterating calls for an independent investigation. Trump says he feels “somewhat” vindicated by Nunes: “I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found”. pic.twitter.com/PwuEaICG2q — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 22, 2017 Still unclear are the contents of the intercepts that Nunes shared with Trump. Schiff released a statement: “This afternoon, Chairman Devin Nunes announced he had some form of intercepts revealing that lawfully gathered intelligence on foreign officials included information on U.S. persons, potentially including those associated with President Trump or the president himself. If accurate, this information should have been shared with members of the committee, but it has not been. Indeed, it appears that committee members only learned about this when the chairman discussed the matter this afternoon with the press. The chairman also shared this information with the White House before providing it to the committee, another profound irregularity, given that the matter is currently under investigation. I have expressed my grave concerns with the chairman that a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way. “As to the substance of what the chairman has alleged, if the information was lawfully gathered intelligence on foreign officials, that would mean that U.S. persons would not have been the subject of surveillance. In my conversation late this afternoon, the chairman informed me that most of the names in the intercepted communications were in fact masked, but that he could still figure out the probable identity of the parties. Again, this does not indicate that there was any flaw in the procedures followed by the intelligence agencies. Moreover, the unmasking of a U.S. person’s name is fully appropriate when it is necessary to understand the context of collected foreign intelligence information. “Because the committee has still not been provided the intercepts in the possession of the chairman, it is impossible to evaluate the chairman’s claims. It certainly does not suggest — in any way — that the president was wiretapped by his predecessor.” He also spoke to CNN about Nunes’s actions. Said Schiff: “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both,” Schiff said. “Unfortunately, I think the actions of today throw great doubt into the ability of both the chairman and the committee to conduct the investigation the way it ought to be conducted.” Rep.

Here is the story from Politico: Nunes said the monitoring appeared to be done legally as a result of what’s called “incidental collection,” but said he was concerned because it was not related to the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and was widely disseminated across the intelligence community. “I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored,” Nunes told reporters. “It looks to me like it was all legally collected, but it was essentially a lot of information on the president-elect and his transition team and what they were doing.” Nunes described the surveillance as most likely being “incidental collection.” This can occur when a person inside the United States communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be kept secret — but can be “unmasked” by intelligence officials under certain circumstances. Nunes created a firestorm with this information because it led to all manner of speculation and incorrect information being bandied about on social media. Nothing helpful came from what he did, despite protests to the contrary. In the end, it looks like nothing more than Nunes giving cover to the Trump administration after the hearings on Monday went very badly for them. In that vein, here are four reasons why this little stunt by Nunes just created an even bigger mess than before. 1. There was no purpose for releasing the information in question – Nunes said it was all “legally collected.” But he also notes there was information in the reports about the transition team. Do you know who was on Trump’s transition team? Devin Nunes. Also, he held the press conference and provided the information he received without giving it to fellow members of the Intelligence Committee. That comes off as highly irresponsible on his part. Finally, the Intelligence Committee is an oversight committee. The intelligence community is headed up by the executive branch of government and yet here was the Chairman of the committee that has oversight over the executive branch, skipping off to the White House to inform the President of information he had before other members of the committee. Jeremy Bash, a former counsel to the Intelligence Committee, had this to say: Ex-House Intel counsel: Nunes briefing Trump is a “breakdown in the entire oversight process,” other committee members likely “horrified” pic.twitter.com/aRn8dB3Ia6 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 22, 2017 2. Saying the Trump team was placed under surveillance, wiretapped or spied on is not correct – Words mean something and the word “incidental” is key here. Attorney Gabriel Malor said the following: "Incidental collection" is when communications by U.S. citizens are intercepted bc they went *to* a foreign surveillance target. — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) March 22, 2017 Incidental collection under FISA sec. 702 has repeatedly been upheld as constitutional. https://t.co/11fpmdALUI — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) March 22, 2017 Trending Lo & Behold: A Replica of the Successful 2015 Obamacare Repeal Is Languishing in Committee Andrea Ruth Nunes said he didn’t see evidence anyone was conducting surveillance on the Trump team. So everybody saying, “The Trump transition team was spied on!” are not correct. Use a personal example. Say you have a friend who works in a pizzeria. You call that friend on the phone to ask about plans for the weekend. Unbeknownst to you and your friend, the owner of the pizzeria, is under a federal investigation for money laundering. Your conversation is collected as a result. It doesn’t mean you were spied on nor does it say that you were placed under surveillance. More from John Schindler: "Incidental collection" is not surveillance if you're not a SIGINT target. I've explained this too many times already. So did DIRNSA Monday. — John Schindler (@20committee) March 22, 2017 It means Team Trump was in contact with legitimate FI targets who were being monitored totally legally via SIGINT.https://t.co/0Xb9cVSrTM — John Schindler (@20committee) March 22, 2017 3. Contrary to what a lot of people are saying the “unmasking” of people in these reports is not illegal. – For those that aren’t sure, when a U.S. intelligence agency conducts surveillance of a foreigner inside the U.S., it will sometimes include the name of an American that the foreigner is speaking to or about. When it happens, analysts hide or “minimize” the name of the American in question. People all over are saying the “unmasking” of Michael Flynn was illegal. That is not true. The leaking of his name was unlawful. One national security expert and lawyer confirm the legality of unmasking. The nat/sec expert I spoke to said the following: Unmasking is a normal, if pretty rare, IC procedure….unmasking within classified channels is SOP — the LEAK was the illegal part Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institute answers the question:  “There is nothing inappropriate about unmasking when it is appropriate to unmask,” said Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. In the context of the Flynn example, Wittes said, the U.S. is surveilling a foreign target — in this case Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The target, Kislyak, is contacted by an American who is the incoming national security adviser in the new administration — Michael Flynn — and that American is discussing the future administration’s policy. Wittes says it is easy to see where identifying this American is important to foreign intelligence. “I don’t think there’s anything surprising that it got unmasked,” Wittes said. What is at issue is the leaking of the name to the public: The “unmasking” of Flynn’s name is routine, Wittes said. But, he said, sharing Flynn’s name publicly “is both shocking and inappropriate.” It is a crime to disclose or “leak” classified information. The contents of intelligence collected under the authorities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, are classified. Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak was collected under these authorities and therefore classified. Even Sean Spicer recognizes the difference. In a statement about Flynn, he said the following: “Michael Flynn was unmasked and then illegally, his identity was leaked out to media outlets,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday. 4. It gives Donald Trump and his supporters to say he was right about his screwball tweets from two weeks ago – Sure enough, when I tweeted that’s what Nunes stunt would do, I was met with “And he’s right!” replies. Naturally, Trump is not correct, but it doesn’t matter. It goes back to what I said about driving to Philadelphia. If I drove instead to Baltimore, I could say my claim was “right” because I was driving north. It is SOP for Trump make an outrageous claim and then claim vindication when some entirely unrelated information is tied back to what he said. It’s garbage. Bradley Moss, an attorney, specializing in national security issues tweeted the following: The number of people in my TL right now saying Trump's claims were accurate is astounding. His accusations were way off mark. — Bradley P. Moss, Esq (@BradMossEsq) March 22, 2017 This charade will continue until there is an independent investigation carried out. What Nunes did was a disgrace and an embarrassment to the Republican Party. What he did was not in the best interests of the public but the best interest of Donald Trump.

The EliteBooks from the 800-series are premium business notebooks from HP. There are two more expensive EliteBooks with the additional Folio designation , but they have a bigger focus on the mobility. The EliteBook 840 with its 14-inch display is already the fourth generation , but there are only minor changes compared to the previous EliteBook 840 G3. More precisely: You only get a new processor from Intel’s current Kaby Lake generation. Our test model carries the designation Z2V49ET ABD and is a mainstream model from the 840 G4 lineup when you have a look at the available components. HP equips the test model with an Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB NVM-SSD as well as a Full HD display.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 24 March 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Here starts courting app makers Change of ownership: Once part of Nokia, Here was purchased by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015. — AFP Relaxnews Here, the automotive industry-owned mapping and location services company is launching a new set of tools that will let any developer easily build and launch an app that needs location-specific features. It means that if a small company or individual wants to build an on-demand delivery business or launch a ride-hailing feature, for example, they can now turn to Here instead of Google Maps. "Congestion, roadworks and bad addressing are a constant headache for companies operating in a complex market where every single minute makes a difference. Our new toolkit brings together a set of advanced location capabilities to help developers address these challenges and make their app stand above the rest," said Leon van de Pas, head of Internet of Things at Here. If developers choose to simply use the full suite of Here tools and host their service within the company's existing consumer app, they can literally bring their app from idea to reality in a matter of days. All of the complex calculations, from figuring out where a delivery point or a customer really is, to navigating the most efficient route and building in contingencies for traffic flows, is taken care of. Once part of Nokia, Here was purchased by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015 in an attempt to put space between the auto industry and Google's mapping and location services. Over the past 18 months Intel has also come on board and the company has started developing next generation 3D maps that will be crucial for autonomous vehicles. However, cars are just one element and the company wants to expand into all aspects of location and mobility, making connections between internet-enabled things as we enter a future of smart homes, connected cars and on-demand services. This wider view is also why car companies from Audi and VW to BMW and Ford are starting to reposition themselves as mobility service providers as much as car builders. VW expects to have 100 million customers by 2025 that are patrons of its connected services and apps rather than VW group car drivers. Even connected cars being built today are opening up 10 times as many potential revenues streams for carmakers than other vehicles that don't have latest-generation infotainment or web services on board. Therefore the launch of this new developer kit should be seen as a very big first step towards this long-term goal. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Amazon sellers can get insured by Lloyd’s for getting kicked off Laptop ban creates turbulence for airline profits OnePlus 3T is now available Half of tweet removal requests come from Turkey, Twitter says Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Our testing shows that may well be the case. By: Chad Sebring | CPU Liquid Coolers in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: 2 days, 13 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 97%Manufacturer: NZXT Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging] Page 3 [NZXT Kraken X42 Liquid CPU Cooler] Page 4 [Accessories and Documentation] Page 5 [Installation and Finished Product] Page 6 [NZXT CAM Software] Page 7 [Test System Setup, Thermal Tests, and Noise Results] Page 8 [Final Thoughts] Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing     By now, most of us in the real-world have tried some form of liquid cooling, whether it be a fully custom setup, or opting for one of the many sealed loops on the market today. Up to now, when it came to AIOs, there has been one way to make them work well, and that was done by changing the fans used on the radiator portion of the cooler, which allowed companies to opt for static pressure, more airflow, and in the best-case scenario, fans which were great at doing both. Older generations of these coolers tended to be somewhat limited in their pump speeds, and many would complain that the older pumps were noisy, and could even be heard over the fans, when they were running at lower speeds.     It seems that now, there is a drastic change in the AIO market, and NZXT is the first to show off what the latest generation of AIOs is capable of. Rather than depending so much on the fan speed of their systems, there is a new pump in charge of the flow rate, which is where much of the magic happens. The new pump translates to a more efficient system, which increases the rate in which the coolant moves through the radiator, and can then reduce the fan speed, obtaining optimal performance without the need to make your ears bleed. What you are about to see, will change the way you look at closed loop coolers, and a new day is dawning in the AIO market.   NZXT has sent over the Kraken family for us to have a look at what is new, and we have decided to look at them, smallest first, on up in size as we look at the three coolers. The first of this trio is named the Kraken X42, and while similar in name to previous designs that NAZXT has had in the past, that is just about all that is shared between this and previous offerings. We are impressed with what NZXT is doing in the realm of sealed water cooling, and with all the new technology and features added in this time around, there is not a major price hike associated with it, which makes buying anything else at this point a bit pointless.     We took this chart from the Kraken X42 product page, and it does tell us much about this cooler. First off, we are given the size of the radiator, and this single 140mm radiator is 175mm tall, 143mm wide, and without the fan, it is 30mm thick. The head unit on the X42 is larger than most, as it is a cylindrical shape that is 80mm across the top, and it stands 52.9mm high. In this product, there is aluminum used in the radiator and the cover on the head unit. Copper is used in the base plate, plastic is used for the fittings and the clear cover on the head unit, and there are over fifteen inches of ultra-low evaporation rubber tubes, which have nylon sleeve on them.   All told, without the hardware included, it weighs in at 890 grams. Compatibility is wide, as it fits anything since AM2 for AMD, and all Intel sockets after LGA775. There is a RAM height clearance shown too, and we believe this is the height under the swivel fittings. This 35mm may come into play, but you will see later, that the X42 did not encroach on them.   NZXT offers CAM software to control the X42, and this is where you can set modes, for both the fan and the pump, as well as a place to tinker with the RGB LED system. The pump in this system is shown to spin at a maximum of 2800RPM with a margin of error, and the fan cooling the other end of the cooler is an Aer P140 fan. Only one fans ships with the X42, but it is capable of 1800RPM, at a noise level of 38db(A). Along with the model number at the bottom of the chart, we also see that the new Kraken coolers are backed by a six-year warranty; the longest we have seen to date.   Since we were on the product page to get the chart, we looked around as we always do, and found that the MSRP of $129.99 is right there in bold print. From what we can recall in the past, single 120mm AIOs release at $119.99, so an extra $10 to make the move to 140mm is reasonable. Looking around for other places to grab the Kraken X42, we see that Newegg is sticking tight to the MSRP, with their listing at $129.99 as well. Amazon, they are a tad higher, as they are asking $132.58 for this cooler currently. Of course, as time passes by, sales will pop up eventually, but at $129.99 we feel that not only are you getting the latest generation of AIOs to start off with, but you are also getting the most feature rich AIO we have seen to date.
