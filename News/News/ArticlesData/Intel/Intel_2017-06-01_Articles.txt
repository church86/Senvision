Announced as part of a new partnership during this year’s Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835-enabled Windows 10 devices could be a game-changer for lightweight and portable Windows 10 machines. We already know that desktop-like performance can be had with the 835 thanks to the Samsung Galaxy S8’s Android-powered computer interface. Instead of running a custom-built desktop, future Snapdragon 835 devices will be able to run Windows 10 natively. Don’t think this means that the next wave of smartphones, or the likes of the HTC U11 will suddenly become Windows 10 devices. The Windows 10-compatible Snapdragon 835 is a slightly different SKU to ensure it works better with Microsoft’s OS.  What this really means is a slew of affordable, low-power, lightweight Windows 10 ultraportables running on Qualcomm’s chips. It’s unlikely this means the end of Intel’s, somewhat lacklustre, mobile chips, but it does certainly apply some pressure on the manufacturer. Currently no Snapdragon 835 Windows 10 devices have been unveiled, but we do know that HP, Lenovo and Asus are all working on manufacturing some. It’s expected the first slew will arrive later this year, priced in the $400 – $700 range. Going by the mentioned manufacturers, it’s likely these won’t be phone-like devices, but could be lightweight Windows 10 tablets that can dock into a full desktop experience. Video of Windows 10 on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform Microsoft and Qualcomm claim that this is full-fat Windows 10, not some sort of cutdown OS like Windows RT was. Qualcomm sees the 835 as competing with Intel’s Y chips and, while it’s not going to be the performance beast gamers would want, it should be more than capable enough of simple photo editing and any light workload most users will want on the move. The real benefits of switching from an Intel chip to a Qualcomm one come in the form of better battery life and superior connectivity. Not only is Qualcomm well versed on the connectivity front, trying to create mesh networks for the home and bring superior 5G mobile connectivity speeds, but the Snapdragon 835’s integrated Gigabit X16 LTE means a Windows 10 device could offer always-on connectivity. Combine that with eSIMs and your portable Windows 10 machine could literally always be connected even when you don’t have Wi-Fi. See related  Qualcomm is building the solution to your Wi-Fi woes Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 preview: Better battery life, faster charging and a focus on VR In terms of battery life, the 10nm Snapdragon 835 is smaller and more power efficient than Intel’s mobile chips. Not only does this mean more room to slide in a bigger battery due to Snapdragon 835’s 30% smaller chipboard, but it’s BigLittle architecture allows for the high-power cores to run idle when not in use – meaning your battery isn’t sapped. Qualcomm claims that all of this results in up to 50% longer battery life compared to “a competing solution” and four to five times better connected standby. This, should, result in a truly all-day battery life for a Qualcomm-enabled Windows 10 machine. It’s going to be a little while until we get to see one of these devices in operation, but when they do finally emergy it could completely change the ultraportable market. Only time will tell, but it’s clear Microsoft believes Qualcomm has what it takes to give Intel a run for its money.

The Taipai-based show started on 30 May, and ever since then, we've been gleaning through the press conferences and more to determine what's noteworthy. We managed to narrow it to five products - with a couple of them more overarching concepts than actual hardware. However, they're design templates and processing chipsets that could change the way we perceive PCs and gaming laptops for years to come. Here are our top five tech products at this year's Computex. Intel Core i9 X-Series Intel Intel Core i9 X-Series is a hardcore gamer's delight Desktop processors aren't exactly exciting. With each new one, you can expect more power and more efficiency. So, when a company comes along and introduces a new processor with an insane amount of horsepower, especially at a time when everyone is clamoring for more of it, you take notice. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to pack 18 cores and 36 threads into one piece of silicon. That matters when consumers are streaming more 4K video and jumping into more virtual reality experiences than ever before. The more cores and threads there are in a single CPU, the more dedicated tasks it can handle simultaneously without compromising performance. Needless to say, a 18-core, 36-thread processor is a bit much for some people, but for others using intensive apps it's a no-brainer. A video editor, for instance, will want Intel’s $1,700 CPU. Or anyone who compiles code or runs VR experiences or live-streams games or tends to manage several interrelated tasks at once (think: streaming, recoding, broadcasting, chatting, etc -- all simultaneously). Intel even upgraded its Turbo Boost in order to give a pick-up to the two top-performing cores for single-threaded or light-threaded workloads. MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro Pocket-lint Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter If you want a powerful gaming laptop, you usually have to choose between thick, heavy machines with monster graphics cards or slim ones with lower-performing GPUs. In other words, hefty laptops tends to equal more power. However, MSI's new laptop, the GS63VR Stealth Pro, makes it so we no longer have to compromise. It packs a Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics and a 15-inch HDR (120Hz, 3ms) display. And it's just 17.7mm thick and 4.2 pounds heavy. MSI said it's slimmest laptop available with this GPU and display. While the late 2016 version of the MSI GS63VR had the same exact thickness and weight, it packed Nividia's GTX 1060 GPU. The updated model also has MSI's Cooler Boost Trinity technology with five different heat pipes and advanced "Whirlwind" fan blades to keep your system cool. Other features include a non-mechanical SteelSeries keyboard with customisable backlighting and ESS Sabre audio MSI also has yet to announce detailed specifications or pricing for the laptop. However, we imagine it'll be available with Intel 7th Generation and quad-core CPUs. Asus Zenbook Pro UX550 Pocket-lint Asus Zenbook Pro UX550: Next-level machine with a 4K touchscreen Asus’ Zenbook range has quite the following, thanks to its very competitive prices. At Computex, Asus announced the latest addition to the family: Zenbook Pro UX550. it's is a revamp of the original Zenbook Pro, which launched a couple of years ago, and it looks like Asus has really gone to the next level in terms of battery life and portability. It’s slim, light, rocks some great specs, and is a bit of a looker. Asus shaved almost 2mm off the earlier model, at 18.9mm, and the weight has dropped from 2.26kg to a mere 1.8kg. It still manages to squeeze in a 14-hour battery life and can charge to 60-per cent capacity in 49 minutes. The top-shelf model even runs on Intel’s H-series core i7 processor and boasts a Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics card, up to 1TB of PCIe x4 SSD storage, and 16GB DDR4 RAM. The display is another strong point with a 15.6-inch UHD 4K NanoEdge touchscreen with super slim 7.3mm bezels that give an 83-per cent screen-to-body ratio. There’s also a quad speaker set up by Harman Kardon, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB 3.1 ports a full sized HDMI port, and a micro SD card reader, and a fingerprint scanner for Microsoft Hello. And it ships with Windows 10 Pro or Home. Asus said it will start off at just over a £1,000 when it lands in July. Nvidia Max-Q design Nvidia Nvidia Max-Q could ensure your next gaming laptop has MacBook looks Nvidia has unveiled Max-Q, a design approach that major gaming laptop manufacturers can adopt for a series of Nvidia card-packed notebooks. They will be powerful and designed with gaming firmly at the forefront, but they will also be MacBook-thin and useable as a great, travel anywhere, multipurpose laptops. Max-Q laptops will sport GeForce GTX 1080, 1070, or 1060 graphics processing. They will be engineered with sophisticated thermal and electrical design in order to maintain a thin footprint yet keep cool and quite in operation. Nvidia's proprietary WhisperMode technology will also ensure a Max-Q laptop runs quietly. Manufacturers signed on to produce Max-Q machines include Acer, Asus, Alienware, Gigabyte, Lenovo, and MSI. Expect them to appear on the market from 27 June. Asus ROG Zephyrus Pocket-lint Asus ROG Zephyrus: Slim gaming laptop with Nvidia's latest architecture Republic of Gamers' (ROG) has unveiled an exceptionally impressive-looking gaming laptop at Computex: the Zephyrus. Essentially forget everything you think you know about the necessary form factor for a powerful and efficient gaming laptop, because the Zephyrus is packing a vast amount of power in a minuscule package. It's just 17.9mm thin at the thickest point and 16.9mm at the thinnest. The Zephyrus can run GeForce GTX 1080 without any overheating, thanks to an ingenious cooling system ROG calls Active Aerodynamic System. Essentially, there is a flap on the rear of the base that flips out as you open the lid, allowing for a clear airflow. Plus, heat escapes from the large perforated area above the keyboard. The lid is made of contoured steel and there’s a lovely diamond cut edge. It also boasts a 15.6-inch IPA panel with a 1080p resolution, 7th-generation Core i7 Kaby Lake processor, up to 24GB of RAM, four M.2 PCI ports for super-fast SSD storage, multiple USB ports, including USB-C, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an HDMI video output (no wired Ethernet, though). Unfortunately, it's an expensive machine. It costs $2,699 in the US, which will set you back £2,600.

To earn a chance to win a free SBC, participate in our 3-minute survey of these 98 sub-$200 hacker-friendly SBCs. Over the last year, LinuxGizmos has reported on dozens of new community backed, open spec, hacker- and developer-friendly single board computers that run Linux and Android. We’ve added these to a curated list of earlier boards to publish a catalog of 98 SBCs. The boards included in our survey must be priced under $200 (not counting shipping), have a promised shipment availability by July, and meet our relatively flexible selection criteria for open source compliance (see farther below). This SBC catalog is a companion to our 2017 hacker boards survey launch announcement, held in partnership with the Linux Foundation’s Linux.com community website. Click on over for a discussion of recent hacker board trends, as well as links to a brief survey. Fill it out, and you will earn a chance at winning one of 27 free SBCs from six different vendors (see prize details in our survey launch announcement). We’ll announce the winners in mid-June. In addition to the 98 product summaries farther below, we have also generated a detailed spreadsheet that compares the major features of all 98 boards. Spreadsheet comparing the survey’s 98 SBCs (click image to view complete spreadsheet) Our list of 98 boards has expanded since our early January catalog of 90 SBCs, which did not include a survey component. Our June 2016 catalog and survey had 81 boards, and the May 2015 catalog had 53.   Selection criteria Determining the criteria for community backed, open-spec SBCs is always a challenge. No SBC is completely open source, especially given the state of opaque GPUs and sometimes sketchily documented CPUs, although the RISC-V architecture may change this in the coming years. Few of the boards on our list explicitly claim fully open source hardware licensing. At the very least, however, the projects must post extensive specs, as well as schematics for expansion I/O at a minimum, or for the carrier portion of sandwich-style boards. The projects must also offer at least some community and technical support for individual developers, such as forums, tutorials, and other resources for sharing tips and designs based on the SBCs. More important to most customers is the need for open source Linux or Android distributions for download that can dependably exploit the boards’ resources. In the case of new SBCs, we allow a bit of a grace period to post the above resources in a timely manner. The summaries below provide brief descriptions and specs of each board in our survey, along with links to related coverage here at LinuxGizmos.com and at supplier product pages. The listed prices are the lowest we saw at publication, but the pricing on many of these boards is fairly fluid. Typically, the prices do not include free shipping, or if so, only to certain regions. Sometimes the shipping prices can be considerable, turning a $35 board, for example, into a $50 board. Since LinuxGizmos has an international audience, we did not attempt to include shipping costs in the listed board prices. We welcome reader comments on all of the above, especially in regard to your experiences with software and support. Please participate in the discussion area at the conclusion of this post.

The boards offer Arduino-compatible expansion, low power consumption, and a modular COM+baseboard design. Features include Fast Ethernet, USB 2.0, and microSD connections, plus 17x digital I/O pins and 6x analog inputs. A $69 One model adds HD audio and more expansion I/O. There’s also an EduCake mini-PC version and a SeeedStudio version of the One. This appears to be a fading project however, with very little activity in the forum.   A20-OlinuXino-Lime2 Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 4GB eMMC version Price — $50 (45 Euros); $61 (55 Euros) for 4GB version Bulgaria-based Olimex’s OlinuXino project is one of the older hacker board projects around, but lately it seems more focused on the open source, but not Linux compatible ESP32 platform. There’s plenty of activity on the oLinuXino forums concerning its Linux boards, however, and earlier this year the project released an open source, Linux-driven Teres-A64 laptop kit based on the Allwinner A64 for 225 Euros. Meanwhile, there’s still interest in the older A20-OlinuXino-Lime2, which offers a Gigabit Ethernet (GbE, or 10/100/1000Mbps) port, microSD slot, HDMI port, LCD interface, 3x USB ports, battery support, and 160x GPIOs. The 84 x 60mm SBC is available with Android 4.2.2 or Debian Jessie with Linux 3.4.1 images. Last year, the Lime2 switched to the same PCB Revision G used by the Lime2-4GB/eMMC, bringing an up-to-date RTL8211E Ethernet PHY, grounded mount holes, and a streamlined shape without the cutouts found on the 4GB model.   A20-OlinuXino-Micro Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 4GB NAND Price — $61 (55 Euros); $72 (65 Euros) for 4GB version The A20-OlinuXino-Micro has all the I/O of the first-gen Lime models, and adds VGA, LCD with touch support, and audio I/O. This larger, 142 x 83mm board offers expansion connectors with optional I/O modules. The 4GB NAND version is otherwise identical.   A33-OlinuXino Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser Product page Processor — Allwinner A33 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB NAND version available Price — $40 (36 Euros) or $49 (44 Euros) for 4GB version The A33-OlinuXino has a faster quad-core Allwinner A33 SoC compared to earlier OlinuXino boards, but it offers a reduced feature set. The only real-world ports are a mini-USB OTG port, audio jacks with 100dB codec, and a 5V jack. Two unassembled 40-pin connectors support GPIO, as well as up to 1280 x 800 LCD and dual MIPI-CSI (5- and 8-megapixel) interfaces. Other features include a debug connector, a LiPo charger, and a step-up converter. The 71 x 66mm SBC is smaller than the A20-based Lime and Lime2 boards. You can download images for Android 4.4 and Debian Jesse with Linux 3.4.39.   Arduino Industrial 101 Company/project — Arduino LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 400MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM; 16MB SPI flash Price — $38.50 The Arduino wars are now over, but we haven’t seen many new official Arduino boards since the reunification except for the non-Linux, Sigfox-ready MKRFOX1200. The two websites have yet to merge, with each offering a slightly different set of features. The Linux-ready, sandwich-style Arduino Industrial 101 is still available on Arduino.org in addition to the Arduino.cc page linked to above. The board injects the Linux/WiFi capability of the Arduino Yun into a COM that is integrated with an Arduino-enabled baseboard. The module incorporates a soldered down Linino Chiwawa LGA module that runs Linino (a version of OpenWrt) on an AR9331 WiFi SoC, accompanied by 64MB DDR2 RAM and 16MB SPI flash. The carrier adds a 16MHz ATmega32u4 MPU along with 2.5KB SRAM and 32KB flash. There’s also a USB OTG port and 20x DIO pins that include UARTs, 7x PWMs, Ethernet, and 12x analog inputs.   Arduino Yun / Yun PoE Company/project — Arduino Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 400MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM Price — $68.20 (Yun) or (Yun PoE) $78.10 This original Arduino Yun is still available at Arduino.org, and the new Arduino Yun PoE version is sold by Arduino.cc (see link above), but not vice versa. The smaller Arduino Yun Mini is listed on both sites, but is out of stock, with no promises of a refresh. For $10 more than the Yun, the Arduino Yun PoE adds Power-over-Ethernet to the original Yun design, letting you power the board over the 10/100 Ethernet port with the help of an included add-on module. Both versions run the OpenWrt-based Linino on Qualcomm’s 400MHz AR9331 WiFi SoC while also processing Arduino code on an Atmel Atmega32U4. Linux-driven components include the 2.4GHz WiFi-n radio, USB 2.0 host port, and microSD slot. Arduino-controlled interfaces on the 5V board include 20x DIO pins, 7x PWM outputs, and 12x analog I/O pins. Alternatively, buyers with existing Arduinos can still purchase the $49, OpenWrt-driven Arduino Yun Shield, which brings a Yun experience to any Arduino board.   Arduino Tian Company/project — Arduino LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9432 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 560MHz); Atmel SAMD21G18 Cortex M0+ MCU (48MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM; 4GB eMMC; 256KB flash and 32KB RAM for SAMD21G18 Price — $95.70 Compared to the Arduino Yun and Yun Mini PoE, the 68.5 x 53mm Arduino Tian runs Linino on a faster Atheros AR9432, and uses a more powerful, 32-bit Atmel SAMD21G18 MCU. In addition to providing WiFi, the Tian adds a Qualcomm CSR8510 chip for Bluetooth EDR/BLE 4.0a support. You also get a USB 2.0 host port, a GbE port, and 4GB eMMC.

The M2 features GbE, WiFi, five USB ports, and a range of display and camera interfaces. We removed the smaller, Allwinner H3 based, SATA-enabled Banana Pi M2+ from our list because it appears to be out of stock. We could only find it at AliExpress in a stripped-down, $22 EDU version without wireless or onboard flash, or as a $27 to $35 offering that appears to be aimed at OEM customers.   Banana Pi BPI-M2 Ultra Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner R40 (4x Cortex-A7); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $40 The Banana Pi M2 Ultra can be found for a low of $40 on Amazon with free shipping, but it ranges up to $60 elsewhere. It essentially replaces the similarly 92 x 60mm M2, but offers a faster Allwinner R40, which also enables a SATA connector. In the process, one of the four USB host ports was sacrificed. There’s also a generous 2GB of RAM, which is unusual for a Cortex-A7 SoC. The M2 Ultra is further equipped with GbE, WiFi, Bluetooth, micro-USB OTG, a 40-pin connector that supports Raspberry Pi add-ons, and several display and camera interfaces.   Banana Pi BPI-M3 Company/project — SinoVoip Product page Processor — Allwinner A83T (8x Cortex-A7 @ 1.8GHz); PowerVR SGX544MP1 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $74 fy SinoVoip’s Banana Pi M3 (BPI-M3), which features the octa-core Allwinner A83T SoC, sells for $74 at AliExpress and a dollar more at Amazon, both with 2GB RAM and 8GB eMMC. The M3 has about the same size (92 x 60mm), layout, and features of the M2 Ultra, and similarly integrates a RPi-ready 40-pin link. Like the M2 Ultra, the M3 supplies GbE, WiFi, SATA, 3x USB, and multiple display and camera options. Software support is more extensive than some other Banana Pi boards, although all have improved (see the download locator here). Options include Android 5.1, Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 Mate, Raspbian Jesse Mate, Kano, Kali, CentOS, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, Arch, CRUX, and Fedora.   Banana Pi BPI-M64 Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $74 SinoVoip’s first 64-bit Banana Pi has a high price ($74 at AliExpress) compared to the similarly Allwinner A64-equipped Pine A64, but it’s loaded with 2GB RAM and numerous peripherals. You get 4K-ready HDMI, MIPI-DSI, and MIPI-CSI, as well as onboard wireless and GbE connections. The 92 x 60mm board is further equipped with 3x USB host ports, a micro-USB OTG, and an RPi 40-pin connector.   Banana Pro Company/project — LeMaker LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $48 Compared to the rival Banana Pi M2 boards from former partner SinoVoip, LeMaker’s own Banana Pi update sticks closer to the original, retaining the dual-core A20 SoC. The Banana Pro features a SATA connector and an RPi-like 40-pin connector. Other features include microSD, WiFi, 2x USB host ports, and a micro-USB OTG. LeMaker also offers a LeMaker Guitar SBC, as well as a 96Boards-compatible HiKey board (see farther below).   BeagleBone Black, Rev C Company/project — BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $48 The Debian-ready BeagleBone Black Rev C, which came in at third place out of 81 in our June 2016 survey, is available from numerous sources, with the $48 MCM Electronics currently offering the lowest price. This industrial-oriented SBC stands out with its numerous expansion interfaces and programmable “PRU” MCUs, as well as its deeply rooted BeagleBoard.org community and ecosystem. In recent years, the design has spawned several BeagleBoard.org authorized clones. In addition to two SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green models, Octavo’s BeagleBone Black Wireless, and BeagleBoard.org’s own BeagleBone Blue (see reports below), these include Element14’s new BeagleBone Black Industrial 4G, which is identical to the BB Black except for its conformal coating and -20 to 85°C support. SanCloud’s feature-rich BeagleBone Enhanced shipped to Indiegogo backers, and although the design is free to use, the board itself is no longer available. As for the long delayed, dual-core Cortex-A15 based BeagleBoard-X15 successor to the venerable BeagleBoard, it’s finally available from locations including Mouser. At a low of $264, however, it’s over our $200 limit.   BeagleBone Black Wireless Company/project — BeagleBoard.org; Octavo Systems LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP with TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCUs; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $68.75 This BeagleBoard.org backed, Octavo Systems built alternative to Seeed’s BeagleBone Green Wireless (see below) similarly adds 2.4GHz 802.11a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 BLE to the BeagleBone Black design. Unlike Seeed’s two BB Green models, the BeagleBone Black Wireless retains the BB Black’s micro-HDMI port, but removes the Ethernet port. It is otherwise identical to the BB Black with one big exception: It incorporates the Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP (system-in-package) module, “which integrates BeagleBone functionality into one easy-to-use BGA package,” making it easier to create custom variations.   BeagleBone Blue Company/project — BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP with TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips and PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $80 This robotics-focused BeagleBoard.org collaboration with the UCSD Coordinated Robotics Lab is a BeagleBone clone that adds motion control and battery friendly power. Like the BeagleBone Black Wireless, the BeagleBone Blue integrates a TI WiLink 8 with WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 LE, as well as an Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP module that encapsulates the Sitara AM3358 SoC, RAM, and flash along with a PMIC and other features. There’s no Ethernet port or display interfaces, but you get micro-USB 2.0 host and client ports, 8x servo outputs, 4x DC motor outputs, and 4x quad encoder inputs. Other features include an IMU, barometer, JTAG, and GPS and DSM2 radio interfaces. There’s a wide-range 9-18V DC input, a LiPo battery connector, and the usual extensive list of BB Black interfaces. Plenty of user buttons and LEDs are also onboard. The BeagleBone Blue defaults to a real-time enhanced Debian stack, but also runs Ubuntu Core, and supports ROS and ArduPilot.   BeagleBone Green Company/project — SeeedStudio; BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $39 SeeedStudio’s BeagleBoard.org-sanctioned, IoT-focused re-spin of the BeagleBone Black sells for a low of $39 at Banana Robotics. The BeagleBone Green loses the BB Black’s micro-HDMI port and 5V barrel jack connector. However, it costs less, and it adds expansion connectors for Seeed’s Grove sensors. It also replaces the mini-USB connector with a micro-USB port. Seeed offers its own Grove-oriented BB Green developers site in addition to drawing on the support of the larger BeagleBoard community.   BeagleBone Green Wireless Company/project — SeeedStudio; BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $49.90 The BeagleBone Green Wireless has the same base feature set as the BB Green, with identical additions and subtractions from the BB Black, including the addition of a Grove interface. The Wireless model adds WiFi and Bluetooth, as well as three more USB host ports for a total of four, making it the USB leader among all the currently announced BB Black clones. A TI WiLink8 module is now standard, boosting wireless capabilities to Bluetooth 4.1 LE and 2.4GHz 802.11a/b/g/n with 2×2 MIMO.   Bubblegum-96 Company/project — uCRobotics LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Actions Semiconductor Actions S900 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.8GHz); PowerVR G6230 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $89 Based on an earlier ActDuino S900 prototype, the uCRobotics Bubblegum-96 adopts Linaro’s 96Boards CE spec.

Prices range to $160, but you can get it for a low of $146 at Netgate. The board includes a low-speed expansion header that provides Arduino-like prototyping I/O, as well as a 60-pin high speed connector for add-on boards called Lures. Other I/O includes dual USB ports plus GbE, micro-HDMI, and SATA. Firmware support includes Debian, Ubuntu, Yocto Project, Android 4.4, and Windows 10. The Turbot Dual, has recently been joined by an almost identical MinnowBoard Turbo Quad-core (see item below).   MinnowBoard Turbot Quad-core Company/project — Intel, ADI, MinnowBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Atom E3845 (4x Bay Trail @ 1.91GHz); Intel HD Graphics Memory — 2GB DDR3L RAM Price — $190 The MinnowBoard Turbo Quad-core, which began shipping only last week, has the same 99 x 74mm footprint as the dual-core Turbot Dual, and much the same layout and feature set. The Quad advances to the quad-core, 1.91GHz Atom E3845 from the same 22nm Bay Trail generation, and adds a heatsink, a fan, and a faster Intel I210 GbE controller. Almost a year ago, ADI announced a larger (103 x 99mm) MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-E SBC with a choice of dual-core Atom E3826 or quad-core E3845 SoCs. The Dual-E is named for it second GbE port, and it also offers an M.2/micro-SIM combo for WiFi, LTE, or SSD. There’s still no word on pricing or availability.   MYS-6ULX SBC Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 ULL or i.MX6 UL (1x Cortex-A7 @ 528MHz or 696MHz, respectively); 2D PXP GPU Memory — 256MB DDR3 RAM; 256MB NAND Price — $24.80 (i.MX6 ULL) or $26.80 (UL) MYIR is primarily a commercial board vendor, but it has spun several open-spec hacker boards like the MYS-6ULX SBC that have crossover appeal to makers. Others include the Rico Board (Sitara) and Z-turn (Zynq) (see farther below). The $25 to $27 MYS-6ULX offers a choice of i.MX6 UL (UltraLite) or its newer, down-clocked sibling, the i.MX6 ULL. Each SBC model has its own unique super power: The i.MX6 UL version offers -40 to 85°C support instead of 0 to 70°C, and the i.MX6 ULL model features a USB-powered WiFi radio. Otherwise, the 70 x 55mm boards are identical. You get a microSD slot, Fast Ethernet port, USB host and micro-USB 2.0 OTG ports, a debug connector, and an LCD interface with optional touchscreens. The dual 20-pin expansion connectors can be used to attach an optional baseboard, which is not yet available. The MYS-6ULX comes with an open source Linux BSP with a 4.1.15 kernel and either Debian or Yocto Project with ported Qt. There’s no forum or dedicated community site, but you get full schematics and extensive documentation.   NanoPC-T3 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P6818 (8x Cortex-A53 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); Mali-400 MP GPU Memory — 1GB or 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $60 FriendlyElec (AKA FriendlyARM) now offers at least a dozen SBC SKUs, depending on how you delineate them, leading us for the first time to apply our 10-product limit and trim a few from the list. Those that didn’t make it are noted in the blurbs of similar NanoPi models. The 100 x 60mm NanoPC-T3 is one of the few without NanoPi branding. As the PC nomenclature suggests, this is one of the most feature-rich FriendlyElec boards. Equipped with an octa-core Samsung S5P6818, the NanoPC-T3 SBC is almost identical to the earlier, quad-core NanoPC-T2. In addition to the faster processor, the T3 adds a 2GB RAM option. Other features common to both NanoPC boards include an SD slot, GbE, WiFi, and Bluetooth 4.0. The board provides 4x USB host, a micro-USB client, and media ports include HDMI, LVDS, LCD, MIPI-DSI, MIPI-CSI, and audio. In place of the usual 40-pin RPi connector, the NanoPC-T3 provides a 30-pin GPIO header.   NanoPi A64 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $25 The NanoPi A64, which appeared in December, was FriendlyElec’s first 64-bit quad-core NanoPi. It has since been joined by the NanoPi K2 and NanoPi Neo 2, and there’s also the earlier octa-core NanoPi-T3. The NanoPi A64 has a compact, 64 x 60mm footprint that matches that of the NanoPi M3. The board provides two USB host ports, a power-only micro-USB, and HDMI, MIPI-DSI, microSD, audio, and DVP camera connections. The 5V SBC offers GbE and WiFi, but no Bluetooth, and you get the NanoPi-typical 40-pin Raspberry Pi expansion header. Images are available for Ubuntu Core and Ubuntu Mate. Most of the NanoPi boards are available with a growing list of options ranging from cases to heat sinks to camera modules. Shipping to the U.S., however, is expensive. Single-unit prices range from $16 to $36, compared to under $4 for the Orange Pi project.   NanoPi K2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S905 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM Price — $40 If the specs for the video-oriented NanoPi K2 look familiar, that’s because they almost perfectly mimic the $46 Odroid-C2, which aside from the processor is itself a near doppelgänger of the $35 Raspberry Pi 3. The NanoPi K2 has the same quad -A53 Amlogic SoC and 85 x 56mm footprint as the Odroid-C2, as well as similar features like 2GB RAM, 4x USB, GbE, and a 40-pin RPi-like bus. Unlike the Odroid-C2, but like the RPi 3, the NanoPi K2 adds WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0, so you don’t have to use up a USB port. The Amlogic S905 with Mali 450 GPU is considerably more powerful than the RPi3’s Broadcom/VideoCore IV SoC, and [email protected] decoding and DVFS. Android 5.1 is available, with Ubuntu in development.   NanoPi M1 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB or 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $15 or $20 (1GB) The 69 × 48mm NanoPi M1 adopts the quad-core Allwinner H3, the same SoC found on the $10, H3-based Orange Pi One. The M1 offers more features, however, including a CVBS A/V output, an IR receiver, a mic, and two more USB 2.0 host ports for a total of three. Standard features shared by both include microSD, Fast Ethernet, HDMI, DVP camera, and a 40-pin RPi connector. Images are available for Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Core. Last year, LinkSprite launched a rebranded version of the NanoPi M1 called the pcDuino4 Nano, selling for $25 with 1GB.   NanoPi M1 Plus Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $35 This recent, more feature-rich version of the $15 NanoPi M1 retains the Allwinner H3, but is slightly smaller at 64 × 60mm. The higher price reflects the standard 1GB RAM and 8GB eMMC, as well as new features like WiFi, Bluetooth, mic, and the advance to Gigabit Ethernet. One of the three USB 2.0 host ports, however, has moved to an onboard header. OS options include Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Core, Debian, and Android.   NanoPi M2A / M3 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz with 3D GPU) for M2A or Samsung S5P6818 (8x Cortex-A53 @ 400MHz to 1.46GHz with Mali-400MP GPU) for M3 Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $30 (M2A) or $35 (M3) The recently released NanoPi M2A replaces the similarly Samsung S5P4418 driven, $25 NanoPi M2, which we removed from the list due to being out of stock. Aside from the SoC, the NanoPi M2A is almost exactly like the still available, $35, octa-core Samsung S5P6818 based NanoPi M3, so we’ve combined the two SBCs here. The 64 x 60mm footprint, layout, and features appear to be identical except for the M2A’s addition of an onboard mic and a switch from a 5V @ 2A to a 5V @ 3A input. Both SBCs provide WiFi, BT 4.0, and a GbE port, plus media interfaces like HDMI, LCD, LVDS, DVP, and audio. They both offer dual USB 2.0 host ports and two more USB headers, a micro-USB port, and a 40-pin, RPi-ready header. Images listed for the NanoPi M2A include Android 4.4 and 5.1, Debian 8.1, and Ubuntu Core with Qt.   NanoPi 2 Fire Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); 3D GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $29 The NanoPi 2 Fire replaces the earlier NanoPi 2 SBC, and similarly runs Android or Debian on a quad -A9 S5P4418 SoC. The Fire swaps out the earlier wireless module for a GbE port, and adds a PMIC. The 75 x 40mm SBC offers both an HDMI port and an LCD interface, and supplies a DVP camera link. Other features include a microSD slot, a 40-pin RPi connector, a micro-USB OTG port, and a USB host port.   NanoPi Neo/Neo2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-400 MP2 GPU) for Neo or Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-450 GPU) for Neo2 Memory — 256MB or 512MB DDR3 RAM (Neo) or 512MB DDR3 (Neo2) Price — $8 or $10 (512MB) for Neo or $15 for Neo2 Earlier this year, the quad -A7, 40 x 40mm NanoPi Neo was joined by a 64-bit quad -A53 near twin called the NanoPi Neo2. The Neo2 is the same as the Neo except for the faster SoC, GbE instead of 10/100 Ethernet, two more USB headers, and lack of a 256MB RAM option. Both boards, along with a third, wireless enabled Neo Air option (see below) are the world’s smallest and most affordable quad-core ARM SBCs. At 40 x 40mm, they consume only 1,600 square millimeters, compared to 1,950 sq. mm for the 65 x 30mm Raspberry Pi Zero. The NanoPi Neo and Neo2 are further equipped with microSD, USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB OTG ports. All three Neo boards, which run Ubuntu Core or Mate, lack display or camera interfaces. You get 36 GPIO pins instead of the usual RPi connector.   NanoPi Neo Air Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $20 The NanoPi Neo Air is a juiced up NanoPi Neo. This headless, IoT board has the same minisicule 40 x 40mm footprint, and similarly runs Ubuntu Core and Mate on an Allwinner H3. The Neo Air comes standard with 512MB of RAM, and adds 8GB eMMC, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and a DVP camera connector. The Air also sacrifices the Ethernet port and the sole USB host port, however, leaving you only a micro-USB OTG for power and data. You can get more USB ports or a power connection via the split bank of 36 GPIO pins.   NanoPi S2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); 3D GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $45 The NanoPi S2 is like a pumped up, wireless-enabled NanoPi 2 Fire, sharing the same 75 x 40mm footprint and quad -A9 S5P4418 with Debian and Android support. Other common features include USB 2.0 host and micro-USB ports, a microSD slot, a PMIC, a 40-pin RPi connector, and links for LCD and camera. The NanoPi S2 dispenses with the Fire’s GbE port, but adds WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. It also shrinks the HDMI port to mini-HDMI. Unlike the 2 Fire, the S2 features 8GB of eMMC, an ADC pin header, an audio jack, and an LVDS interface.   Odroid-C0 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S805 (4x Cortex-A5 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional eMMC 4.5 Price — $30.80 (with $1.80 Connector Pack) Aimed at IoT and robotics, the Odroid-C0 is a smaller (65 x 56mm), somewhat stripped-down version of the Odroid C and C+ (see below). It has the same quad-core -A5 Amlogic SoC, and offers the same Ubuntu and Android 4.4 support with GCC 4.9.2 Linux toolchain. The C0’s only coastline port is an HDMI port. However, an optional Connector Pack lets you solder on real-world connections for unpopulated interfaces including dual USB host, serial console, IR, I2S, and an RPi 40-pin interface. A battery connector with charging circuit supports an optional 3.7V Li-Po battery. Internet connectivity requires an optional WiFi dongle. As with all Odroid boards, the price includes worldwide shipping.   Odroid-C1+ Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S805 (4x Cortex-A5 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 8GB eMMC Price — $35 The Odroid-C1+ upgraded the earlier, very similar Odroid-C1 with features like a full-size HDMI port, a standard heatsink, and I2S audio and micro-USB-OTG links. The C1+ has a price, footprint, and feature set that is almost identical to the original, 32-bit Raspberry Pi 2, but is more fully open source, has a faster processor, and supports Android 4.4 in addition to Ubuntu 14.04. The C1+ is further equipped with a microSD slot and optional eMMC, as well as GbE, serial console, ADC, and a RPi-compatible 40-pin connector.   Odroid-C2 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S905 (4x Cortex-53 @ up to 1.5GHz); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; optional 8GB eMMC Price — $46 The Odroid-C2 came in second out of 81 hacker SBCs in our June 2016 survey. It has the same 85 x 56mm size and layout as the Odroid-C1+ and Raspberry Pi 3, but advances to a quad -A53 Amlogic S905 SoC. It’s faster and more open source than the RPi 3, but there’s no WiFi or Bluetooth, and the price has edged up to be $11 more expensive. The C2 doubles the RAM of the C1+ to 2GB, and offers a choice of optional storage between up to 64GB of eMMC and an 8GB or 16GB SD 3.01 compatible UHS-1 microSD card. The Odroid-C2 can output 4k/60Hz video, and has almost everything the C1+ has, including GbE and HDMI ports, four USB host ports, and a 40-pin RPi connector. Images are available for Android 5.1 or Ubuntu 16.04, based on a Linux 3.14 LTS kernel.   Odroid-XU4 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung Exynos5422 (4x Cortex-A15 @ 2.0GHz and 4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.4GHz); Mali-T628 MP6 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; optional up to 64GB eMMC Price — $59 While the other Odroid boards have crept up in price, the Odroid-XU4 recently received a $15 price cut. This 83 x 58mm Odroid-XU3 replacement uses the same octa-core Exynos5422 and Mali-T628 GPU. Features include a GbE port, audio-enabled HDMI port, 2x USB 3.0 ports, and a USB 2.0 port. The XU4 offers a 12-pin GPIO header in addition to a 30-pin expansion connector. There’s an option for a USB-based SATA 3 module, an I/O board, and various wireless add-ons. The Odroid-XU4 features several versions of Android up to 7.1 Nougat, as well as Ubuntu 16.04, based on a Linux 4.9 LTS kernel.   Orange Pi 2G-IOT Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — RDA RDA8810PL (1x Cortex-A5); Vivante GC860 GPU Memory — 256MB LPDDR2 RAM; 500MB NAND Price — $9.90 Shenzhen Xunlong sells a lot of dirt-cheap Orange Pi models — adding over a half dozen more since our June 2016 round-up — and they all ship to the U.S. for under $4. The Orange Pi project has been criticized for poor Linux support and HW quality issues, but it appears to be improving. The Armbian community is helping to improve Linux support, and in March, Shenzhen Xunlong partnered with Canonical to launch an Ubuntu snap app store for its Orange Pi SBCs. Linux and Android OS images available on the Orange Pi site vary widely by board. The first Orange Pi on our list is somewhat atypical. The tiny, 68 x 42mm Orange Pi 2G-IOT can withstand -10 to 65°C temperatures, and runs Android 4.4, Ubuntu, Debian, or an RPi image on a single-core, Cortex-A5 RDA RDA8810PL SoC (typically 1GHz) with an integrated 2G GSM/GPRS/EDGE baseband. The $10 board offers WiFi, BT, and a SIM card slot with 2G antenna. Other features include LCD, MIPI-CSI, and audio interfaces, as well as USB 2.0 host and micro-USB OTG ports, and a 40-pin RPi-style connector.   Orange Pi Lite Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $12 The fetchingly priced Orange Pi Lite, a WiFi variant of the Orange Pi One, offers the 1.2GHz version of the quad-core H3 SoC compared to 1.6GHz on the Orange Pi PC. It’s also limited to a half gig of RAM, and lacks an Ethernet port, but you get a second USB host port. Other features include microSD, WiFi, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, micro-USB OTG, and the usual Orange Pi 40-pin RPi header.   Orange Pi One Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $10 The highly affordable Orange Pi One preceded the similar $12 Lite version. It provides 10/100 Ethernet instead of WiFi, and supplies a single USB host port instead of two. Otherwise, the specs are identical, including microSD, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, micro-USB OTG, and 40-pin connections. Comparing only by price, performance, and features, the Orange Pi One clearly beats the $5 to $25 RPi Zero. Meanwhile, the tiny, H3-based NanoPi M1 has a few more features, but has crept up to $15 to $20. A hands-on report on the Orange Pi One can be found here.   Orange Pi PC / PC Plus Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.6GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC on PC Plus Price — $15 ($22 for PC Plus) The $15 Orange Pi PC provides an Allwinner H3, a Raspberry Pi-like 85 x 55mm footprint, and RPi-compatible 40-pin expansion. It has twice the RAM of the Lite and One models, and provides microSD, HDMI, CVBS, CSI, USB OTG, and 10/100 Ethernet connections. A newer Orange Pi PC Plus model adds 8GB of eMMC flash.   Orange Pi PC 2 Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $20 Shenzhen Xunlong’s first 64-bit Orange Pi arrived in November with the same 85 x 55mm footprint, 40-pin RPi header, and many other features found on the Orange Pi PC. However, it offers a quad -A53 Allwinner H5 instead of a quad -A7 H3. The PC 2 is further equipped with 3x USB host ports, as well as micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, CVBS, audio, and MIPI-CSI.   Orange Pi Plus2 / Plus2E Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.6GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $49 ($35 for Plus2E) Like the Orange Pi 2 and the still available, $39 Orange Pi Plus1, the Orange Pi Plus2 and new Plus2E run distributions such as Lubuntu, Raspbian, and Android on a quad-core, 1.6GHz Allwinner H3. Compared to the Plus1, the Plus2 doubles the RAM to 2GB and expands slightly to 108 x 67mm. Other features appear to be identical, including an RPi-compatible 40-pin connector, four USB host ports, a GbE port, and WiFi. The board is further equipped with micro-USB, microSD, SATA, HDMI, CVBS, and CSI connections. The Orange Pi Plus2E swaps the four-port USB hub for three separate USB ports, and loses the SATA connection, but shaves $14 off the price.   Orange Pi Prime Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM Price — $29.90 Like the $20 Orange Pi PC 2, the $30 Orange Pi Prime offers a quad -A53 Allwinner H5, a 40-pin RPi header, 3x USB host ports, and micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, CVBS, audio, and MIPI-CSI connections. This larger, 98 x 60mm SBC doubles the RAM to 2GB, however, and adds WiFi, Bluetooth, and extended -10 to 65°C support. Images are available for Android 4.4, Debian Desktop, Ubuntu Desktop, Arch Server, Raspberry Pi, and Banana Pi.   Orange Pi Win Plus / Win Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM for Win Plus (1GB on Win); optional eMMC Price — $29.90 (Win Plus) or $25 (Win) While most of the new 64-bit Orange Pi models use the Allwinner H5, the 2GB Orange Pi Win Plus and 1GB Orange Pi Win tap the older Allwinner A64, which is much the same except for its weaker Mali-400 GPU. The Win boards, which appear to be named for its upcoming Windows 10 IoT support, can currently run Android 6.0, Ubuntu Desktop/Server Xenial, Debian Server Jessie, and a Raspberry Pi image. The 93 x 60mm SBC is only slightly smaller than the similarly priced and configured, H5-based Orange Pi Prime. Like the Prime, the Win SBCs provide micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, audio, MIPI-CSI, and 40-pin RPi connections. They similarly furnish WiFi and Bluetooth, and offer -10 to 65°C support. Differences include a MIPI-DSI LCD interface on the Win boards in place of RCA/CVBS/AV, and the availability of 4x USB host ports instead of three. You also get optional eMMC.   Orange Pi Zero Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H2 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 256MB or 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $7 or $9 (512MB) The Orange Pi Zero is the smallest and cheapest SBC in the lineup. Just a bit smaller than the Raspberry Pi Zero, the 48 x 46mm SBC uses an Allwinner H2 SoC that is much like an H3, but is limited to HD instead of 4K video. The headless, IoT-oriented Orange Pi Zero has only a single USB 2.0 host port, as well as a micro-USB OTG for power, but it offers both WiFi and Ethernet. There’s a 26-pin header compatible with older Raspberry Pis, as well as a separate 13-pin high-power interface, 3x GPIO, debug serial, and a mic interface.   Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H3 / Zero Plus 2 H5 Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-400 MP2 GPU) or Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz with ARM Mali-450 MP2 GPU) Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $18.90 or $19.90 (H5) These rev’d up versions of the Orange Pi Zero have the same tiny, 48 x 46mm dimensions, but offer a choice of two more powerful processors. The Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H3 has an Allwinner H3 instead of an H2, which adds 4K support. The Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H5 advances to a quad -A53 Allwinner H5, which also moves up to a Mali-450 GPU. Otherwise, the H3 and H5 devices are identical and only $1 difference in price. Differences with the still available Zero include the removal of the USB 2.0 host and 10/100 Ethernet ports, as well as the dedicated mic interface. Yet while the headless Zero was limited to an AV-out interface grouped along with other I/O on the still-available 13-pin function header, the Zero Plus 2 boards add an HDMI port and MIPI-CSI camera interface. They also add 8GB eMMC and Bluetooth 4.2, which is provided on an Ampak AP6212 module along with the previously supplied WiFi. It all looks good for low-cost multimedia, except that the H5 version could really use a 1GB RAM option.   Parallella Company/project — Adapteva, Parallella.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Xilinx Zynq-7020 or -7010 SoC (2x Cortex-A9 @ 667MHz plus FPGA); 16-core Epiphany RISC chip Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 Aimed at power-efficient server clustering applications and parallel programming research, the ever popular Parallella features a Zynq ARM/FPGA SoC running an optimized Ubuntu 15.05 distro called Parabuntu, plus a homegrown 16-core Epiphany coprocessor. I/O includes microSD, GbE, micro-HDMI, and dual USB ports. Four 60-pin connectors provide extensions for I/O linked to FPGA and its novel Epiphany parallel processing chip. Adapteva also offers a $75 Micro-Server version with a Zynq-7010 that omits the USB, HDMI, and expansion I/O. Also new since last year is a $29.50 Parallella Aluminum Case with heat spreading plate and thermal pad, but it’s currently out of stock. A new Epiphany-V chip with 4.5 billion transistors is now several months overdue.   pcDuino Lite WiFi Company/project — LinkSprite Technologies Product page Processor — Allwinner A10 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 256MB RAM; 2GB flash Price — $29 LinkSprite’s pcDuino Lite has been retired, but the similar pcDuino Lite WiFi lives on. The 100 x 52mm board runs Ubuntu 12.04 with Linux 3.0 on the old-school, Cortex-A8 Allwinner A10. The 5V board offers 256MB RAM, 2GB flash, an HDMI port, an Arduino-style interface, and of course, WiFi. LinkSprite appears to have retired several other boards over the last year, including the pcDuino2, pcDuino3, and pcDuino3B. The newer Allwinner A20 based pcDuino3 Nano is listed as “out of stock — check back later.”   pcDuino8 Uno Company/project — LinkSprite Technologies Product page Processor — Allwinner H8 (8x Cortex-A7 @ 2GHz); PowerVR SGX544 GPU Memory — 1GB DRAM Price — $49 The pcDuino 8 Uno isn’t listed on LinkSprite’s main pcDuino page, but a shopping page is buried on the site. The board features an octa-core Allwinner H8 clocked to 2GHz, combined with the usual pcDuino Arduino expansion. The 92 x 54mm board provides microSD, GbE, USB host, USB OTG, HDMI, audio, MIPI-CSI, and IR connections. An Android-only PCDuino 8 STB set-top box version for the OEM market ships with slightly different I/O and an enclosure.   Pepper 43R / 43C Company/project — Gumstix Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3354 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz); PowerVR SGX530 3D GPU Memory — 512MB RAM Price — $169 Gumstix, which is known for its Overo and DuoVero modules and associated carrier boards, has also shipped some Pepper SBCs in recent years, now supported with full schematics. The original, $250 Pepper that appeared back in 2013 has been replaced with three new models, although with a lower-end TI AM3354 SoC rather than the original AM3359. The AM3354 is paired with a 3D-ready PowerVR GPU, but the SoC lacks the PRU units found on some models. The $169 Pepper 43R and 43C are very similar, but the Pepper DVI-D is sufficiently divergent to deserve its own blurb below. The Pepper 43R supports resistive touchscreens while the Pepper 43C supports capacitive, and each are supported with $39, 4.3-inch Newhaven touchscreen options. The 43R version also adds an 8-ch. bidirectional level shifter and a TI step-down converter among other minor variations. Both boards have a GbE port, microSD slot, dual micro-USB ports, a USB console port, and a TI WiLink 8 WiFi/BT 4.1 LE module with access point mode and U.FL connectors. The Pepper 43 boards are further equipped with 20-pin GPIO, an audio jack, LiPo battery support, a PMIC, and LEDs. The board can be further customized in the Gumstix Geppetto online design and manufacturing service.   Pepper DVI-D Company/project — Gumstix Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3354 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz); PowerVR SGX530 3D GPU Memory — 512MB RAM Price — $119 The Pepper DVI-D has a similar size, TI AM3354 SoC, and 512MB RAM as the Pepper 43R and 43C (see above), but has a much lower price and a different layout and purpose. Instead of supporting touchscreens, the Pepper DVI-D features an HDMI port (via DVI-D) to support HD output instead of 720p. Other features include a microSD slot, GbE port, audio jack, console port, USB host port, and dual micro-USB device ports. As with the Pepper 43 boards, images are available for Yocto, Ubuntu, and Android. A community portion of the site shared with other Gumstix developers provides projects and tutorials. Like the other Peppers, the SBC is designed with the Gumstix Geppetto DIY design service, and supports further user customization of I/O using Geppetto. You can then send your design to the related Gumstix Geppetto short-run, fast-turnaround manufacturing service.   PICO-IMX6UL-KIT Company/project — Wandboard.org; Technexion; NXP LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 UltraLite (1x Cortex-A7 @ 528MHz); WXGA graphics Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $65 The sandwich-style PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is last year’s HobbitBoard rebranded and enhanced with 512MB RAM. Instead of supporting Google’s Brillo OS, it comes pre-loaded with Google’s revamped version of Brillo, called Android Things. The PICO-IMX6UL-KIT appears to be the de facto reference platform for the IoT-oriented OS, which also supports the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Intel Edison. Like the HobbitBoard and the almost identical NXP I.MX6UL Development Platform [PDF], the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is based on TechNexion’s PICO-IMX6UL COM (sold by NXP as the NXP Pico). Despite its commercial foundations, the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT’s COM and carrier have been released with full schematics and open licensing. Aside from the RAM and the OS, the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is identical to the HobbitBoard, and features a low-power i.MX6 UltraLite (UL), plus WiFi, BT 4.0, 10/100 Ethernet, dual USB ports, an audio jack, and a PMIC. The COM can be removed and plugged into the 70-pin Hirose socket on an Intel Edison carrier. When connected to the 100 x 45mm PICO-IMX6UL-KIT carrier, the Edison connector remains active. The board also offers a MikroBus socket for Click add-ons, as well as four Wandboard-compatible board-to-board expansion headers. The kit goes for as high as $90, but can be found for $65 at ARMkits.   Pine A64 Company/project — Pine64, Inc. LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 cores @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB (standard), 1GB ($19 Plus), 2GB ($29 Plus) DDR3 RAM Price — $15 to $29 This quad-core, 64-bit Raspberry Pi imitator broke new price/performance ground when it arrived last spring, and it’s still very competitive. Standard features include microSD, HDMI, Fast Ethernet, audio, dual USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB ports. The 127 x 79mm board offers a Pi-compatible, 40-pin connector and a 14-pin Euler connector. There’s also an RTC and -20 to 70°C support. The $15 model ships with 512MB RAM, but we recommend the $19 or $29 Plus models, available in 1GB and 2GB configurations, respectively. These higher-end models also boost Ethernet to GbE, and add a touchpanel interface, MIPI-DSI and MIPI-CSI ports, plus display and camera options. Curated OS mainline Linux based images include Android 6.0/7.1, Remix OS 2.0, Debian Jesse Mate, and Ubuntu 16.04 in Mate, Base, and minimal images. The board is further compatible with openSUSE, Armbian, Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and more. In January, Pine64 released a SODIMM-style SoPine A64 COM featuring the guts of the Pine A64. It also launched an open source Pinebook laptop based on the same A64 processor, sold for $89 (11.6-inch) or $99 (14-inch).   Raspberry Pi Zero Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2835 (1x ARM1176JZFS core @ 1GHz) with FPU and VideoCore IV dual-core GPU Memory — 512MB SDRAM Price — $5 and up Even when factoring in $5 to $25 more to add various cables and adapters — we’re calling it $14 in our comparison spreadsheet — the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero is still a good deal for space-constrained IoT hacking projects. The tiny, 65 x 30mm Zero upgrades the same ARM11 processor found on the Raspberry Pi A+ and B+ to 1GHz speed. The COM-like SBC ships with a microSD slot, a pair of micro-USB ports, and a mini-HDMI port with audio support, as well as an unpopulated composite video header. Missing are all the USB ports, DSI and CSI ports, and audio jacks found on the Pi 2 and 3.   Raspberry Pi Zero W Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2835 (1x ARM1176JZFS core @ 1GHz) with FPU and VideoCore IV dual-core GPU Memory — 512MB SDRAM Price — $10 and up The new Raspberry Pi Zero W is identical to the RPi Zero except for the addition of the same Cypress CYW43438 wireless chip found on the $35 Raspberry Pi 3, providing 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 with BLE. The Zero W is available starting at only $10 at outlets like Cana Kit and BuyaPi, but you need the same add-ons as the Zero to get real-world video and USB ports.   Raspberry Pi 2 Model B 1.2 Company/project — Raspberry Pi Trading LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2836 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 900MHz) or on v1.2 model, Broadcom BCM2837 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 900MHz); Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU @ 250MHz Memory — 1GB SDRAM Price — $35 Last October, the Raspberry Pi 2 was revised with a v1.2 model, replacing the quad -A7 based BCM2836 with the same quad-core, Cortex-A53 BCM2837 used on the Raspberry Pi 3. However, the SoC is still clocked to 900MHz instead of 1.2GHz, and the board lacks the RPi 3’s WiFi and Bluetooth module. Otherwise the RPi 2 is almost identical to the faster, wireless-enabled RPi 3, but with no price discount.   Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM43437 (4x Cortex-53 @ 1.2GHz); Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU @ 400MHz Memory — 1GB SDRAM Price — $35 The world’s most popular Linux hacker SBC — and the runaway winner of our 2016 survey — is commonly marked up, but it’s still found at the official $35 price at outlets like Circuit Specialists. The Raspberry Pi 3 gives you everything the new RPi 2 v1.2 does at the same price, and adds a higher clock speed plus WiFi and Bluetooth. Some other boards with the same RPI expansion compatibility can beat it on price, performance, and features, and many are more open source than RPi 3, which like its siblings does not provide complete schematics or open source licensing. Yet, if you want guaranteed Raspberry Pi compatibility (and dependability), and membership in the thriving community, this is still your top pick. Last week, the Raspberry Pi Foundation doubled down on its original educational mission by merging with CoderDojo, a non-profit that organizes learn-to-code clubs for kids 7-17. Practically, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is becoming a corporate member of the CoderDojo Foundation, but will otherwise maintain its identify and association with the commercial Raspberry Pi Trading entity.   Rico Board Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI AM437x (1x Cortex-A9 core @ up to 1GHz); PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM (alternatively 256MB or 1GB); 4GB eMMC flash Price — $99 ($149 for full kit with cables etc.) MYIR’s open-spec, 100 x 65mm Rico Board taps TI’s single-core, Cortex-A9, Sitara AM437x SoC. The SBC integrates HDMI, GbE, and dual USB ports, as well as a 24-bit LCD interface that supports optional 7-inch touchscreens. You also get camera interfaces and dual 40-pin expansion connectors with support for CAN and other industrial I/O.   RioTboard Company/project — Newark Element14, RioTboard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo (1x Cortex-A9 @ up to 1GHz) Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $79 The RioT (“Revolutionizing the Internet of Things”) board runs Android or Linux on a low-power, single-core Cortex-A9 SoC. The 120 x 75mm SBC offers several advantages over the similar Wandboard Solo, including twice the RAM, built-in flash, and many more USB ports.   SAMA5D4 Xplained Company/project — Newark Element14, Atmel LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Atmel SAMA5D4 (1x Cortex-A5 @ 528MHz) Memory — 512MB DDR2 RAM; 512MB NAND flash Price — $93.50 SAMA5D4 Xplained is a collaboration between Atmel’s Linux4SAM developers site and Newark Element14. The Linux-ready, IoT-focused SBC showcases Atmel’s SAMA5D4 SoC, which like the earlier SAMA5D3, is limited to a single Cortex-A5 core. The SAMA5D4 adds NEON, L2 cache, and security features, and several models support 720p video. The 138 x 88mm Xplained board ships with 512MB each of RAM and NAND flash, and offers partial Arduino compatibility. You also get HDMI, Fast Ethernet, and three USB ports.   SavageBoard Company/project — Poslab Technology LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo, DualLite, or Quad (1x, 2x, or 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Vivante CG880 GPU Memory — 512MB (Solo) or 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB (Solo) or 8GB eMMC Price — $59 (Solo); $79 (DualLite); $99 (Quad) The aging, but recently revised, Wandboard now has direct competition from the similarly configured, i.MX6 based SavageBoard. The 125 x 95mm SBC is larger than the Wandboard and lacks the Wandboard Quad’s 2GB of RAM, but it’s $20 cheaper. Unlike the Wandboard, the SavageBoard offers onboard eMMC storage, although it lacks the Wandboard’s second microSD slot. Among other differences, the SavageBoard’s SDIO/UART connected WiFi and Bluetooth module is a $35 option whereas wireless is standard on the DualLite and Quad WandBoards. The SavageBoard lacks the Wandboard’s user-available mini-PCIe slot, as well as its S/PDIF audio interface, although it does provide MIPI-DSI in addition to HDMI and MIPI-CSI ports. Other features are similar, including a GbE port, 2x USB 2.0 ports, micro-USB OTG port, and COM and audio ports. BSPs are available for Android 6.0, Yocto Project, and Arch Linux. Poslab also has posted a page on its website for an apparently open source HobbitBoard. The SBC is said to be available, but has no price or shopping page. The HobbitBoard is nothing like Wandboard.org’s former Brillo-on-i.MX6 UltraLite based board of the same name, now rebranded as an Android Things based PICO-IMX6UL-KIT SBC (see blurb farther above). The HobbitBoard is based on the SavageBoard, but with a different mix of features.   Seeeduino Cloud Company/project — SeeedStudio LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS 24kc @ 400MHz); Atmel ATmega32u4 MCU @ 16MHz Memory — 64MB RAM; 16MB flash; 32KB flash for MCU Price — $70 SeeedStudio’s Seeeduino Cloud Arduino Yun clone is a variation on its Seeeduino Arduino clone, and similarly adds Arduino support and the ability to connect the company’s Grove sensor and I/O add-ons. By integrating Dragino’s HE computer-on-module, the Seeeduino Cloud provides a Yun-like Atheros AR9331 WiFi subsystem that runs OpenWrt Linux. Other features include 10/100 Ethernet, USB host, micro-USB, 20x DIO pins, 7x PWM channels, and 12x analog inputs. Like the Seeeduino, the Seeeduino Cloud eases the interface between Arduino firmware and complex web services, in this case via a YunBridge library that delegates all network connections and processing of HTTP transactions to the Linux machine.   Tinker Board Company/project — Asus LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Rockchip RK3288 (4x Cortex-A17 @ 1.8GHz); Mali-T760 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM Price — $60 Asus’ Tinker Board is the first open spec hacker SBC from a major PC manufacturer, and the first Rockchip-based hacker board with a Raspberry Pi style size, layout, feature set, and 40-pin connector. The RPi 3 is $25 cheaper, but the Tinker Board has advantages like a faster, although still 32-bit, RK3288 SoC, a more powerful Mali T760 GPU, twice the RAM, and GbE instead of Fast Ethernet. It also supports upscaled 4K/30fps playback. RPi3-like features include WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and 4x USB 2.0 ports plus microSD, micro-USB, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, and MIPI-DSI interfaces. There’s no dedicated community site or forum as of yet, but the board is available with schematics, 2D and 3D drawings, and other open-spec resources, as well as a FAQ. The only currently available image is the Debian-based, LXDE desktop ready TinkerOS, but Android support is in the works.   Udoo Neo Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 SoloX (1x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Cortex-M4 MCU; Vivante GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3L RAM (1GB on Plus version) Price — $49.90 (Basic) $59.90 (Extended), $64.90 (Full) Like the larger Udoo Quad/Dual SBCs, the IoT-focused, 85 x 59mm Udoo Neo runs Linux or Android on a Cortex-A9-based i.MX6. The Neo, however, is optimized for the single-core i.MX6 SoloX variant, tapping its Cortex-M4 MCU to mimic an Arduino. The specs differ slightly from the Kickstarter package referenced in the news link above. The Udoo Neo Basic provides Ethernet, microSD, USB host, micro-USB OTG, micro-HDMI, LVDS with touch, and a Parallel camera interface. There’s also an Arduino connector, as well as GPIO, UART, CAN, PWM, I2C, and SPI interfaces. For $10 more, the Neo Extended bumps the RAM to 1GB, adds 3-axis motion sensors, and replaces Ethernet with a WiFi/Bluetooth module. The Neo Full is identical to the Extended, but offers both Ethernet and wireless.   Udoo Quad / Dual / Dual Basic Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Quad or DualLite (4x or 2x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz with Vivante GPUs); Atmel SAM3X8E Cortex-M3 MCU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 (Dual Basic); $115 (Dual); $135 (Quad) Seco’s Udoo project offers three SKUs for its flagship Udoo board. They all measure 110 x 85mm, and are enhanced with a Cortex-M3 based Arduino Due subsystem. The Udoo Dual Basic and Udoo Dual provide the dual-core i.MX6 DualLite while the Quad has the quad-core i.MX6 with a higher-end Vivante GPU. The Dual Basic supplies microSD, HDMI, LVDS with touch, audio, and CSI connections, along with dual USB host and dual micro-USB ports, one of which is OTG. There are 76 GPIO pins in addition to the Arduino interface. The Udoo Dual adds WiFi and GbE connections, and the Quad also adds SATA.   Udoo X86 Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Braswell quad-core SoCs (Basic: Atom x5-E8000 @ up to 2.0GHz; Advanced and Advanced Plus: Celeron N3160 @ up to 2.24GHz; Ultra: Pentium N3710 @ up to 2.56GHz); Intel Gen 8-LP GPU Memory — 2GB (Basic) or 4GB (Advanced/Plus) or 8GB (Ultra) DDR3L RAM; 32GB eMMC on Advanced Plus and Ultra Price — Basic $125; Advanced $149; Advanced Plus $165; Ultra $259) The delayed, Kickstarter-backed Udoo X86 SBC finally shipped to backers in March, and is now publicly available. All but the $259 Ultra version with a quad-core Atom X5-E8000 are eligible under our $200 limit. This is the most fully open source of any of the new wave of third-party, non Intel/AMD backed x86 hacker board projects. Since our initial coverage, Seco’s Udoo project has added a Pentium N3710 based “Ultra” version with 8GB RAM and 32GB eMMC. The N3710 is from the same 14nm Intel Braswell family as the Advanced versions’ Celeron and Basic models’ Atom. The SoCs range from 5-6W TDP power consumption, which is low for the x86 world. The Udoo X86 also includes an Intel Curie chip with a Quark MCU. The feature list on this 120 x 85mm device is too extensive to cover here, but highlights include M.2, SATA III, HDMI, 2x DP, wireless, and GPIO. It runs Linux, Android, and Windows 7/8.1/10.   UP board Company/project — Aaeon; UP Community LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Atom x5-Z8350 (4x Cherry Trail @ 1.44GHz/1.92GHz burst); Intel HD 400 Graphics Memory — 1GB or 2GB DDR3L RAM; 16GB eMMC Price — $89 (1GB) or $99 (2GB) The UP board shipped in time for our 2016 survey, but we disqualified it for its lack of open source compliance. Like the more powerful UP Squared (see below), and upcoming, small-footprint UP Core version of the UP board, the original UP is not backed up with full schematics. Yet, the UP Community now offers far more extensive documentation, including some schematics, as well as open source downloads, and goes beyond the typical “community” site in offering tutorials and support. The UP board runs Yocto Project or Ubuntu Linux, Android 5.0, or Windows 10 on a quad-core, 1.44GHz/1.92GHz Atom x5-Z8350 of the 14nm Cherry Trail generation. A $149 4GB RAM version was briefly available, but has apparently sold out. The UP board used on the Intel RealSense Robotic Development Kit does offer 4GB. The 1GB and 2GB UP models are otherwise identical. The 85.6 × 56.5mm board not only looks like a Raspberry Pi, but it offers a 40-pin expansion bus via an Altera MAX V CPLD that is said to provide RPi 2 compatibility. The UP features 16GB eMMC, a GbE port, a USB 3.0 OTG port, 4x USB 2.0 ports, and two more USB 2.0 headers. The board is further equipped with HDMI, DSI, CSI, I2S, and eDP interfaces.   UP Squared Company/project — Aaeon; UP Community LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Celeron N3350 (2x Apollo Lake @ 1.1GHz/2.4GHz) or Pentium N4200 (4x Apollo Lake @ 1.1GHz/2.5GHz); Intel Gen9 HD 500/505 graphics; Altera Max 10 FPGA Memory — 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB LPDDR4; 32GB eMMC 5.0, expandable to 128GB Price — $145 (Celeron with 2GB), $169 (Celeron with 4GB), $219(Pentium with 4GB), or $269 (Pentium with 8GB and 64GB eMMC) The “Up2” (or “Up Squared”), which may be the most powerful hacker-friendly single board computer around, began shipping to Kickstarter backers only last week. It features dual-core Celeron or quad-core Pentium SoCs from Intel’s latest Atom-like “Apollo Lake” generation, although the Pentium SKUs are beyond our $200 limit. As noted in the UP board blurb above, the UP SBCs are not fully open source, but they come close. The 90 x 86mm Up Squared offers 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE ports, dual HDMI outputs, a SATA interface, M.2 support, and mini-PCIe expansion. You also get eDP, dual MIPI-CSI, 3x USB host ports, a micro-USB 3.0 OTG, and both a 60-pin GPIO and a 40-pin interface tied to an Altera Max 10 FPGA. OS support includes Linux (Ubuntu, Ubilinux, Yocto), Android Marshmallow, and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.   USB Armory Company/project — Inverse Path LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX53 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz) Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $123 (with USB host adapter); $112 (100 Euros) without This tiny (65 x 19mm), Crowd Supply funded SBC for secure computing applications features Trustzone security, USB emulation, and a secure boot feature that lets users apply verification keys that ensure only trusted firmware can be executed on a specific device. The fully open source USB Armory is limited to two real-world ports: a USB 2.0 OTG port and a microSD slot, but you can extend that with the adapter. Surprisingly, this thumbdrive-style SBC supports Android, as well as Linux. A 10-Euro host adapter is required for stand-alone rather than USB stick mode.   Wandboard Reload Company/project — Wandboard.org; Technexion LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo, DualLite, or Quad (1x, 2x, or 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Vivante GPU Memory — 512MB (Solo) 1GB (Dual), 2GB (Quad) DDR3 RAM Price — $79 (Solo); $99 (Dual); $129 Quad The venerable Wandboard, a modular, sandwich-style, COM+baseboard assembly featuring a replaceable compute module, was recently updated as a Wandboard Reload. The pricing is identical and the feature set is much the same. The Wandboard Reload adds the i.MX6 QuadPlus as an alternative to the Quad model, bringing an improved Vivante GC2000+ GPU. The SBC’s WiFi has been updated to 802.11ac and Bluetooth to 4.1 BLE. There’s a new PMIC, and Wandboard.org has fixed an HDMI EDID + CEC problem. Features include dual microSD slots, analog and S/PDIF audio, plus GbE, HDMI, camera, serial, USB, and USB OTG connections. The Dual lacks the Quad’s SATA connection, and the Solo also foregoes the WiFi and Bluetooth found on the Quad and Dual. The Wandboard now has head-to-head competition from a similar SavageBoard (see blurb farther above.)   Z-turn Board Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Xilinx Zynq-7010 or -7020 (2x Cortex-A9 cores @ 667MHz, plus FPGA) or optional Zynq-7020 Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 (7010) or $119 (7020) The Z-turn Board runs Linux on the Xilinx Zynq-7010 or -7020, which combine dual Cortex-A9 cores with different levels of FPGA circuitry. The 102 x 63mm SBC features HDMI, GbE, and dual mini-USB ports, as well as a variety of sensors, buzzers, switches, buttons, and LEDs. Dual 80-pin expansion connectors express the FPGA signals, and can be configured as LVDS pairs. A $139 kit version adds a power adapter, cables, and a 4GB data card.   Next Steps1.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Sports Smart bats and drones deliver more data to cricket fans Scott Collie June 1, 2017 Intel wants drones, VR and smart bats to improve cricket data tracking  View gallery - 5 images Smart technology has given amateur and professional sportspeople access to a huge array of data. The latest suite of smart sports gear from Intel is focused on delivering more info to cricket players and fans alike, with plans to bring drones, virtual reality and a bat sensor to life later this year. Drones NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW So much of cricket is dependent on the pitch, so being able to analyze how the 22-yard strip of grass in the middle of an oval will behave is invaluable – both for fans and players. Intel plans to outfit its Falcon 8 Drone with high-definition and infrared cameras for pre-game pitch reports, with information about grass cover, grass health and topology for commentators to use during broadcasts. The technology will be rolled out at the Champions' Trophy, which kicked off on June 1 in England. Bat Sensor The new bat sensor is powered by Intel Curie – a tiny module design to act as a low-power, multi-use brain for activewear. Sitting at the top of the handle, it's designed to track every shot a batsman plays. Cricket is an intensely technical game, and small tweaks to a batter's backswing, bat speed or follow-through can be the difference between an embarrassing walk back to the pavilion and a game-breaking century. The tech will be making its debut at the Champions Trophy, where information from the current batsman will be shared with commentators. It will also be available to consumers as "Speculur BatSense" in Australia, Britain, India and the USA in the second half of 2017. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," says Speculur Managing Director Atul Srivastava. "Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman's technique." Virtual Reality Bat tracking has more benefits than telling amateurs how poor their technique is. It will allow fans to slap on a VR headset and test their skills against a virtual bowler. The bat tracking technology will allow visitors to The Oval and Edgbaston to pretend they're out there with their heroes, and give them feedback about their bat speed, back-lift angle and a final score from the VR "session."

Both companies have been firing lawsuits after lawsuits at each other for quite some time now. It is undeniable that the relationship has now been strained especially after one calling the other “unfair” and the other retaliating with an import ban. Now, rumor has it that Apple has gained a new ally with regards to the iPhone 8 that may spell disaster to Qualcomm. Over the past few years, Apple has been dependent on Qualcomm to provide its products for Apple’s range of mobile devices. These are mostly broadband or wireless modems used on most of the iPhones in the market. Last year, Qualcomm has controlled the majority of supplies for the iPhone’s modems. The other part of the spectrum was held by Intel, with its subpar chips. Last year, however, Digitimes reports that the supply for wireless modems will be split equally between Qualcomm and Intel. Furthermore, the report also mentioned that Apple is planning on giving Intel much of the supply percentage by 2018. This could potentially mean the end of Qualcomm modem’s inside the future iPhone and iPad devices. Alleged iPhone 8 mockup unit (by Benjamin Geskin) The only real reason that Apple chose Qualcomm is the fact that it has the better technology when it comes to wireless modems. However, since the release of Intel’s XMM 7560 LTE modem, this will soon change. This is because the said chip is capable of reaching a theoretical 1GB bandwidth. The recent counter lawsuits against each other has certainly not helped Qualcomm’s reputation in this regard. It should be noted that Apple, early this year, withheld almost $1 billion of royalties to Qualcomm on the basis of unfair monopoly. After that, Qualcomm fired with a counter lawsuit regarding patents that are used on the iPhones and has sought to get the said devices banned in the United States. Because the court has ruled in favor of Apple, a few companies have started following suit by not paying royalties to Qualcomm. This has infuriated Qualcomm which leads us to the current predicament. Unless Qualcomm does something drastic about the matter, it risks losing quite a big chunk if its earnings. For more tech update, be sure to check us out at The Bitbag.

The move comes as another major planned tech project, the first element of a €1bn data centre campus planned for Dublin by internet giant Amazon, is also appealed to An Bord Pleanála. In 2015, Thomas Reid of Hedsor House in Kildare won a Supreme Court appeal against a decision by the High Court to allow the IDA to compulsorily acquire land he and his family had worked for more than a century. He sued the IDA and the State after an order was granted permitting the development agency to acquire the 72-acre property, which includes a farm and the Reid family home. Mr Reid did not want to sell his land. He claimed the decision to allow the acquisition of it was flawed and unfair and breached his property rights as well as his rights under the Constitution and European Convention of Human Rights. The IDA had argued it was entitled to acquire Mr Reid's lands under powers granted in the 1986 Industrial Development Act. But the Supreme Court found that the making of the compulsory purchase order in 2012 for Mr Reid's lands had gone beyond the powers of the Act. Last month, Kildare County Council approved plans by Intel Ireland to expand its mammoth facility in Leixlip that would put the Irish site in the running for a potential $4bn (€3.6bn) investment. But there's no immediate intention to build, as the Irish unit has to vie with other global Intel sites for investment. "The planning application is part of a strategic initiative by the Intel Ireland site to ensure that the designated campus is optimised and is in a competitively-placed position to compete for next generation investment within the Intel corporation when major future capital investment decisions are being considered," planners for Intel noted. An Bord Pleanála will make a decision by the end of September. It will also make a decision by that date in the appeal taken in the Amazon case. A key opponent of Apple's data centre project in Co Galway, Allan Daly, has appealed a decision by Fingal County Council to grant permission to Amazon for the first part of what could be a €1bn data centre project, amid energy usage concerns. Another objector, architect David Hughes, told An Bord Pleanála that the financial benefit derived from data centre jobs will be eclipsed by EU fines of up to €300m a year. He claims these could be levied if Ireland fails to meet a target of producing 40pc of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.

Two people living near the multinational’s factory in Leixlip have appealed a recent decision of Kildare Co Council to grant planning permission for a new state-of- the-art facility on the site. Local Labour TD Emmet Stagg expressed disappointment that objections to Intel’s plans had been lodged with An Bord Pleanála. It is estimated the project would create 3,000 jobs during the construction phase as well as 850 full-time jobs at Intel’s base at Collinstown Industrial Park in Leixlip. Intel sought planning permission for the development in November in what was effectively a revamp of planning permission it first secured in 2013. The latest proposed facility is about 50% smaller than the original plan but is still a massive 88,740 sq metres. The multinational, which employs 4,500 full-time staff, says the move is part of a strategic initiative to ensure its Leixlip campus is in a position to compete for a new generation of investment. Mr Stagg said Intel’s Irish operations were in competition with some of the company’s other facilities in Israel and the US. Intel bosses have still to decide the location of the new manufacturing plant estimated to be worth €3.6bn. The company, which has been based in Leixlip since 1990, has invested around €12bn in its Irish plant to date. READ MORE Visit the section home page here © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Print Email By Jim McGregor Jun 1, 2017 1:28 PM PT Just when PCs looked to be dying a slow, painful death, they became interesting again. As expected, this week's news coming from Computex in Taiwan is flush with new PCs and PC technologies, but is it enough to reinvigorate a market that has faced declining sales since 2011? The market peaked at just over 365 million units annually, and fell to 269 million units last year, according to Gartner. So, why all the excitement? The excitement is emerging from both the technology driving PCs and the applications leveraging the processing power of PCs. In terms of technology, the battle between AMD and Intel for processor supremacy has heated up again, along with a new core race. High-End Battle Impact AMD kicked off the new battle with its Ryzen processor, featuring up to eight CPU cores with 16 threads, the equivalent of 16 virtual cores. With significantly lower price points, AMD also lowered the starting price for a well-equipped gaming PC to less than $2,000. Intel has countered with a new line of Core i9 processors that will feature up to 18 cores and 36 threads -- but at a price tag that puts the price of the processor alone at around $2,000. In addition, the graphics processing unit soon will get a significant bump in performance, when AMD introduces new products on its Vega architecture and Nvidia launches products based on its Volta architecture. If that weren't enough, the I/O on PCs is being upgrading to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, and solid-state drives and memory are getting faster with larger capacities. While these extreme systems won't have much of an impact on average consumers in 2017, the impact of a performance battle at the high end of the market is that mainstream PCs will see new technologies and substantial bumps in performance at much lower price points starting in 2018. For people who want to be productive but are more focused on social media, entertainment and light gaming, Microsoft and Qualcomm are pushing the concept of an always-connected PC, leveraging the performance of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 mobile processor. Think of it as the Microsoft version of the Chromebook, but with the Windows 10 ecosystem and Windows Store, and similarly available from a variety of PC OEMs. VR and AR Ahead On the application side, gaming remains the application driving PC technology and market stability. In fact, gaming is the only area where PCs shipments actually have been growing. However, just on the horizon is a new generation of virtual reality and augmented reality head-mounted displays that hold the promise of improving the PC experience in just about every application -- from engineering and design to entertainment and gaming. This is the first new application well suited for the PC in a long time, because VR and AR require increasingly more processing, graphics and I/O capabilities than the industry can deliver today. More Power Users Despite all the activity around PCs, most industry forecasts still point to a down year in 2017. We haven't seen this much innovation in a tech segment in years, so why is the outlook for PCs still so negative? The answer lies in the dynamics of the market. The first thing to consider is the adoption rate of these new PCs. While gamers are anxious to be on the latest and greatest technology, other power users, like enterprises, have longer and planned upgrade cycles. This means that adoption cycles can take a year or two for new technologies. On the positive side, however, is that power users account for more than a third of the overall PC market, by some estimates, and the their ranks are growing. The shift to Windows 10 by consumers and enterprise users also bodes well for the overall PC segment next year. The second issue is the adoption of new applications and technologies. While VR and AR hold promise, the applications are still limited and evolving toward a must-have user experience. In addition, the cost of the high-end HMDs that provide that rich user experience currently are upwards of $800, well out of the price range of the average consumer. As the number of applications increases, the user experience improves, and as the technology evolves, prices will come down to a more reasonable $200-$300 price range, starting later this year. Finally, there is the competition from other platforms. While PCs are a great platform for VR and AR today, game consoles, mobile devices, and other platforms will offer viable alternatives in the future, especially as HMDs move to next generation high-speed WiFi and 5G wireless interfaces, starting later this decade. Keeping the Momentum Going The new surge in technology around the PC might abate the decrease in PC shipments and may even show an uptick in late 2017 and throughout 2018 as the new platforms are introduced and the technology is pushed down into more affordable price bands, in the view of Tirias Research. Products like the new Asus ROG Strix GL702ZC and the new Dell Inspiron gaming desktops announced at Computex, which are based on AMD technology, target lower price points than the traditional gaming platforms like Dell's Alienware products. The technology surge is a positive for the industry, as the same technology will be used for other platforms, ranging from medical systems to gaming consoles. However, the PC still needs to evolve in both form factor and usage models to sustain this brief surge in momentum. Jim McGregor is principal analyst at Tirias Research.

A major self-driving car trend from this year's CES was not how autonomous cars will work, but what passengers will do in them. A new study from Intel suggests not only how passengers will spend their time, but how much that time will be worth. Popular Searches Netflix Inc NFLX ▼ 162.99 -0.08 -0.05% Boeing Co BA ▼ 187.32 -0.31 -0.17% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 152.67 +0.04 +0.03% Moody's Corporation MCO ▲ 119.00 +0.55 +0.46% By 2050, the study says, self-driving vehicle services, including ride-hailing, cargo delivery and in-car entertainment, will be worth $7 trillion in what Intel calls the "passenger economy". Paying for a robo-taxi is just the tip of the iceberg in this major economic shift. The study, sponsored by Intel and written by research firm Strategy Analytics, proposes that passengers might use video conferencing for work or have a self-driving car go pick up lunch, making it ready for a meal on the road. The study's dollar figure takes into account advertising served to passengers, delivery services both heavy and light, and passenger time saved due to the fact that this technology allows for more efficient driving, with fewer traffic jams. The current transportation economy, including trucking and car services, is huge, but the need for human drivers means that people in vehicles usually must remain focused on the road. When reliable self-driving cars hit the market, currently projected for 2021, former drivers will be left with little to do. As the vehicles progress, automakers may even design cabins with more social seating, facing each other as opposed to looking forward. The Intel study predicts that all the time drivers currently spend during the daily commute will turn into free time. The largest chunk of the projected sum, about $3.7 trillion, will come from regular people using self-driving car services. Most of these people, representing about 50 percent of current drivers, will probably not own a personal car. Autonomous cargo delivery and other business services make up another $3 trillion slice of the pie, while new services, which could involve anything from a mobile manicure to meal-on-wheels accounts for another $200 billion. Journalist Greg Lindsay, brought in by Intel to comment on the study, said "self-driving cars will make as big of an impact on society as the advent of affordable cars did in the last century." He said that, as in-car time becomes more productive or enjoyable, people might opt for longer commutes and live further away from cities. Aside from the new passenger economy, the study notes that self-driving cars could save 535,000 lives between 2035 and 2045, due to their inherent safety, along with a savings of $234 billion over the same period in costs that would otherwise be caused by collisions. Intel entered the self-driving car fray earlier this year, opening its Autonomous Driving Garage in San Jose. It competes with other tech companies, such as Google and Nvidia, automotive equipment suppliers and automakers themselves.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple’s fight with Qualcomm could hurt the iPhone 8 Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 1st, 2017 at 5:42 PM Share Tweet Apple has been locked in a bitter dispute with Qualcomm, a major chip manufacturer that has historically supplied the wireless modems for the iPhone. According to a new report, Apple’s legal dispute with Qualcomm is going to have an effect on iPhone 8 components, and Apple might have to substitute some Qualcomm chips with Intel components. Given the inferior quality of the Intel chips in last year’s iPhone 7, that’s not good news. Don't Miss: 10 best new movies and shows coming to Netflix in June According to a Digitimes report, Apple will shift supply of iPhone baseband modems away from Qualcomm and towards Intel, starting this year. The report says that 50% of the iPhone 8 modems could be supplied by Intel, with that number rising to 70% for the 2018 iPhone lineup. Intel’s modems have historically been cheaper but worse-performing than Qualcomm’s solution. A worse modem means less power efficiency but also a worse cell signal with lower speeds — all important things for Apple, especially considering new LTE technologies are being deployed this year, and wireless speed is set to take on a new level of importance. Qualcomm generally supplies the modem for every Android flagship worth talking about, and the iPhone’s reputation is all about reliability and speed. Apple could be forced to make a bad choice here: make an unpleasant legal settlement with Qualcomm, which would likely eat into Apple’s profit margins; or accept an inferior component in nearly half of its brand-new iPhone range. Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm is related to the licensing fees Qualcomm charges for its patents. Qualcomm’s intellectual property is used inside every single iPhone — which Apple acknowledges — but Apple contends that Qualcomm charges unreasonably high patent fees. Apple has sued Qualcomm over the issue in the past, and even instructed its manufacturing partners like Foxconn to stop royalty payments to Qualcomm. The chip manufacturer has countersued in the Southern District of California; if the case there fails, Qualcomm could even take the issue to the US International Trade Commission, and seek a ruling banning the import of iPhones into the US. Nothing’s yet indicated that Qualcomm is prepared to go that far. But the rumors about Apple shifting as much of supply as possible away from Qualcomm is telling.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel shows how its Compute Card makes dumb appliances smart 06/01/2017 at 2:21 PM by Brad Linder 2 Comments Intel is starting to show what its upcoming Compute Card modules can do. The company has been stuffing PCs into smaller and smaller packages over the past few years, and that’s culminated in a device that’s not much larger than a credit card. First unveiled at CES earlier this year, Intel announced this week that the first Compute Stick devices are due to start shipping in August. And the company is providing the first real-world demonstrations of the platform for journalists at Computex in Taiwan. The Intel Compute Card isn’t designed to work as a standalone computer the same way that the company’s NUC or Compute Stick devices are. Instead, it’s a module that you can be used to turn a docking station into a PC, a dumb TV into a smart one, or a media player into an upgradeable device, among other things. It could also work as a computer module that you can carry with you throughout the day: slide it into a desktop dock at work or school, then take it home and put it in a laptop dock to access all your files, applications, and settings. Here are a few of the concepts/early designs Intel is showing off: LG, ECS, Sharp, and Dell are showing displays that become all-in-one Windows 10 desktops when you add a Compute Card. Smart Tech is showing a convertible laptop/tablet hybrid. Intel’s “Port Jefferson” dock adds all the ports you’d need to use the Compute Card as a desktop computer. There’s also a cash register prototype and a a rugged PC/router designed for use outdoors. Since each system relies on a removable card, it should be possible to upgrade hardware after you buy it. Or you could change operating systems or user environments by swapping out cards, allowing multiple people to use the same laptop, desktop, or display docking station with their own personal Compute Cards. You’ll most likely end up buying a Compute Card from the same company that makes a laptop/desktop/display dock for it rather than buying one from Intel. And it’s not entirely clear at this point if a module bought for a Dell device, for example, will work with an LG dock. While each Compute Card will have a standard interface, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some device makers try to lock down their system with DRM and/or a slot that only accepts cards with a specific shape. At launch Intel will offer Compute Modules with Celeron N3450, Pentium N4200, Core M3-7Y30, or Core i5-7Y57 chips. Each module supports 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2 and has 4GB of DDR3 RAM. The Celeron and Pentium models are based on Apollo Lake architecture and feature 64GB of eMMC storage. The Core/Kaby Lake-Y versions have 128GB of SSD storage. Prices are expected to range from about $140 to $450. MobileGeeks has a brief video showing some of the Compute Card-powered devices including a laptop, a convertible model, a tablet for use in medical environments, and a small desktop computer-style dock. Update: Roland Quandt has also posted a pretty great hands-on video that, among other things, shows what’s inside the case of a Compute Card: via Tom’s Guide, Engadget, The Inquirer, MobileGeeks, and PC Watch Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 2 Comments on "Intel shows how its Compute Card makes dumb appliances smart" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member zdanee Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

In mobile devices the trend is to non replaceable batteries, yet it is the battery that limits the device life. Perhaps this tech will reverse that trend!

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Your next notebook will run for days thanks to… Your next notebook will run for days thanks to Qualcomm — not Intel By Mark Coppock — Updated June 1, 2017 12:25 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: For the longest time — as in, forever – most notebooks have run some version of Windows on an Intel processor. A few machines have run with AMD inside rather than Intel, and MacBooks have run MacOS instead of Windows. But in general, your choices were limited to machines that ran hot, didn’t last all that long away from a plug, took a long time to boot up, and were connected to the internet on a part-time basis. Smartphones have changed all that, however. They turn on instantly, last a long time on a single battery charge, and are always connected. And it’s the mobile ARM processor that’s made all that possible. Intel has chased the smartphone ever since, introducing features like Intel Rapid Start in a partially successful quest to make PCs feel as responsive as smartphones. Now, there’s a version of Windows 10 that runs on ARM processors, specifically on Qualcomm’s latest system-on-chip (SoC), the Snapdragon 835. The combination promises significantly longer battery life on machines that start up as fast as smartphones, and packs in a LTE modem that keeps it connected to the internet on a full-time basis. That’s a nice vision of the future of truly mobile computing, but is it real? We’ve been down this road before, with Microsoft’s Windows RT platform that showed up on its original Surface tablet, and was then promptly put to death. What makes us think that this time around, Microsoft’s initiative will make a difference in how we use our Windows 10 machines? Yes, things really are different this time around If we want to predict if Windows 10 on ARM has a chance of being successful, then we need to discuss exactly why Windows RT was such a failure. There are two main reasons why, and we’re already seeing Microsoft, Qualcomm, and PC makers doing some things differently that could make instant-on, long-lasting, and always-connected Windows 10 notebooks a reality. Windows 10 on ARM will run all 16 million of the Windows desktop applications that people have come to know and love. First, Windows 10 on ARM will run all 16 million of the Windows desktop applications that people have come to know and love. The full version of Office 2016, Adobe’s professional suite of creativity applications, and niche software like AutoCAD will run on the platform this time around. Windows RT was limited to only the paltry apps in the Windows Store, in addition to a ported version of Office 2013. That wasn’t good enough. Second, it’s not just Microsoft working on the project. Qualcomm is fully on board, and at least three influential PC makers are already slated to make ARM-based Windows 10 systems. This forms an interesting alliance. Qualcomm wants to sell more processors, and the PC makers want to sell budget computers without paying for expensive Intel hardware. Everyone involved has reason to make Windows 10 work on ARM, and work well. What will ARM-based notebooks look like? This time around, ARM-based Windows 10 machines will offer real benefits that you’re going to love, without major drawbacks. To begin with, ARM processors use less power than Intel processors, which makes sense. They were designed for smartphones, which are all about squeezing as much battery life as possible out of much smaller battery capacities, while still providing decent performance. According to Qualcomm, ARM-based Windows 10 notebooks will provide up to 50 percent more battery life, and will last for 20 hours on average. It will turn the PC into a device you don’t need charged every day. Next, devices running ARM processors are instant-on. People demand that their smartphones wake up instantly — push the button, and they’re ready to go. The iPad and Android tablets have done this forever. Intel, Microsoft, and PC builders have made some headway into building notebooks that respond quickly, but their efforts are most visible in high-end hardware. People who buy budget computers – in other words, most people – must wait. Better still, ARM-based systems use very little power when in standby mode. Again, Windows notebooks have improved here, but smartphones remain the king of standby power. While a good notebook can last a week or more in standby, the Google Pixel smartphone can last 19 days. This, too, will help make ARM-powered Windows PCs last for days on a charge. Finally, ARM-based systems run cooler. That will enable exclusively fanless designs that run completely silently and won’t require unsightly venting and won’t subject their users to blasts of hot air. Some Intel-based systems are fanless as well, but they typically need to throttle performance more aggressively to keep things cool, and most such devices are expensive. ARM-based notebooks running Windows 10 will be thin and sleek, and they won’t weigh much. Many of them will be 2-in-1 devices, and allow the screen to be used independently as a tablet. In other words, they’ll probably look a lot like iPads, Android tablets, and Chromebooks – but they’ll run Windows 10, instead. What about the performance penalty? Windows 10 on ARM won’t match the performance of Intel’s latest Core processors, or AMD’s Ryzen. Aside from the fact those companies build more powerful, more power-hungry chips than Qualcomm, the way software is written is also an issue. Windows is coded for the x86 instruction set, which is what Intel and AMD chips understand. To make Windows 10 work on ARM hardware, Microsoft has written a comprehensive emulation layer. That is certainly going to result in a performance penalty. The size of the penalty is the biggest unanswered question. No one’s going to want a Qualcomm-powered Windows notebook if it feels slow. The real impact will be on low-end Windows notebooks, where ARM’s advantages are more important. Also, some of the largest and most complex applications, like Adobe’s professional video editing application, Premiere, and AutoCAD, which is used for rendering 3D images, already demand high-end, quad-core Intel Core i7 processors, lots of RAM, and fast GPUs for any kind of performance. Today’s ARM processors aren’t yet capable of matching Intel’s performance running these kinds of apps. However, high-end PCs aren’t the target. The real impact will be on low-end Windows notebooks, where ARM’s advantages are more important. What this means for you is that you will finally be able to use all your favorite Windows productivity, media consumption, and communications apps on a machine that can really last a full day on a single charge. You won’t have to wait for it to boot up, and you won’t have to worry about finding a Wi-Fi connection. Windows 10 on ARM is a big deal So, does Windows 10 on ARM matter? Yes, we think it does. It solves some problems that have plagued Windows notebooks for a long time, and it will likely do so for hundreds less than similar Intel-powered notebooks. In the meantime, you’ll still have those powerful Intel-based Windows 10 machines to choose from if you need to do 3D rendering in AutoCAD or play the latest games in VR and at high frame rates. Companies like Nvidia will keep working on initiatives like GeForce GTX with Max-Q Design to bring increasing levels of gaming performance to even more mobile devices. Gaming may in fact be the greatest weakness of Windows 10 on ARM, as it’s doubtful that games will run well on Qualcomm hardware, particularly after translated through emulation. For most people, though, Windows 10 on ARM will make for a better, more affordable experience, and it leaves plenty of room for Intel and others at the higher ends of the market. Choice is a good thing, and that’s what makes this new platform so important. While the timing of production notebooks powered by Qualcomm is still an open question, they’ll seriously disrupt the PC arena whenever they arrive. Unlike Windows RT, which could only run the more limited Windows Store applications, Windows 10 on ARM looks like the real deal.

Amid this constant news cycle of deals and drama, the purpose of all of it can get lost — or at least a bit muddied. What exactly are these companies racing for? A $7 trillion annual revenue stream, according to a study released Thursday by Intel. The companies that don’t prepare for self-driving risk failure or extinction, Intel says. The report also finds that over half a million lives could be saved by self-driving over just one decade. The study, prepared by Strategy Analytics, predicts autonomous vehicles will create a massive economic opportunity that will scale from $800 billion in 2035 (the base year of the study) to $7 trillion by 2050. An estimated 585,000 lives could be saved due to autonomous vehicles between 2035 and 2045, the study predicts. By 2050, business use of mobility as a service will generate about $3 trillion in revenue This “passenger economy,” as Intel is calling it, includes the value of the products and services derived from fully autonomous vehicles as well as indirect savings such as time. This is hardly the first attempt to place value on autonomous vehicles, nor will it be the last. However, Intel’s study offers a few interesting predictions for autonomous vehicles and how a combination of mobile connectivity, population density in cities, traffic congestion and subsequent regulation, and the rise of on-demand ride-hailing and car-sharing services will be the catalysts in this new economic era. Of course, Intel has a vested interest in rosy predictions about the future of autonomous transportation. The chipmaker has promised to spend $250 million over the next two years to develop self-driving technology, and recently acquired Jerusalem-based auto vision company Mobileye for an eye-popping $15 billion. And Intel is working with BMW to put self-driving cars on the road later this year. So when Intel pays for a study that predicts self-driving cars will cause cash to rain from the sky, it should be seen as equal parts industry analysis and wishful thinking. Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries, the study predicts, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector. These autonomous vehicles will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors, says Strategy Analytics president Harvey Cohen, who co-authored the study. This will relieve driver shortages, a chronic problem in the industry, and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues. One of the bolder predictions is that public transportation as we know it today — trains, subways, light rails, and buses — will be supplanted, or at least radically changed, by the rise of on-demand autonomous vehicle fleets. People will flock to suburbs as population density rises in city The study argues that people will flock to suburbs as population density rises in city centers, pushing commute times higher and “outstripping the ability of public transport infrastructure to fully meet consumer mobility needs.” The pressures of mounting traffic congestion and the correlated emissions will drive regulators to include autonomous vehicles as a part of their larger public transportation plans. Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation, the study says. The bulk of the revenue generated in the new economy will be driven by this “mobility-as-a-service.” By 2050, business use of mobility as a service will generate about $3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use will account for $3.7 trillion, or 53 percent, the study predicts. The remaining $200 billion in revenue (of the $7 trillion total) will be generated by new applications and services as driverless vehicle services expand. A key opportunity will be how to capitalize on all of this saved time people will have once they no longer have to drive a car. Vehicles could become “experience pods” Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world, the study says. That’s a lot of time that could be filled with streaming video, news, and other content delivered to a captured audience. It could also change the way cars are used. Vehicles could become “experience pods,” places where people can have their hair styled and cut, conduct a meeting, or receive a health screening. Keep in mind, that this reimagined future doesn’t mean people will necessarily spend less time in cars. One of the great promises of self-driving cars is a reduction in congestion because these vehicles will be able share real-time traffic data and optimize tasks like finding parking. However, in a more densely populated world, where cities rely on shared autonomous vehicles for public transit, there will be more traffic than ever before. The question is: how do people want to spend their time?

G.Skill floors it and cranks its DIMMs to 4800 MT/s by Wayne Manion  3:00 PM on June 1, 2017 Intel's X299 high-end desktop platform has a lot to offer PC enthusiasts, but the HEDT ecosystem is incomplete without high-speed memory modules. G.Skill demonstrated a number of new products at Computex that look to occupy all availabe X299 niches. At least some X299 buyers are going to run their memory in dual-channel mode. Intel's Kaby Lake-X chips only have two memory channels to work with, and Skylake-X overclockers might choose to leave two channels unoccupied when chasing high clock rates. G.Skill has shown off its Trident Z DDR4-4800 CL19 16GB (2 x 8 GB) kit, capable of running with tight CL19-19-19-39 timings. The demo system was built with ASRock's X299 OC Formula motherboard. Some folks need some bling to go with their high-speed memory, and G.Skill showed off its Trident Z RGB DDR4-4400 16GB (2 x 8 GB) to that crowd. G.Skill touts the kit as the fastest memory on the block with RGB LEDs. The DIMMs' timings are set at CL19-19-19-39. For this set, G.Skill's demo system was assembled using Gigabyte's X299 SOC Champion motherboard. I would imagine most X299 buyers want their system to have a lot more than 16 GB of memory. Someone at G.Skill must think along the same lines, because the company also showed off the Trident Z RGB DDR4-4200 64 GB (8 x 8 GB) kit, which, as the long-winded name suggests, consists of eight rainbow-lit 8 GB DDR4 DIMMs running at 4200 MT/s. Timings are a bit looser at CL19-21-21-41, but having 64 GB of RAM spread across eight sticks in the same system at that speed is an impressive feat. This particular demo system was built around an Asus Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard, suggesting that such feats may is possible on "entry-level" X299 boards. Buyers might also want DIMMs larger than 8 GB each. G.Skill meets this demand with its Trident Z RGB DDR4-4000 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) kit, which has a pair of 16 GB modules running at 4 GT/s. Timings are extra-tight at CL17-18-18-38. The demo system for these modules used another ASRock X299 OC Formula board. Intel's X299 chipset hasn't made an appearance in laptops yet, but G.Skill didn't want to leave laptop buyers out of the party. The company showed off an EVGA SC17 gaming laptop packed with two 16 GB 3466 MT/s DDR4 modules running at CL16-18-18-43 timings, for a total of 32 GB of RAM. G.Skill did not provide pricing or availability information for any of the new high-speed kits. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The Compute Card comes packed with the full functionality of a standard computer, including an SoC, connectivity, storage, and memory in one slim device. The device slots into a range of devices from laptops, tablets, and AIOs to interactive refrigerators and IoT gateways. The devices can be ejected and replaced, thus decoupling compute from the device and allowing for easy upgrades as the card evolves into more powerful variants. That could also make for interesting new laptop platforms with longer shelf lives. Intel Compute Card SKUs   CD1IV128MK CD1M3128MK CD1P64GK CD1C64GK CPU Core i5-7Y57 Core m3-7Y30 Pentium N4200 Celeron N3450 Memory 4GB DDR3 Storage 128GB Intel SSD 64GB eMMC Connectivity Intel Wireless-AC 8265 (2×2 .11ac & Bluetooth 4.2) Intel Wireless-AC 7265 (2×2 .11ac & Bluetooth 4.2) The Compute Card family offers processors that span from Core to Celeron and come in four SKUs. Each respective product has varying compute, storage, and connectivity options, though the processor serves as the only differentiation between the two high-end options. Aside from listing the processors, Intel hasn't given us an indication of performance. Intel has signed on a bevy of partners to develop new products that leverage the device, including Contec, ECS, Foxconn, LG Display, MoBits Electronics, NexDock, Sharp, Seneca, SMART Technologies, Suzhou Lehui Display, and TabletKiosk. Many of these partners will have products on display at Computex 2017. Dell, HP, and Lenovo are also working on new products, but have yet to reveal any of the end devices. Intel also released its Compute Card Device Design Kit, which is a set of guides and reference designs that simplify and speed up the product development process. In many ways Intel's Compute Card signifies the company's continued push for product diversification as it delves into IoT, automated driving, and other lucrative climes. In this case, its efforts also further its objectives in the mobility space, as we can expect new laptops and AIOs to come to market with the new cards installed. The Compute Card will begin shipping in August 2017, but Intel hasn't revealed pricing info.

Reply bobbozzo - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link Hi, what interfaces are available on the card to the docks? PCIe or USB or ? Reply CharonPDX - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Per the original announcement: "The “flexible I/O” is not Thunderbolt (obviously, due to power consumption concerns), but it handles USB, PCIe, HDMI, DisplayPort connectivity and has some extra pins for future/proprietary use." The physical port consists of a standard USB type C port with an "extension" next to it that is about twice as wide as a type C port. They have not yet published (that I can find) the pinout of that extension. Presumably the type C port contains all standard type C functionality - power, USB, and display. I would guess that either the extension contains PCIe connectivity by itself, or that it's really a "not fully compliant" Thunderbolt 3 port plus an extension for added functionality. Reply cfenton - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link It would be pretty cool to be able to upgrade your laptop's CPU without replacing the whole thing. Though, at this performance level it would be a huge downgrade from my current laptop. Maybe someday. Reply smilingcrow - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link Upgrading the CPU on a laptop used to be possible on most prior to the move to Ultrabooks and other fetishistic portable computing devices. Reply name99 - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link Its almost like the key to FASTER LOWER POWER devices is to put more and more functionality closer and closer together, ideally on the same chip...

It has both WiDi and HDMI-out to a monitor. So we got them, albeit a few years late. I'm not sure what your point is though. If you don't have a use for these that's great. Others will. Does every single product in existence have to benefit you specifically for it to have value? Because honestly, the world doesn't really care whether Bullwinkle J Moose thinks these are a good idea or not, let alone if he personally is going to buy them.

By Tiernan Ray June 1, 2017 1:47 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Canaccord Genuity’s Matthew Ramsay today offers up his views on the announcements this week at the Computex computer conference in Taipei, Taiwan, from the Big Three: Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Ramsay, who has a Hold rating on Intel stock, and Buy ratings on Nvidia and AMD, nevertheless finds that all three made some impressive announcements this week. On the Intel side of things, he notes the company’s announcement of new “Core X” parts for "high-end” personal computers, writing that "Core X-series is an impressive lineup." Among its virtues, the Core X “hits all pricing tiers,” at $242 to $1,999, which is good, and it’s “the most capable high-end desktop platform from Intel to date." Still, he thinks AMD can take desktop share from Intel with the “Ryzen” parts it has put out this year: While we believe Intel will maintain dominant market share and a sustainable leading position in the CPU market in terms of software breadth and raw CPU performance (enhanced further by Optane SSD support in certain applications including gaming), we believe AMD's new 14nm Ryzen processor lineup offers both competitive performance metrics and aggressive pricing and could take incremental share from Intel starting in Q3/17. Things are improving for Intel, but it’s still a wait-and-see story for the company and its stock overall, as far as he’s concerned: Combined with the launch of certain 10nm notebook products and the new Skylake/Purley server platform, we anticipate stronger 2H/17 results for Intel overall. However, while we concede Intel shares generate a strong yield and remain inexpensive, we believe shares could remain range bound as overall gross margins stagnate and until investors see proof that new investments in 10/7nm, FPGAs, auto, IoT and memory are capable of generating strong returns within a reasonable horizon. For AMD, he was surprised that the company didn’t give more details on its “ThreadRipper” chip, first disclosed at its analyst day two weeks ago, which is the part that’s comparable to Intel’s Core X: In light of Intel's announcement during Computex of its Core X- series of high performance CPUs including its ultra high end i9 topping out at 18 cores and 36 threads (at a $1,999 ASP), we had hoped AMD's management would discuss pricing details for their ultra high end Threadripper processors. While no pricing details were discussed, we believe AMD will aggressively price Threadripper and believe the inclusion of 64 lanes of PCIe I/O will prove an important feature. He liked a presentation on the company’s forthcoming notebook part, Ryzen Mobile: EVP Jim Anderson from the C&G group demonstrated for the first time publicly Ryzen Mobile, the ultra-portable APU, with 4 cores, 8 threads and Vega architecture-based graphics in a sub-15mm thickness notebook. We believe the Ryzen Mobile adds strategic flexibility to the rapidly growing notebook gaming segment for AMD, but will face tougher competition versus Intel's 10nm designs in 2H/18. And he’s enthusiastic about AMD CEO Lisa Su’s discussion of OEM partnerships for Ryzen-based PCs: CEO Lisa Su announced partnerships with all of the top global PC OEMs (Acer, Asus, Dell, Lenovo and HP) to have Ryzen CPU-based designs in the market by the end of Q2'17, ranging from high end gaming towers to notebooks to all-in-ones, powered by both Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 desktop processors with many also featuring AMD GPUs. We believe these partnerships and channel strength further solidifies our conviction in the Zen core lineup as we look towards 2H'17 to deliver strong sales growth and margin expansion. Also, the release date of June 20th was announced for the “Epyc” server chip that was also introduced at the analyst day. "While we model under $100M in EPYC revenue this year,” writes Ramsay, "we believe the more important ramp will materialize in 2018 as OEM systems begin shipment and believe a $1B+ server business is achievable by 2020." For Nvidia, Ramsay notes the introduction of “HGX,” a “reference design” to help computer makers construct servers for artificial intelligence computing, which others have commented on. And there was also the debt of “Max-Q,” a set of designs for gaming laptop computers. "As competitor AMD begins to market integrated CPU/GPU single-chip gaming systems, we believe the Max-Q program will prove critical for NVIDIA to maintain leading market share in the emerging gaming notebook market." He likes both announcements: "While neither announcement changes our overall thesis or estimates, we do believe both announcements continue to broaden the NVIDIA ecosystem and increase the runway for Pascal and Volta adoption in gaming notebooks and in the datacenter."

Intel spent several billion dollars - the exact amount is a closely guarded secret - to build and equip a massive Hillsboro factory designed for new generations of computer microprocessors. The chipmaker hired Hoffman Construction in 2010 as the general contractor for the enormous project, called D1X, and court documents show it ordered the company to move rapidly. Work did proceed quickly, according to legal filings. Intel wrapped up the first phase in 2013 and is now developing its next generation of 10 nanometer computer chips there. Construction on a second phase called "Mod 2" began in 2012 and is largely complete, awaiting future iterations of computer technology. Together, the two phases constitute more than 2 million square feet of clean rooms to develop and produce computer chips, plus more than 1 million square feet in associated support buildings. It's the most advanced factory of its kind in the world and among the biggest. Somewhere along the line, though, something went wrong between Intel and Hoffman. The construction firm placed a $50.8 million lien on D1X in 2015, according to Washington County records. Nearly two years later, records show, the lien remains in place. Meanwhile, a complaint filed this year by another contractor indicates Intel and Hoffman are in private arbitration related to what Hoffman charged Intel for changes in construction plans. Details of that dispute are not public, and it's not clear whether that dispute led to the 2015 lien. Intel declined comment. Hoffman and attorneys for the companies did not respond to requests for comment. Attorneys say liens are common in construction disputes, sometimes merely to preserve the option of additional legal action later. And while the amount of the lien is large in this case, it's proportionate to the scale of the project. "In the construction environment, the proceedings tend to be a little more adversarial than in some other settings," said Darien Loiselle, a partner at the Portland law firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt, which does not represent any party in this case. "Liens are used to ensure that validly established claims are in fact paid because the liens attach to the real property if properly litigated," Loiselle said in a written statement. "These claims also allow for a statutory right to attorney fees and costs for the prevailing party, a right that may not otherwise exist under the contract between the parties. Parties asserting them also do so often as a bold statement about the merits of the claim being pursued. " Hoffman's lien on Intel's Ronler Acres campus does not contain details of its dispute with Intel, and the companies' arbitration proceedings are private. However, some issues are visible through a related case brought by another contractor, Harder Mechanical Contractors. The Hillsboro Tribune noted that case in May. In its complaint, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Harder alleges that Intel and Hoffman were sharing some of Harder's proprietary information during arbitration to settle a dispute. Harder's filing indicates that "change orders issued by Hoffman resulted in a dispute between Hoffman and Intel regarding the price Hoffman was charging Intel for Hoffman's work on the Mod 2 project." According to Harder's complaint, Intel and Hoffman disagreed on how to value labor costs and are seeking to resolve their dispute out of court, through the American Arbitration Association. It's not clear from Harder's filing whether the dispute over labor costs is what prompted Hoffman to file the $50 million lien against Intel, or the status of the dispute between the companies.

(CSCO) and eBay Inc (EBAY) The charts aren't favoring INTC or CSCO stock, but EBAY shares indicate a buying opportunity Jun 1, 2017, 12:45 pm EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group     View All   The technology sector has been one of the better groups to be trading this year, as the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 are outpacing the S&P 500 by more than double. While technology stocks have performed well as a group, some of the more notable names have been stuck in a bearish rut that has potential to worsen. Today’s three big stock charts look closely at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), as their charts indicate technical tests that may lead to more selling and in one case, an opportunity to “buy the dip.” Intel Corporation (INTC) The semiconductor sector has been on fire for the year, as the group has returned more than 15% year-to-date. Despite the sector performance, Intel has remained a relative strength laggard and it appears that the situation could get worse. After a mixed earnings results, INTC stock vacillated around $37 before the sellers stepped in to take shares to their current $36 and change. This is a critical technical test for Intel shares and their near-term outlook. Intel’s 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages all reside between the prices of $36.00 and $36.20, staging a technical test that will determine the next 5-10% move for INTC stock. A break below these technical trendlines will target $34 for Intel stock, as the sellers will react to the triple technical break, which should be able to provide enough support for this technology bellwether. The bull case, which is less likely, is that INTC stock finds support for a short period of time and rallies from the triple-barreled support. In this case, the stock should target a short trip to $37 and then reverse back to another critical test, which would be more likely to fail. Bottom line is that there are much better stocks to pick from within this sector other than the best-known name of Intel. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Another tech giant that is struggling to keep up with the market and its peers is Cisco Systems. The networking giant has spent years trying to nail down the direction of product line and services, but the small moving networking companies have been more nimble to adjust to the fast-moving market. Technically, CSCO stock took a beating after its latest earnings announcement, so badly that it moved almost instantly into a technically oversold condition. That has helped the stock from deepening its recent losses, but time is running out for the bulls. The move in Cisco took shares below their 200-day moving average. The move has also put the final touches on transitioning the 50-day moving average of the stock into an intermediate-term bearish trend. This will add to pressure if/when there is a short-term bounce. Traders will take their cue from CSCO stock’s ability to move back above the 200-day trendline within the next week or so. Currently, this moving average is sitting at $31.75 and starting to rollover itself, which would add more selling pressure to Cisco. As if it weren’t enough, CSCO shares are also bouncing on their 20-month moving average. A close below this trendline will mark its official entry into a long-term bear market trend.

In summary, ASRock is offering a new range of Intel X299 chipset motherboards, Mini-ITX AM4 motherboards, new Bitcoin mining specialist motherboards, a pair of SFF chassis, and its X10 IoT router. However, today I'm going to highlight ASRock's Mini-ITX motherboards for Intel Core-X based, and AMD Ryzen based-systems. The ASRock X299E - ITX/ac is claimed to be "the world's first and only mini-ITX X299 motherboard". It's a tiny size but this motherboard can accommodate a good selection of integrated components and expansion. For example it includes 4x SO-DIMM sockets, two Intel Gigabit LANs, dual band 2.4/5GHz 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, 6x SATA ports, plus triple M.2 sockets onboard. There's a single PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for your graphics accelerator of choice. As AnandTech observes, the board is rather tightly packed, and it reckons that the close integration of the LGA 2066 socket, four DIMM slots, and high-capacity VRMs is a "remarkable engineering achievement". A possible negative side effect could become apparent depending upon your go-to cooling solution, especially as the vertical slot-based USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and an M.2 slot could encroach on the vital space surrounding the CPU socket. Full specs are tabulated below, next to ASRock's Mini-ITX AM4 motherboard specs. ASRock is also pioneering Mini-ITX for AMD Ryzen users. The ASRock Fatal1ty X370 Gaming ITX/ac features the X370 chipset, if you had not guessed. It features all the essentials you might wish for in such a compact motherboard. ASRock is also launching the Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming-ITX/ac. Standard features of the two tiny AMD Ryzen motherboards include two (APU friendly) HDMI outputs, an 802.11ac Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2 solution, 7.1-channel sound with Realtek ALC 1220 codec, and custom heatsinks. Elsewhere on the X370 motherboard there are two DDR4 DIMM slots, two Intel Gigabit Ethernet ports, and USB connectivity via 5× USB 3.0 Type-A, 1 × USB 3.0 Type-C, and 5 × USB 2.0. As you can see in the Anandtech specs list above, the price is far keener than that of the Intel X299 board, possibly half the price, though it is noted retailers might gouge customers as such boards are currently rare and in demand.

That’s the conclusion of an analysis funded by computer-chip maker Intel Corp., which is heavily invested in the driverless car field. If the projections are accurate, the impact of those vehicles, once they become prevalent in coming decades, could touch on areas of life you haven’t considered yet. “Autonomous vehicles will reconfigure time and then space, to some extent, and will ultimately to changes in land use and services,” said Greg Lindsay, a senior fellow at the New Cities Foundation, a nonprofit promoting connected cities. “...Just as automobile ownership in the post-war era led first to a reconfiguring of peoples’ lives... then over decades led to a massive reconfiguring of the U.S. in the form of suburbia and malls.” Intel defines the passenger economy as “the economic and societal value,” including products and services “that will be generated by fully autonomous pilotless vehicles.” It will most likely lead to a sharp decrease in the ownership of personal vehicles as people begin to adopt the mentality of “mobility-as-a-service” in which they arrange for transportation on an as-needed basis. While it will take decades to reach full integration of driverless vehicles, the projected $7 trillion global value will come from three major areas: ■43 percent, or $3 trillion, is expected to come from business use of mobility-as-service. ■55 percent, or $3.7 trillion, would from consumer use of mobility as service. ■Another $203 billion would be generated by new pilotless vehicle services and features. “Ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, are pursuing pilotless fleets with the ultimate goal of (eliminating) the need for drivers and converting what is currently a taxi alternative into, in essence, a public transportation network of shared vehicles...,” the report reads. “Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation.” Automakers would be forced to shift their focus from sales to individual consumers to the ride-sharing and car-sharing economy. “Carmakers may ultimately vie to operate particular networks of vehicles for particular cities — not unlike cities in China today where local taxi franchises are assigned to particular carmakers (also partially owned by the cities,” the report reads. “What is clear is that carmakers will themselves become fleet operators. With electrification, new market participants may challenge existing incumbent car manufacturers for these franchises.” Companies will no longer be handcuffed by driver shortages, as pilotless fleets boost efforts for industries like package deliver and long-haul transportation. Of the $7 trillion impact predicted by Strategy Analytics, $3 trillion will be generated by businesses utilizing mobility-as-a-service. Apartment buildings, hotels and condominiums will likely provide driverless vehicles to tenants and guests as an amenity, and companies could do the same as a perk for employees. For those who want to hang on to their personal vehicles, there will be new opportunities to capitalize on all of that time when cars are not in use. One study estimates those vehicles sit idle 92 percent of the time, and Personal Vehicle Sharing Networks would allow owners to make their cars available for ride-sharing. With the ability of passengers in driverless cars to utilize their ride time more efficiently, the idea of longer commutes may not be so daunting. “Eventually, you’ll see changes in land use, where you start to see, perhaps, the rise of massive new exurban suburbs where people are willing to commute two or three hours a day each way because of how they are able to use their time,” Lindsay said. And those longer commute times, where passengers inside the vehicle are no longer required to have their eyes on the road, create all kinds of opportunities for on-board productivity or entertainment. “The enhanced safety offered by pilotless vehicles will enable the vehicle to finally become a media and entertainment hub,” the report reads. “The number of screens in vehicles will expand and the use of heads-up displays for rich media and other content presentation and viewing will grown steadily.” That sounds like good news to Jim Daniels, manager at WoW Electronics in Eastpointe. The company has been installing electronics in vehicles, old and new, for nearly a decade and a half. And the prospect of autonomous vehicles becoming a moveable entertainment center is intriguing. “I think that might be a boost for us with people having the ability to spend more time with the technology,” he said. “If the car is driving itself, you could have the whole family in the back seat watching movies or going on the internet.” jlynch@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2034 – 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2ruDFjz TOP VIDEOS Impressions of Wednesday's Mackinac Conference 6:41 Flyover of the Little Caesars Arena neighborhood 0:38 Spirit airlines unveils new maintenance hangar at DTW 1:24 Raw video: Taking a hot lap on Belle Isle 3:58 Little Caesars world headquarters hosts 'topping out' ceremony 1:33 Entrepreneur/actor Hill Harper an admirer of Detroit 2:55 Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Small businesses Editorial: Connectivity will drive state’s future The Detroit News Ford Foundation president stresses collaboration Neal Rubin Column: Trump tax cuts will put America back to work Stephen Moore Column: Winning the race in connected technology Wright Lassiter III WeWork, Quicken hand out $2.5M in business contest The Detroit News Grand Rapids loves the high-flying Griffins Ted Kulfan

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Asa Mathat for Vox Media Brian Krzanich at the 2017 Code Conference on June 1, 2017. "Powered by Intel" was a familiar tagline when personal computers ruled the Earth. With the PC market in a slow but stabilizing decline, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said consumers will start seeing the hearing the slogan with a new suite of products. Krzanich spoke on Thursday from the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The chipmaker and enterprise technology company has been investing in technologies like virtual and augmented reality headsets — tools that have cropped up in the sports industry, one of the content areas that really "brought people to the internet," Krzanich said. Intel announced a new deal on Thursday to provide live and on-demand virtual reality experiences for the next three years for Major League Baseball. The deal comes after Intel's high-profile Super Bowl promotion, which let viewers see the game through the eyes of the players. Intel has faced an uphill battle in its traditional arenas, with Qualcomm powering many popular Android phones, and Nvidia becoming increasingly powerful in high-end computers. Meanwhile, PC shipments posted a year-on-year decline of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. But Krzanich pushed back on the idea that Intel is lagging, noting that Intel is among the top companies when it comes to patents, and defends them when needed. (Rival Qualcomm is also near the top of the pack, according to IFI Claims data). Intel has been investing behind the scenes in technologies like cloud servers, drones and self-driving cars, working with regulators and ethics experts on privacy and safety issues.

The study says it's too soon to predict which companies are poised to grab the biggest pieces of the market. This self-driving market includes consumer mobility, business-to-business mobility and pilotless vehicle services. Phil LeBeau | @Lebeaucarnews 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The future of driverless cars    13 Hours Ago | 00:59 Why are so many automakers, tech firms, components suppliers and ride-hailing companies pouring billions of dollars into developing self-driving cars and trucks? In part, it's because the payoff could eventually be worth $7 trillion. That's the estimate of a new study from the research firm Strategy Analytics and Intel, one of several tech giants investing heavily in autonomous-drive systems. "This technology is driving big changes," said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel's Automated Driving Group. "Time will be freed up by people not driving, there will be increased productivity and new goods and services to be consumed." The study predicts a global "passenger economy" will start to grow after the first fully autonomous-drive vehicles hit the market in the next four to five years. At first, there will not be many, and their use will be limited, but by 2035 Intel expects the passenger economy will climb to $800 billion worldwide. In 2050, Intel estimates, the global passenger economy will be worth $7 trillion. While it's too soon to know which companies will profit the most from the new world of transportation, Intel estimates the money will come in three primary areas. $3.7 trillion from consumer mobility-as-a-service Includes: Vehicle car-share and ride-share companies. $2.9 trillion from business/business-to-business mobility-as-a-service. Includes: Freight and self-driving delivery companies. $203 billion from pilotless vehicle services Includes: Consumer businesses like restaurants, health-care providers, entertainment companies. Initially, many of the autonomous vehicle services and benefits will be found in cities and suburban areas with large populations. However, analysts believe self-driving vehicles will also reach rural areas. "There are probably people in a rural area who have as much of a need for autonomous-drive vehicles as someone in a city," said Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility in the global automotive practice at Strategy Analytics. While the dollar impact of the coming passenger economy is huge, the other benefits of widespread adoption are enormous. For example, Intel estimates pilotless vehicles will save at least 585,000 lives between 2035 and 2050.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Intel predicts autonomous cars will spawn a ‘passenger economy’ Dean Takahashi@deantak June 1, 2017 10:00 AM Above: Intel is working with BMW to make self-driving cars a reality. Image Credit: Intel Intel and market researcher Strategy Analytics have applied their collective brainpower to the impact of self-driving cars, and they’re predicting that we’ll see a “Passenger Economy” emerge from all of the services targeted at people while they are no longer driving their cars. By 2050, Intel and Strategy Analytics made the astounding prediction that the passenger economy will have a $7 trillion economic impact. The companies estimated that the passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a car) would be more than twice the size of the sharing economy (based on companies such as Uber or Lyft that share resources across many people) by 2050. I have to remark how easy it is to ridicule this research. Economists have a hard enough time predicting economic change on a monthly basis. Intel paid Strategy Analytics to look at the economy 33 years from now, and it came up with a figure for the passenger economy being worth $7 trillion in 2050. Despite my light-hearted skepticism, Intel and the researchers are dead serious about the huge impact that self-driving will have. Above: Intel believes 5G wireless will bring lots of services to cars of the future. Image Credit: Intel Qualcomm recently looked into the same thing, starting with some very different assumptions. Qualcomm paid for a research paper created by David Teece, professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and market researcher IHS Markit to assess the impact of 5G mobile technology — which Qualcomm is playing a big hand in bringing about — on the economy. That report said 5G would create 22 million jobs and $12.3 trillion in impact on goods and services by 2035. These predictions are surely going to be wildly off the mark, but I won’t be around to check — unless of course there are some real breakthroughs in biotechnology that will keep my brain intact. My prediction is that, thanks to Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the climate change accord, that the headquarters of both Intel and Qualcomm will be underwater by 2050. That said, I find the discussion that these reports trigger to be very interesting. When I think back to debates about the mobile Internet, I recall a lot of fears that Europe and Japan were going to jump ahead of the U.S. because they set aside the proper amount of bandwidth early for it. And in fact, these fears came to pass. Europe and Asia are far ahead in some respects, with faster wireless broadband and better services on top of those networks. Indeed, maybe companies such as WeChat, Kakao, Supercell, and NCSoft would be based in the U.S. if policy makers had moved faster and planted the seeds for a mobile economy. Qualcomm’s study found that 91 percent of those surveyed expect 5G to create new products and services that have yet to be invented. The report assumes that it may take something like a decade for autonomous cars to become mainstream and make a real impact on society. By 2035, the passenger economy will only be about $800 billion. The real growth comes from 2035 to 2050, which is about the same time period when we’ll need to have flying or floating cars because of climate change. Above: Intel and self-driving cars. Image Credit: Intel Greg Lindsay, urbanist, mobility futurist, and coauthor of Aerotropolis: The Way We’ll Live Next, said in a press call about the Intel report that the $7 trillion figure might be really conservative because self-driving cars could be the biggest change in transportation since the creation of the “horseless carriage.” The idea of “mobility as a service” will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations, and usage. Indeed, if I’m not going to drive my car, maybe I don’t need to own it. And if I don’t own it, I won’t take it to Jiffy Lube, and Jiffy Lube will have to serve some giant self-driving car rental agency instead. Mobility as a service is expected to be a $3 trillion industry by 2050, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Above: The breakdown of a $7 trillion passenger economy by 2050. Image Credit: Intel Consumer use of mobility as a service is expected to be about $3.7 trillion of the passenger economy, or 55 percent of the total. And another $200 billion is expected to come from consumer use of innovative applications and services. From 2035 to 2045, the report estimates 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving cars. Collectively, autonomous cars could save us more than 250 million hours of commuting time a year. Reductions in public safety costs could amount to more than $234 billion of the passenger economy from 2035 to 2045. Hmm. Maybe that means there won’t be so many highway patrol jobs? On the other hand, Lindsay said that if it is no longer such a chore to drive, people might not mind traveling to work over a longer period of time, like maybe two hours, because being a passenger isn’t so taxing as driving. Intel envisions onboard beauty salons, touchscreen tablets for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile health care clinics, and treatment pods. And who needs to use valuable real estate to park cars anymore? In fact, it might make a lot of sense for an apartment landlord to offer an autonomous car service as a part of the rent for an apartment. Above: An artist’s illustration was part of the “When Cars Can Talk: Readying the Network for 5G and the Autonomous Driving Era” presentation at Intel’s one-day autonomous driving workshop. Image Credit: Intel Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics and a coauthor of the report, said that we could actually cram more vehicles onto the road because they will be so good at avoiding collisions. That could help us deal with all of the trucks that Amazon puts on the road because it has wiped out stores. And I’m sure that advertisers will find ways to blast us with location-based advertising. Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s automated driving solutions division, said in a call that Intel thinks the history of technology is worth remembering here. We’ve seen massive societal transformations as digital business models were ushered in by personal computing, the Internet, ubiquitous connectivity, and smartphones. She believes autonomous driving will do the same. It’s like looking back at the space race and seeing the unpredictable things — like the semiconductor chips that Intel itself makes — that came from it, Lindsay said. “We started thinking about other evolving economies,” Winter said. “Why do we care about this passenger economy? As more of us understand the future, the more we can plan and adapt. This massive new economy is driving big changes in the way we do things.” In short, I find it fascinating to think about the changes that will come in society as technology advances. But I still have a hard time thinking about these reports as scientific. By the way, I asked if that $7 trillion estimate had a big margin of error. “Based on studies looking on similar market sizings like the adoption of 5G, many come out in a similar vicinity,” said Lanctot said. “There is enough to suggest an acceptable margin of error.” VB Recommendations AI Weekly: Siri, please meet Alexa and Google Assistant Google confirms Chrome ad blocker coming ‘in early 2018’ AR/VR Weekly: Buying stuff in VR without facing … reality

Computex 2017: Intel unleashes NVMe RAID for X299 by Tony Thomas  11:45 AM on June 1, 2017 The unveiling of Intel's X299 chipset has made a big splash here at Computex 2017. The major motherboard manufacturers are all aflutter showing off all the RGB LEDs—ahem, compelling features that set their X299 boards apart. Buried in all the noise are hints of new RAID functionality that Intel developed to accompany X299. The company doesn't seem to have directly disseminated any information about what it is or how it works, but we've managed to cobble together a rough idea by talking to Intel's motherboard partners. For starters, the new RAID functionality is called Virtual Raid On CPU, or VROC. Users dropping high-speed NVMe storage into M.2 and spare PCIe slots can select arbitrary subsets of those drives to create a blazing-fast RAID 0 array. Here's where the waters get muddied a bit. Some Asus guy with pretty solid storage credentials who goes by the Gasior surname asserts that those arrays are bootable. However, Gigabyte told us that VROC depends on Intel's RSTe driver, which is software you run on top of Windows. These two claims would seem to be at odds, at least at first sight. VROC header on EVGA's X299 FTW K At the end of the day, it would appear that Intel's out to make a quick buck (my words, not the manufacturers'). X299 boards may optionally include a VROC header on the PCB. Support for RAID 0 NVMe arrays is free, but you have to shell out $99 for a physical VROC key to plug into the header to unlock RAID 1 and RAID 10. For RAID 5, there's a more expensive key (we heard both $199 and $299 are possible). These keys aren't being channeled through motherboard manufacturers, so as far as we know Intel will be selling them directly. Since the implementation details of VROC are nowhere to be found, we don't know whether the key contains any real mojo or not. All signs point to it merely being a sort of physical DRM. We'll keep you posted as we learn more. Tags: Motherboards Storage Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The giant chipmaker made the announcement as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world’s leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing. “It’s time to make this transition,” CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts “difficult,” he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. “These companies are so big that it takes time” — and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring — to change direction, said Patrick Moorhead, a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights & Strategy. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for “cloud computing” data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices and drones. “We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,” he said in a statement. Intel said the job cuts will include “voluntary and involuntary departures” over the coming year, some of them occurring as Intel consolidates some of its PC chip operations into fewer locations. A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected. Intel has large campuses in Portland, Oregon; Chandler, Arizona; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and Santa Clara and Folsom, California. It also has facilities in countries including Israel and China. Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. The cuts are likely to involve divisions making and selling chips for traditional desktop and laptop computers, Moorhead said. He noted Intel has signaled its plans to continue investing in chips for gaming consoles and new “two-in-one” devices that resemble tablets with detachable keyboards. Those devices are still seeing strong sales growth. Krzanich has been trying to change Intel’s focus since he became CEO in 2013, and he’s replaced several top executives in recent months. Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months. But aside from the data center business, which now contributes nearly a third of Intel’s revenue, the markets for Intel’s other new products are still “very embryonic,” according to Mark Hung, an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm. “It’s going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company,” Hung said. Krzanich cited Intel’s first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working. Intel reported revenue of $13.70 billion for the first three months of 2016, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. That was slightly lower than the $13.73 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Global demand for PCs fell 9.6 percent in the first quarter, according to figures released earlier this month by Gartner. The industry has been in decline for the last four years, Hung noted, but some analysts had expected PC sales to level off this year. Instead, he noted quarterly PC shipments fell below 65 million for the first time since 2007.

The Democratic nominee in last year’s bitterly fought White House race addressed a technology conference in California, speaking at length about what she termed a Moscow-led campaign of “disinformation” against her that influenced the vote. “The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the Intel and counter-intel people I’ve talked to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided,” Clinton told the Recode conference, referring to an avalanche of false information, social media bots and hacks of Clinton campaign emails. Some of those people helping the Russians, she said, had access to “polling and data information.” Asked by a moderator who those individuals might be, Clinton said: “We’re getting more information about all of the contacts between Trump campaign officials and Trump associates with Russians before, during and after the election. So I hope that we’ll get enough information to be able to answer that question.” “I’m leaning Trump,” she said of the connections. “I think it’s pretty hard not to.” The Republican president struck back in a tweet late Wednesday, criticising Clinton for failing to take responsibility for her loss. “Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC,” he said. He was referring to Clinton’s assertions during her talk that fake news about her was spread on Facebook, and that the Democratic Party, unlike the well-funded Republicans, did not have a sophisticated data system. Clinton snapped back at the president in a brief message on Twitter. “People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” she wrote. Trump used the non-existent word in an incomplete sentence tweeted just after midnight Tuesday. The tweet remained online for some 5.5 hours, sparking worldwide ridicule. The message was finally deleted early Wednesday, and Trump joked about it in a subsequent tweet. When White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked about the cryptic word he told incredulous reporters that Trump “and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.” He gave no further explanation. Several US congressional committees have launched investigations into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election and its possible coordination with Trump campaign aides or associates. The Department of Justice has appointed a former FBI director as a special counsel to head a separate, independent investigation. Clinton, who ruled out a new election bid, told Recode that the best example of such coordination took place in October. WikiLeaks released emails hacked from her campaign chief John Podesta within an hour of a 2005 video of Trump boasting about how he could get away with groping women was leaked to the press. “They had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that and they had to be given the go-ahead; ‘OK, this could be the end of the Trump campaign. Dump it now,’” she said. As she had done previously, Clinton also said that then-FBI director James Comey dealt her campaign “a tremendous hit” when he briefly reopened an investigation into her use of a private email account and server just days before the election. “He dumps that on me on October 28, and I immediately start falling,” she said. The presidential vote was November 8. While she said she takes “responsibility” for the loss, Clinton appeared reluctant to publicly discuss her own campaign mistakes. Despite losing the indirect but all-important state-by-state electoral college count, “I won three million more (popular) votes than the other guy,” she said.

Despite inferior performance, Intel has gone from supplying around 30% of iPhone 7 baseband chips in 2016 to 50% in 2017. And experts say it could be supplying over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018. Earlier this year, Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in a California district court for charging unfair prices to license its tech. Qualcomm has since countersued Apple, and withheld around $1 billion in royalty rebates from the iPhone-maker as retaliation for its participation in a Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation. Given the nature of this feud, don’t be surprised to see Apple work to dramatically reduce its reliance on Qualcomm over the next several months. The company recently hired Esin Terzioglu, Qualcomm’s VP of Engineering, to head up a new chip project. It’s believed they are developing their own, in-house baseband modems.

Shareholders Have Something to Worry About The chipmaker’s future relies heavily on its rivals dropping the ball. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jun 1, 2017 at 11:00AM AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which rallied nearly 140% over the past 12 months, is a highly divisive stock among tech investors. The bulls believe that AMD's new x86 Ryzen CPUs and upcoming Vega GPUs can strike critical blows against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their respective markets. The bears meanwhile note that AMD repeatedly failed to beat both bigger chipmakers in the past, and that too much of its future relies on the Ryzen and Vega's success. While I'm not bearish on AMD, I believe that investors should still worry about several major headwinds facing the company. Image source: AMD. The ongoing battle with NVIDIA AMD stole the spotlight from NVIDIA last June by launching the RX 480, which was the cheapest "VR ready" card on the market at $200. But over the next few months, NVIDIA struck back across the low-end market with the GTX 1050 ($109), GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the GT 1030 ($80). The GTX 1050 Ti was approved by Oculus last October, making it the cheapest VR ready card on the market. AMD responded by lowering the price of its VR-ready RX 470 from $179 to $169, but that low-end card still remained pricier than the GTX 1050 Ti. AMD's next big push against NVIDIA will be the launch of its next-gen Vega cards this summer, which could overtake NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards in terms of raw graphical horsepower. However, it's unclear how long that lead will last, since NVIDIA will likely launch its next-gen Volta GPUs for mainstream consumers in early 2018. This upcoming clash could follow the same cycle as the low-end GPU battle last year, with AMD winning the initial benchmarks but provoking a fierce retaliation from NVIDIA. Other potential pain points... The two major gaming consoles -- the PS4 and Xbox One -- are both powered by AMD SoCs. The revenue from those consoles is the core pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit. However, NVIDIA's Tegra chip now powers the Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch, which has been stealing the spotlight from the PS4 and Xbox One with its hybrid design and well-received launch titles. The Switch's success shows that NVIDIA's Tegra has the graphical muscle for hybrid devices, which bodes well for its future in other smaller devices -- like AR/VR headsets, set-top boxes, gaming tablets, or other handheld devices. Image source: Nintendo. When NVIDIA's graphics licensing deal with Intel expired earlier this year, NVIDIA stopped receiving $66 million in "free" revenue per quarter. Earlier this month, rumors suggested that Intel would sign a graphics deal with AMD to replace that deal and give AMD a much-needed injection of "free" revenue. However, Intel later claimed that report was false. The upcoming battle with Intel AMD's new Ryzen chip recently impressed investors when initial benchmarks showed that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches Intel's 8-core Core i7-6900K in single-threaded performance, and beats it in multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. But here's the catch -- the 14nm Ryzen is considered a next-gen chip for AMD, while the Core i7 in the comparison is Intel's current-gen 14nm Kaby Lake chip. AMD also plans to loosen Intel's iron grip on the data center market with Naples, a high-end Zen processor that has more cores than Intel's current-gen Skylake-based Purley CPU. But once again, this is technically a next-gen to current-gen comparison. Intel isn't sitting idly by and letting itself get overtaken by AMD. On the PC front, it plans to launch its newer Coffee Lake (14nm) and next-gen Cannonlake (10nm) chips near the end of 2017. On the server front, Intell could soon release an updated version of Purley which boasts just as many cores (32) as Naples. Why AMD remains a speculative stock The problem with AMD is that it needs its next-gen chips to gain enough traction against NVIDIA and Intel before those bigger rivals strike back with potentially faster chips. If you're a PC owner who wants to upgrade an aging desktop PC, you're likely wondering if you should buy AMD's Ryzen and Vega chips this year, or wait and buy Intel's Cannonlake CPUs and NVIDIA's Volta GPUs instead. Big companies will likely want to see comparisons between Naples and the new Purley chips before authorizing any sweeping upgrades. I'm not saying that AMD is a bad buy at current levels -- it's actually fairly cheap at 2.2 times sales (relative to the industry average of 4 for semiconductor makers). But investors would be foolish not to worry, since AMD's future depends heavily on NVIDIA and Intel's new chips falling short of market expectations.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News politics Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air SENATE Senate panels dueling for witnesses in Russia Investigation By Brooke Singman Published June 01, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print   Two powerful Senate committees are probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election - and possible collusion with the Trump campaign,  but only one panel has managed to line up key witnesses. Both the Senate’s Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are leading separate investigations, but the two panels are dueling for information—and the Senate Intel Committee is winning. Fox News has confirmed that former FBI director James Comey will testify before the Senate intelligence committee on June 8. On May 19, the fired FBI chief declined Judiciary’s request to testify—but this wasn’t Judiciary’s first disappointment. “The Judiciary Committee has primary responsibility for FBI oversight,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who sits on the Judiciary Committee said when Comey declined the panel’s request. “If former Director Comey testifies, he should do so before both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.” Days after Comey’s May 9 ouster, the Intelligence Committee heard testimony from Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. On that same day, Intel committee members met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who penned a letter to the president recommending Comey’s firing. The day after, the Judiciary Committee followed Intel’s lead, and requested the same committee briefing with Rosenstein on May 12, and invited McCabe for one as well, but the committee received no response. Judiciary also requested the Comey memos which reflected conversations he had with President Trump regarding the investigation, and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who reportedly will hand over subpoenaed personal and business records to the Intelligence Committee.  “The FBI said it is still reviewing the request to provide Comey memos following the announcement of special counsel,” a Judiciary committee spokesperson told Fox News in an email on Wednesday. “We’ve not heard back on our requests for briefings from McCabe and/or Rosenstein.” But the Department of Justice downplayed the Judiciary Committee’s concern with a lack of response from Rosenstein, noting he briefed the full Senate May 18. “This request came in before the Deputy Attorney General appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel and before he had briefed all 100 members of the U.S. Senate,” DOJ Director of Public Affairs Sarah Flores told Fox News. “Since that appointment, briefings related to that ongoing investigation from the Department would now be coordinated with Special Counsel Mueller’s office.” When asked about a possible McCabe appearance or response to the Judiciary Committee’s request, an FBI spokesperson told Fox News that the bureau works with “all of our oversight committees on their requests.” But former FBI special agent and former bureau national spokesman John Iannarelli told Fox News that it makes “perfect sense” for top witnesses to choose to provide testimony before Intelligence, rather than Judiciary. “Choosing the Intelligence Committee over Judiciary makes perfect sense because this is for intelligence purposes—has the president or his staff compromised intelligence?” Iannarelli said. “This is an intelligence-based inquiry, anyway.” Iannarelli added: “This could also be further indication that nothing is here that actually compromised sensitive intelligence, especially because Comey agreed to testify in an open setting.” But the Judiciary Committee isn’t giving up. On May 20, Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-IA, took to Twitter and said the Committee would continue. JudiciaryCom must continue FBI oversight even w SpecCounsel Can't wait months for Mueller report Judiciary needs to know so we can act&clear— ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) May 20, 2017 “JudiciaryCom must continue FBI oversight even w SpecCounsel Can’t wait months for Mueller report Judiciary needs to know so we can act&clear,” Grassley tweeted. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sits on both committees, and will have her opportunity to press Comey when he testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office told Fox News they would not comment. Despite media reports that Comey has been cleared by Special Counsel Mueller to testify in public next week, a Mueller spokesperson told Fox News that he had no information on Comey’s potential testimony, or whether Mueller cleared him for public testimony. Congress is currently out of session, and will resume business next Tuesday. Comey will testify before the Intelligence Committee on Thursday, June 8, in an open session, followed by a closed session.  Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

At the Computex show in Taipei, Taiwan this week, Qualcomm and Microsoft officials announced that HP, Lenovo and Asus will be the first to roll out laptops powered by Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835 processor, which they said will offer constant connectivity, thanks to an LTE modem, longer battery life and the ability to run all Windows applications. Related articles Qualcomm PC push presents 'hard' value proposition for partners Nutanix: Partner programs must stop 'laying down the law' Today's channel rundown - 1 June 2017 IBM Security, Cisco tag team on managed security services Today's channel rundown - 31 May 2017 The move also opened up another front in the ongoing competition between Intel and ARM, which is expanding into the datacenter and emerging areas, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous vehicles. For the channel, while the Qualcomm processor will offer some differentiation from Intel, particularly in the areas of price and battery life, the ARM-based systems will have to offer most the same capabilities as those running on Intel in order to be appealing to users. For many users, what's important is that the PC they're buying runs Windows 10, not what chip is inside. "It's a hard value proposition if you say that it's not much different from what you have now," Roger Kay, principal analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, told Channelnomics. "If I was a channel partner, I would be skeptical I could sell any of these until someone shows they can work with it." It's not that it can't work, he said, but a lot of it will come down to the effectiveness of efforts like branding and marketing campaigns. That said, there is also opportunity for the channel. The introduction of systems from top-tier OEMs that run Windows 10 atop Qualcomm chips will mean a larger portfolio of products they can offer to customers, Kay said. In addition, the OEMs will push the angles of better battery life, good performance, constant connectivity and a lower cost than Intel-based systems, Kay said. Microsoft officials last year announced plans to bring Windows 10 applications to mobile devices powered by ARM processors. The move is reminiscent of the software vendor's failed effort five years ago with Windows RT, a version of the platform aimed at ARM-based systems and supported at the time by the likes of Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Samsung. Qualcomm officials remain confident there will be enough advantages to the new ARM-based systems to make them attractive to end users. In addition to the company's Snapdragon 835 processor, the systems, which are expected to come out later this year, will run on an integrated X16 LTE modem, which is said to bring constant connectivity capabilities. "With Snapdragon, hardware makers can create Windows 10 PCs that are thin, light, fan-less and designed to deliver long battery life," Don McGuire, VP of global product marketing for Qualcomm, wrote in a blog post this week, adding that with the LTE modem Windows 10s device can support "blazing fast" gigabit internet speeds. During Computex, Intel officials said they are engaging in their own push into the area of constantly connected systems by making current and upcoming modems compatible with eSIM technology. The moves come at a time when the PC market, which has seen global shipments decline for the past five years, is getting a lot of attention from system and component makers who are optimistic about a possible rebound in the space. For example, Computex has been full of PC-related announcements thus far, and last month, giant Chinese IT vendor Huawei Technologies said it was getting into the PC space.

Intel’s camera pods will help provide VR streams to fans this season. Photos via Intel. You can now watch MLB games in virtual reality. Starting June 6, MLB will launch a VR livestream of one out-of-market game each Tuesday in June. It’s part of a new 3-year deal with Intel, which is helping power the experience via its Intel True VR app and 4K-resolution camera pods set up at various stadiums around the league. The feed, which is free to access and available on Samsung Gear VR headsets, will let viewers select from five camera angles — home plate, first base, third base, center field, and a special pitcher-batter view — that offer 360-degree views of the live action. Or, they can choose a “sit back” mode that is a fully-produced VR broadcast experience. There are also real-time statistics and exclusive in-app commentary available on the stream. After the game, highlights and on-demand replays of each game will be made available in VR. Here are the four games: Cleveland Indians vs. Colorado Rockies on June 6 at 5:40 p.m. PT / 8:40 p.m. ET Kansas City Royals vs. San Francisco Giants on June 13 at 7:15 p.m. PT / 10:15 p.m. ET Detroit Tigers vs. Seattle Mariners on June 20 at 7:10 p.m. PT / 10:10 p.m. ET St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on June 27 at 6:40 p.m. PT / 9:40 p.m. ET You can download the Intel True VR app here via the Oculus store. David Aufhauser, managing director of strategy and product for Intel Sports Group, told GeekWire that “there will be opportunities for advertisers and sponsorships to be apart of this,” but didn’t offer more details.  This is separate from the VR-ish offering that is going live on MLB’s At-Bat app today. Those feeds, streamed for each game, don’t provide a 360-degree view but instead a two-dimensional format with the normal broadcast view. It’s available for Google’s Daydream View headset. Intel, which partnered with MLB last year during the All-Star Game, continues to push forward in the sports industry. In March, Intel livestreamed the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in virtual reality via a partnership with the NCAA and Turner. It also aired a virtual reality feed from the Players’ Championship last month. This past fall, the company established its Intel Sports Group, right around the time it acquired virtual reality startup Voke. Much of the Intel True VR experience is powered by technology that Voke helped develop — you can hear from Voke co-founder Dr. Uma Jayaram at our upcoming GeekWire Sports Tech Summit. Intel continues to build products and services with wearable computing, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports industry. MLB, meanwhile, isn’t the only league testing virtual reality. The NBA offered its own VR streams this season in partnership with NextVR; NASCAR did something similar last year. MLB announced a live streaming deal with Facebook last month.

Google Cloud has become the first major cloud provider to offer Virtual machine instances using Intel’s Skylake processors. The Skylake Xeon processors, which are now generally available, include up to 64 vCPUs and 455GB of RAM supporting a range of compute-intensive workloads, data analytics and engineering simulations. Google Cloud revealed that the customer demand for Intel’s Skylake has increased and since its launch for the Compute Engine in February, customers have run several hours of compute Skylake VMs. According to Google, the new general availability release enables customers to create new VMs with Skylake across all the VM instance types in Compute Engine. This includes standard, highmen, highcpu, Custom Machine types and Preemptible VMs. Read more: Google Cloud boosts machine learning portfolio with Nvidia GPUs The decision to begin offering virtual machine instances using Intel’s processors is a smart move made by Google to compete against its rival cloud providers such as AWS, which announced a set of Skylake-powered C5 instances for its Elastic Compute Cloud in 2016 but are still yet to launch. The Google Cloud Platform also released several updates to its Compute Engine to allow developers to easily select their preferred CPU platform for VMs within a particular Google Cloud region, whilst also being able to choose the suited CPU features. Developers were previously restricted with the amount of RAM space per vCPU they were entitled to, but Google has now extended the memory and removed the restrictions to up memory space to a maximum of 455GB per VM instance. This helps Google offer a wider memory space to user applications that may benefit from flexible memory configurations for better performance. Google Cloud has made Skylake available in three of its regions, Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific with general availability across every region at no extra cost for a limited time.     Tags Google Cloud Platform Intel Processors Previous Article5G – A building block for the smarter city Next ArticleOneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Most read Hackers turn political saboteurs as cracks in the cloud signal a new frontier for cyber crime Ellie Burns 26th April 2017 IBM brings cognitive assistant to factory for cutting down inspection time Byomakesh Biswal 25th April 2017 Oracle, the newest tech startup?

In the market for a virtual reality headset? You might want to wait. That seemed to be the consensus of industry insiders who gathered at the Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara, Calif., this week. The first mainstream consumer VR headsets, among them the HTC Vive and Sony PlayStation VR, just hit the market last year, and a new crop will likely be ready for shopping carts before the 2017 holiday season. But the quality of the experiences they'll offer isn't quite what many in the industry are striving for. Deficiencies persist in the hardware that powers the headsets as well as the games and other apps that are designed to run on them, experts say. One of the most egregious in terms of how it affects the health of the headset wearer is latency, or the amount of time it takes a nod of the head or other movement to be recognized by the headset's motion processors and displayed on the screen. For Achin Bhowmik, Intel's general manager of perceptual computing, the latency of the first crop of VR devices is better than that of the last, but still leaves a lot to be desired. "I think that we are on this verge of something exciting about to happen, and yet virtual reality has been there before, where it didn't live up to its promises," Bhowmik said at the Expo on Wednesday. "There's a lot of work for us to do." Intel expects the first headsets based on its Project Alloy reference design to hit the market this year. Like other companies, it is striving to get latency below 20 milliseconds, but even that isn't good enough, according to Bhowmik. "I can guarantee that [20 milisecond latency] will not be enough" to eradicate vestibular mismatch, or the feeling of losing your balance, he said. Of course, whether or not you'll get motion sickness in VR depends a lot on the app, too, and Bhowmik implored game developers not to include scenes of, say, a character flying above the Earth at jet-like speeds. But if you are interested in VR because of the potential to experience flight or something else that's impossible in real life, you'll also likely be disappointed with your current options, since programming those experiences requires a different mindset than what is needed for a conventional video game. "In the virtual world, there are no tricks, there are no shortcuts," explained Zvi Greenstein, General Manager at Nvidia's GeForce team. "All the objects must be collidable." In other words, chain-link fences must rattle when you shake them and you should not only see the movement but hear the rattle, too. That's something that you don't often find even among the most heavily-produced first person shooters today. Greenstein is hoping for a VR headset that can power extremely realistic apps. While Nvidia isn't known for software, the company has taken to writing code for things like its recently-unveiled HoloDeck as a way of demonstrating its vision. HoloDeck is a collaboration platform that allows multiple people to examine and manipulate an object—a car, for instance—in virtual reality. It's a good first step, but it's far from perfect, according to Greenstein. Related The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 "We're nowhere near the limits of human perception," he said of the VR industry. Still, there is reason to be excited for the future, even if it means holding off on a planned headset purchase. The next crop of devices will be completely wireless and have better eye tracking, according to HTC Vice President Rikard Steiber. "This is the year where PC-powered VR will go wireless," he said at the Expo. Such incremental hardware improvements may seem minor, but they're worth waiting for because they could prepare the VR industry for its iPhone moment. If that happens, Steiber said, "it's not just a different computing platform, it's an evolution of how we interact with computers."

Callaghan is a 30 year veteran in the high-tech industry. His career of 21 years with Intel Corporation (INTC) included roles as an investor for Intel venture capital arm Intel Capital as well as Business Development roles in the company’s Internet of Things business.   Sensum is a software company whose technology enables businesses to understand and react to how and why people emotionally respond to brands, products, services and experiences. Using emotion AI algorithms, Sensum can show a deeper, contextually aware understanding of the emotional digital self. The Sensum emotional response platform consolidates and interprets multimodal biometric data from wearable-tech, facial coding and eye tracking. The platform also utilises contextual data from surveys, implicit tests and emoji analytics to acquire conscious and unconscious responses, providing a full 360° emotional understanding. In a discussion about Sensum’s future, Damien said  „The next paradigm shift in the development of the digital self is ‚How do I feel?’ – Sensum delivers on this.  Entrepreneurs created the digital platforms to express ‚Who am I?’ via companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn, ‚What am I doing?’ via companies such as Twitter and Instagram and ‚Where am I?’ via companies such as Foursquare and now ‚How do I feel?’ with Sensum.  The application of Artificial Intelligence to emotions to digitally express how one feels is a hugely exciting opportunity.  Sensum have developed algorithms to enable industries to monetize this opportunity.” Commenting on Callaghan’s appointment, Gawain Morrison, CEO & Co-founder of Sensum said, „We are growing fast and building our team and business capabilities to achieve the vision of becoming number one in the field of multimodal emotions AI. It is fantastic that Damien Callaghan has joined us as Chairman to help us accelerate our growth.” Sensum has worked with the likes of Unilever, Red Bull Media House, Jaguar, BBC and many more brands to help them understand the emotions and biometric responses for products, advertising and unique PR events.

Aaron standing in today for Adam, who is traveling to Canada. With the Computex trade show going on in Taiwan this week, we're certainly being treated to a flood of announcements from the formerly forlorn state known as the personal computer market. I got a chance to speak with Gregory Bryant ahead of the show. He's the 25-year Intel veteran who was thrust to the top of the chip giant's PC business just a few weeks ago. The head of Intel's server chip unit, Diane Bryant, had to take a lengthy leave of absence and the company tapped Navin Shenoy, who had only been running PC chips for a year, to fill in for her, creating the opening. Bryant is so bullish on PCs in 2017 you might never know that the industry sold only 260 million units last year, down 26% since 2011. He's also very bullish on Intel, telling me they are "really the only company that can power every segment of this emerging smart connected world all the way from the cloud through the network to the edge devices and kind of everything in between." The 1.5 billion smartphone buyers last year (triple the number from 2011) would probably beg to differ. Aaron Pressman @ampressman aaron.pressman@fortune.com NEWSWORTHY Taking stock. In earnings land, Wednesday was a day for reports from some of the tech companies oriented towards the corporate market. Box said revenue grew 30% to $117 million, more than Wall Street expected. Same story at security expert Palo Alto Networks, where revenue rose 25%. Not so for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which saw revenue decline 22% to $9.9 billion. Moving in the right direction. Results also came on Wednesday for a very large but not yet public company: Uber. The Wall Street Journal reported that first quarter revenue of $3.4 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and its net loss declined 29% to $708 million. Oh, and head of finance Gautam Gupta is leaving. The future of TV. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings repeated his analysis that traditional cable TV "is all going to move to the Internet-it’s all going to be on-demand." But maybe some people in cable land were finally listening. Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav said his industry needs to develop an $8 Internet TV bundle to compete with Hastings. David Marchese at New York magazine has a deeper read about how show creators are handling the changes. John Podesta needs a time machine. Google announced it would better protect Gmail users from hackers with new anti-phishing security checks. Lots of loot. Rumors have been flying about what new hardware Apple might introduce at its upcoming developer conference, WWDC. According to Mac Rumors, the haul could include new MacBook and MacBook Pro models along with a refreshed iPad Pro. MOAR data. Don't have time to review all 355 slides in Mary Meeker's annual state of the Internet report? Fortune's Leena Rao has pulled some highlights, including that global Internet advertising is finally expected to pass TV spending in the next six months and 20% of mobile searches were made using a voice query in 2016. The full report is also online at Kleiner Perkins web site. Look, up in the sky. Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group, had a vision to combine his OneWeb satellite Internet startup with longtime player Intelsat SA. But Intelsat's bondholders wouldn't go along. FOOD FOR THOUGHT Andy Rubin got lots of attention this week, including from Data Sheet, for his new smartphone. But Eric Limer at Popular Mechanics tried to cut through Rubin's rhetoric and analyze just how essential the Essential Phone might be. His conclusion? Not very. What is maybe more noteworthy is the ways it is like other phones out there: It's a $700 rectangular screen with a camera that (probably) runs vanilla Android. In fact, it's quite an awful lot like Google's Pixel, though prettier and without the headphone jack. The things that make it 'special' are unproven at best, meaningless at worst.

Under a three-year pact, Intel will live-stream one free out-of-market game each week (on Tuesdays) via its Intel True VR app on Samsung Gear headsets starting June 6. The broadcasts will include post-game highlights and on-demand replays for each game. Related MLB to Launch VR-Enhanced Broadcasts, but Live Games Won’t Be in 360 Video The Intel-MLB virtual-reality deal represents another experimental push into VR entertainment. For Intel, the pact will serve largely as a branding opportunity to get in front of early tech adopters. According to Intel, there’s demand for baseball in VR. The company commissioned a survey of 500 MLB fans ages 18-64, conducted by Turnkey Intelligence, which found that 71% would be interested in watching an MLB game in VR that they are unable to attend. It isn’t clear, however, whether those consumers would be willing to pay a premium for the VR experience. The “Intel True VR Game of the Week” will let viewers control their vantage point by selecting from up to four camera angles per game; alternatively, they can opt to watch a produced VR broadcast experience. In addition, the Intel VR baseball experience will provide live player and team stats throughout the games plus exclusive commentary. “As a VR partner of MLB, Intel is delivering a truly immersive virtual reality live-stream where fans can experience the excitement of being at the ballpark every week,” said James Carwana, GM of Intel Sports Group. Separately, on Thursday MLB’s At Bat app is scheduled to launch a VR mode, initially for Google’s Daydream headset and Android smartphones. The new VR option will let users access live stats and scores while watching games in HD video, and includes a 3D strike-zone cube as well as a collection of 360-degree on-demand videos. But to watch games in VR video, fans will have to turn to Intel’s VR app for the Samsung Gear. Here’s the lineup of MLB games for the Intel True VR experience in June: Cleveland Indians vs. Colorado Rockies on June 6 at 8:40 p.m. ET Kansas City Royals vs. San Francisco Giants on June 13 at 10:15 p.m. ET Detroit Tigers vs. Seattle Mariners on June 20 at 10:10 p.m. ET St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on June 27 at 9:40 p.m. ET Updates on the Intel True VR Game of the Week are available at intel.com/truevr.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mobileye Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results JERUSALEM, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Total revenue of $124.7 million, an increase of 66% over the same quarter last year GAAP Net Income of $33.5 million; Non-GAAP Net Income of $60.0 million – an increase of 53% and 73% over the same quarter last year, respectively GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.14; Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.25 Generated GAAP net cash from operating activities of $56.6 million; Non-GAAP free cash flow of $41.2 million (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V., the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems („ADAS”) and autonomous driving technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. „Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate,” said Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Mobileye.  „Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM™) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers.” „The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders,”  Mr. Aviram noted.    First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue:  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $124.7 million, compared to $75.2 million in the prior-year period, representing a 66% increase.  Within total revenue, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue was $94.5 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior-year period representing a 54% increase.  EyeQ chip volume increased to 2,032 thousand EyeQ units, compared to 1,322 thousand units in the prior-year period.  EyeQ Average Selling Price (ASP) per unit for the first quarter of 2017 was $45.1, up from $44.2 during the same period last year.  The increase in OEM revenues is the result of new launches and the roll-out of Mobileye technology to more models within existing programs compared to the same quarter last year.  After market (AM) revenue contributed the remaining $30.2 million of total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.8 million in the prior-year period representing a 188% increase. The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus.

The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period.

In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What Is Windows 10 on ARM, and How is It Different From Windows RT? By Chris Hoffman on June 1st, 2017 Microsoft is working on a version of Windows 10 that will run on ARM hardware. Unlike Windows RT, the version of Windows 8 that powered the original Surface and Surface 2, this will be a full version of Windows 10 with an emulation layer that allows it to run traditional desktop apps from outside the Windows Store. Why Is Microsoft Putting Windows 10 on ARM? RELATED ARTICLE ARM vs. Intel: What It Means for Windows, Chromebook, and Android Software Compatibility ARM PCs have some advantages over x86 ones. They have built-in LTE cellular connectivity, often offer better battery life than Intel and AMD CPUs, and the hardware is less expensive for manufacturers. Future ARM CPUs could pull even more ahead of Intel and AMD CPUs and offer much more battery life, for example. Microsoft would like Windows 10 to run on ARM hardware so it can reap those benefits. Sure, you probably won’t use an ARM desktop any time soon, but ARM could be a great choice for tablets, 2-in-1 convertibles, and even smaller laptops. Rather than creating a more limited version of Windows for this platform, Microsoft has decided to release a full version of Windows 10 for ARM hardware, one that can even run traditional Windows desktop applications. Microsoft first announced a partnership with Qualcomm to create Windows on ARM at WinHEC in December, 2016. It Can Run x86 Desktop Programs This isn’t just Windows RT all over again. Windows RT didn’t allow you to run traditional desktop software. It even blocked developers from compiling their desktop applications for ARM processors and offering them to users. Windows RT only allowed apps from the Windows 8 Store. Windows 10 on ARM is completely different. This is the full Windows desktop experience. Microsoft has created a special emulator layer that allows traditional 32-bit desktop applications to run on ARM processors, so everything should “just work”. Microsoft even showed off a version of Windows 10 Professional on ARM, and said it supports all the usual advanced features you’d find on Windows 10 Professional. The emulation works completely transparently to both users and the programs they run. It uses the same WOW (Windows on Windows) technology that Windows uses to run 32-bit applications on 64-bit versions of Windows today. However, the x86-to-ARM emulation happens entirely in software. That software emulation could be an issue, however. While Microsoft demonstrated Windows 10 on ARM running the desktop version of Photoshop and said it “runs perfectly” on the Qualcomm processor, there’s almost certain to be some slowdown in demanding desktop applications compared to running the same apps without software emulation on an Intel or AMD system. We’ll have to wait to see performance benchmarks when Windows 10 on ARM is released. Don’t get distracted by the emulator, however. This isn’t just an emulated Windows 10 operating system. The Windows kernel, hardware drivers, and all programs included with Windows are native ARM code. Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the Windows Store are also native ARM programs. The emulator is only used when running traditional x86 Windows desktop software. Much of this information comes from a video Microsoft released during BUILD 2017. Support for Older Hardware Devices May Be a Problem While Windows 10 on ARM can emulate traditional desktop applications, it won’t be able to install hardware drivers written for traditional x86 or x64 Windows operating systems. It will need ARM versions of those hardware drivers to support different hardware devices. Microsoft promises that Windows 10 on ARM “will have great device support for USB peripherals using the in-box class drivers”. That’s great for modern USB peripherals. But read between the lines: Devices that aren’t supported by the built-in drivers won’t work. Printer utilities and other hardware driver utilities may not work, either. This could be an issue for older or more obscure hardware peripherals. Windows 10 S Is the New Windows RT It doesn’t matter which type of CPU Windows is running on. You get a full Windows desktop experience with Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Professional, even if you’re using Windows 10 on ARM. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Windows 10 S, and How Is It Different? However, Microsoft did just announce Windows 10 S, a more limited edition of Windows 10 that can only run software from the Windows Store—just like Windows RT did. This has nothing to do with Windows 10 on ARM. In fact, the Windows 10 S devices Microsoft announced all run on standard Intel or AMD processors. Microsoft hasn’t mentioned Windows 10 on ARM and Windows 10 S together yet, presumably to avoid any confusion. However, even if Microsoft does ship Windows 10 S on ARM PCs, you’d be able to pay to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and get the ability to install desktop apps, just as you can with Windows 10 S on Intel and AMD PCs. In other words, with Windows 10, ARM is just another hardware platform that’s treated the same—it just needs an emulation layer to make that possible. Windows 10 S is a limited version of Windows that can run on any hardware platform. When Will It Be Released? Microsoft said devices will be released “later this year” in 2017. Qualcomm also told investors that the first Windows on on ARM laptop would be released sometime in the fourth quarter of 2017. It will pair Windows 10 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Chris Hoffman is a technology writer and all-around computer geek.

JERUSALEM, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Total revenue of $124.7 million, an increase of 66% over the same quarter last year GAAP Net Income of $33.5 million; Non-GAAP Net Income of $60.0 million - an increase of 53% and 73% over the same quarter last year, respectively GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.14; Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.25 Generated GAAP net cash from operating activities of $56.6 million; Non-GAAP free cash flow of $41.2 million (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V., the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ("ADAS") and autonomous driving technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. "Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate," said Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Mobileye.  "Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM™) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers." "The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders,"  Mr. Aviram noted.    First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue:  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $124.7 million, compared to $75.2 million in the prior-year period, representing a 66% increase.  Within total revenue, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue was $94.5 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior-year period representing a 54% increase.  EyeQ chip volume increased to 2,032 thousand EyeQ units, compared to 1,322 thousand units in the prior-year period.  EyeQ Average Selling Price (ASP) per unit for the first quarter of 2017 was $45.1, up from $44.2 during the same period last year.  The increase in OEM revenues is the result of new launches and the roll-out of Mobileye technology to more models within existing programs compared to the same quarter last year.  After market (AM) revenue contributed the remaining $30.2 million of total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.8 million in the prior-year period representing a 188% increase. The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the "Mobileye Campus") that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon ("Kisalon") formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation ("Intel") and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the "Purchaser") pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the "Offer"), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company's Notice of Annual General Meeting ("AGM").  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as "believes," "intends," "expects," "projects," "anticipates," and "future" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company's current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Batsmen Will Use Smart Bats During Current Champions Trophy Aadil Shadman 19 hours ago Cricket is all about technique and for viewers, it’s all about real-time information and statistics. To add more excitement to the game of cricket, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has partnered with popular chip maker, Intel. Together, they plan to introduce smart bats during the upcoming Champions Trophy 2017 in England. These smart bats will actually use chips, dubbed BatSense, that allow them to sense the bat swings. Batsensing Bats Three players from all international teams will have a Bat Sensor installed on top of their bats. The chip will generate data on each swing of the bat. In a statement, ICC said “The new bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays.” The statement adds, “With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed, and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast.” Impact of BatSense The sensors are developed by Intel and sports startup Specular. Useful insights like the back-lift angle, bat speed, impact momentum and follow-through will be measured using the sensors. These figures will be transmitted back to coaches for immediate analysis while broadcasters will be able to use the info to bring exciting content to the viewers. Following Hawk-Eye, which changed the whole cricketing scenario thanks to the use of high speed cameras and ball tracking technology, the new sensors can revolutionize the batting aspect of cricket. Studio pundits will be able to explain a player’s performance or weaknesses and how certain players can improve their gameplay or technique. Coaches and players will benefit the most and will be able to fine-tune training sessions. Players Who Will Use BatSense While it is almost confirmed that three players from each team will have BatSense-installed bats, the names of these players are yet to be announced. For now, we know of Indian and English players who will have the chips on their bats. England: Ben Stokes, Alex Hales, Jason Roy India: Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin More in Tow ICC plans to modernize the game by bringing upcoming technologies to the cricketing field. While similar bat-sensing tech has already been used in baseball bats, tennis racquets and golf clubs, it’s a first for cricket. Now, ICC is ready to incorporate VR and pitch reading drones. Everything is explained in the video below: What About Us? Specular has revealed that a consumer version of BatSense will be released later this year. People will no longer need expensive trainers or months of trial and error to improve their skills. If anyone wants to bat like AB de Villiers or Chris Gayle, they will be able to use VR technology and the bat sensors along with a digital trainers. Cricket fans, expect great times ahead with new ways of improving your game.

Vinod Yalburgi   June 1, 2017 15:56 IST ICC to bring advanced technology for analysing pitch and player's bat-swing stats at ICC Champions Trophy 2017Intel Newsroom The use of technology in sports has become a norm these days as tech gadgets have often proved invaluable in analysing a player's strengths and weaknesses. International Cricket Council has now revealed that it has been working with American tech giant Intel to bring pitch analysis tech, bat sensor and new virtual reality (VR) experience to the audience at the Champions Trophy 2017. The Champions Trophy kicked off on Thursday, June 1, with England taking on Bangladesh at The Oval, London, and avid cricket fans can get the best cricketing experience with the advent of new technology into the game. According to ICC, we will be seeing a new drone technology for handling advanced pitch analysis and a new VR experience for fans at the stadium. Team data analysts and coaches could now get busy with the new bat sensor technology from Intel, which enables accurate analysis of bat speed, the batsman's back-lift angle, and time to impact with the bat after the ball is released by the bowler. The new bat sensor is powered by Intel's Curie technology and can be attached to any cricket bat to collect stats on the player's bat-swing. Thereby players and coaches can monitor the batsman's strokes and help him correct his bat swing for improving his overall game. Here are a few excerpts from Intel's official post: With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich storytelling during broadcasts. Virtual reality (VR) experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston will allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skills against a virtual bowler. Avid cricket fans can now entertain themselves in an immersive world of virtual reality at select matches, wherein they will be allowed to test their batting skills while facing deliveries from a virtual bowler, using a head-mounted display (HMD). Apart from England and Bangladesh, six more nations including India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka and England will take part in the ICC Championship Trophy 2017.

Elmor, a processor performance enthusiast overclocked Intel Core i9-7900X. This deca-processor has a base clocking of 3.3 GHz. It clocks to a staggering 4.3 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 and to 4.5 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. However, Elmor overclocked i9-7900x to an unbelievable 5.7 GHz using Liquid Nitrogen cooling setup. This high end desktop platform scored 3181 points setting up a Cinebench world record. Also Read: How Intel's Compute Card Can Shape Up the IoT Market in The Year 2017 The feat was achieved on the following setup, ASUS Rampage V1 Apex X299 motherboard with G.Skill DDR4 memory and an ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Strix Gaming graphics card. Elmor had previously overclocked the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X at 5.8 GHz which scored 2454 on Cinebench. The competition will certainly heat up once Intel starts shipping its latest line of processors later this year. AMD's more than successful Ryzen series is about to face a tough competition from its arch rival. The 10 core, 20 threaded i9-7900X has been priced at $999 (approx Rs.) which is half the price consumers will pay for i9-7980XE.

Personal computer shipments industrywide showed small signs of growth in the first quarter—rising 0.6% according to market tracker International Data Corp. But no matter the size of the uptick, it was the first growth in five years. Intel's own PC chip unit saw revenue shoot up 6%, as sales of higher-priced CPUs aimed at gamers and content creators more than made up for slipping sales at the low end. And after years of delays and disappointments, Intel's CPU roadmap for 2017 and 2018 looks strong and on schedule. "I can say that we're kind of in a little bit of a renaissance," Bryant tells Fortune in his first interview since taking the new post a few weeks ago, formally the head of Intel's $33 billion client computing group, or CCG. Bryant reports to group president Murthy Renduchintala, the former Qualcomm (qcom) executive brought in at the end of 2015 to stabilize Intel's PC and mobile businesses. Promoted from running strategy and product development for the connected home products unit at Intel (intc), Bryant points to the rash of new applications requiring higher performance computing, from virtual reality to e-sports video gaming, that have lately been driving sales higher and enticing new manufacturers, like Chinese phone giants Xiaomi and Huawei, to make PCs for the first time. "There's just a lot of kinds of new innovation that's happening in the industry and then we're even seeing some new entrants," the 25-year Intel veteran says. "It's a good indication of some of the return to innovation and health in the business." Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Intel offered a host of its own innovations at the Computex trade show in Taiwan this week. Bryant unveiled the chip giant's newest line of CPUs, dubbed the Core X series, led by a monster chip called the Core i9 Extreme Edition, which will have 18 cores and cost about $2,000. The high-end processor, suited for 4K video editing or rendering complex virtual reality game environments, can hit a performance benchmark once reserved for supercomputers: the teraflop, or one million million floating point operations per second. "It's hard to get your head around if you’ve been in the industry for a long time like I have," Bryant says. "But just imagining that in terms of raw compute that we essentially have a teraflop CPU in a desktop PC form factor is kind of amazing." Intel famously built the first supercomputer capable of a teraflop. Known as ASCI Red, the behemoth was made for the U.S. government to simulate the decline of weapons in the country's nuclear arsenal after the end of live explosive tests. Put into operation almost exactly 20 years ago, ASCI Red was the fastest supercomputer in the world for three years running and wasn't retired until 2006. If it's humility that you're expecting, Bryant isn't offering any. Intel completely missed the smartphone revolution and has zero market share in phone processors, which have been dominated by chips based on ARM Holdings designs and made by Apple (aapl), Samsung and Qualcomm. In corporate and cloud data centers, Intel is doing well but has no graphics chip-based products, a rapidly growing niche dominated by rival Nvidia (nvda). But there don't seem to be any holes in Intel's product line according to Bryant. "We really believe we're a leading company and really the only company that can power every segment of this emerging smart connected world all the way from the cloud through the network to the edge devices and kind of everything in between," he says. Despite the confidence and the improving market conditions, Bryant and Intel face a renewed competitive threat in 2017 from Advanced Micro Devices (amd), the only other chipmaker compatible with Intel's own x86 architecture. AMD's new Ryzen line includes CPUs that can match the performance of much more expensive Intel chips. And AMD announced its own monster chip, perhaps anticipating the Core i9 announcement, dubbed the Ryzen Threadripper and including 16 cores. At the Computex show, AMD disclosed that the Threadripper chip will have considerably more bandwidth to connect to graphics cards, disk storage and other peripherals than any of Intel's newest chips. It likely will be months before reviewers and analysts can benchmark real world systems pitting the two monster chips against each other, however. Towards the end of the year, Intel will counter again, introducing systems with its 8th generation CPU design. Bryant wouldn't say much, except to note that the new chips are performing much better than Intel initially expected. The chipmaker had said it was expecting a 15% gain from the new line compared to the current 7th generation Kaby Lake line. But Bryant now says that the gain looks to be about 30%. That will come in handy as AMD pushes its Ryzen architecture further and faster over the next few years as well. "We really recognized the opportunity in the enthusiast space and we really stepped on the gas, we really stepped on the accelerator in this space, a while back," Bryant says. "And I think you're seeing that play through now." Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

There is a good possibility that there will be an increase in volatility along with sharp price fluctuations in the near future. Our volume indicators reflect volume flowing into and out of INTC.O at a relatively equal pace (neutral). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bearish on INTC.O and have had this outlook for the last 12 periods. Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 70.7318. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 51.57. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 22 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 79. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 3 period(s) ago.   computers, CPU, heffx, i9, INTC, Intel, NASDAQ, PC, shayne heffernan, US Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Sets Cinbench World Record added by John Heffernan on June 1, 2017 View all posts by John Heffernan → The following two tabs change content below.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares59 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Intel just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. Intel's new X299 platform and accompanying Core X-Series processors raise the bar for CPU and memory performance with up to 18 cores and 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. And they add bandwidth for multiple graphics cards and NVMe SSDs with up to 44 PCIe lanes through the CPU and even more from the chipset. It's an incredibly potent platform we've used to create the Prime, TUF, and ROG X299 families.     Based on Intel's X299 chipset, the ROG, Prime and TUF series feature state-of-the-art connectivity and control options designed for gamers, power users and prosumers   ROG has three models expertly tailored for different priorities: the Rampage VI Extreme lives up to its name for drool-worthy dream machines with custom liquid cooling and ultra-fast networking, the Rampage VI Apex unabashedly targets peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking, and the Strix X299-E provides gamers the powerful tuning, cooling, and personalization options they need to get the most from their rigs. ROG does more than just offer checkbox features-we take the time to ensure each one is empowering for enthusiasts and accessible for beginners.   The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same.   Shared innovations define the ROG X299 family All three boards share the same DNA - essential features that enthusiasts in the Republic of Gamers demand. That starts with critically acclaimed overclocking and cooling controls for liquid and air. There are dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in-one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for optimal efficiency and quiet acoustics. Sensor grouping lets your cooling react to a mix of workloads, including GPU-heavy gaming via direct temperature monitoring for select graphics cards. Tuning your gaming PC is easy whether you want to perfect your setup with manual tweaking or automatically configure and overclock the whole thing with a single click using our 5-Way Optimization utility.   Gaming PCs provide unprecedented options to express your style, including through personalized lighting. The RGB LEDs embedded on our boards are augmented by headers for multiple RGB LED strips to illuminate your entire chassis. All of the lighting is part of our Aura Sync ecosystem, which synchronizes harmoniously across compatible ROG graphics cards, peripherals, and monitors, along with other components from our partners.   Equipped with the latest generation of SupremeFX integrated audio, ROG's new X299 motherboards boast enhanced recording quality for streamers who want their voice to come through clearly. Graphics cards plug into reinforced SafeSlots that protect against damage from heavy GPU coolers and rough handling.   Intel's VROC technology combines with our optional add-in card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. You can hit ludicrous speeds with enough capacity for overflowing game libraries. You get all the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports and internal headers pushing speeds up to 10Gbps. Onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking are standard equipment, and you can add Intel's new Optane memory as a high-speed cache.   Imagine your dream machine with the Rampage VI Extreme The flagship of this new family is the Rampage VI Extreme, which balances power and design to elevate showcase PCs. It's made specifically for machines with custom liquid cooling. Along with all of the usual fan and pump headers, we added dual flow headers that let you monitor the coolant coursing through your loop. There's also a special connector that lets water blocks designed for the Extreme provide flow, temperature, and leakage data.   Almost every aspect of the Rampage VI Extreme has been enhanced to give you more. The Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller is bolstered by an onboard 10Gbps chip capable of increasing networking throughput by an order of magnitude. We've also upgraded the Wi-Fi to the latest 802.11ad standard, increasing wireless bandwidth up to 4.6Gbps.   To help avoid unsightly wiring, three M.2 SSDs can be added to the board without using the VROC card. One slots under the Extreme's outer skin, while the other two ride our DIMM.2 module next to the memory slots. The onboard Thunderbolt header lets you extend high-speed connectivity to external devices with our optional add-in card.   New for X299, the Rampage VI Extreme integrates a LiveDash OLED screen that lets you monitor system temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds right on the board. The dashboard also displays custom messages and graphics to add a little extra flair to your build. It's complemented by enough onboard LEDs and strip headers to put on a show.   Set performance records and game with the Rampage VI Apex ROG's commitment to pursuing the highest overclocks and top performance manifests in the Rampage VI Apex. This model is purpose-built for setting records at sub-zero temperatures - not just with LN2, but also with exotic liquid helium. Our overclocking experts have already used the Apex to take 8 world records and 20 global records with the Core X-processor reaching 7.560GHz, and we're just getting started. Expect more records to fall as we cement ROG's legacy as the absolute performance leader.   Less is more on the ragged edge. The Apex has only one DIMM slot per channel, which allows optimized trace routing that can improve stability with the fastest memory kits. You can load the board with 64GB of DDR4 memory running at blistering speeds and extremely low latencies. Memory is flanked by dual DIMM.2 slots that take up to four M.2 SSDs between them.   The Rampage VI Apex proudly wears its attitude on its sleeve - or rather PCB. The distinctive shape visually sets the Apex apart from the competition, while the customizable name plate provides space to add a personal touch. You also get the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports, onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking plus SupremeFX audio technology for those times when you want to game instead of setting records.   Game in style with the Strix X299-E Where the Rampage VI Extreme and Apex are highly specialized, the ROG Strix X299-E takes a more straightforward approach. It represents an affordable entry point into the Republic of Gamers without sacrificing the looks and features that define the number one gaming brand.   Like its Rampage siblings, the Strix wears a monochrome motif that won't clash with other components or your lighting choices. Featuring standard ATX dimensions, the Strix still comes with all of the slots, ports, and headers you expect from ROG. This includes dual M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs, Intel Gigabit networking, onboard Wi-FI, USB 3.1 Gen 2, SupremeFX audio technology with Sonic Studio III and class leading RGB options featuring Aura Sync.   Ready for liquid cooling and RGB lighting, the Strix X299-E has headers for dual pumps and both standard and addressable LED strips. We also include a couple of extension cables that make it much easier to get the look you want.   Prime time for X299   Built for power users and prosumers, the Prime series represents the culmination of decades of experience refining all aspects of motherboard technology. These boards mate state-of-the-art connectivity with accessible tuning options to provide a premium experience everyone can enjoy.   All of our X299 motherboards have extensive overclocking and cooling options available in both the UEFI and software. The Primes go one step further with 5-Way Optimization, which intelligently overclocks your system and tunes the cooling based on the individual characteristics of your components. Beginners can effortlessly optimize their entire PC with a single click, while experienced users can adjust tuning parameters to meet their needs.   Refinement extends to the styling, whose predominantly black-and-white theme lays the perfect foundation for understated builds-or much flashier ones with RGB lighting. Our Prime X299 boards feature multiple headers for LED strips that can light up your entire chassis. They're part of a rich ecosystem of Aura Sync products that can synchronize colors and effects across a complete system.   Intel's new Core X-Series processors demand serious cooling, which is why all of our new X299 motherboards have dedicated headers for all-in-one liquid coolers and stand-alone pumps. Our Prime X299 series also support up to three-way graphics configurations, and their x16 slots incorporate structural reinforcements with our SafeSlot technology to prevent damage and protect your investment.   PCIe lanes left unused by graphics can be devoted to storage with VROC, which combines multiple M.2 SSDs in a bootable RAID array connected directly to the CPU. An insane number of drives can run in parallel across multiple VROC cards to deliver staggering throughput and warp fast access for system drives. Intel's Optane Memory technology is supported, which provides a solid state cache to accelerate other storage devices.   This new Prime series receives our latest on-board audio enhancements, including a Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier and premium components that produce immersive and crystal clear sound which rivals some dedicated sound cards.   The Prime X299-Deluxe has everything Our Deluxe motherboards set the template for high-end builders who want it all, and the new Prime X299-Deluxe continues that proud tradition. It adds pretty much everything you could want on a high-end motherboard, from ultra-fast I/O to cutting-edge aesthetic enhancements.   After setting the bar for RGB lighting with Aura Sync, we're raising it with new customization features that take personalization to the next level. Chief among them is support for addressable lighting strips that offer independent control over each LED on the line, setting the stage for considerably more advanced effects. The Deluxe has headers for addressable and conventional RGB LED strips, plus dual onboard light bars that run down the I/O shield and chipset heat sink.   The chipset heat sink also houses the all-new LiveDash, an integrated OLED screen capable of displaying valuable system information and custom graphics. You can see vital stats like temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds without alt-tabbing away from games and other full-screen tasks. LiveDash can also display text messages and graphical animations to set your rig apart from the rest.   Ultra-high-speed storage is available in multiple form factors, and the Deluxe supports them all. In addition to offering a U.2 port for enterprise-grade SSDs, it comes with dual M.2 slots for gumstick-sized NVMe drives. Both M.2s are situated with thermals in mind; the main slot sits under the chipset heat sink, which reduces drive temperatures, while the secondary one mounts drives vertically near the DIMM slots, where they can be exposed to airflow generated by system fans.   Networking gets a boost from next-gen Wi-Fi with an integrated 802.11ad module. The dual-band solution can push wireless rates up to 4.6Gbps-several times the speed of most wired connections. And the Deluxe has you covered on the wired front, too, with dual Intel Gigabit Ethernet controllers delivering fast and reliable connectivity.   There's only so much we can squeeze onto a motherboard without exceeding standard ATX dimensions, so the Prime X299-Deluxe comes with a couple of sidekicks. Our ThunderboltEX 3 card is included, providing 40Gbps of bandwidth to external peripherals. We also bundle our Fan Extension card, which expands the board's already generous assortment of fan headers and temperature sensors. If you want one board with everything, the Deluxe is it.   Distill the essentials with the Prime X299-A Although the Prime X299-A features many of the same technologies as the Deluxe, it eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics. The combination of core Prime features with the latest Intel platform produces an enticing board.   Like its big brother, the X299-A supports up to three-way graphics configurations across a trio of x16 slots. You can add VROC arrays via our add-in card, if the two onboard M.2 slots are not enough. Essential I/O is fully covered, including an USB 3.1 Gen 2 internal header for chassis' that support the new 10Gbps standard, plus Type-A and reversible Type-C ports at the rear.   With a more sedate design than its sibling, the Prime X299-A can still light up your PC with RGB effects. The board has dual headers for off-the-shelf LED strips, each of which supports up to two meters of lighting at optimal brightness. The colors, effects, and tastefulness of the resulting glow is entirely up to you.   The Prime X299-A shows that affordable Core X-Series motherboards need not skimp on the features you crave. It has everything needed for an entry-level build, plus room to grow into something much more formidable.   TUF enough to endure Our Prime X299 motherboards are balanced by entries from the TUF family. These models march to a different beat that prioritizes reliability and durability for PCs built to go the distance. They use tougher components than conventional counterparts, and they're subjected to more stringent testing.   Shifting focus requires a new outlook, and TUF answers with distinctive designs that meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine. Stealthy by nature, the new boards minimize RGB lighting to concentrate on different priorities.   Arm yourself with the TUF X299 Mark 1 A new coat of reinforced armor makes the TUF X299 Mark 1 stand out from its predecessors. The protective cover streamlines airflow over the board and prevents dust from accumulating in nooks and crannies. Airflow beneath the surface is generated by a dedicated fan that also directs cool air toward the primary M.2 slot that further improves thermals.   Managing thermals is critical to maintaining stability when systems are pushed to the limit, especially on a high-end desktop platform. The TUF X299 Mark 1 is laced with additional temperature sensors to monitor different zones on the motherboard and in your system as a whole. Sensor data is fed into Thermal Radar 3 software that intelligently manages your cooling to keep temperatures and acoustics low.   The updated armor is our strongest yet, but the Mark 1's real strength comes from its Fortifier backplate. This rear reinforcement uses a carefully shaped and folded metal plate to stiffen the board against warping that now includes a removable GPU Holder that supports the weight of sagging graphics cards. And, as an added bonus, it helps dissipate thermal energy from multiple hot spots on the back of the PCB.   TUF Detective reprises its role as smartphone-powered troubleshooter and monitoring utility. Unlike previous iterations, which require a wired USB connection, the latest version performs diagnostics wirelessly over Bluetooth using the included USB adapter.   As the flagship of the TUF family, the Mark 1 also adds several perks. The glowing logo at the center of the board changes based on the load to show how hard the system is working. There are dual Intel Gigabit LAN controllers plus all the flavors in the USB 3.1 Gen2 rainbow: old-school Type-A, reversible Type-C, and internal header.   Welcome the X299 Mark 2 into the TUF family TUF strips down to the essentials with the X299 Mark 2. Like the Prime X299-A, the board delivers all the features of the new Intel platform, plus must-have ASUS innovations like advanced overclocking, cooling and tuning options. It removes the armor and backplate in favor of a naked PCB with a darker motif that blends into the shadows. The Mark 2 makes TUF more accessible for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula.   AVAILABILITY & PRICING   ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June with the Strix series arriving first. ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June. Suggested MSRP pricing will be announced by 6/26/2017.   Related Tags ASUS Intel Realtek Intel X299 ASUS ROG Motherboards Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD drops Ryzen 7 pricing by up to 23% GTA publisher on Switch: we're there front and center Pokemon Company profits soar by 2400% GTA parent buys Kerbal Space Program IP and devs iPhone 8 rumored size vs other phonesView More News Posts Forum Activity Raidmax Alpha Mid-Tower Chassis Review Amped Wireless Artemis-EX AC1300 Range Extender Review asrock fatal1ty x370 K4 GAMING - Cannot create RAID GA-Z87x-UD5H Only PS/2 Keyboard can be used with SETUP Plugable USBC-SATA-V USB 3.1 Gen 2 HDD Dock ReviewView More Forum Posts Press Releases Next generation 3D NAND propels PCIe SSD adoption Tegila expands lifetime storage program, unveils controller-only refresh option ASUS Republic of Gamers showcases brand new gaming innovations at Computex 2017 AMD exhibits PC innovation leadership at Computex 2017 Thermaltake unveils the new 4 tempered glass View 71 TG Edition full-tower chassis with Tt LCS CertifiedView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

Funsters port WannaCrypt to Commodore, Cisco, Nintendo and Tesla Data Center Cloud Google cloud switches on Intel's Skylake Xeons and cloud CPU picker Another thing cloud's changed: it used to be be server-makers that trumpeted CPU exclusives 1 Jun 2017 at 04:02, Simon Sharwood A member of Intel's new “Xeon Scalable Family” has appeared in Google's cloud. The Alphabet subsidiary says that Skylake Xeons are now generally available and that it is “the first and only public cloud to deliver Intel’s next-generation Xeon server processor”. That's the kind of thing server-makers used to trumpet in the hope those with a need for speed would shop with a perhaps-unfamiliar supplier to get their hands on more clock cycles. The arrangement with Google looks similar: The Register understands that Intel cut a custom Xeon for the Alphabet subsidiary to use in the knowledge it would shout long and loud about the new Xeon's many fine qualities. Google's not, however, sharing a lot. It is saying that Skylake-Xeon-powered instances have clock speed of 2.0 GHz and let you build virtual machines with up to 64 vCPUS and 455 GB of RAM. We still don't know exactly what's inside Skylake Xeons, which is no surprise given that Intel's only revealed branding for the CPUs and plans to reveal specifics about their their innards in coming days ahead of their mainstream launch. For now we have Google's assurance that the CPUs are well-suited to demanding applications, but that they're nonetheless ready to roll inside its standard instances, as well as the gruntier highmem, highcpu, Custom Machine Types and Preemptible VMs. For now they're only offered in Google's Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific regions, but the company says “we have more capacity arriving every day, and support for additional regions and zones coming in the near future.” Google's also added a new “Minimum CPU Platform” feature that lets you specify the worst CPU you're willing to use in its cloud. The company has admitted it has a fleet mixing Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell silicon. The new feature means if you specify Haswell, you'll never run on the older Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Google Intel Cloud Skylake Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Supermicro sockets it to Skylake rivals Comment Word to your motherboard 7 Comments Supermicro boasts of secret super server Silicon Valley win 30,000+ into a single 'valley data centre - but whose is it? 9 Comments Micron, VMware, Supermicro, Nexenta doodle array designs Cosy club comes up with flashy little reference architecture SuperMicro, IBM hook up Adding POWER servers yo its Xeon Ultra line Amazon's AWS S3 cloud storage evaporates: Top websites, Docker stung 'Increased error rates' is the new 'outage', according to Bezos' bit-barn bods 107 Comments Scality reinvents the RING, adds extra Amazon S3 polish Software-flinger improves security, integration with v6.4 Whitepapers Blending Cloud-native and Conventional Applications This IDC InfoBrief, sponsored by Red Hat, reviews ten lessons from early adopters for successful integration of cloud native and traditional applications.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Cricket: England trio to pioneer bat sensors in Champions Trophy Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. — AFP Relaxnews England trio Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes will be among the players from around the world pioneering new bat sensors during the upcoming Champions Trophy, it was announced Tuesday.  Technology giant Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. The aim is to both provide more information to television audiences and, longer term, develop a coaching aid. Former England captain turned cricket broadcaster Nasser Hussain told a news conference at The Oval: "How many times have we spoken about people having 'fast hands' or 'great bat speed'? "But what does that mean? We've never quantified it." Hussain, speaking ahead of the Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday, said he would have benefitted had this technology been available in his career. "When I first played for England, I had never really seen myself on television. I remember playing in Jamaica, getting out and walking through the hotel lobby and Geoffrey Boycott shouting at me 'Hussain, you'll never get any runs with that open bat face'. "Something like this can show you the exact angle of your bat." Hussain said Roy, going through a run drought that has yielded four single figure scores in his last five one-day international innings, might gain from the new system. "Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say 'is everything I'm doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?' and if you know it was, you know that's not the issue." Hussain added: "There will be traditionalists thinking 'is this relevant?'. "But if it gives you that one percent to improve the game, someone will be using it." Other innovations at the Champions Trophy include the use of high-technology drones to provide more in-depth pitch analysis and a virtual reality system that allows fans to experience what it's like to face the world's best bowlers. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, speaking alongside Hussain, welcomed the developments by saying: "If the technology is available to enhance and amplify the cricket experience, over the years we've shown a real willingness to trial and support it. "Our long-term vision is to make cricket the world's favourite sport and really there's only one way to achieve this – to keep the fans engaged and interested in the game." The former South Africa wicket-keeper added:  "That's all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology." — AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple said to ready Siri speaker in bid to rival Google, Amazon Chinese bitcoin exchanges resume withdrawals after freeze China puts into effect new drone registration rules Blame game for cyberattacks grows murkier as spying, crime tools mix How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Short film contest wants M’sians to dig deep CAS hearing set for Velez transfer dispute with Man City Hair and body care brand launches campaign to aid nature society‘s efforts advertisement Latest News Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Waymo working on self-driving trucks Most Viewed in Tech Chipmakers at Taiwan's biggest tech fair look beyond crowded smartphone market Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision Sophisticated automatic replies are coming to Gmail Ethiopia cuts off Internet after high school exam leaks Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account Waymo working on self-driving trucks Social media firms have increased removals of online hate speech To play Android games on your PC, this is the best emulator Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

This particular motherboard is "designed for gamers and PC enthusiasts who love performance," and features high-end tools for overclockers including a 10 phase DigitALL power design with Loadline Calibration and MSI's Turbo Socket.     The X299 GAMING M7 ACK also features M.2 Shield FROZR to cool M.2 SSDs, Audio Boost 4 PRO, which allows users to use two headphones and speakers at the same time, as well as a three-way conjunction of Killer networking hardware to ensure optimum online gaming. MSI's premium X299 mobo also features Mystic Light RGB along the board's heat sinks and covers, offering 16.8 million colors combos and 17 LED effects.     Next up is the MSI Performance Series, which includes the X299 GAMING PRO CARBON AC and X299 GAMING PRO CARBON motherboards. Let's start with the first one: the Gaming Pro Carbon AC is touted as "a modder's dream" and is the world's first motherboard to allow users to change-out the stock heat sink covers and X-Mount accessories with custom 3D-printed and modded covers, but MSI provides three color options: black, silver, and gold.     The board also comes with Mystic Light RGB LEDs and many of the premium M.2 cooling, audio boost, game boost, and Killer LAN networking features as the other models.   The X299 Gaming Pro Carbon is essentially the same as the X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC besides the swappable custom covers.     Last but not least we have MSI's Aresnal Gaming series, which is comprised of the X299 Tomohawk and X299 SLI Plus.     The X299 Tomohawk's main selling point is its solid reinforced design. The motherboard features stainless steel heat sinks and a "Steel Armor" design that's built with Military Class 5 components, making it "unbreakable in any gaming session."   The X299 Tomohawk also features front-facing USB Type-C for a myriad of different devices, and rocks the premium features of MSI's motherboard series including VR boost and game boost, along with Audio Boost 4 with Nahimic 2 to deliver "next level sound quality".     The MSI X299 SLI Plus is "engineered to gratify even the most demanding professional" and features premium power phases and high-end military class components to ensure optimum reliability. In fact, MSI boasts that the X299 SLI Plus is the "strongest SLI PLUS we've ever built."   "The X299 SLI PLUS adopts premium Dual Intel® LAN, optimized for maximum transfer speeds by reducing CPU overhead and offering exceptionally high TCP and UDP throughput. Featuring 15KV protection, the X299 SLI PLUS also shields your network from lightning strikes and static electricity.   "Combining MSI exclusive System Saver design, users will never have to worry about a system issue. Simply use one of the System Saver's options to guarantee a successful boot up. For maximum data transfer performance and latest generation SSD support, the X299 SLI PLUS adopts the latest Turbo U.2 and Twin Turbo M.2 with Steel Armor.   "For the best DDR4 memory compatibility and stability, DDR4 boost with Steel Armor is included. The X299 SLI PLUS motherboard will make anyone's professional life easier with super stable, reliable and long-lasting top performance.     MSI also notes that its full fleet of X299 motherboads are the first to feature the new ASMedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 controller to enable maximum high-speed performance. In fact, all the front-facing USB Type-C connectors featured on MSI's X299 motherboards have been upgraded from Gen1 to Gen2 for improved performance and transfers. >> NEXT STORY: Thermaltake announces tempered glass full-tower PC case << PREVIOUS STORY: GIGABYTE reveals new fleet of Aorus X299 motherboards Related Tags Computex 2017 Intel X299 X299 MSI MSI X299 Motherboards Motherboards Intel BitFenix Corsair Phanteks Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD drops Ryzen 7 pricing by up to 23% GTA publisher on Switch: we're there front and center Pokemon Company profits soar by 2400% GTA parent buys Kerbal Space Program IP and devs iPhone 8 rumored size vs other phonesView More News Posts Forum Activity Raidmax Alpha Mid-Tower Chassis Review Amped Wireless Artemis-EX AC1300 Range Extender Review asrock fatal1ty x370 K4 GAMING - Cannot create RAID GA-Z87x-UD5H Only PS/2 Keyboard can be used with SETUP Plugable USBC-SATA-V USB 3.1 Gen 2 HDD Dock ReviewView More Forum Posts Press Releases Next generation 3D NAND propels PCIe SSD adoption Tegila expands lifetime storage program, unveils controller-only refresh option ASUS Republic of Gamers showcases brand new gaming innovations at Computex 2017 AMD exhibits PC innovation leadership at Computex 2017 Thermaltake unveils the new 4 tempered glass View 71 TG Edition full-tower chassis with Tt LCS CertifiedView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

Huawei P10, P10 Plus launch in South Africa Samsung Galaxy S8 launches in SA tomorrow, what do critics say? Computers / Intel Core i9: six things worth knowing By Hadlee Simons on 31 May, 2017 Intel made a huge splash this week when it announced the Core i9 processor. Of course, 9 is higher than 7 (duh), so you’d expect it to be powerful (bigger duh). But what are the key things to know about the new chip? A lot of cores and threads The Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition has a monster 18 cores and 36 threads, clearly being designed for the one-percenter wanting to one-up their middle class friends. Otherwise, the company says the new chips are made with “advanced gaming, VR and content creation in mind”. It’s part of Intel’s new X-Series family Yep, the Core i9 isn’t the only new chip brought to market by Intel, as it’s actually part of a family of ultra high-end processors. Other chips include the standard Core i9 7900X (10 cores/20 threads), the Core i7 7820X (8 cores/16 threads), Core i7 7800X (6 cores/12 threads), the Core i7 7740X (4 cores/8 threads) and Core i5 7640X (4 cores/4 threads). Pricing? The Core i9 Extreme Edition won’t be cheap though, receiving a suggested price of US$1999. Sheesh. How about the Core i9 7900X? Well, you’re looking at a US$999 price tag. Able to pay more than US$999 but not willing to go to the US$2000 mark? Well, Intel is also readying 12, 14 and 16 core variants of the Core i9 chip, with suggested prices of US$1199, US$1399 and US$1699 respectively. Otherwise, the cheapest chip in the family (Core i5 7640X) has a US$242 price tag. About the socket Intel has confirmed that the X-Series family takes advantage of a new LGA 2066 socket. In other words, you’ll need to buy a new motherboard as well. Then again, if you’re buying the most expensive chip, it’s a small price to pay. How powerful is it? Intel claims that the family also includes their first teraflop CPU. But it’s not just due to sheer number of cores, apparently. Although that helps massively. The company’s new boost tech sees the two best cores being identified, with heavy lifting then being directed to them for a performance boost. Intel adds that you should be able to edit, transcode, animate and render simultaneously (presumably on the higher end chips). What about gaming? For starters, the company says it represents the best gaming performance in an Intel chip. Obviously. But Intel says you can game, stream, record and transcode simultaneously too (again, we presume you’ll want to try this on the higher end processors). Otherwise, the firm says the new chips have support for up to four graphics cards Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

ASRock displays its trove of funky motherboards at Computex by Zak Killian  8:00 AM on May 31, 2017 We've yet to look at the company's wares, but ASRock is in attendance at Computex, too. ASRock has a reputation for making some of the zanier products around, although it might prefer the word "innovative." This year, the company is showing off some unique motherboards for both Intel and AMD systems, along with what might be the coolest application of the Mini-STX form factor we've seen yet. ASRock has the usual array of high-end X299 boards on display. Although we don't have specific details on the models, the company is showing X299 motherboards bearing Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel's sobriquet as well as the name of champion overclocker Nick Shih. While the X299 Fatal1ty Professional Gaming i9 hails from the "does everything" school of motherboard design, the X299 OC Formula by Nick Shih is more stripped-down, with just four memory slots and a 14-phase voltage regulator. Perhaps more interesting to gerbils (given you folks' affection for PCs en miniature) is the X299E-ITX/ac. Yes, ASRock's engineers crammed an X299 motherboard into the Mini-ITX form factor. To support the LGA 2066 socket's quad-channel memory, the board uses a quartet of SODIMM slots. It also packs on six SATA ports, three M.2 sockets, dual Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet ports, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Intel's X299 platform isn't the only one getting the ITX treatment from ASRock. The Socket AM4 X370 Gaming-ITX/ac is exactly what it sounds like: a Mini-ITX motherboard for AMD's Ryzen CPUs. You only get two DIMM slots, but they're for full-sized sticks instead of SODIMMs. The board supports the Ryzen CPU's native USB 3.1 ports and has a pair of HDMI outputs, should you wish to stick an APU in it. ASRock also has a version of the board coming out with an AMD B350 chipset onboard. In case you haven't heard, cryptocurrency "mining" has come back into vogue lately because of newer "alt-coin" algorithms that can't easily be accelerated on custom hardware. Generally speaking, GPUs are once again the chosen platform, and since such work is primarily done in chunks that fit entirely on a graphics card and its local memory, the host system's performance is less relevant. Miners could spend a bundle on expensive X299 systems to host their hashing, or they could buy something like ASRock's H110 Pro BTC+. This stripped-down platter has twelve PCIe x1 slots and a single x16 slot. All those slots can be filled with enough graphics cards to power a heavy-duty mining rig. Finally (at least as far as PC parts go), ASRock will be showing off some mini-PCs at its Computex booth. We don't know much about the new boxes yet, but the company says it is launching a line of DeskMini RX and DeskMini GTX products based on products like its new Z270M-STX motherboard. Mini-STX is the proper name of the form factor formerly known as "5x5", since it's just five inches square. ASRock says the Z270M-STX mobo supports MXM graphics cards and a staggering three M.2 slots. Hopefully our guys on the ground will get a chance to stop by the ASRock booth to see this stuff in person. If not, you'll surely be hearing about some of these products in the coming months, so keep an eye out. Tags: Motherboards Systems Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Almost everyone has a smartphone or a tablet or notebook, and some people have all three. Customers want these devices to be light, thin and portable. But, looking at the venerable PC, it seems this same trend has not really caught on. PC enthusiasts are well aware of the Mini-ITX form factor, but the wider market still seems to think of the PC as the stereotypical ATX sized box that has been with us for decades. Most people are simply unaware that they can have a fully capable PC in the size of a paperback book (such as a NUC) or have a gaming capable PC, even capable of 4K gaming, in a package the size of a CD player or shoebox. We have gathered some popular PC components and we’ll be putting them into a Silverstone Fortress FTZ01 and see just what a mini PC is capable of. Let’s start off with our component choices. The Components The Case – Silverstone FTZ01 $185 SGD The case is obviously a key component when considering a mini build. Silverstone is a company that consistently release and refine small form factor products including power supplies and coolers, so it was really easy to choose Silverstone for the chassis and PSU. The Silverstone FTZ01 is among our very favorites. It’s one of the best-designed ITX cases available. It is surprisingly easy to work with,  especially with its GPU riser system that allows the use of large, high-powered video cards, all the while packing a slim, low profile chassis with a 14L capacity. At 14.8″ (W) x 4.21″ (H) x 13.82″ (D), it’s one of the smallest cases capable of holding a high end system without compromise. The FTZ01 is is a premium metal body case which offers the flexibility of being placed vertically or horizontally. It retains flexibility with regards to cooling, it will accept a 3.5″ HDD if needed and includes a slot for a DVD or Blu Ray player at its front. It’s size is about what you’d see from a typical Hi-Fi component. Naturally a small form factor case will come with some considerations, including the choice of cooler, but these are easily worked around with the knowledge of what you need. The Power Supply– Silverstone SX700-LPT 80Plus Platinum $248 SGD The Silverstone SX700-LPT  is a 700 watt power supply, meaning its capable of powering essentially any system including overclocked CPUs with high core counts and a single graphics card. It will also power many systems with dual GPUs too, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a small form factor build. The key reasons for choosing this unit are its small size and the fact that it is 80Plus Platinum rated. This means it has very good efficiency, which in turn means less heat output and a lower power bill. This is a key consideration for any small form factor build where cooling is usually not as efficient as a full sized build.   The Motherboard– MSI Z270I Gaming AC $329 SGD For our motherboard, we chose a MSI Z270i Gaming AC. This board has a raft of high end features, including quality audio, AC Wi-Fi, M.2 support, USB 3.1 and even full RGB lighting.   The CPU – Intel i7-7700 – $475 SGD The CPU was a tougher choice. While we could have gone with a 7700K, its TDP is significantly higher than our eventual choice of a i7-7700. The 7700 means we have a turbo frequency of up to 4.2Ghz while keeping TDP at an impressive 65w. This compares to 91w for a 7700K. So, with a 3.6Ghz base clock and 4.2 Ghz boost clock, the i7-7700 still provides 8 threads and will easily power the latest games and have enough grunt on hand for demanding tasks. it will also be easy for a modest CPU cooler to handle. The CPU Cooler – Cryorig C7 – $55 SGD The Cryorig C7 cooler is specifically designed for small form factor builds. It has the same footprint as a stock Intel cooler, which fit’s into the Intel socket area where no other components are allowed. This means it won’t interfere with tall memory heatsinks, chipset or PWM heatsinks. It’s still much better than the standard Intel cooler thanks to the addition of heatpipes, greater fin surface area and a more efficient fan. It is easily capable of keeping the 65w i7-7700 cool. The GPU – AMD Radeon RX480 8Gb $409 The choice of GPU for a small form factor build will depend on the users budget and usage scenario. The FTZ01 case can handle cards up to 13″ in length and supports dual slot cards. We chose a reference AMD RX480 with its exhaust blower configuration. This is key as all the heat is dumped outside the case. The card performs well at 1080p and offers a good range of technologies including HDMI 2.0b and Display Port 1.4 for driving high resolution displays. It also brings native HEVC Main 10 support making it a good choice for playback of 4k60p content on modern televisions. A GTX 1060 3Gb or 6Gb would be another good choice for the same reasons. We also have a GTX 1080 Ti reference card here that would be the ultimate choice, but its expense is something to consider. If you want to game on your sexy 4k TV or display though, its the only choice. Do you fancy gaming on a 4k OLED 65″ TV? Droooooool… Of course if you’re playing less demanding games such as DOTA or CS:GO, then you can save dollars and go with a cheaper card, though do be aware that a cheaper card might not be capable of pushing to the 120 or 144fps levels that many gamers prefer.   The Memory – G.Skill 2x8Gb DDR4-3200 $239 SGD G.Skill make the highest speed memory you can get, and high speed memory just so happens to run very well on dual slot motherboards. 2x8Gb of DDR4-3200 is a good sweet spot choice of speed, capacity and performance.   The Storage – Zotac 240Gb SSD $149 + Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD $499+ Seagate 2Tb HDD $115 These days, a 128-256Gb SSD simply runs out of space once you put a few programs on there. Think Grand Theft Auto 5 or similar which takes up the best part of 70Gb! For this reason we chose a smallish 240Gb Zotac Premium SSD for the OS, then a Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD for games and and a Seagate 2Tb SSD for media storage. You can omit the HDD of course if you have a NAS or external drive. This will make the system much quieter. Mechanical drives really do make an annoying whirring noise that is really noticeable when they spin up.   The Build Moving onto the build, as we see below, the Silverstone FTZ01 has a unique GPU cage/holder with PCIe extender which allows the card flat relative to a normal GPU/MB installation. This alone allows the case to be several centimeters thinner than would otherwise be possible. Here is the PCie Extender card itself. Inside the cylindrical hole is where you place the GPU into the slot. Here is the RX480 attached to the GPU mechanism. The little black plastic piece in the middle is designed to support the weight of the GPU. This a is a good idea since GPU sagging is become more of an issue as GPUs seemingly get ever heavier. Below is the system prior to installing the GPU cage. This gives an illustration of some of the options available with the FTZ01. If you don’t install the cage and use the IGP, you could install a dual radiator watercooler. Some users might wish to skip gaming altogether and this would allow you to run a heavily overclocked i7-7700K if you like, or even the likes of an ASRock X99ITX or one of the upcoming X299 or AM4 ITX motherboards. On the outside of the case, the fans have magnetized dust covers which seal up the system very nicely.   Here is the system in its complete state minus the WD 1Tb SSD and hard drive (which would be located just underneath the main power cables at the top right). The GPU is located below the SSD. The space to the bottom right is where an optical drive can be placed. Cable management is usually a bit of a nightmare in smaller form factor builds where space is the primary consideration, but in the Silverstone FTZ01 the cables can be routed quite well, which improves airflow and assists with cooling. The scale of the system is well illustrated here with the I/O of the motherboard and graphics card clearly visible. Below is a good comparison of the size if the unit vs a full sized Corsair 760T case. As you can see, it’s a lot smaller in every dimension!   But how does it perform? Here is the main spec of the system. 8 cores at 4Ghz+ at 65w.. Nice!   One of the supposed weaknesses of a compact system is the compromising on cooling. The FTZ01 has no problems with airflow, and the i7-7700 stayed under 80c, which is quite good for a Kaby Lake processor under 100% load. Obviously the Cryorig cooler isn’t as good as a top end air cooler, let alone a water cooler, but under 80c is perfectly worry free.   The beauty of 8 threads is you can do some serious work with them. As you can see below, a i7 7700 smashes an overclocked 2600K at video encoding. The 2600K is one of the best processors Intel ever made, but its starting to show its age now. the i7 -7700 is a good 25% faster without an overclock. We ran a few game benchmarks to see how we’d go. With the RX480, 1080p is the real sweet spot for high quality gaming. Once you go to 1440p, you’ll have to dial back the quality a bit to maintain 60fps. Rise of the Tomb Raider with Very High settings held at 70fps, Far Cry Primal 61fps and Ashes of The Singularity 47.5fps when set to Extreme with DX12 mode enabled. These are difficult games to run, but all are easy with a RX480. Of course you can add about 10% of performance if you go with a RX580. Don’t forget that games like CS:GO, Overwatch or DOTA can get by with a low end card, but to get the best experience in these games, high FPS is still desirable. If you’re running a 120hz+ monitor with freesync, you’ll need a decent card to get the best out your games.   Summing it up The Total for the system is $2700. Of course you’ll need a monitor and peripherals to go with it. This is certainly not cheap, but we think this is a good balanced system. You can easily put a top end graphics card in there and game happily at 4K, alternatively you could go for a cheaper CPU or skip the graphics card altogether. Even a Kaby Lake dual core will do the job for non compute intensive tasks. Another option might be to go for some generic memory, for example 2x8Gb of DDR4-2400. Why ITX? It’s just more convenient! You get the full power of a modern PC, whilst combining it into a small form factor. A smaller footprint adds a lot of flexibility when it comes to the uses of the system. A living room gaming PC? A portable LAN PC? Living in a university dorm room? Not everyone wants a huge snarling beast of a system decked out in Christmas RGB lights. Some people want their systems to be functional and blend in. The wolf in sheep’s clothing. Having experience in PC sales in a previous life, it’s amazing how many people automatically assume a small PC is a weak PC. It is not! The point here isn’t so much to build a top end system or a budget system, it’s to show what an ITX system is capable of. Other than really high end multi GPU systems, a well though out ITX build can do everything a full sized build can do. We all like Ultrabooks, slim phones & compact tablets. Why not apply the same thinking to your next PC? Bigger doesn’t always mean better!   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Dell Specials at The PC Show and the Consumer Electronic Exhibition!

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Did Samantha Power ask for American citizens to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports? posted at 6:41 pm on June 1, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES A leftover from yesterday that shouldn’t be missed. Thanks to Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intel Committee and the man who first raised suspicions about improper “unmasking” in March, subpoenas have been issued to three Obama-era officials. Two are natsec people — Susan Rice and John Brennan, both of whom might have had good cause to “unmask” the identities of Trump staffers in the course of reviewing intelligence reports. But the third was a surprise. It’s Samantha Power, formerly the U.S. ambassador to the UN. Why would she be caught up in an “unmasking” review? She’s a diplomat, not an intelligence specialist. “Unmasking” is the revealing in intelligence reports of the identities of Americans whose communications (or information about whom) have been “incidentally” intercepted during foreign-intelligence-collection operations. Of course, the fact that a subpoena demanding information is issued does not necessarily mean the information exists. Nevertheless, the issuance of a subpoena implies that the issuer has a good-faith basis to believe it does. On that score, it has previously been reported that the committee’s chairman, Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), has reviewed intelligence reporting and detected instances of unmasking. Were there to be information indicating that Ms. Power was involved in unmasking American identities in intelligence reports, significant questions would be raised. As ambassador to the U.N., Power, a long-time Obama adviser, held a diplomatic position. She was not an intelligence analyst. It is not immediately clear why the U.N. ambassador would be involved in the disclosure of American identities in intelligence reports — after the agencies that collected and analyzed the intelligence had decided such identities should be masked. “Unmaskings are supposed to be rare,” noted the Wall Street Journal in an editorial, “and if the mere ambassador to the U.N. could demand them, what privacy protection was the Obama White House really offering U.S. citizens?” Watch the report Fox News ran on this embedded below. At 2:00, James Rosen flags an unusual question that Trey Gowdy asked Brennan at a hearing recently: “Do you recall any U.S. ambassadors asking that names be unmasked?” Hmmmm. Brennan doesn’t give him a categorical “no” either. Double hmmmm. One big wrinkle, though. Technically, neither Power nor anyone else can “demand” that American citizens be “unmasked.” They can request it; the decision then falls to the NSA or FBI (whichever agency has the relevant surveillance transcript), which can deny the request if it has no obvious intelligence purpose. That is, if it’s true that Power was keeping tabs on Trump staffers, this scandal would be much bigger than her. It would implicate the NSA and/or the FBI in approving a dubious request, especially if, as Nunes has claimed, the “unmaskings” he saw had no obvious foreign intelligence rationale. There’s another possibility, though. Maybe, notwithstanding Gowdy’s question, Power’s not being looked at because she requested an “unmasking.” Maybe someone else in a more plausible natsec position requested it and the unmasked transcript somehow found its way into Power’s hands. Remember, one of Nunes’s complaints in March about the intelligence he’d seen was that unmasked material had been “widely disseminated” within the Obama administration. If even someone as far-flung from the IC as Power had gotten hold of the material, that might explain what he meant. Power may have been subpoenaed so that the committee can find out who was passing intelligence to whom once they’d received it, properly, from the NSA or FBI. Since we’re on the subject of improper sharing of intelligence, an intriguing report (also left over from yesterday) via John Crudele of the New York Post: The Justice Department has gotten a warrant from the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court — also known as the FISA court — to conduct electronic surveillance on a group of journalists who’ve been the recipient of leaked information, the source said. The journalists are not the target, according to my source — and I say, thank goodness for that. Instead, the Trump administration is looking for the leaker. Who could it be? Some in the administration are focusing on a retired, high-ranking military officer who held important posts in the intelligence service, according to the source. A retired, high-ranking former military officer who held important intelligence posts and is supposedly being fed info by “holdovers from the Obama administration” in the White House? That points to James Clapper or Michael Hayden, and Hayden didn’t serve in the Obama administration (except for a few weeks very early on while he was waiting to be replaced). Triple hmmmm.

Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles doubling as security cameras. Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as these cars can spot a specific license plate 'quite rapidly'. Scroll down for video  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles, such as Uber's models (pictured) doubling as security cameras INTEL'S TAKE ON SELF-DRIVING CARS  Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles doubling as security cameras. Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as these cars will have the power to spot a specific license plat 'quite rapidly'. Intel also sponsored a study this month that discussed how passengers of autonomous vehicles will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. This means riders will be able to stream movies during their travels and surf the web – providing advertisers with new outlets for targeting ads. This will create a 'personal economy' sector that is said to be a $7 trillion business by 2050.  On Thursday, Krzanich spoke at the Code Conference in California, where he discussed the benefits of self-driving cars – other than reducing road accidents, CNBC reported. He also acknowledged the fact that using the vehicle's cameras to 'look' at license plates and other cars on the road could be intrusive on people's privacy. 'We'll have to put limitations on it,' he said. 'We'll have to encrypt that data and make sure I can't tell that it's John's [car] necessarily,' said Krzanich. 'I think there will be rules and new areas we'll have to explore, but the amount of social good that can come from that far outweighs those concerns.' 'We just have to deal with them.' The semiconductor manufacturer also sponsored a report written by researchers at Strategy Analytics, which discussed how passengers of these autonomous vehicles will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. The study, entitled 'Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy', has suggested that by 2050, passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a self-driving car) will be a $7 trillion business.

But it will see a giant leap to an $800 billion market worldwide by 2035. The report shared that pilotless vehicles will free more than 250 million hours of consumers' commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. 'We'll have to put limitations on it,' said Krzanich (pictured) in the interview  'We'll have to encrypt that data and make sure I can't tell that it's John's [car] necessarily' Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as the cameras, like those used by Google's Waymo (pictured), can spot a specific license plate 'quite rapidly' This means riders will be able to stream movies during their travels and surf the web – providing advertisers with new outlets for targeting ads. The study has deemed mobility-as-a-services as the driving factor of the $7 trillion business. 'These mobility service providers will offer both on-demand and contract or subscription models that offer transportation as an amenity to their core retailing products or services,' the report reads. Intel sponsored a report that discussed how passengers will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. The study has deemed mobility-as-a-services as the driving factor of the $7 trillion business called 'personal economy' 'They will compete with a rising tide of service providers from across a range of consumer industries, including web/internet and retailing powerhouses who offer transportation as amenities of their core product/service offerings.' 'Mobility services will be an element of the value proposition of an office building, apartment complex, university campus or home.'  Read more: Intel CEO Krzanich: Self-driving cars will double as security cameras newsroom.intel.c...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price.

Unless you have a very good reason not to. And get a laptop with a SDD, or have one fitted from the shop you buy from .

But that architecture has not come to the laptop market yet. So I would probably stick to an intel chip for a laptop. I do have an AMD A10-5630 or something, and its fine, but I also have an intel i7-4620Q in my other laptop and that is far more powerful. simon14 1815 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 18 Trusted   Reply # 1763827 13-Apr-2017 14:13 Thanks guys,       Ideally looking for a laptop with good processor, 8gb ram and touch screen.

If the machine is low on RAM (4GB or less) it makes the whole machine faster as the swap file is on the SSD instead of a slow spinning disk.   128GB is fine for a SSD for a general machine for email, web, that kind of thing. My PC has a 128GB SSD, of which only 50GB is used, and that's with a LOT of stuff installed - Office, Photoshop, Development tools, etc, but no games.   AMD CPUs are probably fine for general use machines as well. @dazhann If you put up a link to the machines you'll get more advice.

A 7 year old i3 CPU gets 3600. However the AMD is about half as fast as my old i7 single threaded, so it's probably ok for general use. Complex web pages and multiple tabs might not be as fast as you'd like, but should be ok I think.

Following a quiz session which featured corporate teams, and a solo singing competition, it was time for a fascinating discussion on 'Careers - Many Pathways to Success'. On the panel was Raj Jain (CEO, BCCL), Saurabh Kumar (co-founder, Grofers), Warren Patrick (chief 'learning' officer and senior president, YES Bank), Debjani Ghosh (ex CEO, Intel) and Ritesh Agarwal (founder and CEO, OYO Rooms), with Swapan Seth acting as the eloquent moderator. So, what is success all about? Are there different paths to success? Is failure a necessary stopover on the road to success? And if you're a college dropout, do you have a better chance of being successful in life? "Success is about being grateful when you wake up every morning, for what you have, what you've done, and where you are. It's also the zeal and energy to make tomorrow better than today," shared Jain. Patrick felt success was the achievement of a goal, whether personal or professional, while Kumar believed if you're happy with what you are doing, then you are successful. For Agarwal, if what you're doing can create a positive impact around yourself, you've achieved success. "Success is a state of mind. It's a time when, and a place where, you feel good with where you are and what you have achieved, and you're ready to move on to the next level," said Ghosh, who quit as Intel CEO at the top of her game. As for yardsticks of success, they differ from person to person. "Acceptance and acknowledgment by your peers fuels your journey to success, a journey that is never-ending. And you keep raising the bar higher, each step along the way," said Patrick. Kumar believed how one defines success comes from within, while Agarwal felt that success is directly proportional to ambition. And what are the attributes of success? Well, topmost are the values and principles that one is taught, and embraces. Also, learning from people who have been there, done that. To these Agarwal added the spirit of contrarianism. "Whatever you do, do it differently to everyone else." Jain mentioned inquisitiveness and a desire to learn all the time. "I would love to be an Uber driver one day - it's such a fun life, doing what you want, when you want! "But there's also no substitute for good old hard work," added Jain. Still, in any conversation about success, failure cannot be too far behind. "Failure without deep reflection has no meaning. You have to learn from failure," Jain advised. According to Agarwal, failure is a stepping stone to success. "It should be considered a badge of honour!" Kumar believed every failure makes you a better person, but insisted it shouldn't be glamourised. "It should be a part of the journey - it's important to take learnings from failure." Patrick took the philosophical approach. "If you haven't experienced the darkness, you won't appreciate the light. If you haven't experienced failure, you won't taste the fruits of success." Failure is part and parcel of life, admitted Ghosh, adding that if success isn't fun, it isn't success at all. It's probably best to conclude by paraphrasing Rudyard Kipling: 'If you can meet with 'Success' and 'Failure' / And treat those two impostors just the same', then the sky truly is the limit.

Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion Study Estimates the Value of Goods and Services in the Early Years of the ‘Passenger Economy’ Will Be More Than Twice the Size of the ‘Sharing Economy’ NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel predicts a new “Passenger Economy” will emerge to support the idle time when drivers become riders The economic opportunity will grow from US$800 billion to US$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream Mobility-as-a-Service will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations and usage A new study by Intel Corporation and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy," the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. (Graphic: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 01, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Here's what that means It's as fast as a turn-of-the-century supercomputer. By Rob Verger posted Jun 1st, 2017 at 1:26pm Intel's Core i9 Extreme Edition processor costs about $2,000. Intel Corporation Earlier this week in Taipei, Intel announced the most powerful desktop chip for consumers that it has ever sold. With 18 cores and a price tag of $1,999, the processor is known as a teraflop chip, meaning it can accomplish a trillion computational operations every second. Called the Core i9 Extreme Edition processor, the chip is not for the average computer user, someone who just wants to check email, read the news, and watch “House of Cards.” Instead, the processor is for people who want to do extreme stuff, like playing a game in 4K while simultaneously livestreaming it—oh, and also doing two other things at the same time. In a cute turn of phrase, Intel calls this “mega-tasking.” This is Intel’s first time making a consumer desktop chip that breaks the teraflop barrier, and Gregory Bryant, an Intel senior vice president, calls it “by far the most extreme desktop processor ever introduced.” From megaflops to teraflops to petaflops To get a sense of what a teraflop can do, it helps to know what FLOPS, a unit of computing speed, are. FLOPS stands for floating-point operation per second; one floating-point operation means taking two numbers that have a decimal point in them and doing some math on them, like multiplying them together. One teraflop is a trillion floating-point operations every second. “There was a time, when if someone said ‘teraflop,’” says Brandon Lucia, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “you would expect them to be talking about a supercomputer that had many, many processor chips.” In fact, if you wind back the clock to 1976, the Cray-1 supercomputer could do just 160 megaflops (that’s a million FLOPS), meaning this singular new Intel chip is about 6,000 times as fast as that machine, says Steve Scott, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at Cray, Inc. The Cray-1. Cray Inc In the late 1990s and 2000s, supercomputers were still measured in teraflops, and an important machine called ASCI Red at Sandia National Laboratory reigned as the fastest machine in the world from 1997 to 2000. It could do over a teraflop. Today, these powerful machines are measured in petaflops (that’s a thousand trillion FLOPS). As just one example, Mira, the supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, is a 10-petaflop machine that has been used to model complex scenarios like a potential Ebola outbreak in the United States. “Supercomputing technologies have now filtered down into the consumer space,” Scott says. “If you can build a petaflop system for many millions of dollars, that means you can build 10 teraflop systems that companies or smaller organizations can afford to buy, or one teraflop systems that individual consumers can afford to buy.” When a chip like the new Intel processor is doing floating-point operations, the math is not done just for the sake of doing math—it’s the computation powering the software you’re running. “This isn’t just to make the computer into a calculator,” Lucia, of Carnegie Mellon, says. “Those floating point numbers represent the kind of important workloads that we care about, whether it’s video editing or virtual-reality environments.” In short: a powerful chip like this can make virtual reality, gaming, streaming 4K video, or video editing all go faster and more smoothly. A PlayStation 4 has a graphics processing unit that can do over a teraflop, if you’re keeping score at home. The Trinity supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Los Alamos National Laboratory Computer processors have cores The Intel chip boasts more cores than a rival processor called the “Threadripper,” which packs 16 cores and is made by AMD. The comparison gets pretty nebulous, however, unless you consider what a core actually does. Envision a supermarket checkout line, says Lucia. Let’s say there’s just one open register, and the cashier is checking out one customer at a time; that’s like a single-core chip. (And if you’re standing in that line with your bananas and ramen, you’re likely feeling frustrated.) Now imagine that 18 checkout lines are open, all of them staffed with cashiers who are checking customers through in parallel with each other. In this utopian scenario, everything moves much, much faster. That represents an 18-core processor. This new chip does even more than that, because it uses an Intel technology called hyper-threading, which means that each core can actually do two things at once. In our supermarket analogy, that’d be as if the store hired robots that could check out two people simultaneously in each of the 18 lines—now they’d be able to help 36 people a time. Similarly, this new Intel chip can actually do 36 tasks at once. So why would we want a chip like this? And all that matters because something like an interactive virtual-reality landscape places a huge demand on the processor. Sure, computers and processors already on the market can power, say, an Oculus Rift headset, but the idea behind a powerful chip like this is that it could do several intense things at once; it could also make for smoother interactions between people and computationally-demanding software. “We want to run these [intense programs] efficiently so that we can do things that are responsive and appear to react in realtime to our interactions with them,” Lucia says. “This is the direction that a lot of computing is going.” All of which means that not only can a chip like this power a virtual reality experience, it could also power other complex endeavors that require tons of computing heft—like simulating how a protein (a large molecule made up of amino acids) interacts with another protein. Intel hasn’t said when this chip will be available, but a company representative said that other chips in the same family (called the X-series) with fewer cores will be available in the next few weeks.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    FACT CHECK: Did 17 Intel Agencies ‘All Agree’ Russia Influenced The Presidential Election? David Sivak 1:35 PM 06/01/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP During an interview Wednesday with the tech news outlet Recode, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton discussed at length her belief that Russian interference in the 2016 election harmed her chances of winning. “Read the declassified report by the intelligence community that came out in early January,” said Clinton. “Seventeen agencies, all in agreement – which I know from my experience as a senator and secretary of state is hard to get – they concluded with ‘high confidence’ that the Russians ran an extensive information war against my campaign to influence voters in the election.” Verdict: False While the intelligence report she mentions does express ‘high confidence’ that Russia sought to undermine her campaign, it only represents the views of three agencies – the FBI, CIA and NSA. Clinton incorrectly claims this report shows consensus among 17 intelligence agencies. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper himself appeared in front of Congress and explicitly pushed back on the idea that “17 intelligence agencies agreed,” stating flatly that it was just three. Fact Check: The intelligence community is comprised of 17 civilian and military agencies including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Another of these agencies – the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) – speaks on behalf of the intelligence community and orchestrated the January report. “The [intelligence community assessment] was a coordinated product from three agencies: CIA, NSA and the FBI, not all 17 components of the intelligence community,” said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a congressional hearing in May. “Those three under the aegis of my former office.” A handful of experienced analysts were chosen from the three agencies to investigate and draw independent conclusions. Each agency reached the same verdict about Russian interference. So while the DNI published the report as an intelligence community assessment, Clapper clarified at the hearing that the report reflects the views of those three agencies alone. In fact, when questioned by Democratic Senator Al Franken, Clapper resisted the notion that all 17 agencies had reached a consensus. Franken: The intelligence communities have concluded, all 17 of them, that Russia interfered with this election. And we all know how that’s right. Clapper: Senator, as I pointed out in my statement, Senator Franken, it was- there were only three agencies that directly involved in this assessment plus my office. Franken: But all 17 signed on to that? Clapper: Well, we didn’t go through that process. This was a special situation because of the time limits and […] the sensitivity of the information, we decided – it was a conscious judgment – to restrict it to those three. I’m not aware of anyone who dissented, or disagreed when it came out. DHS published a joint statement with the DNI back in October expressing the same verdict about Russian interference, so it’s fair to say a handful of agencies have publicly drawn conclusions. But simply because the DNI speaks for the intelligence community as a whole doesn’t mean all 17 agencies reached independent conclusions, let alone conducted independent investigations.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion SANTA CLARA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

If Trump bails out of the agreement, which has been signed by 200 countries, he will do so even over the objections of hundreds of major U.S. businesses. In recent months, big business has lobbied fiercely in favor of the deal, which aims to end the fossil fuel era. Among those many who are in support we see Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Levi Strauss, Morgan Stanley, Mars, Tiffany e Intel. Large companies in other parts of the world are also warning President Trump against leaving the Paris climate pact. Business leaders say the Paris deal, also called COP21, will help generate new jobs, limit damage from climate change and help assert North American leadership on the global stage. Trump has called climate change a 'hoax' and blasted the Paris agreement as a 'bad deal.' At this weekend's G7 Summit in Sicily, European Union officials and the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris agreement. The group said the U.S. was 'reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus.' Trump issued a tweet on the topic: 'I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord soon this Thursday!' The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, estimates that unchecked climate change could cost the U.S. economy almost $2 trillion per year in current dollars by 2100. This deal that was signed by 200 countries in Paris in 2015, has as main objective to reduce global warming and carbone dioxide and other gases that are a result of the use fossile fuels. sgl/oda/dsa/mem/lla Temas Relacionados: Big Business Wants Trump to Stick With Paris Climate Accord Washington, Jan 1 (Prensa Latina) The heat is on: President Donald Trump says he will decide soon whether to stick with the landmark Paris climate accord.

Get Flash to see this player. Zenith Extreme and Rampage VI Extreme lead the way for AMD and Intel chipsets. Asus has gone to town on high-end consumer motherboards. We say this because the company has loaded the proverbial kitchen sink on its premier AMD and Intel offerings. Starting off with AMD, Asus is one of the few guys to produce the X399 chipset reserved for the upcoming 'Threadripper' CPU. The Zenith Extreme features premium components all round - integrated OLED screen, Aura Sync lighting, 802.11ad WiFi, RGB strips, and 10Gbe Ethernet - and should be available as soon as Threadripper launches in the summer. Arguably, the X299 Rampage VI Extreme is even more out there, but we won't spoil the surprises until you watch Jonathan from Asus give you the rundown in the video above.

The PCIe V3.0 lane count is the killer feature and it is going to be NVMe that chews it up. Fair enough the gaming and graphics enthusiasts will be lapping up the dual and perhaps triple x16 V3.0 potential but the slowest part of any PC / Workstation will always be the storage and with ThreadRipper we can potentially start thinking about hitting 10Gb/s in the very near future without the need for a crazily expensive HBA or RAID cards. 2 x Samsung 960 Pros in RAID 0 will be hitting 5Gbs, what will 4 give us? :) - Throw in quad channel to keep the beast fed from a memory perspective and it is beginning to feel like the late 90's and early 00's when the CPU's and platforms were getting some real design and innovation. AMD has completely caught Intel offside with their pricing / PCIe lane restrictions.

Then take a look at the components system integrators are employing in their latest builds. With the goal of selling as many PCs as possible, the best boutique builders keep their finger on the pulse and utilise hardware that is favoured by many and easy to work with. Cyberpower has been around long enough to identify current trends. Originally founded in the US and now serving UK customers from a Gateshead HQ, Cyberpower promises "the most up to date hardware for your needs" and has sent in the £1,999 Infinity X77 Titanium for evaluation. Designed with gaming in mind, this enthusiast base unit immediately catches the eye courtesy of a Cooler Master MasterCase Pro 5 Nvidia Edition chassis. We're quite fond of the MasterCase aesthetic, and the GeForce makeover works surprisingly well as the green-and-grey accents add extra interest without overstepping the mark. Build quality is good throughout, with Cyberpower doing a decent job of cable management and overall tidiness, but what's telling is that Intel and Nvidia's stranglehold on high-end PCs appears unbreakable. AMD ought to be back in the race with its competitive Ryzen CPUs, yet Core i7 and GeForce GTX continue to rule the roost - we've yet to hear from a single vendor who is eager to send in a Ryzen PC for review. Multi-threaded goodness obviously isn't a high priority for gaming machines, and Intel's lead in IPC keeps the latest-generation Core i7 'Kaby Lake' at the top of most users' wish list. Sticking with the tried-and-trusted, Cyberpower straps a Core i7-7700K to a Cooler Master MasterLiquid 120 cooler and overclocks the chip to 4.7GHz across all cores. Accompanying the CPU is 16GB (2x8GB) of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3000 memory on an MSI Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon motherboard outfitted with a liquid-cooled MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Sea Hawk graphics card. No major surprises thus far, though Cyberpower does try something different with regards to storage. Rather than adopt the usual SSD primary, HDD secondary configuration, the Infinity X77 Titanium comes equipped with a 3TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk and a speed injection courtesy of a 16GB Intel Optane M.2 accelerator. A 600W Cooler Master MasterWatt Lite PSU is par for the course at this price point, as is a DVD writer and a clean 64-bit install of Windows 10, though it's nice to see Cyberpower employ a sleeved set of green Phanteks extension cables to maintain the overall theme. The default component selection makes sense, and though there's plenty of choice for customisation using the online configurator, we don't see any obvious reason to make changes at first glance. The question for enthusiasts is why buy a pre-built machine when you can buy all of the aforementioned components for roughly £1,850? Well, for an additional £150 premium, Cyberpower takes away the guesswork, guarantees a 4.7GHz overclock and backs the machine with a three-year warranty that includes two years of parts cover as standard. Tempted? Then let's see what the benchmarks have to say.

Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion Study Estimates the Value of Goods and Services in the Early Years of the ‘Passenger Economy’ Will Be More Than Twice the Size of the ‘Sharing Economy’ NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel predicts a new “Passenger Economy” will emerge to support the idle time when drivers become riders The economic opportunity will grow from US$800 billion to US$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream Mobility-as-a-Service will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations and usage A new study by Intel Corporation and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy," the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. (Graphic: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 01, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Andrew Grove served as chairman and CEO of Intel at different points during his career, and he had a famous philosophy about why the two jobs were separate. “Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an employee? If he’s an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the board,” Grove, who died in 2010, once said. “The chairman runs the board. How can the CEO be his own boss?” Facebook’s stockholders will have to answer those questions about chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg at today’s annual meeting. Four Facebook investors, joined by the consumer watchdog group SumOfUs, have put forth a proposal which would “require the Chair of the Board to be an independent member of the Board.” The measure is included as part of Facebook’s proxy statement. “We believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporation’s governance,” the shareholder statement reads. The group’s main problem with Zuckerberg’s monopoly involves an independent committee’s decision last year to alter Facebook’s stock structure.  Every stockholder in Facebook — including Zuckerberg — received two new shares of so-called “Class C” stock for every existing share. The new stock had no value—its sole purpose was to create new shares that Zuckerberg can sell off in order to fulfill his promise of giving away 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity. What’s more, Zuckerberg’s ownership stake in Facebook is not affected, no matter how much Class C stock is sold off—he still has voting control over the company’s board. As The New York Times reported, “(The deal) ensures that Mr. Zuckerberg will have lifetime control over Facebook.” Marc Andreessen. Kimberly White/Getty Images What makes the deal even more ethically dubious is that one member of the “independent” committee which approved the stock split, entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, texted Zuckerberg with updates during deliberations. These actions have affected the company’s stock market standing—the advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has given Facebook a corporate governance score of 10 (the highest level of risk). SumOfUs is using all of this as ammunition—last week the group sent a letter to all Facebook shareholders urging them to vote for an independent chair. “We believe that independent oversight of management would improve the ability of the Facebook board to support Facebook executives as they formulate appropriate responses to these challenges,” the letter reads. For its part, Facebook’s board of directors is lobbying members to vote against the SumOfUs proposal. “Forcing a division between our Chairman and our CEO could harm our performance and be detrimental to interests of our stockholders,” their response reads. “Mr. Zuckerberg, as our founder, has guided us from inception and is invested in our success. We do not believe that requiring the Chairman to be independent will provide appreciably better direction and performance, and instead could cause uncertainty, confusion and inefficiency in board and management function and relations.” This is not the first time SumOfUs has fought Facebook—last year, it was among 80 organizations which accused the social media giant of “racially biased” post moderation. Among the other proposals which will be voted on at the annual meeting is a request for Facebook to compile a report assessing its role in spreading fake news. The board is also opposing this measure, calling it “unnecessary.” SEE ALSO: Facebook Spaces Changes Reality for VR Entrepreneurs Business & Technology Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

News & Analysis Nvidia CEO Says Moores Law Is Dead Alan Patterson 6/1/2017 12:01 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has become the first head of a major semiconductor company to say what academics have been suggesting for some time: Moore’s Law is dead. Moore’s Law, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, reflects his observation in 1965 that transistors were shrinking so fast that every year twice as many could fit onto the same surface of a semiconductor. In 1975, the pace shifted to a doubling every two years. The enablers of an architectural advance every generation — increasing the size of pipelines, using superscalar tweaks and speculative execution — are among the techniques that are now lagging in the effort to keep pace with the expected 50 percent increase in transistor density each year, Huang told a gathering of reporters and analysts at the Computex show in Taipei. “Microprocessors no longer scale at the level of performance they used to — the end of what you would call Moore’s Law,” Huang said. “Semiconductor physics prevents us from taking Dennard scaling any further.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang notes the divergence between semiconductor technology and microprocessor performance at Taipeis Computex show. Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling, is based on a 1974 paper co-authored by Robert H. Dennard, after whom it is named. Originally formulated for MOSFETs, it states, roughly, that as transistors get smaller their power density stays constant, so that power use stays in proportion with area. The diminishing returns from Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling have seen the semiconductor industry enter a mature stage in which just a handful of chipmakers can afford the multibillion dollar investments required to push the process technology forward. By now, only a few chip designers have the deep pockets to double down on fabricating silicon at the 16nm and 14nm nodes, design rules where the distinction has become increasingly blurred. That stagnation in the progress of technology has also led to rapid industry consolidation in recent years that’s resulted in a flurry of multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions. Nvidia’s Huang predicts further advances to come from GPU computing. Even so, Huang suggested a modus vivendi for the semiconductor industry that plays into graphics processors, the products that Nvidia expects will enable continuing advances for years to come. Deep learning will use the processing power of GPUs that Nvidia makes as part of a new architecture that will take the company into artificial intelligence, outside the computer gaming business Nvidia has dominated, according to Huang. The semiconductor industry is exploring a number of pathways beyond Moore’s Law. Some upstart Chinese chipmakers are taking a stake in Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator FD-SOI.  Others see a future in going beyond planar design to three-dimensional chips. Nvidia’s bet on artificial intelligence to take the silicon industry forward is bullish, according to Randy Abrams, an analyst with Credit Suisse in Taipei. Nvidia has highlighted its Volta GPU on 12nm at an 815mm die size, taking up the same surface area as 7 iPhone processors, and connected to 16GB of high bandwidth memory using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSMC) silicon interposer technology. A configuration of eight of these chips in Nvidia’s DGX-1 deep learning / high performance computing machine sells for $149,000. NVIDIA’s data center business has grown 186 percent annually to a $1.7 billion run-rate in the recent quarter, Abrams said. That chunk of business is worth $500 million to TSMC, or about 1.5 percent of its total revenue. AI will need more time to offset mobile as a major driver, Abrams said. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times. He is based in Taiwan.

Here's what you can expect when the first Alloy-based headsets go on sale later this year. In one corner of a guest room at the Hyatt Regency in Santa Clara, Calif., there's a spinning tower of molten metal that will spew across the bed if you put your finger in it. But you won't be able to see it unless you're wearing a "mixed reality" headset like Intel's Project Alloy. First announced last August, Project Alloy is a reference design for an untethered headset that can display a virtual world with elements from your physical environment mixed in. At the Santa Clara Hyatt this week, Intel showed off Alloy's latest iteration, a headset that looks vaguely like the Sony PlayStation VR but is completely wireless, so you can roam around the physical world with nothing to trip over. When you first put the headset on, you're immediately transported into an intriguing hybrid of the physical and virtual worlds. While Microsoft's HoloLens or Qualcomm's augmented reality glasses superimpose computer-rendered objects on your normal field of view, with Alloy you initially feel as if you're wearing a traditional VR headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. You're completely immersed in the virtual world, until you step close enough to a physical object—a hotel bed, for example—which will materialize in the virtual world as if it was magic. It isn't magic, of course. You can see the bed thanks to Alloy's RealSense camera, which is capable of depth perception, 3D imaging, interior mapping, and object tracking. The data is fed back not to a high-powered gaming PC or PlayStation, as is the case with Oculus or Sony, but instead to a CPU and graphics card contained within the headset. Intel designed the hotel room demo with fairly high filtering of the physical world so you didn't see real objects unless they were about 2 feet in front of you. That distance perfectly demonstrated what is perhaps Alloy's most ground-breaking feature: you can see your hands and the rest of your body in the virtual world, and software developers can design interactive elements that respond not to electronic inputs from controllers like the Oculus Touch, but from your actual hands. The end result was that you could touch the spinning tower of metal with a pointer finger and it would immediately deform, with molten droplets flying everywhere. (If you're less adventurous, you also could have also held a pen or other physical object and used it to interact with the spinning tower). In theory, this opens up augmented reality to a host of non-video game applications that would be awkward or impossible with glasses like the HoloLens or regular VR headsets like the HTC Vive. For instance, surgeons could fire up an immersive simulation of a patient in an operating theater, using their hands to interact with virtual scalpels and other tools. There are a few downsides, however. Perhaps the most obvious is the development time required to devise realistic-looking virtual worlds that respond to motion-tracking inputs. Creating virtual objects for a HoloLens app is remarkably simple using the Unity game engine, and you're not necessarily worried about their realism because users will expect them to look rudimentary compared to objects from the physical world that they can see through the lens. But with Alloy, hands, feet, and other physical objects are intruders in an otherwise virtual world, and the less realistic that world looks, the less time viewers will want to spend in it. Unfortunately, the Alloy demo in the hotel room definitely looked cheap. Everything virtual, from the spinning metal tower to a deformable blob on the other side of the room, was pixelated. There was a static snow effect that covered the display, likely a result of the RealSense cameras picking up light disturbances. And the borders of everything physical—like hands, shoes, or the bed—were jagged, as if they had been badly Photoshopped. Intel can't be faulted for all of this mediocrity, since Project Alloy is simply a reference design for other companies to emulate. The content for Alloy-based headsets, which could go on sale by the end of the year, will almost certainly get better over time. And Intel has rapidly improved the hardware since Alloy was announced—there's now an Intel Core i7 inside instead of an M-series processor, and the number of RealSense cameras has been shaved from three to two in order to improve efficiency and battery life. The fact remains, however, that the industry is a long way off from realizing the full potential of something like Project Alloy. Even Intel, which has pivoted away from desktop and server chips to become one of the VR industry's biggest cheerleaders, readily admits that there is a long road ahead. "I think that we are on this verge of something exciting about to happen, and yet virtual reality has been there before, where it didn't live up to its promises," Achin Bhowmik, Intel's general manager of perceptive computing, said at the Augmented World Expo here in Santa Clara on Wednesday. "There's a lot of work for us to do."

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun JERUSALEM Mobileye (MBLY.N), a maker of driverless vehicle technologies, reported a jump in quarterly profit that topped estimates, boosted by higher sales of its advanced driver assisted systems. The Israeli-based company, which is in the process of being acquired by Intel Corp (INTC.O), said on Thursday it earned 25 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the first quarter, up from 15 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 66 percent to $124.7 million. Mobileye was forecast to have earned 24 cents on revenue of $118.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it posted new advanced driver system wins, forged alliances with new partners and moved forward with its proprietary high-definition mapping project by signing definitive collaboration deals with several major automakers. In March, Intel agreed to buy Mobileye, which develops camera-based systems to help drivers avoid collisions, for $15.3 billion in a deal that promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. In light of the pending transaction, Mobileye said it would not hold an earnings conference call and will not provide and outlook for its financial results for future period. Nissan (7201.T), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) have already signed up to share data from Mobileye's camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems to generate HD maps for self-driving cars, and Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua has said four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program.

Intel fought back with its new Core X-Series announcement and the new $1999 flagship CPU with Core i9-7980XE.     AMD might not have a consumer CPU with 18C/36T, but it will be offering 16C/32T with their flagship ThreadRipper 1998X processor. Interestingly, AMD has nailed the TDP on ThreadRipper where they're offering far superior TDP numbers on their processors. For example, Intel's new 6C/12T right up to the 10C/20T have 140W TDPs, while AMD sips 125W. It's only 15W, but traditionally it has been Intel that has superior TDP numbers.     There will be 9 different Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs in total, with the 'X' models featuring XFR (Extended Frequency Range), which allows the ThreadRipper CPUs to scale their clock speeds past the traditional boost clocks, and it scales the CPU clocks with cooling. So if you have air cooling, you'll hit a certain frequency, but AIO water cooling and LN2 setups will benefit more with XFR.     AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs   16C/32T   ThreadRipper 1998X: 3.5/3.9GHz, XFR, 155W ThreadRipper 1998: 3.2/3.6GHz, 155W   14C/28T   ThreadRipper 1977X: 3.5/4.0GHz, XFR, 155W ThreadRipper 1977: 3.2/3.7GHz, 155W   12C/24T   ThreadRipper 1976X: 3.6/4.0GHz, XFR, 125W ThreadRipper 1956X: 3.2/3.8GHz, XFR, 125W ThreadRipper 1956: 3.0/3.7GHz 125W   10C/20T   ThreadRipper 1955: 3.1/3.7GHz, 125W ThreadRipper 1995X: 3.6/4.0GHz, 125W NEWS SOURCES:Zdnet4.cbsistatic.com >> NEXT STORY: Pokemon Company profits soar by 2400% << PREVIOUS STORY: Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records Related Tags AMD Computex 2017 ThreadRipper AMD ThreadRipper 16C/32T Intel Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD drops Ryzen 7 pricing by up to 23% GTA publisher on Switch: we're there front and center Pokemon Company profits soar by 2400% GTA parent buys Kerbal Space Program IP and devs iPhone 8 rumored size vs other phonesView More News Posts Forum Activity Raidmax Alpha Mid-Tower Chassis Review Amped Wireless Artemis-EX AC1300 Range Extender Review asrock fatal1ty x370 K4 GAMING - Cannot create RAID GA-Z87x-UD5H Only PS/2 Keyboard can be used with SETUP Plugable USBC-SATA-V USB 3.1 Gen 2 HDD Dock ReviewView More Forum Posts Press Releases Next generation 3D NAND propels PCIe SSD adoption Tegila expands lifetime storage program, unveils controller-only refresh option ASUS Republic of Gamers showcases brand new gaming innovations at Computex 2017 AMD exhibits PC innovation leadership at Computex 2017 Thermaltake unveils the new 4 tempered glass View 71 TG Edition full-tower chassis with Tt LCS CertifiedView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

MSI X299 SLI Plus is ready for heavy lifting by Eric Born  9:30 AM on May 31, 2017 Nothing shakes up the hardware market quite like a processor launch. In advance of Intel's Core X-series processors, manufacturers have been keeping us busy with a rapid-fire succession of new X299 motherboards. In addition to the slate of boards announced yesterday, MSI has another variant to add to the mix: the X299 SLI Plus. The X299 SLI Plus is a spacious ATX motherboard designed for systems that need a lot of memory and even more GPU horsepower. Builders can populate the board's eight memory slots with up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 RAM. MSI claims that the motherboard's optimized traces and isolated memory circuits help ensure stable memory performance even at high frequencies.  As users may well be loading up the board with heavy graphics cards, MSI used steel to reinforce the PCI-e slots. Other niceties include titanium chokes and ESD protection around the mounting holes. In the storage department, there are dual M.2 slots with support for Intel's Optane memory, along with a U.2 connector and eight SATA ports. The board also ships with a cooling solution for one of the M.2 slots. The rear I/O panel provides further connectivity with a USB 3.1 Type-C port and nine previous-generation USB connectors. Ethernet connections come courtesy of dual Intel Ethernet adapters, while audio services are provided by a Realtek ALC12220 codec. As with many of our other motherboard announcements this week, we don't have information on pricing and availability. Do expect manufacturers to get these products onto shelves in time to be purchased alongside Intel's Core X processors, though.

EK Fluid Gaming kits make custom loops easier and cheaper by Wayne Manion  4:00 PM on May 31, 2017 Liquid-cooled PC components are all the rage these days, and custom open-loop setups have the highest cool factor in both senses of the word. Those full-bore systems with their discrete pumps, reservoirs, and CNC-machined copper waterblocks tend to be much pricier than their all-in-one siblings, though. EK Waterblocks' Fluid Gaming line of open-loop kits wants to put custom liquid-cooling gear within the fiduciary capabilities of more gamers. There are three different kits: one with a universal CPU waterblock and a 120-mm radiator, a set with a CPU block and a 240-mm radiator, and finally one with both CPU and GPU waterblocks and a 240-mm radiator. Aluminum parts are generally frowned upon in open-loop liquid-cooling setups owing to their position close to the top of the metal reactivity series. Mixing parts made of aluminum and less-reactive metals in the same loop is usually a bad idea since it makes the aluminum vulnerable to corrosion. EK's solution is to offer complete kits with aluminum radiators, waterblocks, and fittings, along with an aluminum-compatible reservoir-and-pump unit. It's worth noting that AIO makers are free to use aluminum because they have complete control over the composition of the metals and the liquid. EK says the radiators have dense fin arrays and a profile less than 1.1" (28 mm) thick, and has branded them with an EK-Alustream label. The EK-Supremacy AX CPU block is made from CNC-machined aluminum and fits Intel sockets with 1150 to 2011 pins, as well as AMD's AM4 socket. The company didn't mention Intel's shiny new LGA 2066 socket, though LGA 2011 coolers should be compatible. Support for AMD's upcoming Threadripper TR4 socket seems unlikely without some kind of upgrade kit. Gerbils clinging to Core 2 Quad and AMD FX CPUs need to look elsewhere. The top-of-the-line kit includes an EK-AC GeForce GTX Pascal aluminum water block designed for use with GeForce GTX 1060, 1070, 1080, and 1080 Ti cards, as well as the Titan X Pascal and the Titan Xp. EK said that a Vega-compatible kit will be offered in the future, though it made no mention of other Radeons. Owners of cards based on non-reference PCBs might want to do a little investigation before clicking any "buy" buttons. All the fans in the kits are EK Vardar models, and the included pump-and-reservoir is an SPC-series unit. Standard gear for all the kits includes transparent flexible tubing EK-ACF aluminum fittings, EK-CryoFuel coolant, and the required cabling. The company says that all the kits come with detailed instruction books, though its promised installation tutorials on YouTube sounds like they'll be more helpful. The Fluid Gaming A120 kit with a CPU block and a 120-mm radiator costs $150, the A240 set with a CPU block and 240-mm radiator costs $160, and the A240G kit with both CPU and graphics card blocks plus a 240-mm radiator will run you up $240. The kits are available through EK's web store immediately and will be offered at TR-favorite Newegg soon. Guru3D has already gotten its hands on the Fluid Gaming A240G kit.

Is this the future of travel? The Pal-V flying car; available from next year Credit: Pal-V Jonny Cooper 2 June 2017 • 6:00am Driverless cars, hypersonic underground tunnels, no more traffic lights… The Future Lab at the Goodwood Festival of Speed offers a glimpse of the shape of travel to come Regular visitors to the Goodwood Festival of Speed speak of a certain tang in the air. The annual four-day event sees a fleet of classic race cars and modern supermachines take it in turns to compete up the festival’s ‘Hillclimb’, a 1.16- mile track that winds its way through Lord March’s 11,500-acre estate. Intoxicating whiffs of throaty exhaust mingle with fresh, South Downs oxygen, creating a potion that’s joyfully inhaled by hundreds of thousands of spectators, who watch while soaking up the early summer sun. However, go down to Goodwood this year and you might be in for a surprise. In among all the combustion engines, there will be a collection of vehicles that call into question the future of mobility as we know it. Future Lab, an exhibition instigated by Lord March himself, promises to collate the big ideas that are jostling to shape the next generation of human travel, from driverless cars to hypersonic underground travel. The big players | Driverless cars It’s as though the ghosts of automobiles past and present are about to meet the spectre of what’s to come. What will the Goodwood air smell of in the future? ‘Driverless cars alone have the potential to completely change the way we travel,’ says Future Lab’s curator, Lucy Johnston. ‘And they’re closer than we think. In his most recent TED talk, Elon Musk (the entrepreneur who co-founded US carmaker Tesla) said that by the end of this year, an autonomous car will be able to leave a parking space in Los Angeles, navigate all the way across America, and park in a space in New York. If you promise that on the TED stage, you have to be pretty sure it’s going to happen.’ Indeed, driverless technology is a battleground for the world’s wealthiest companies, attracting eye-boggling investment from Silicon Valley and beyond. Name a big company and they’ve probably got a foot on the pedal: Uber and Volvo arguably lead the field, with a pilot scheme already running in Pittsburgh; Google has completed over two million miles of testing on public roads; Intel just sunk £12.5 billion into an autonomous-car tech company; Amazon is said to be looking at harnessing the cars for deliveries; and that’s before we’ve even mentioned the traditional car manufacturers – the BMWs and Audis, who all want a slice of the pie. Everyone went crazy when the Google car crashed into the bus, but if any human had driven that many miles, there would have been more accidentsJustin Cooke So it’s interesting that rather than use one of these big names to represent the future of driverless cars in her exhibition, Johnston has chosen the Robocar –  a madly futuristic, autonomous, electric car that was unveiled earlier this year by a British company of just 50 people. Robocar looks like a remote-controlled supercar that’s lost its top half: there’s no windscreen, no steering wheel, and nowhere for a human to sit. It can reach speeds of 200mph and is being tested on racetracks around the world – but spectators would be forgiven for struggling to identify Robocar as a car at all. And that, says Johnston, is part of the point. It forces spectators to appreciate the sheer capability of the technology. ‘When you first see Robocar, it spins you out  a bit. You realise the future is now real. We read a lot about driverless cars by companies such as Google, but they still look like cars. There’s a seat for a driver to take control, so your brain doesn’t have trouble joining the dots. With Robocar, your brain really does freak out – in a good way!’ The Robocar is seatless, driverless and can reach speeds of up to 200mph Credit: Benedict Redgrove    Johnston is confronting a problem that the driverless car industry knows only too well: that the computer technology for these vehicles is far ahead of our readiness to accept them into our lives. Elon Musk may be ready to send a car across America with no driver, but that doesn’t stop the idea sending a shiver down our collective spine. Which is why stories about driverless crashes, like the one between a Google car and a human-driven bus last year, travel so fast around the internet. We want to see the devil in computer-controlled cars, rather than the detail. ‘Everyone went crazy when the Google car crashed into the bus, but the reality is that it was the first crash after millions of miles of testing,’ says Justin Cooke, chief marketing officer of Kinetik, the company behind Robocar. ‘If any human had driven that many miles, there would have been more accidents.’ Other challenges include a game of chicken, where two Robocars speed towards a central line and have to stop as close to it as possible without hitting one another To help bridge this trust gap, Kinetik will next year launch Roborace, a competition designed to showcase its car’s capabilities, with teams of programmers striving to devise the most effective software and then running Robocar in front of spectators. In theory, Roborace will be to the driverless car what F1 is to the manual car: the supreme testing ground for technology that will ultimately trickle down to the consumer. Only in this instance, speed isn’t necessarily of the essence. ‘Roborace isn’t going to be your traditional race,’ explains Cooke. ‘Safety is top of the agenda for this technology, so we’re looking at setting tasks. Maybe the car has to reach 200kmh [125mph], then stop perfectly in a box.’ cars Goodwood 75MM gallery puff Other challenges being discussed include a game of chicken, where two Robocars speed towards a central line and have to stop as close to it as possible without hitting one another, and the introduction of robotic dogs on the racetrack – an idea borne from a testing session in February, when a real-life dog ran out on to the track and the Robocar swerved to avoid it. Roborace promises entertainment, but that’s not to say its real-world application is anything less than extraordinarily serious. With the hardware (the driverless cars themselves) already able to navigate city spaces and improving daily, an algorithm that can safely and efficiently control an entire car network has become the holy grail of autonomous transport. Find it, and the 97 per cent of accidents on our roads that are caused by human error disappear (Cooke says that, by comparison, a computer’s margin for error is ‘0.000something’). The HyperLoop ‘train’, funded by Tesla’s Elon Musk, proposes near-supersonic ‘tube’ travel  Credit: Hyperloop So too do traffic lights – instead, the computer can sort the most efficient flow of cars at any junction. No more sitting at red lights; no more slowing down as other drivers rubberneck a crash. The social implications are as startling. While some of us would regain the time we currently spend behind the wheel, others would lose their jobs. Estimates suggest there are around 400,000 HGV drivers in the UK alone; in the US, driving a vehicle is the most common job in 29 of the 50 states. All would face redundancy in the driverless epoch. We can also expect the face of our towns and cities to change significantly. The average car currently spends 95 per cent of its time parked in a drive or by the side of the road; that gets flipped on its head in a connected, autonomous system, where your next ride can be summoned at the touch of a button (much like Uber now, so you can see why it is keen to invest). How do Uber self driving / driverless cars work? ‘You’d only need main roads,’ says Cooke. ‘All those side streets running off B roads, where we currently park our cars, could be gardens for families. Kids could grow up in air that has more oxygen.’ Combine all this with advances in manufacturing techniques – 3D printing offers an alternative to the traditional production line – and Johnston thinks it’s no exaggeration to say that we could be looking at the next industrial revolution. However, she’s adamant that we shouldn’t be scared by the speed at which tech develops. ‘When people spell out the doom and gloom, that robots and AI are going to replace humans, I always say: “Yes, but it will also produce more roles in other places that don’t yet exist.” When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, we didn’t know that 20 years later one of the biggest industries in Britain would be digital design. We’re humans. We think creatively and we’re good at adapting.’ Italdesign and Airbus unveil Pop.Up  Credit: Airbus The obvious question that hangs over all this is: when? When will our trust of driverless cars catch up with their potential? Cooke suggests we could see an autonomous network within the next five years. Design company Italdesign, at Goodwood to show off its concept of detachable travel pods that use engines on the ground and propellers to fly through the air, says the radical vision could become reality within 10 years. Embrace the technology and it seems the possibilities become endless. But are we really so close to taking the handbrake off the future of travel? Transport entrepreneur Robert Dingemanse is sceptical. ‘Some of the concepts we see in transport were there in the 1930s. Of course, we’ve improved the concept since then, but making something safe and accepted by regulators is another thing.’ He cites the example of two relatively minor regulation changes for three-wheeled vehicles in Europe, which were first discussed in 2002, agreed in 2011, and are yet to be fully implemented. ‘These things move in decades, not years.’ Tech trends | An acceleration in driverless cars Dingemanse’s own project is Pal-V, a flying car that can reach 112mph on the ground and in the air, and will be commercially available next year (pre-orders start around £260,000, in case you’re wondering). It’s one of a handful of exhibits at Future Lab that look to use the ‘Third Dimension’ of travel – away from flat, congested roads and up into the air or down into the ground, where space isn’t at a premium. Pal-V is perhaps the most easy to understand: a small gyro plane-cum-car that will offer rural communities and the super-wealthy an efficient way to travel from door-to-door. At the loopier end is HyperLoop, a Musk-funded project that’s trying to shoot capsules of people through tunnels at near-supersonic speeds. If that one takes off, we’re looking at London to Manchester in 18 minutes flat. Does all this mean that the humble car as we know it is dead? Is that tang in the air above Goodwood soon to be a thing of the past? ‘Not at all,’ asserts Dingemanse. ‘We’re still driving cars that are 100 years old and it will be the same in 100 years’ time. Autonomous cars and flying cars and tunnels will offer different modalities, but people will still want to drive themselves. Humans like to determine their own destiny. That’s freedom.’  The Goodwood Festival of Speed runs from  29 June-2 July 2017   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Tesla Humans Driverless cars Amazon Flying cars Robotics Artificial Intelligence Luxury motoring BMW Elon Musk 3D Printing Space Goodwood Festival of Speed Volvo Roads Audi Google Race Uber Goodwood Fast cars Internet Motoring Show more Technology latest 02 Jun 2017, 7:01am Google Doodle celebrates ICC Champions Trophy with addictive cricket game - what you need to know about tournament 02 Jun 2017, 7:00am Snapchat Spectacles go on sale in the UK: Where to buy them and how they work 01 Jun 2017, 9:04pm Facebook shareholders reject fake news proposal 01 Jun 2017, 5:31pm BT to show Champions League final clips on Snapchat 01 Jun 2017, 4:46pm Uber 'on path to profitability' as losses fall to $708m 00:41 01 Jun 2017, 4:07pm Japan launches rocket in first phase of new GPS 01 Jun 2017, 3:22pm WWDC 2017: iOS 11 best features and release date, plus everything we know about Apple's new software 01 Jun 2017, 1:31pm Amazon Prime Day 2017: When is it and what are the best deals? 01 Jun 2017, 12:42pm Why does Google Street View’s 'Pegman' have a party hat and balloons? 01 Jun 2017, 12:13pm When is WWDC 2017 and what will Tim Cook and Apple announce? 01 Jun 2017, 11:18am First robotic cop joins Dubai police Gallery 01 Jun 2017, 10:01am Gallery: Stratolaunch: Microsoft founder unveils world's largest plane, in pictures 00:46 01 Jun 2017, 10:00am World’s biggest aeroplane revealed: Immense aircraft boasts six engines and is wider than a football pitch Gallery 01 Jun 2017, 8:30am Gallery: Obsolete technologies that will baffle modern children - in pictures  01 Jun 2017, 8:27am Elon Musk to quit Donald Trump's advisory councils if US leaves Paris agreement 01 Jun 2017, 6:55am Comment: The polls might be unreliable now, but voting will soon be as predictable as your Amazon shopping basket Juliet Samuel Premium 01 Jun 2017, 4:21am Hillary Clinton says Facebook 'must prevent fake news from creating a new reality' 01 Jun 2017, 12:01am Deliveroo offers workers pay per trip in bid to defuse self employment row  01 Jun 2017, 12:01am Data watchdog fines double the number of businesses for breaches in crackdown  31 May 2017, 6:13pm When is the Microsoft E3 2017 Xbox press conference and what can we expect from Project Scorpio? 00:57 31 May 2017, 5:52pm Zaha Hadid: Who was she and what were her most impressive buildings?  Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

The U.S. will join just two other nations—Syria and Nicaragua—left out of the agreement. The President isn’t just denying the scientific consensus on the direct links between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. He is also ignoring calls by big business—including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Unilever, and many others—to remain in the agreement, who argued that participation benefits U.S. companies and the economy. Announcing his decision to pull out, Trump made reference to the voters who supported him in America’s coal country: “I was elected by the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” The move is the latest in a series of decisions made by Trump since taking office that have been met with scathing criticism by the political left, the scientific community, and environmental activists, including his appointment of climate change denier Scott Pruitt to head the US Environmental Protection Agency and his recent budget that proposes deep cuts to numerous research agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While the Paris Agreement focuses on climate, it also notes that “it is important to ensure the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans.” Greenhouse gas emissions and the rise in global temperatures are already having a devastating impact on the oceans and its inhabitants. With the change in seawater chemistry due to the uptake of carbon dioxide, the health of countless calcifying species from plankton to corals is at serious risk, while the increase in seawater temperature is causing catastrophic coral bleaching events which threaten the survival of the planet’s reef systems.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | June 2, 2017 -- 02:16 GMT (19:16 PDT) | Topic: PCs Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop PC gamers should be thrilled about the renewed interest that's being given to performance desktops, as AMD's Ryzen processors have been matched by Intel's new Core i9 and Core-X CPUs. While the high end is always claiming the most attention, most gaming isn't done by those who can afford $3,000 systems. Computex 2017 First 'Always Connected' Windows 10 on ARM PCs are coming from ASUS, HP, Lenovo Always Connected PC sounds great, but we'll have to wait Intel unveils monster 18-core Core i9: 'First teraflop-speed' consumer PC chip Intel i9 vs Ryzen ThreadRipper: Now AMD hits back with more on its 16-core beast AMD stakes its claim to the high ground Dell is hoping to cater to gamers whose wallets contain a more modest pile of cash with its new Inspiron gaming desktop, launched this week at Computex. The computer giant has long had its XPS line of high-performance desktops, and has previously rolled out an Inspiron gaming laptop (not to mention its Alienware lineup of boutique PCs). But this is the first time it's released a gaming-oriented desktop in its mainstream Inspiron family. AMD's new chips are the centerpiece of this Inspiron, but you won't see them in the base $599.99 configuration, according to The Verge. That's because that model will come with an AMD A10 processor, instead, along with 8GB of RAM, a terabyte hard drive, and a budget AMD Radeon RX560 graphics card. There will be plenty of opportunities to upgrade, as the Inspiron can handle up to 32 gigs of RAM, an SSD in additional to a hard drive, and better-performing processors and graphics cards. Those cards include ones that support virtual reality apps, such as the Radeon RX580 or the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, and the chassis can support a second graphic card. Other options include liquid cooling that can be illuminated by the blue LED lighting that's included. One other advantage to choosing a Ryzen processor is that you get a USB Type-C port that an A10 configuration lacks. Dell's website says the Inspiron gaming desktop will be shipping starting on June 13. As with all Dell systems, you'll be able to customize it, so if you want some of the advantages from the new Ryzen chips, you'll have to pony up a bit extra.

The Wall Street Journal first reported this week the documentary, which was shelved in November, was to discredit Fethullah Gulen, the exiled cleric whom Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has accused of masterminding last year's coup attempt. Flynn Intel Group was paid by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin to "polish the country's image after a botched military coup," the Journal reported. Production of the documentary was underway as Flynn campaigned for President Donald Trump throughout the United States. The company's contract with the businessman has placed Flynn in legal jeopardy. The contract is drawing scrutiny by U.S. officials conducting several investigations into Flynn's business activities. Flynn, who resigned under pressure as Trump's national security adviser in February, failed to inform the federal government until March that his firm was paid to represent the Turkish government. Numerous probes into Flynn's activities Flynn is now the subject of criminal, congressional and military probes into allegations of improperly concealing his financial links to Turkey and Russia. Investigators are also trying to determine whether the alleged ties influenced Flynn's decisions as an advisor to Trump. The report said work on the documentary began last summer, shortly after the failed military coup in Turkey. It also said Flynn's company signed a three-month contract with Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin a few weeks later. Flynn Intel Group hired Rudi Bakhtiar, a former CNN anchor, former VICE News correspondent, and also a former correspondent for VOA's Persian Service, to do on-camera work for the documentary. Bakhtiar said she was given the impression the film would be an objective news documentary. David Enders, a former VICE News employee, told the Journal that the head of Flynn's company, Bijan Kian, attempted to conceal the company's role in the documentary's production. The latest disclosures about Flynn's work on behalf of Turkey comes as he is under investigation for any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence last year's U.S. presidential election.

June 02 2017 Fox Sports news.com.au Home 2017 National Elections National News World News Top Stories Sports Latest News Business Drum Editorial Yu Tok Bougainville World News Global diarrhoea deaths down by a third The number of children dying worldwide of diarrhoea fell by a third between 2005 and 2015, researchers have found. June 2, 2017 The number of children dying worldwide of diarrhoea fell by a third between 2005 and 2015, researchers have found. The Lancet study says better access to clean water and sanitation is key, with fewer weak and malnourished children becoming infected. New vaccines have also had a positive impact. However, diarrhoea is still the fourth-biggest killer of children globally, with almost 500,000 a year dying before their fifth birthday. This figure could well be a significant under-estimate because of the lack of data in sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases occur. Preventable and treatable Diarrhoea is also indirectly responsible for large numbers of deaths, through exacerbating the effects of other diseases, such as pneumonia and measles. The US researchers, who analysed data from the new Global Burden of Disease study, found well over a third (42%) of deaths happen in Nigeria and India. Diarrhoeal diseases, such as rotavirus and cholera, are spread by water contaminated with faeces. They are preventable and treatable. “Diarrhoeal diseases disproportionately affect young children,” said lead author Dr Ali Mokdad, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “Despite some promising reductions in mortality, the devastating impact of these diseases cannot be overlooked.” Diarrhoea cases in 2015 2.39 billion episodes of diarrhoea Almost half of those (957.5 million) involved children. 1.3 million deaths Including 499,000 child deaths The highest death rates were in Chad and Niger Source: Lancet World Health Organization: Diarrhoea While deaths from diarrhoea have dropped by just over 20% overall, and 34% in children, the rate of infection has been falling far more slowly. For children it dropped by just over 10% between 2005 and 2015. Of all the diarrhoeal diseases, rotavirus remains the biggest killer of under-fives, according to this study. But death rates for the disease were down by 44% in 2015. The researchers attribute much of this to a relatively new vaccine. ‘Unacceptable’ “We’re encouraged to see fewer children dying of diarrhoea,” said Yael Velleman, senior policy analyst on health and hygiene at WaterAid. “But it is unacceptable that diarrhoea still claims the lives of nearly half a million children under five each year. “Up to 50% of under-nutrition is linked to chronic infection, diarrhoea and worm infestation caused by dirty water and poor hygiene.” She said those children’s life chances were limited by preventable illness – “all for the lack of conditions we have been taking for granted in the UK for over 100 years”. How to prevent diarrhoea Access to safe drinking-water Improved sanitation Hand washing with soap Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life Good personal and food hygiene Education about how infections spread Rotavirus vaccination SOURCE: World Health Organization  -BBC Share this article: World News Kabul bomb: The hell of losing loved ones in Afghanistan Kabul bomb: The hell of losing loved ones in Afghanistan Ariana Grande's Manchester benefit concert: How do they protect it?

By Tiernan Ray June 1, 2017 9:48 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of automotive chip maker Mobileye (MBLY) today closed up 2 cents at $61.92, after the company this morning reported fiscal Q1 revenue and profit that topped analysts’ expectations, ahead of its purchase by Intel (INTC) for $15.3 billion, announced back in March. Revenue of $125 million topped the average $118 million estimate, and the EPS of 25 cents, excluding some costs, was also a penny better than expected. David Kelley with Jefferies & Co. writes that the results show the company making progress with autonomous driving in China: We believe ADAS market adoption is accelerating with noted robust Q1 China regional growth from industry peers. We believe MBLY's early mover advantage and REM positioning favor the leading auto technology supplier as a likely major player in the developing active safety market.  Tavis McCourt with Raymond James takes note of a couple of details in the report: Mobileye "sold just over 2 million EyeQ chips in the quarter, up more than 50%” from the prior-year period, and its "stated ASP [average selling price] per EyeQ chip was $45.10, up ~$0.90." And RBC Capital’s Joseph Spak notes the gross profit margin results, noting that the margin of 75.8% expanded by half a percentage point was 70 basis points better than he’d expected, 40 better than the Street. "Expanding gross margin performance impressive,” he writes, "considering the still robust y/y growth in the lower-margin Aftermarket business." Intel has said it expects the Mobileye deal to close nine months from the announcement, which should make it sometime this December.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Microsoft pushes a mixed reality, connected future at Computex Matt Barlow, corporate vice president, Windows marketing; and Peter Han, vice president, partner devices and solutions show off mixed reality headsets from some of the world's leading PC companies at Computex 2017. — AFP Relaxnews At the annual tech extravaganza in Taipei, Microsoft is talking up headsets and the Internet of Things but, more importantly for consumers, how its close working relationship with most of the world's leading electronics firms is going to make these new technologies and devices an affordable reality for all.  "Our partner model is unique in the industry as we collaborate, end-to-end, from design, through all phases of the product lifecycle and across consumer and device channels," said Nick Parker, corporate vice president, consumer and device sales. "Together, we are building new experiences for customers, generating demand and ultimately, creating growth in existing and new categories including Mixed Reality, Internet of Things, and Always Connected PCs with Intel and Qualcomm." Until Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone, the only time most people encountered the term ‘ecosystem' was when flicking through a copy of National Geographic. However, today we all understand that no matter how good a digital device, unless it has a supporting ecosystem of services and companies, it is destined to become an also-ran. It's why the Windows operating system is the world's most popular but is also why Microsoft's phone business failed to find a wider market – no ecosystem of apps or accessories. So, when Microsoft's mixed reality headset and associated platform go live later this year, consumers will be able to buy in confidence as the likes of Acer, Dell, ASUS, HP and Lenovo are all going to support the technology and will be launching their own headsets before the end of 2017. Likewise, the world's biggest PC makers are committed to Microsoft's new always-connected PC category. These will be mobile computers that are always online via LTE/4G connectivity, that use the cloud for software and applications, and that will use processors developed in partnership with Intel and Qualcomm. They will have what the company describes as "a great battery life" and could for some prove an attractive, productivity-based alternative to a phablet or tablet. ASUS, HP, Lenovo, VAIO and Xiaomi have already confirmed that they'll be launching devices based on the concept. As for the Internet of Things, Microsoft's showcase at Computex was aimed at businesses and highlighting how it is already revolutionising the energy, manufacturing and retail sectors. — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber UK campaigner takes on Facebook ‘dark ads’ during election Apple said to ready Siri speaker in bid to rival Google, Amazon Toyota uses open-source software in new approach to in-car tech How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read No follow-through a cause for concern CEO: Cycling brings people together Top Merkel aide rejects Trump's call to renegotiate global climate deal advertisement Latest News Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Waymo working on self-driving trucks Most Viewed in Tech Chipmakers at Taiwan's biggest tech fair look beyond crowded smartphone market Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision Sophisticated automatic replies are coming to Gmail Ethiopia cuts off Internet after high school exam leaks Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account Waymo working on self-driving trucks Social media firms have increased removals of online hate speech To play Android games on your PC, this is the best emulator Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Deals: Here, Have A VPN For 90% Off Nintendo Switch's Online Service Will Be $US20/Year [UPDATE] AMD's Ryzen CPUs Are A Little Bit Cheaper Now Alex Walker Jun 2, 2017, 9:15am ⋅ Filed to:  1500x 1600x 1700x 1800x amd Australian Stories cpus ryzen 5 ryzen 7 Share Image: Techspot When they launched, AMD's new Ryzen CPUs were supposed to be appealing predominately for their price. And as it turns out, they're now even cheaper. Just to recap, here's what the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 CPUs were priced at when they launched: Ryzen 7 1800X (8c/16t): $699 Ryzen 7 1700X (8c/16t): $569 Ryzen 1700 (8c/16t): $469 Ryzen 5 1600X (6c/12t): $359 Ryzen 5 1500X (4c/8t): $275 We tested some of the Ryzen 7 and 5 CPUs, and you can read about that below. Our take at the time was that the Ryzen CPUs were good value, provided you weren't using them exclusively for gaming, and if you were, then the 1600X was probably the CPU of choice. AMD's Ryzen CPUs: Good For Games, Better For Everything Else It's not often that the CPU market has any degree of disruption. And that was the logic behind the launch of AMD's Ryzen CPUs, with the chip manufacturer aiming to offer more performance by selling CPUs with more cores and threads than their Intel counterparts for less money. Read more But while AMD had a small advantage in price when the Ryzen CPUs first launched, Intel has been able to respond with a price cut of their own. And so, right in the middle of Computex week, it turns out that AMD have cut their prices as well. AMD wasn't able to respond to an inquiry by the time of writing, but a cursory check of Ryzen CPU prices on the excellent StaticICE aggregator has shown that, across the country, Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs are coming down. The Ryzen 7 1800X hasn't really changed: stores are selling it for $679 now, which is more or less what you'd expect retailers to do a few months after something has launched. And the Ryzen 1600X has more or less stayed put, too. Beyond that, the haircut is more intriguing: Ryzen 7 1700X: $519 (down from $569) Ryzen 7 1700: $429-439 (down from $469) Ryzen 5 1600X: $345 (kind of down from $359) Ryzen 5 1500X: $249 (down from $275) Not a bad saving, especially if you're going for a sub-$800 or $1000 gaming PC build. Grab a cheap GTX 1060 or an RX 470 around $250-260, and you've got a decent little gaming rig on the cheap. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments Virus @virus__ Jun 2, 2017, 10:20am Oh wow. That's good news. I was wanting to put together a cheap Ryzen R5 build after I get my tax back. Looks even better now. Reply 1 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

"I have never been to Russia, I’ve had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life," Nigel Farage said.  (Daniel Leal-Olivas / AFP/Getty Images)   By STEVEN ERLANGERThe New York Times Thu., June 1, 2017 LONDON—Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), ridiculed on Thursday a published report that suggests U.S. investigators think he may be able to shed light on any possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Farage was responding to an article in the Guardian newspaper Thursday that said he was a “person of interest” in the FBI’s investigation into Moscow’s contacts with representatives of Trump’s campaign, including Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump’s national security adviser. The Guardian, citing unidentified sources, said Farage was not accused of wrongdoing but had “raised the interest” of the FBI because of his relationships with the Trump campaign and with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks. Read more:A current Trump adviser is a significant person of interest in Russia probe, people familiar with the case say Intel committee issues subpoena for Trump’s personal attorney in ongoing Russia investigation Article Continued Below Ex-Trump adviser Michael Flynn agrees to provide documents in Russia election probe U.S. officials say Russian hackers working for the government obtained documents from the Democratic Party and provided them to WikiLeaks to damage the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Under Farage, the far-right, anti-immigrant UKIP played an influential role in a referendum last year in which British voters supported withdrawing from the European Union, a move commonly known as Brexit. The investigators are examining whether Farage was a link between Assange and Trump advisers including Roger Stone, who has acknowledged being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker who is thought to be an agent of Russian military intelligence. “This hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump,” Farage said in a statement to the New York Times. “For the record, I have never been to Russia, I’ve had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT in the last 18 months,” referring to the Russian television network that has been accused of serving as a propaganda organ for the Kremlin. He added that a March meeting he had with Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where the Australian has received political asylum, “was organized for me by LBC Radio with a view to conducting an interview.” Farage has hosted a show on the independent radio station in London. Farage said that the Guardian article made him laugh. “I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia,” he said.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) House committee subpoenas Flynn, Cohen in Russia probe Thu Jun 1st, 2017 3:03pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Billy House / Bloomberg News WASHINGTON — Fired national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were subpoenaed Wednesday by the House Intelligence Committee. “As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records,” Republican Mike Conaway of Texas, who is leading the probe, and Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House panel, said in a joint statement. “We hope and expect that anyone called to testify or provide documents will comply with that request, so that we may gain all the information within the scope of our investigation.” Subpoenas were also approved by the committee for documents possessed by the Flynn Intel Group LLC and Michael D. Cohen & Associates PC. The panel is investigating Russian efforts to influence the U.S. election, as well as leaks of classified information and reports that identities of Trump associates captured in spy intercepts may have been improperly unmasked. Flynn, who previously asserted a Fifth Amendment right not to turn over documents or testify, is preparing to offer some documents in separate negotiations with the Senate Intelligence Committee, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Cohen has dismissed any talk of collusion with Russia. “To date, there has not been a single witness, document or piece of evidence linking me to this fake Russian conspiracy,” Cohen said in a statement Tuesday. “This is not surprising to me because there is none.” As of Tuesday night, Cohen said he hadn’t yet been subpoenaed, but added, “If I was, I would comply.” The committee’s announcement doesn’t detail whether the subpoenas to Flynn and Cohen contain specific deadlines. Three other subpoenas tied to the Russia investigation were issued by the House panel for information related to so-called “unmasking” of some Trump associates’ names appearing on classified reports during the Obama administration, said an official with knowledge of the subpoenas. Questions have been raised — including by Republicans on the committee — about why those names weren’t redacted and were distributed between intelligence agencies during the transition period between the two presidential administrations. Flynn was fired by Trump in February after revelations that he misled administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. He has become a central figure in congressional investigations, as well an FBI probe that now is being overseen by a special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller. A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn was a top adviser to Trump during his run for president. Cohen previously served as executive vice president of the Trump Organization.   Most Read Marysville pair arrested in stabbing death of Everett woman EVERETT — A woman whose body was discovered in her home south… Jun 1st, 2017 by Eric Stevick and Caitlin Tompkins Vandals break into, damage one of Everett’s oldest churches EVERETT — The act was as malicious as it was heartbreaking.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement UP Core: Quad-core x86 mini PC that’s smaller than a Raspberry Pi (crowdfunding) 06/01/2017 at 11:17 AM by Brad Linder 5 Comments The makers of the UP Board and UP² single-board computers is back, and this time the company is offering a device with all the same functionality as the original UP Board… but in a smaller package and with a new modular feature. The UP Core is a single-board computer with an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 quad-core processor, support for up to 4GB of RAM, up to 64GB of eMMC storage, and Windows 10, Android 6.0, or Linux-based software. It measures just 66mm x 56.5mm (2.6″ x 2.2″), making it smaller than a credit card (or a  Raspberri Pi). The new UP Core is expected to ship in August, with entry-level models going for about $77 through a crowdfunding campaign at Indiegogo. That entry-level version only includes 1GB of RAM and 16GB of eMMC storage. But you can pay more for 2GB/32GB or 4GB/64GB models. Despite its tiny size, the board has a USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, a 5V power jack, and built-in 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 support. There’s are also headers for two more USB 2.0 connectors, cameras, or other accessories. But the coolest thing may be the new 100-pin I/O docking connector which enables support for stackable expansion boards. For example, there’s a board that adds PCIe, Gigabit LAN, and USB 3.0 connectors, and another that adds a serial connector and GPIO, among other things. This lets you configure the board for use in a variety of applications. UP is also encouraging developers to create their own carrier boards by offering to sell popular boards and make royalty payments to the designers. Or you could just buy an UP Core and use it as a standalone system with or without a fanless case. Like a lot of single board computers, the UP Board could be used as a dev board. It could power Internet of Things devices like smart speakers, home hubs, or robotics projects. But it’s also got pretty much everything you would need to make a small, low-power, fanless media streaming box capable of running Windows, Android or Linux-based software such as Kodi, Plex, or MythTV. You could even use it as a desktop computer… although the Atom x5 chip used in the UP Core should be fine for basic web browsing, media playback, and similar activities, but will probably feel pretty sluggish if you’re a heavy multitasker of want to render video, play high-end games, or perform other CPU/GPU-intensive tasks. If you’re looking for something a bit more powerful, the UP² that launched on Kickstarter last year is now shipping to backers, and mass production is expected to begin soon. That model is a bit larger, but it features up to an Intel Pentium N4200 Apollo Lake processor and a wider array of ports.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 5 Comments on "UP Core: Quad-core x86 mini PC that’s smaller than a Raspberry Pi (crowdfunding)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest Richard Ames Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I have had one plugged in running for 2 years straight with just a couple of reboots when a new kernel was released. The fan will kick-on only when the cpus have been maxed-out for more than 10 seconds… which is very rare (it is a point of failure, but the cpu throughput is much higher than an atom).

Trump withdraws US from Paris climate deal World Thursday 1 June 2017 - 10:19pm US President Donald Trump announces his decision on the Paris Climate Accords in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on June 1, 2017. Photo: SAUL LOEB / AFP US President Donald Trump announces his decision on the Paris Climate Accords in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on June 1, 2017. Photo: Brendan Smialowski / AFP WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday announced America's withdrawal from the Paris climate deal, signaling a policy shift with wide-ranging repercussions for the climate and Washington's ties with the world. In a highly anticipated statement from the White House Rose Garden, Trump said the United States would abandon the current deal, but was open to negotiating a new one.   President Donald Trump has announced the United States will withdraw from the #ParisAgreement https://t.co/L1dnjtN6Jc pic.twitter.com/IJnK6nToPq — USA TODAY (@USATODAY) June 1, 2017 "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country," Trump said. "We're getting out but we'll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine." Although details and the timeframe are still unclear, Trump argued that the agreement was a bad deal for Americans and that he was keeping a campaign promise to put American workers first. "I cannot, in good conscience, support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does," Trump said.   JUST IN: Obama tears into Trump for "rejecting the future" with Paris agreement withdrawal https://t.co/GMYrA4Clb6 pic.twitter.com/ppZVXVURg9 — The Hill (@thehill) June 1, 2017 The White House has told allies the 2015 deal was signed by President Barack Obama out of "desperation." Trump faced last-minute pressure from business tycoons, foreign allies and from inside his own White House not to pull out of the 196-party accord. Ever the showman, the 70-year-old gave his decision a reality-TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. His decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. The United States is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China. Opponents of withdrawal -- said to include Trump's own daughter Ivanka -- have warned that America's reputation and its leadership role on the world stage are also at stake, as is the environment. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. Diplomatic pressure Trump's long wind-up prompted fierce lobbying, with his environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave.   There it is, Trump blaming Obama. pic.twitter.com/uucsJJgcw4 — Resistance != Futile (@Xipher_404) June 1, 2017 A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, have also urged Trump to remain part of the deal. Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said he would have "no choice" but to leave White House-backed business councils if Trump pulls out. On the diplomatic front, German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the "remain" camp, publicly describing the deal as "essential," and suggesting other countries would press ahead regardless. Trump raised alarm bells when he refused to sign up to a pledge on the deal at last week's G7 meeting in Italy. Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the "six against one" discussion "very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory."   Trump, per a source, will follow the 4-yr rule to get out of Paris, meaning the US will leave on Nov 4, 2020. Election Day 2020: Nov 3. — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 1, 2017 European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was less diplomatic, all but accusing the US president of being ill-informed. "I am a transatlanticist. But if the US president in the next hours and days says that he will get out of the Paris accord, then it's the responsibility of Europe to say: that's not acceptable." He noted that it would likely take three or four years to exit from the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had sought to explain that to Trump at the G7 summit. "As it appears, that attempt failed," said Juncker. China pledge  Hours ahead of Trump's announcement, China's Premier Li Keqiang also pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord, and urged other countries to do likewise. "China will continue to implement promises made in the Paris Agreement, to move towards the 2030 goal step by step steadfastly," Li said in a Berlin joint press conference with Merkel. "But of course, we also hope to do this in cooperation with others."   By pulling out of #ParisAgreement, Trump is ceding #cleanenergy race to China who expects to create 13 million jobs via @WRIClimate. #solar pic.twitter.com/Er2zylp34S — Mike Hudema (@MikeHudema) June 1, 2017 China has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US are responsible for some 40 percent of the world's emissions and experts warn is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to succeed. The leader of Asia's other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said this week failing to act on climate change would be "morally criminal". Contradictory signals Trump's announcement comes less than 18 months after the historic climate pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama's leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events.   The big story is the "unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama Administration. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2017 They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to "pursue efforts" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since taking office on January 20, Trump, who has called climate change a "hoax", has sent contradictory signals on the Paris deal. When asked on Tuesday whether Trump believes human activity is contributing to climate change, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, "Honestly, I haven't asked him that. I can get back to you." AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Image Credit: Reuters / Kevin Lamarque President Trump announced he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, a move that will weaken efforts to fight climate change and raise tensions in an already uneasy relationship with technology companies that have vocally opposed such a move. In a speech delivered in the White House Rose Garden, Trump said withdrawing from the accord would “protect America and its citizens” and that he would seek new negotiations for terms more favorable to the U.S. “We are getting out,” Trump said. “But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great.” Tech giants including Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have been outspoken about the costs of leaving the Paris Agreement, taking out full-page ads that included a letter signed by 25 companies, which also included Adobe, Intel, and Salesforce. “Continued U.S. participation in the agreement benefits U.S. businesses and the U.S. economy in many ways,” the letter read. “U.S. business is best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft president Brad Smith both tweeted the letter out this morning as Trump prepared his announcement. Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. pic.twitter.com/ztSXyYtRrm — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 Tesla’s Elon Musk and Apple’s Tim Cook reached out to the White House in recent weeks to underscore the reasons for remaining in the accord. This morning, Musk tweeted that he had “done all I can to advise directly” Trump and others in the White House. Musk sent another tweet shortly after Trump ended his lengthy speech, announcing his own departures from Presidential councils. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had previously left Trump’s economic advisory council following Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration and amid a storm of negative press about the company. Musk remained an advisor, arguing he could engage on critical issues, which presumably included climate change. Uber penned a post in response to today’s announcement as well. Following Trump’s announcement, Benioff, Smith, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, GE CEO Jeff Immelt‏, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Disney CEO Robert Iger‏, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also weighed in, expressing disappointment. Deeply disappointed by President's decision to withdraw from ParisAgreement. We will double our efforts to fight climate change. — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals. — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 1, 2017 Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government. — Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) June 1, 2017 As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. — Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017 This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o — jack (@jack) June 1, 2017 Musk, Smith, Benioff, Pichai, and other corporate leaders inside and outside tech may opt to create a corporate commitment to the Paris Agreement goals. But the relationship between Trump and Silicon Valley, which got off to a bizarre start last year with a tech summit in Trump Tower, is as strained as ever, and will likely get even more uncomfortable.

Published: 23:18 June 1, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Washington: President Donald Trump announced America’s shock withdrawal from the Paris climate accord Thursday, prompting a furious global backlash and throwing efforts to slow global warming into serious doubt. In a sharply nationalistic and at times meandering address from the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced the United States would immediately stop implementing the “bad” 195-nation accord. “I cannot, in good conscience, support a deal that punishes the United States,” he said, decrying what he said were the “draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.” Trump repeatedly painted the pact - struck by his predecessor Barack Obama - as a capitulation, a deal that did not “put America first” and was too easy on economic rivals India, China and Europe. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” he said. “We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won’t be.” Trump offered no details about how, or when, a formal withdrawal would happen, and at one point suggested a renegotiation could take place. “We’re getting out but we’ll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine,” he said. That idea was unceremoniously slapped down by furious allies in Europe, who joined figures from around the United States in condemning the move. Related Links Musk quits White House panels over Trump move US state governors form climate alliance Macron: Trump climate move 'mistake for planet' Obama slams Trump over climate deal decision “The agreement cannot be renegotiated,” France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement. ‘Reject the future’ The United States is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, so Trump’s decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. Amid Trump’s domestic critics was Obama, who said the United States was “joining a handful of nations that reject the future.” Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. Obama insisted that US business, state governors and the mayors of major cities would step up. The Democratic governors of New York, California and Washington states indeed formed a quick alliance, vowing to respect the standards agreed on under the Paris deal. With much of the implementation of the accord taking place at the local level, the Paris accord’s supporters will hope the deal will be in hibernation rather than killed off entirely. Trump’s decision is likely to play well with the Republican base, so the more immediate damage may be on the diplomatic front. Trump called German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May - as well as Canada’s Justin Trudeau - to explain the decision. But traditional US allies were uncharacteristically blunt in their condemnation of Trump’s decision, which comes amid already strained relationships with the hard-charging new president. Germany said the US was “harming” the entire planet, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called the decision “seriously wrong.” ‘Harming’ the planet Ever the showman, the 70-year-old Trump had given his decision a reality-TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. That had prompted last-minute pressure from business tycoons, foreign allies and from inside his own White House not to pull out of the accord. Opponents of withdrawal - said to include Trump’s own daughter Ivanka - had warned that America’s reputation and its leadership role on the world stage was at stake, along with the environment. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, had urged Trump to remain in the deal. Ultimately, the lobbying by Trump’s environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave won out. In the wake of the announcement, Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk and Disney chief Robert Iger announced they would no longer take part in presidential business councils. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said. GE CEO Jeff Immelt said he was “disappointed” with the decision: “Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” China pledge White House officials were unable to provide firm details about how and when the US would leave, but acknowledged that under the deal, formal withdrawal may not take place until after the 2020 election. Trump had raised alarm bells when he refused to sign up to a pledge on the deal at last week’s G7 meeting in Italy. Hours ahead of Trump’s announcement, China’s Premier Li Keqiang pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord in a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and urged other countries to do likewise.

The leader of Asia’s other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who is due to visit the White House shortly - has said failing to act on climate change would be “morally criminal.” Mixed signals Trump’s announcement comes less than 18 months after the climate pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama’s leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to “pursue efforts” to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Trade Wars Could Erase Them. by Michelle Jamrisko @mljamrisko More stories by Michelle Jamrisko June 1, 2017, 4:00 PM EDT Tariffs on U.S. carbon emitters could overshadow any benefits Trump says pullout spares jobs, ‘draconian’ economic burdens How Rising Temperatures Can Fry the Economy President Donald Trump argued that leaving the Paris climate accord would save jobs at home, yet possible trade wars sparked by his decision could nullify any additional benefit to American workers. Complying with the deal “could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025,” he said Thursday at the White House, citing a litany of other dire economic forecasts aimed at supporting his decision. “Believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.” But job and growth estimates at the heart of the climate debate have varied so widely, some analysts viewed them as unreliable. Supporting the pro-pullout side was one estimate saying $3 trillion in gross domestic product and 6.5 million in jobs will be lost over the next quarter century -- numbers Trump also mentioned in the Rose Garden ceremony without noting the extended timeline. Another tally puts the GDP hit at more than $8 trillion through 2100 -- but that’s the damage estimated if the U.S. exits the deal. “Those numbers are exercises in imagination,” Kevin Book, managing director of Washington-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners, said of the jobs estimates. “If the United States pulls out of Paris, it sets in motion potentially an acceleration of the original Paris prognosis we had, which is that this probably ends with trade-based measures,” particularly because the agreement didn’t include enforcement provisions, Book said before the president’s announcement. More worrisome than the long-term guesses could be the expected tariffs on U.S. carbon emitters slapped on by other countries. Twenty-five companies, including Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and PG&E Corp., have signed on to a letter running as a full-page advertisement in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal on Thursday arguing in favor of the climate pact, and warning of potential “retaliatory measures” by other nations. Musk Leads CEOs’ Full-Court Paris Press as Trump Weighs Exit “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the letter says. “U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” The move leaves the U.S. as the third country, with Syria and Nicaragua, outside the massive international pact. While some see the fear of retaliation as a stronger, if less quantifiable, economic case around the Paris agreement than hard estimates, numbers on GDP and jobs have gotten much of the attention. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce points to a study by NERA Economic Consulting, which cites a $3 trillion hit to America’s GDP and the loss of 6.5 million industrial jobs by 2040 if the U.S. were to make good on its promises under the Paris accord. The World Resources Institute contends that those figures are misleading because the group based projections on an unnecessarily expensive route to achieving the 2025 targets agreed to under the Paris deal. Rallying Cry While the industry is split on their stance toward the Paris agreement, some coal executives like Bob Murray, chief executive officer of Murray Energy, have supported Trump’s talking points on the U.S. economic implications of the Paris agreement. U.S. growth would take a $2.5 trillion hit over 10 years with “factories and plants closing all over our country,” Trump said at an April rally in Pennsylvania. The reality, however, is that the boom in energy jobs has come in gas, wind and solar industries. The electric power industry’s transition away from coal has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewables, making solar companies the largest employer, with twice as many workers as coal, according to the U.S. Energy Department.

Sign Up Those urging the Trump administration to keep the U.S. promise on the Paris agreement have made opposite charges around the potential jobs impact. Environmental Entrepreneurs, an environmental advocacy group, said the withdrawal would put 3 million clean-energy jobs at risk. American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive political action committee, called the potential withdrawal “catastrophic” in a statement earlier this week, saying it threatens 11 million jobs being supported by made-in-America exports. Marshall Burke, a resource economist at Stanford University who’s been modeling the effects of climate change on world and national GDPs over the course of the century, is taking an even longer view. His estimate is that pulling out of the Paris agreement would cost the U.S. economy $8.2 trillion through 2100. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In a highly anticipated statement from the White House Rose Garden, Trump said the United States would abandon the current deal — but was open to negotiating a new one. “As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,” Trump said. “We’re getting out but we’ll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine.” Although details and the timeframe are still unclear, Trump argued that the agreement was a bad deal for Americans and that he was keeping a campaign promise to put American workers first. US President, Donald Trump “I cannot, in good conscience, support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does,” Trump said. The White House has told allies the 2015 deal was signed by President Barack Obama out of “desperation.” Trump faced last-minute pressure from business tycoons, foreign allies and from inside his own White House not to pull out of the 196-party accord. Ever the showman, the 70-year-old gave his decision a reality-TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. His decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. The United States is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China. Opponents of withdrawal — said to include Trump’s own daughter Ivanka — have warned that America’s reputation and its leadership role on the world stage are also at stake, as is the environment. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. – Diplomatic pressure – Trump’s long wind-up prompted fierce lobbying, with his environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, have also urged Trump to remain part of the deal. Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said he would have “no choice” but to leave White House-backed business councils if Trump pulls out. On the diplomatic front, German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the “remain” camp, publicly describing the deal as “essential,” and suggesting other countries would press ahead regardless. Trump raised alarm bells when he refused to sign up to a pledge on the deal at last week’s G7 meeting in Italy. Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the “six against one” discussion “very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory.” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was less diplomatic, all but accusing the US president of being ill-informed. “I am a transatlanticist. But if the US president in the next hours and days says that he will get out of the Paris accord, then it’s the responsibility of Europe to say: that’s not acceptable.” He noted that it would likely take three or four years to exit from the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had sought to explain that to Trump at the G7 summit. “As it appears, that attempt failed,” said Juncker. – China pledge – Hours ahead of Trump’s announcement, China’s Premier Li Keqiang also pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord, and urged other countries to do likewise. “China will continue to implement promises made in the Paris Agreement, to move towards the 2030 goal step by step steadfastly,” Li said in a Berlin joint press conference with Merkel. “But of course, we also hope to do this in cooperation with others.” China has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US are responsible for some 40 percent of the world’s emissions and experts warn is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to succeed. The leader of Asia’s other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said this week failing to act on climate change would be “morally criminal”. – Contradictory signals – Trump’s announcement comes less than 18 months after the historic climate pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama’s leadership.

They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to “pursue efforts” to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since taking office on January 20, Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax”, has sent contradictory signals on the Paris deal. When asked on Tuesday whether Trump believes human activity is contributing to climate change, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, “Honestly, I haven’t asked him that.

Microsoft announced last November that it was moving ahead with its Station Q campaign to build a working computer. The consortium now extends to Purdue as well as TU Delft in the Netherlands, the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, the University of Sydney in Australia, ETH Zurich in Switzerland and the University of Maryland. Purdue has been working with Microsoft on quantum computing for more than a year, but the newly signed agreement deepens the connections at Station Q Purdue. “What’s exciting is that we’re doing the science and engineering hand-in-hand, at the same time,” Professor Michael Manfra, director of Station Q Purdue, said today in a news release. “We are lucky to be part of this truly amazing global team.” Microsoft is one of several high-tech heavyweights that are laying bets on quantum computing technology. Google, IBM and Intel are also part of the quest. In March, IBM unveiled plans to build a breed of quantum devices that could be used for cloud computing. This month, Canada-based D-Wave Systems announced that it’s received $30 million in new funding for its quantum computer development effort, with the potential for $20 million more. Why quantum? Classical computing is based on the manipulation of well-defined bits, either ones and zeros, but quantum computing takes a radically different approach. It relies on fuzzy computational systems that can represent ones and zeros simultaneously, in a state known as superposition. Theorists say quantum computers would be far better suited for solving particular categories of problems, such as cryptography, cryptoanalysis and secure communications as well as computer modeling for molecular interactions and climate change. However, working with the quantum world poses challenges. For example, it’s difficult to keep a system of interconnected quantum bits, or qubits, stable enough for useful computation. Outside interference tends to push the qubits out of superposition prematurely. Microsoft and its Station Q collaborators aim to address that particular challenge with an approach known as scalable topological quantum computing. “Topological quantum computing utilizes qubits that store information ‘non-locally,’ and the outside noise sources have less effect on the qubit, so we expect it to be more robust,” Manfra said. The approach calls for weaving together arrays of exotic subatomic quasiparticles known as non-abelian anyons. Theoretically, such phenomena emerge from two-dimensional quantum systems, but so far, researchers have found only tentative evidence for their existence. In the years ahead, Station Q’s researchers will have to solve knotty problems in materials science and condensed matter physics as well as electrical engineering and computer architecture, Manfra said. “This is why Microsoft has assembled such a diverse set of talented people to tackle this large-scale problem,” he said. “No one person or group can be expert in all aspects.” Purdue’s main focus will be to study ultra-pure semiconductors and hybrid systems of semiconductors and superconductors that could provide the physical platform for Station Q’s quantum computer.

The former US president’s comments follows Mr Trump’s announcement that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate deal, signalling a policy shift with wide-ranging repercussions for the climate and Washington's ties with the world. "The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created," Mr Obama warned in a statement. "Even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got," he added. Barack Obama has strongly opposed US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal. (AAP) Before leaving office, Mr Obama helped shepherd the landmark international pact that commits all signatory nations to limiting global warming caused by carbon emissions. "It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well," he said. "And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America's private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar." In a highly anticipated statement from the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump said the US would abandon the current deal -- but was open to negotiating a new one. "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country," he said. "We're getting out but we'll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine." "We're getting out": Mr Trump announces the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (AAP) Although details and the timeframe are still unclear, Mr Trump argued that the agreement was a bad deal for Americans and that he was keeping a campaign promise to put American workers first. "I cannot, in good conscience, support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does," he said. "The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us as a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.” Mr Trump said though that he was open to renegotiating the deal, or creating a new agreement, "on terms that are fair to the US, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers." Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. Mr Trump's long wind-up prompted fierce lobbying, with his environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, have also urged Trump to remain part of the deal. Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said he would have "no choice" but to leave White House-backed business councils if Mr Trump pulls out. On the diplomatic front, German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the "remain" camp, publicly describing the deal as "essential," and suggesting other countries would press ahead regardless. Mr Trump raised alarm bells when he refused to sign up to a pledge on the deal at last week's G7 meeting in Italy. Ms Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the "six against one" discussion "very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory." European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was less diplomatic, all but accusing the US president of being ill-informed. "I am a transatlanticist. But if the US president in the next hours and days says that he will get out of the Paris accord, then it's the responsibility of Europe to say: that's not acceptable," Mr Juncker said. He noted that it would likely take three or four years to exit from the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had sought to explain that to Mr Trump at the G7 summit. "As it appears, that attempt failed," Mr Juncker said. Hours ahead of Trump's announcement, China's Premier Li Keqiang also pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord, and urged other countries to do likewise. "China will continue to implement promises made in the Paris Agreement, to move towards the 2030 goal step by step steadfastly," Li said in a Berlin joint press conference with Ms Merkel. "But of course, we also hope to do this in cooperation with others." China has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US are responsible for some 40 percent of the world's emissions and experts warn is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to succeed. The leader of Asia's other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said this week failing to act on climate change would be "morally criminal". Mr Trump's announcement comes less than 18 months after the historic climate pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama's leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times and to "pursue efforts" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 World Politics Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

US President Donald Trump. Photo/AFP Donald Trump will on Thursday announce plans to withdraw from the Paris climate deal, a US official told AFP, signaling a policy shift with wide-ranging repercussions for the climate and America's ties with the world. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official said that Trump will confirm America's "withdrawal" during a statement in the White House Rose Garden set to begin at 1900 GMT. Although details and the timeframe are still unclear, Trump is set to argue that the agreement is a bad deal for Americans and that he is keeping a campaign promise to "put American workers first." The White House has told allies the 2015 deal was signed by President Barack Obama out of "desperation." Trump faced last-minute pressure from business tycoons, foreign allies and from inside his own White House not to pull out of the 196-party accord. Ever the showman, the 70-year-old gave his decision a reality-TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way and coyly telling reporters on  "you're gonna find out very soon." His decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. The United States is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China. Opponents of withdrawal -- said to include Trump's own daughter Ivanka -- have warned that America's reputation and its leadership role on the world stage are also at stake, as is the environment. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. Diplomatic pressure Trump's long wind-up has prompted fierce lobbying, with his environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave. "I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways. Both ways," Trump said on the eve of his statement.

"As it appears, that attempt failed," said Juncker. "But a rule is a rule. And everyone must respect it. Not everything that is a rule, and not everything that stands in an international agreement is fake news." China pledge Hours ahead of Trump's announcement, China's Premier Li Keqiang also pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord, and urged other countries to do likewise.

They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to "pursue efforts" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since taking office on January 20, Trump, who has called climate change a "hoax", has sent contradictory signals on the Paris deal.

Now, the company has announced that this “era” is beginning soon – 2021 to be specific. Through its collaboration with Intel and Mobileye, BMW is developing a self-driving system for its upcoming iNext electric vehicle that will be capable of Level 3 and possibly even Level 4 autonomy. A recent video released by the German car manufacturer describes the five levels of autonomous driving as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, or SAE International, in terms of how much responsibility and awareness is required by the driver. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. Currently even the most advanced “self-driving” systems have a Level 2 capability meaning they require the driver to be alert at all times. Level 3 on the other hand allows the driver to operate the vehicle hands-free and take their eyes off the road for brief periods of time. With Level 4 the driver has the ability to take their eyes completely off the road, even napping if they choose to do so. However, the driver must still have a license and be fit to drive in case of an emergency. The BMW iNext electric vehicle is part of BMW's push to bring more gas-free cars to market. (BMW) The ultimate goal for automakers, Level 5 autonomy, is described as “fully autonomous driving” which requires no one to operate the vehicle at all. BMW’s iNext, set to hit production in 2021, will be a Level 3-capable vehicle allowing drivers to briefly change their focus to other activities. The automaker even claims it will have Level 4 and Level 5 capabilities, but due to laws and regulations as well as lack of traffic infrastructure, drivers will not be able to use most of them. What will this next generation high tech machine look like? For those envisioning BMW’s super cool Vision Next 100 concept the company calls “The Ultimate Driver”, you might be sadly disappointed. Rumor has it the iNext will be more of an electric crossover. The vision concept is a long way from production but it is intriguing nonetheless.  (BMW) As a brand that prides itself on its vehicle’s technology, BMW’s timeframe for the iNext’s production has it falling behind the curve. With Cadillac’s “hands-free” Super Cruise system debuting this fall and German rivals at Audi and Daimler in the lead in terms of testing and proposed release dates for similar systems, 2021 seems like a far way off, relatively speaking. Whether the delay is based on limited resources or BMW’s high standards is anyone’s guess, but only time will tell how waiting pays off for the automaker.

The files were related to a military project being undertaken by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which uploaded the files to an Amazon cloud storage server that anyone could access. Chris Vickery, a risk analyst with cyber resilience firm UpGuard, did just that. Among the files were sensitive information and even the security credentials of a senior employee with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). There were also the login credentials needed to access code repositories that might contain classified information among the files. Vickery said that the information appeared to have been accidentally leaked by a BAH employee. © AP Photo/ Kirsty Wigglesworth UK Resumes Intel Sharing With US After Manchester Probe Leak Perhaps the crown jewel of the 28 gigabyte leak? Master credentials that would grant administrative access to a high-security Pentagon system. "Information that would ordinarily require a Top Secret-level security clearance from the DOD was accessible to anyone looking in the right place," UpGuard's Dan O'Sullivan wrote in a blog post about the leak. "No hacking was required to gain credentials needed for potentially accessing materials of a high classification level." The files have since been secured, but anyone who found them before Vickery could have downloaded the files and used them to access NGA, Booz Allen Hamilton or Pentagon data.  "In short, information that would ordinarily require a Top Secret-level security clearance from the DoD was accessible to anyone looking in the right place; no hacking was required to gain credentials needed for potentially accessing materials of a high classification level," Vickery said on Wednesday.  © REUTERS/ Jonathan Ernst 'Repair': Israel Changes Intelligence-Sharing Rules With US After Trump Leak The NGA has gone into damage control mode, issuing a statement where they claimed to have begun an investigation into the leak. "We immediately revoked the affected credentials when we first learned of the potential vulnerability," the Wednesday statement read.  "NGA assesses its cyber security protections and procedures constantly with all of its industry partners. For an incident such as this, we will closely evaluate the situation before determining an appropriate course of action." Booz Allen is conducting their own investigation, a company spokesman told Gizmodo. "Booz Allen takes any allegation of a data breach very seriously, and promptly began an investigation into the accessibility of certain security keys in a cloud environment. We secured those keys, and are continuing with a detailed forensic investigation. As of now, we have found no evidence that any classified information has been compromised as a result of this matter." The NGA is the intelligence and combat-support agency that collects intelligence through geospatial imaging, social media georeferencing, and data analysis, earning them the nickname of the "Pentagon's mapmakers." © Photo: Youtube/BVFV - Best Vines & Funny Videos US Watchdog Releases New Clinton Emails Sent Through Unsecured Server BAH enjoys an $86 million contract with the NGA. The contract was for the consultant to provide "integrated learning solutions and enabling functions through learning portfolio and performance management, registrar services and learning outreach, and faculty development" to the NGA. Their reputation suffered a catastrophic blow in 2013 when BAH employee and NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked highly classified material. Another BAH employee, Harold Martin III, was arrested and charged with espionage when he was found to be in possession of over 50 terabytes of classified data in 2016. "Obviously, Booz Allen is a large company and a well-respected defense contractor," said national security lawyer Mark Zaid to Gizmodo. "And none of these cases are necessarily related to one another. But it still raises some real serious concerns about what's going on with Booz Allen's security protocols."/p> This is the second time in recent months that sensitive US information was left online for anyone to see. In March, a cache of Air Force files that included the social security numbers of officers and classified information from internal investigations was found unsecured online. ...

TRUMP Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official said that Trump will confirm America’s “withdrawal” during a statement in the White House Rose Garden set to begin at 1900 GMT. Although details and the timeframe are still unclear, Trump is set to argue that the agreement is a bad deal for Americans and that he is keeping a campaign promise to “put American workers first.” The White House has told allies the 2015 deal was signed by President Barack Obama out of “desperation.” Trump faced last-minute pressure from business tycoons, foreign allies and from inside his own White House not to pull out of the 196-party accord. Ever the showman, the 70-year-old gave his decision a reality-TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way and coyly telling reporters on “you’re gonna find out very soon.” His decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. The United States is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China. Opponents of withdrawal — said to include Trump’s own daughter Ivanka — have warned that America’s reputation and its leadership role on the world stage are also at stake, as is the environment. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. – Diplomatic pressure – Trump’s long wind-up has prompted fierce lobbying, with his environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave. “I’m hearing from a lot of people, both ways. Both ways,” Trump said on the eve of his statement. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, have also urged Trump to remain part of the deal. Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said he would have “no choice” but to leave White House-backed business councils if Trump pulls out. On the diplomatic front, German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the “remain” camp, publicly describing the deal as “essential,” and suggesting other countries would press ahead regardless. Trump raised alarm bells when he refused to sign up to a pledge on the deal at last week’s G7 meeting in Italy. Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the “six against one” discussion “very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory.” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was less diplomatic, all but accusing the US president of being ill-informed. “I am a transatlanticist. But if the US president in the next hours and days says that he will get out of the Paris accord, then it’s the responsibility of Europe to say: that’s not acceptable.” He noted that it would take three or four years to exit from the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had sought to explain that to Trump at the G7 summit. “As it appears, that attempt failed,” said Juncker. “But a rule is a rule. And everyone must respect it. Not everything that is a rule, and not everything that stands in an international agreement is fake news.” – China pledge – Hours ahead of Trump’s announcement, China’s Premier Li Keqiang also pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord, and urged other countries to do likewise. “China will continue to implement promises made in the Paris Agreement, to move towards the 2030 goal step by step steadfastly,” Li said in a Berlin joint press conference with Merkel. “But of course, we also hope to do this in cooperation with others.” China has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US are responsible for some 40 percent of the world’s emissions and experts warn is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to succeed. The leader of Asia’s other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said this week failing to act on climate change would be “morally criminal”. – Contradictory signals – A US withdrawal would come less than 18 months after the historic pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama’s leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to “pursue efforts” to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since taking office on January 20, Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax”, has sent contradictory signals on the Paris deal. When asked on Tuesday whether Trump believes human activity is contributing to climate change, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, “Honestly, I haven’t asked him that. I can get back to you.” adekunle View all posts by adekunle → Previous Post Police rates Ekiti as state with lowest crime rate in Nigeria Next Post Orphans begin nationwide prayer for President Buhari Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

(AMD) Stock Is Sending a Message. Listen. Everyone talks about screaming 'buy' and 'sell' signals, but right now, AMD stock is yelling out, 'Leave me alone!' Jun 1, 2017, 8:50 am EDT  |  By Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace Contributor     View All   Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you already know that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of the hottest comeback stories of 2016. Last year, both die-hard investors and speculators pocketed over 300% returns. Aside from a comeback bounce from the 2008 global financial crisis, AMD stock has never seen such levels. Source: Shutterstock But in the markets, everything can change in a heartbeat. Advanced Micro Devices is learning that the hard way. So far this year, the AMD stock price is actually slightly in the red since Jan. 1. Missed revenue expectations for the chipmaker’s Q1 earnings report stunted CEO Lisa Su’s otherwise glorious turnaround effort. Advanced Micro dropped about 25% — the worst single-day selloff in a decade. The company suffered further disappointment when rumors about a GPU licensing deal with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) were flatly denied. Intel previously had a contract with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), but that expired in March of this year. Speculation was rampant that Intel would go with Advanced Micro Devices. AMD stock jumped on the rumor, but fell apart after Intel said it was untrue. Additionally, Ms. Su gave no indication of the deal in her corporate presentation to Wall Street analysts. Ordinarily, such denials would arouse heartache. Apparently, AMD stock is no ordinary investment. Rather than avoiding the chipmaker, a considerable number of analysts are urging investors to double down. Should you do the same? Worrying Headwinds for AMD Stock Wall Street’s analyst community is absolutely no help, with the majority (52%) of those covering the stock ranking it a “Hold.” To be fair, though, only a small handful are bearish, with most of the remainder bullish. But that’s a big undecided camp. This stalemate of perspectives is our first clue that strongly directional guidance should be avoided. If market pros can’t form some sort of solid consensus, it’s difficult to have confidence — in either direction. AMD’s financial situation isn’t glowing, either, with the company still trying to figure out a way to churn out profits. Su is putting together a fantastic turnaround story that has Advanced Micro on the right path, but the semiconductor industry is insanely competitive, and scraping together higher margins is difficult. But my biggest worry is the worst-case scenario of a prolonged industry downturn. AMD simply doesn’t have the resources of some of its better-heeled competitors. Artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, among other emerging technologies, should help stave this off, and then there’s AMD’s core strength — gaming — which is holding strong. But there’s no questioning the difficulty of the PC market’s deflationary environment. Technical Trouble Ahead, Too? Of course, even if I am right and the fundamentals don’t make the case for a turnaround in shares right now, AMD stock is always good for a technical bump here and there.

The idea could bring up concerns about privacy, but Krzanich has already thought of how to minimize those worries. Chantel McGee 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Intel CEO: Growth areas are growing double digits    14 Hours Ago | 03:50 The benefits of having self-driving cars go far beyond automatic parking or fewer accidents, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told CNBC on Thursday. Among those other benefits: Driverless cars will double as security cameras, he said from the sidelines of the Code Conference in California. "I always say that the cars are going to be out there looking, so the next time an Amber alert comes up and they're looking for a license plate, the cars should be able to find that license plate quite rapidly," said Krzanich. The idea could bring up concerns about privacy, but Krzanich has already thought of how to minimize those worries. "We'll have to put limitations on it," he said. "We'll have to encrypt that data and make sure I can't tell that it's John's [car] necessarily," said Krzanich. "I think there will be rules and new areas we'll have to explore, but the amount of social good that can come from that far outweighs those concerns," he said. "We just have to deal with them."

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Comey to testify before Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 In Politics by Brian Abrams / June 1, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @brianabrams Thursday afternoon, C-SPAN reported that James Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, June 8. The open hearing will begin at 10 a.m. EST followed by a recess and a closed session at 1 p.m. EST. Press statement below: It’s happening! Comey to testify publicly at Senate Intel next Thursday. pic.twitter.com/GwmD7Zplpu — Eric Geller (@ericgeller) June 1, 2017 Last we checked in with the former FBI director, associates of his had leaked to news organizations how Comey documented his meetings with President Trump in a series of memos. One of which we’re already familiar (but have not seen) relayed how POTUS asked Comey to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. But this was only one memo, mind you. And, thus, according to a report last month from The New York Times, since Comey was uncomfortable with his relationship with the president, Comey recorded several memos, and that are presumably still in his possession, about his encounters with the shady prez. Per the aforementioned memo penned by Comey, he and Trump met on February 14 to discuss recently resigned former national security adviser Flynn, who’d lied to vice president Mike Pence about speaking with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Trump made it clear he wanted the investigation into Flynn’s wrongdoings shut down. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” [photo: Getty] Tags: comey Recommended for you Trump told the Russians in the Oval Office that Comey was ‘a real nut job’ Trump is pissed off at his golden boy Jared Kushner Trump aides admit they can’t prepare for next scandal since they don’t know all the dumb shit he’s done Comey associate confirms Trump asked for loyalty White House aides say Trump didn’t prepare for his Lester Holt/NBC News interview Acting FBI Director McCabe contradicts White House claims about Comey termination sign up to get the latest deathandtaxes news Thank you for signing up for our newsletter.

The House intelligence committee said May 31, it is issuing subpoenas for President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser and his personal lawyer, Cohen, as well as their businesses as part of its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)More WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia's influence in the 2016 election (all times local): 6:30 p.m. The former FBI director heading a probe into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia has enlisted a top Justice Department official in the effort. Special counsel Robert Mueller has appointed Andrew Weissmann to his team, a department official confirmed Wednesday. Weissmann had been head of the criminal division's fraud section since 2015. The longtime Justice official previously served as FBI general counsel under Mueller. Weissmann began his career with Justice in 1991 at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. He later joined and ran the Enron Task Force. The department official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly announce the appointment. — By Sadie Gurman ___ 5:15 p.m. The House intelligence committee is issuing subpoenas for several individuals, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as part of its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election. Subpoenas were approved Wednesday for Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, and Cohen and his firm, Michael D. Cohen & Associates. Reps. Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee's probe, say the panel approved the subpoenas to compel certain individuals to testify and to obtain personal documents and business records. Cohen earlier rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. ___ 3:40 p.m. An associate of James Comey says the special counsel overseeing an investigation into possible Russian coordination with the Trump campaign has approved the former FBI director to testify before a Senate committee. The associate wouldn't discuss what Comey plans to tell the Senate intelligence committee. But the associate says Comey has received approval from special counsel Robert Mueller to make certain statements. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the committee, says the committee would welcome Comey's testimony. Congress is due back in session next week. The Associated Press reported on May 19 that Comey had agreed to testify before the committee after Memorial Day. The associate wasn't authorized to discuss details of Comey's testimony and so spoke on condition of anonymity. — By Jake Pearson in New York. ___ 3:44 a.m. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. The Associated Press has learned of Flynn's cooperation that was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Flynn's decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation.

On Thursday morning, major firms including Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel, Microsoft and Salesforce paid for a full-page ad in both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal urging Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate agreement. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk were among the business leaders to personally call the White House in a last-ditch effort to keep the U.S. in the agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported. Musk took to Twitter to warn that if Trump elects to drop the U.S. from the climate deal, he will step down from his positions on White House advisory councils. Musk has earned significant criticism for his decision to stay on the councils in the past but has argued that it’s “important” to have a role in shaping discourse at the White House. ADVERTISEMENT Musk and Cook were only the initial wave in calls from the technology industry for Trump to keep the U.S. in the agreement.  IBM reaffirmed its support of the Paris climate deal on Thursday. "This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country," Wayne Balta, vice president of environmental affairs at IBM, wrote in a blogpost. "IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it." Dean Garfield, the president and CEO of the D.C. trade association Information Technology Industry Council, called the Paris agreement a "critical component" and a "responsibility." The council represents major tech firms like Twitter, Samsung and Dell. “The perception that we have to decide between creating jobs or tackling climate change is a false choice,” said Garfield. “It is not too late for the president to stay the course and work with the tech industry to ensure that more clean energy jobs continue to go to Americans and that U.S. leadership in innovation is second to none.” During a segment of CNBC’s "Squawk Box" on Thursday morning, CEO of HP Enterprise Meg Whitman also pleaded with the president. “Please do not withdraw from the Paris climate accord. This is not in the best interest of Americans,” Whitman said. “We need to own the next generation of jobs, whether that’s clean energy or 3-D printing or immunotherapy. This is an arena that America should lead and must lead.” Trump tweeted Wednesday that he would reveal his decision on the Paris accord at 3 p.m. on Thursday in a Rose Garden speech.

May was an eventful month in the channel ,with security shooting to the forefront thanks to the worldwide WannaCry ransomware attack that left some speculating as to who was behind it. Related articles MSP Road Trip: Norwell, Massachusetts Channelnomics story of the month - May 2017 Distribution consolidation: M&As shaking up disties' role in the channel DRaaS opportunity ripe for channel partners Vendor Q&A Series: Hedy Belttary, Laserfiche Meanwhile, May represented the one-year mark from the launch of European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPC). Research and experts agree, however, that many are still not prepared for the upcoming complaince regulations. Of course, GDPR also point to opportunity, which includes prospects for channel partners in cloud, datacenter and managed services. In the vendor world, PC took much of the spotlight. We saw AMD line up as notable competitor against Intel in the PC and server chips space, while Huawei announced a laptop launch set to shake up partners' PC options. Of course, for solution providers the month brought a myriad of analysis for running a successful channel business, including looks at the importance of prioritizing people over product and the money-making potential for MSPs in cloud and security. This month's favorite story also offers partners analysis, but instead of centering on technology, this piece focuses on strategy. As always, we welcome your feedback on our choice, so get in touch or send us a tweet - @Channelnomics - to let us know what you think. You may well have a different view to ours, so we'd love to hear it! Channel partners are so dedicated to their day-to-day business that they can forget to take time to think about what lies ahead. During Kaseya Connect in Las Vegas, NV last month, the RMM vendor encouraged channel partners to dedicate a few days a year contemplating strategy and future evolution. By turning off phones and emails and resisting the urge to put out fires, Kaseya said taking time to work on the business can separate partners from low-growth companies.

I went from from a standard 14-inch ThinkPad to a 17.3-inch Asus ROG gaming laptop, with the ROG machine towering over my old laptop like the peasant it was. My new daily workstation is now the Asus ROG G752VT, an impressive device which boasts an Intel 6th-Gen Core i7 processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970M graphics card. Unlimited power If my old laptop was a reasonable hatchback with good fuel economy, the Asus ROG G752VT is a Lamborghini – stylish and packing a ton of horsepower in its elegant chassis. The ROG is a massive laptop with an aggressive, gamer-focused design – sporting generous amounts of orange and red lighting and large rear cooling vents. However, the most impressive feature is the 17.3-inch 1,920 x 1,080 IPS panel with G-Sync support at 75Hz. Moving from a 14-inch 1,366 x 768 display on my old laptop to the ROG’s FHD display was like going from cold soup to medium-rare fillet. When it comes to gaming, the laptop’s Maxwell-powered GeForce GTX 970M GPU performs exceptionally well, tackling most titles with no trouble at all. My PC runs The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt flawlessly on “high” settings at around 40-50FPS, with G-Sync eliminating all screen tearing and delivering impressive levels of smoothness. The image above shows how I now spend most of my day at work, thanks to some expert screen positioning. I’ve thrown nearly everything in my Steam library at the laptop, and it has handled most games without breaking a sweat. Additionally, the laptop’s cooling system vents hot air through the back of the chassis, meaning I won’t end up slowly roasting my hand after long gaming sessions. The battery delivers decent unplugged gaming time, and performance is not lowered at all when playing games on the move. Considering that the only games I managed to play comfortably on my old work laptop were Hearthstone and Clicker Heroes, the ROG is a great upgrade – offering desktop-grade performance. Down to business While it is significantly larger than my old laptop, the ROG is far better to work on thanks to its large, high-quality display and backlit keyboard. The device is relatively heavy – and so large that I had to upgrade my carrier bag – but it has a sturdy, rugged construction. It is surprisingly easy to handle when working on the move without a desk, although it’s already attracting the envious attention of colleagues thanks to its design and LED lighting. The high-resolution display is great when working online, making it easy to view large webpages and documents. The keyboard is an improvement over my previous laptop and the Alt+Tab keys are placed within easy reach – making it simple to switch between games and work. 16GB of 2,133MHz DDR4 RAM allows the device to run smoothly despite hordes of Google Chrome tabs, and the I/O offers a range of ports, including Thunderbolt and a microSD card reader. Despite its relative bulk and weight, the ROG G752VT is a great upgrade over my previous laptop and has tackled everything I’ve thrown at it.

Safely tucked away in a hotel they setup a room with kit on display. The Focus G is going multi-color, the Celcius is in the house as well as some other things. Fractal design recently released the new Celsius liquid cooling kits. The Celsius S36 for example is an all-in-one liquid cooling solution for desktop PCs and is available in 240mm and 360 versions. The kit is a self-contained (AIO) CPU cooling unit based on liquid cooling. It does not require much setup installation. With a pump and radiator shipped pressure tested, it is pre-filled and sealed directly from the factory to provide maintenance-free operation for years. This ease of use extends to its support of the latest Intel and AMD sockets; including the latest Intel LGA 1155/1156/2011 and AMD FM2 sockets as well as AM4 for Ryzen. Recently they also launched the sub 50 USD Focus G series. The Focus G series have decent storage options and is aimed at a relatively smaller form factor. New is that FD is to offer these models in different colors like white, red and gunmetal grey, stepping away from the traditional black/white design. Fractal Design has released the Focus G, yet also a Focus G Mini. This one is a notch smaller and houses only smaller micro-ATX/ Mini-ITX motherboards. The chassis series will offer space for just two 3.5"/2.5 units that are tucked away in the compartment next towards the hidden power supply. These units are armed with Silent Series LL 120mm (Led Lit in white) that already have been factory installed, and that means good decent versus fairly little noise. They have more on display though like the Define S, have a look at some of the photos we took of all the kit available, now and in the near future. Oh and there was something tempered glass going on as well, but **** I forgot which model that was. Tagged as: Computex 2017 Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ...

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Mobileye Profit Rises 53% As Self-Driving Interest Surges Business boomed in the first quarter for the maker of the automotive vision systems that will be key to self-driving cars. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Jun 1, 2017 at 10:22AM Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) said that its first-quarter net income jumped 53% from a year ago, to $33.5 million, on strong year-over-year growth in sales across its product line.  Excluding share-based compensation and a one-time item, Mobileye earned $0.25 per share in the first quarter, a penny ahead of the consensus estimate of Wall Street analyst polled by FactSet. Revenue jumped 66% from a year ago to $124.7 million, ahead of the $119 million estimate as reported by FactSet. The Israel-based developer of advanced driver-assist and autonomous-vehicle systems agreed in March to be acquired by chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for $15.3 billion.  Mobileye co-founder and CTO Amnon Shashua (left) and Volkswagen brand chief Herbert Diess. VW agreed in February to roll out Mobileye's map-building system in its vehicles starting next year. Image source: Volkswagen AG. Mobileye earnings: The raw numbers  Metric Q1 2017 Change vs. Q1 2016 Revenue $124.7 million 66% EyeQ chips shipped  2,032,000 54% EyeQ average selling price $45.10 2% Net income (GAAP) $33.5 million 53% Free cash flow (GAAP) $56.6 million 74% Data source: Mobilieye N.V.  A note about the pending Intel acquisition As noted above, Intel is in the process of acquiring Mobileye for $15.3 billion, or $63.54 per share. The two companies began working together closely last year, when they joined auto supplier Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH) in two partnerships aimed at delivering self-driving vehicle systems. One aims to bring a system directly to the market by the end of 2019, the other is a joint effort with German luxury-car maker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF), better known as BMW. Because of the pending transaction, Mobileye said, it didn't hold its usual quarterly earnings call, and it declined to provide forward-looking guidance.  What happened at Mobileye during the first quarter of 2017 The deal with Intel was Mobileye's most consequential news of the quarter, of course. But much more happened: Mobileye sells into two channels: Directly to automakers (called "original equipment manufacturers," or OEMs) and aftermarket. OEM revenue jumped 54% from a year ago to $94.5 million on a jump in sales (and average selling prices) of Mobileye's core product, the EyeQ series of chips. Aftermarket revenue jumped 188% to $30.2 million.  Mobileye closed a purchase of land in Jerusalem that will be used to build a new research and development campus. Construction will begin once regulatory approvals are in place, Mobileye said. The facility will cost about $195 million.  In January, Mobileye formed a strategic partnership with electric-vehicle start-up NIO US to develop a Level 4 autonomous-vehicle system by 2019. (Learn more about the levels of autonomous-vehicle technology here.)  Mobileye and Volkswagen AG (NASDAQOTH:VLKAY) announced in February that the German auto giant will begin integrating Mobileye's camera-based mapping system (called Road Experience Management, or "REM") into its vehicles beginning next year. The REM system automatically creates high-definition maps of a vehicle's surroundings as it travels. The data collected by VW's vehicles will be pooled with data collected by other automakers using the REM technology to create shared maps for autonomous vehicles. Later in February, BMW said it will also roll out the REM system on its vehicles starting next year. (A similar deal was announced with Nissan Motors in April.)  What Mobileye's CEO said about the first quarter As noted above, Mobileye didn't hold an earnings call. But CEO Ziv Avriam released a short statement: Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate. Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers. The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders. Looking ahead: What's next for Mobileye The sale of Mobileye to Intel is expected to close by the end of 2017.  John Rosevear has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Is Apple about to announce five new MacBooks? by Joseph Carey 17 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Apple has registered five new Mac computers ahead of a supposed WWDC reveal on June 5, if a new report is to be believed. French website Consomac (via) has posted an apparent regulatory filing, translated from Russian, and has noted the five ‘personal computer’ models running macOS that are supposedly launching soon. The apparent new Macs, known only as A1289, A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481, are said to be new 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. Why would Apple be debuting new Mac hardware? Well, it's suggested that the company will be including faster Intel Kaby Lake processors in order to win back fans that were disappointed with the specifications of the new MacBook Pro, released towards the end of last year. Related: WWDC 2017 It is also being suggested that the 12-inch MacBook will see an internal refresh, with Apple potentially considering updating the now archaic MacBook Air. What’s most interesting is the model A1843, labelled as a new wireless keyboard from the Cupertino based company. While there's no details on any of these devices, it could be that this new keyboard houses a Touch ID sensor that could be used with Mac desktop computers. That's not completely unfathomable, considering the MacBook Pro now has that functionality. Finally, there are also four models detailed in this leak that appear under ‘Tablet PC brand’, which could point to the launch of new iPads at the WWDC keynote. This filing seems to be in line with recent reports stating that Apple is ramping up laptop upgrades in order to battle back against Microsoft, which recently debuted its Surface Laptop – a direct competitor to Apple’s Mac line-up. Interestingly, there's no mention of Apple’s rumoured Siri speaker in this filing. However, it seems as though WWDC is going to bring a few new hardware announcements, something that the conference hasn't delivered since 2013. The WWDC keynote is taking place on June 5 at 10am pacific time, which is 6pm UK time. During the presentation we are sure to hear all the biggest announcements and, as ever, TrustedReviews will be keeping you up to date with all the latest developments.

The news comes in a report by DigiTimes, which states that Apple's increase of Intel-created wireless chips for iPhones could lead well into 2018, suggesting the so-called iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 have a higher chance of receiving Intel's chip than Qualcomm's. Apple sourced both of the manufacturers for wireless chips in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, with a ratio of around 70 percent sourcing going to Qualcomm and 30 percent going to Intel. Now, Apple is believed to have given each supplier an equal 50 percent proportion of the wireless chip manufacturing for the rest of 2017, and that number could eventually increase to weigh in Intel's favor -- all because of Apple's legal fight with Qualcomm. Analysts watching the supply chain predict that Apple will eventually give Intel 70 percent of the production capacity in iPhones by 2018, because neither Apple nor Qualcomm are willing "to give in to make peace." Apple's outsourcing proportion to Intel for the next-generation iPhone baseband chips has risen to about 50% for orders running through the end of 2017 due to the lawsuit between Qualcomm and Apple, which has grown fiercer recently. Since both Qualcomm and Apple are unwilling to give in to make peace, some market watchers believe Apple is likely to shift even more baseband chip orders away from Qualcomm with Intel to supply over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018. Apple and Qualcomm's feud began with a complaint filed by the FTC in January that centered around Qualcomm's anticompetitive patent licensing practices, which the FTC claimed it used to remain the dominant supplier of baseband chips for smartphones. Not long after, Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm over the news of its practices, claiming Qualcomm charged unfair royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with." After a few quiet months, in April Qualcomm countersued Apple, so Apple decided to stop making royalty payments to its suppliers in relation to Qualcomm's baseband chip technology, igniting a new series of arguments between the companies. Because Qualcomm holds licensing deals with Apple's iPhone manufacturers, and not Apple itself, the move was suggested to hurt Qualcomm to the tune of $500 million, causing the company to adjust its third quarter guidance from $5.3 billion - $6.1 billion in revenue down to $4.8 billion - $5.6 billion. Qualcomm eventually tried to get an import ban passed that would prevent iPhones from entering the United States, and then decided to file a lawsuit against Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, and Compal for "breaching their license agreements" by failing to pay royalties on the use of Qualcomm's technology in the assembly of Apple's devices. Last week, Qualcomm requested an injunction to force Apple's iPhone manufacturers to keep paying royalties during the legal battle. Due to the ongoing nature of the feud between the two companies, it's expected that the case will continue well into 2017, leading to today's report that Qualcomm might see a greatly reduced presence in the manufacturing of the next-generation iPhones. Even with the bad blood between Apple and Qualcomm, insiders still call Apple's reliance on Intel "a friendship of convenience" more than any kind of long-term partnership, because Intel's chips are said to have "inferior performance" in comparison to Qualcomm's technology.

This is unfortunate. It's fairly common knowledge the Intel version of the iPhone 7 is significantly worse than the QUALCOMM version. I switched and signal strength and speed both went back up. Sucks Apple has to go with the inferior supplier :-( Are you serious? "Sucks" is a way too harsh a term to be used here. Sucks should mean that the Intel WWAN chips are faulty, causing various issues like drop-outs and whatnot. Having a chip that gives you slightly worse Throughput/RSRP does not mean it downright sucks. People really need to get their acts together. This is no need to blow everything out of proportions all the time. If you seriously consider the difference between the Qualcomm MDM9645M and Intel XMM7360 to be of such significance that the Intel versions downright sucks you must hate the iPhone 6S as the Qualcomm MDM9635M in the iPhone 6S scored worse on the Throughput/RSRP ratings on pretty much all the tests compared to the Intel XMM7360.. What's even funnier is how the Intel XMM7360 actually beats the Qualcomm MDM9645M at Throughput/RSRP on lower signal levels. But who care about that? People care more about having 140mbps vs 110mbps in good coverage, compared to having 15mbps vs 25mbps in bad coverage. What kind of applications do you use while roaming that makes you notice the difference between having 140mbps vs 110mbps over LTE with good signal strength? I don't care. It's not like the networks are pushing the limits of what the chips can support. However I am curious on their CDMA abilities since Qualcomm owns a lot of patents on that chip technology. Good to see that there is still at least a few members who don't jump onto the whine-train as soon as a article goes live on Macrumours.

I switched and signal strength and speed both went back up. Sucks Apple has to go with the inferior supplier :-( The only reason why Intel chips somewhat have less performance than the Qualcomm (not Broadcom) chips is because they are first generation chips. They obviously aren't going to be the best, but they will get better. I have an Intel-based iPhone 7 Plus and everything works just fine for me though.

Long term this will be good as the industry will get a viable alternative to Qualcomm (who needs some competition). Hopefully the Intel chips this year will be improved (Intel is good at that sort of thing - refining) so it won't be a letdown to get an Intel iPhone.

Rating: 2 Votes jkozlow3 11 hours ago at 12:44 pm As for CDMA support, this may be the year that it is officially dropped from the iPhone. I can't speak for the rest of the world, but here in the U.S., I haven't seen a Verizon iPhone on their CDMA network in years. Sprint is likely the carrier in the U.S. that would suffer greatly from lack of CDMA support in future iPhones. Huh? In YEARS?? There are still a LOT of Verizon customers that don't have VoLTE enabled on their phones (even if their phone supports it). I only just enabled VoLTE in 2016 myself (Verizon customer). Before that LTE was too sparse in my city to make reliable calls without dropping - especially while driving around town. Guess what all of those people are using to make calls if they don't have VoLTE enabled? CDMA. Your comment is way off base. I would be SHOCKED if Apple dropped CDMA support in the next iPhone. We're still 2 years out from that being a reality. Many rural customers and customers who work in office buildings with poor reception would be screwed. No way Apple is going to do that.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Computex / Computex: G.Skill demos new ultra-fast RAM for X299 Computex: G.Skill demos new ultra-fast RAM for X299 Matthew Wilson 19 hours ago Computex, Featured Tech News, Memory At Computex today G.Skill began showing off its new super fast DDR4 modules, which are primarily geared towards use on Intel’s new X299 platform. G.Skill’s new memory kits range from a 3466MHz 32GB DDR4 SODIMM kit all the way up to a Trident Z 4800MHz kit. First up is the new Trident Z DDR4-4800MHz CL19 16GB (2x8GB) Kit. The goal with this kit was to achieve the fastest frequency possible and at Computex, G.Skill demoed it running perfectly fine while maintaining a low CAS latency timing of CL19-19-19-39. At the show, G.Skill has this kit running with an Intel Core X-series processor on an ASRock X299 OC Formula motherboard. Stepping down from that is the Trident Z RGB DDR4 4200MHz, which is a 64GB kit. This is a quad-channel kit for the X299 chipset platform, running at 4200MHz with a timing of CL19-21-21-41. Similarly to the last demo, this was running on an Intel Core-X CPU though the motherboard this time was an ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe. Next up is the 4400MHz version of the Trident Z RGB kit, though rather than offering 64GB of memory in quad channel, this kit offers 16GB in dual channel (2x8GB). This kit is overclocked to DDR4-4400MHz CL19-19-19-39 on the Gigabyte X299 SOC Champion motherboard. The final desktop kit we got to see was the Trident Z RGB DDR4-4000MHz 32GB kit, utilising two 16GB modules. This kit runs at a timing of CL17-18-18-38 and was shown running on an ASRock X299 OC Formula motherboard. The final kit we saw overall was a SO-DIMM kit for laptops. G.Skill has put together a high speed 3466MHz 32GB kit for portable systems, with a CL16-18-18-43 timing. This kit was shown running inside an EVGA SC17 gaming laptop, though it could run inside many others. KitGuru Says: It looks like those upgrading to X299 this year will have plenty of new high-speed memory kits to choose from. Are any of you currently planning your next upgrade?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « News of Inventec Winning the Contract for Apple's version of a Home Speaker Device with Siri Resurfaces | Main | Apple invents a new Integrated Microphone and Vibration Sensor to Provide Superior Headset Noise Cancellation » June 01, 2017 Apple Advances their work on a 3D Virtual Character Creation App for Gaming on iDevices, Apple TV & future Headset   Apple's advanced avatar creation app first came to light in a patent report back in 2012. The patent covered such topics as 3D creation, advanced editing, playback on holographic displays, head mounted display systems and more. Gamers are used to being able to choose the character that they want to play and change characteristics such hair styles, clothing and more. You could check out various details in our previous reports here and here. Apple was also granted a patent for this future app back in February.   Avatars are not just about cartoon-like characters anymore. Apple acquired a company called Faceshift that uses a power 3D camera that could scan your face movements in realtime and create quite the elaborate characters as noted in the video below.     In 2015 Faceshift’s Brian Amberg (CTO) and Nico Scapel (Creative Director) talked about face tracking to bring virtual characters to life, using the Intel RealSense depth camera. Faceshift’s expertise is built with the big Hollywood studios, but this new motion capture solution makes it affordable for smaller studios, as well as accessible for consumers. According to 3D animator Adrian Firth, this now means that “The only real limitation is what our imagination can think off." Apple will eventually replace Intel's RealSense depth camera with one invented by their Israeli team acquired from PrimeSense on future Apple Macs and other devices over time.   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a continuation patent application from Apple where they continue to add new patent claims, new aspects of the invention that they want to protect.   Apple's new patent claim #1 states: A method comprising: identifying a contact point on a surface of a model at which to place an asset; identifying a surface normal extending perpendicular from the surface of the model at the identified contact point; positioning a pivot point of the asset at the identified contact point, wherein the pivot point of the asset corresponds to the center of gravity of the asset; and orienting the asset normal of the asset at the identified surface normal.   One of the new key claims relates to the positioning of the user's eyes. Apple notes in patent claim #27: "establishing an eye position of a user; and defining a line passing through the established eye position and through the identified position on the display." This could be better understood by seeing in the light of face tracking in realtime like the Faceshift video.    In respect to the kinds of displays that the avatars could appear on has widened from the original application. The list now includes:   "The display may include any suitable type of display or interface for presenting visual content to a user. In some embodiments, the display may include a display embedded in a device or coupled to a device (e.g., a removable display). The display may include, for example, a liquid crystal display ("LCD"), a light emitting diode ("LED") display, an organic light-emitting diode ("OLED") display, a surface-conduction electron-emitter display ("SED"), a carbon nanotube display, a nanocrystal display, any other suitable type of display, or combination thereof. Alternatively, the display can include a movable display or a projecting system for providing a display of content on a surface remote from the electronic device, such as, for example, a video projector, a head-up display, or a three-dimensional (e.g., holographic) display.   Apple's patent application titled "Systems, methods, and computer-readable media for placing an asses on a three-dimensional model" was filed back in December 2016. You could review the newly added patent claims in full here. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Mesa 17.0.7 Released, Mesa 17.0 Hits The End Of The Line Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 1 June 2017 at 07:07 AM EDT. Add A Comment Mesa 17.0.7 is now available as the latest bug-fix release to Mesa 17.0 and is also the last planned release for the Mesa 17.0 series that debuted earlier this year. Mesa 17.0.7 has fixes for Intel i965/ANV, minor work on Nouveau/Etnaviv/VC4, some Wayland patches, and work on EGL and GLVND GLX. Nothing too exciting for users sticking to this older stable series. With Mesa 17.0.7 being the last planned point release, users are encouraged to upgrade to the newer Mesa 17.1 series. Mesa 17.2 meanwhile is coming as the next feature release in August. The complete list of changes for Mesa 17.0.7 can be found via the mailing list announcement.

For a gamer on-the-go, they are quite handy at times as it allows them to take their gaming anywhere. Unfortunately, with all the necessary cooling and power requirements, they tend to be on the heavy side. Not only that, common builds are quite bulky too. Good thing there is the ASUS ROG Zephyrus, an ultra-slim gaming laptop equipped with NVIDIA GTX 1080 Max-Q. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus comes in two slightly different models: the GX501VS and GX501VI. The GX501VI comes with the NVIDIA GTC 1080 while its little brother, the GX501VS is equipped with the GTX 1070 GPU. Both gaming laptops will sport the seventh generation Intel processor, the i7-7700HQ. System RAM can be ramped up to 24GB while running at 2400MHz. As for storage, options start from 256GB to 1TB of PCIe NVMe flash storage. Since ASUS is also quite serious about Thunderbolt, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus is equipped with one Thunderbolt 3.0 port using a USB Type-C interface. There is also an HDMI 2.0 port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and four USB 3.0 ports. ASUS ROG Zephyrus (via rog.asus.com) The 15.5-inch display features a resolution of 1920x1080p and refresh rate of 120Hz. ASUS claims that the display itself if capable of reproducing 100 percent of sRGB color space. With the graphics card and the display interface, users can do VR gaming on this rig without it breaking a sweat. The other selling point of this massive laptop is its weight and dimensions. Weighing at only 2.2kg, it only slightly heavier than the MacBook Pro. However, compared with other gaming laptops out there, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus is the lightest. As for dimensions, never mind the width and depth, what matters is the height of the laptop. The Zephyrus stands at only 16.9mm. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus will hit store shelves by the end of June. Price for the GX501VI starts at $2,699. Meanwhile the GX501VS starts at $2,299. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.
