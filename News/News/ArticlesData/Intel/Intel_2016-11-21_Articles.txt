Blog :  Tact Aims to Advance Conversational Application Interfaces Article :  Artificial Intelligence: Present Trends and Its Future Intel and How Artificial Intelligence Could Save Thanksgiving Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 22 Nov, 2016          |         |     Share I know a lot of folks who are dreading Thanksgiving. Most are Democrats on their way to visit their relatives who overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. I tend to avoid this kind of problem, largely by choosing not to travel over the holidays and paying someone to fix my wife and me a nice dinner. Then we come home to binge watch a show like Scandal or House of Cards. Unfortunately, those suddenly seem too realistic to be fun. We are doing Game of Thrones instead because it seems far more lighthearted than reality. For those looking for something interesting to talk about during Thanksgiving, let’s look at how I think artificial intelligence (AI) could have helped the Democratic party. Many of our concerns surrounding AI of late have to do with the machines either going terminator on us or eliminating our jobs. However, at an AI Intel event last week, Intel proposed using AI to make us smarter, mostly focused on avoiding mistakes before we make them by observing what we do and providing timely advice. In this scenario, instead of killing and/or replacing us, they become like guardian angels, preventing us from doing something dangerous or stupid. Setting the Stage for AI Separate yourself from either party and see if you can look at the election dispassionately. On one side, we had a guy who had no direct political experience, had to fund much of his own campaign because he didn’t know how to raise money, had offended virtually every voting segment but older white men, and didn’t even have the backing of his own party, which was the smaller of the two to begin with. Oh, and the majority of his party leaders had either declined to endorse him or endorsed his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He ran against a near-lifetime politician with a huge number of successful political campaigns, and one failure, under her belt, the full backing of her party, a massive and vastly larger war chest, most of the entertainment and technology industries behind her, and the heir apparent for the popular sitting president and his often more impressive wife. On paper, this would be like my high school football team taking on the team that won the Super Bowl and then winning. That might happen in a movie, but how the heck could that ever happen in real life? Last week when Intel had its AI Day and CEO Brian Krzanich proposed his plan to help create AIs that would keep us from doing stupid things and help create a better world, I immediately figured that the folks who needed that tool the most were politicians and, given their unprecedented loss, the Democratic party (those dealing with Brexit in England could use some help, too). The Democratic Party’s Unofficial Plan to Lose It wasn’t that the Republicans or Trump out-executed the Democrats; they had virtually nothing but Trump’s personality as a viable weapon and that weapon, at best, was flawed. The Democrats made a massive number of avoidable mistakes. Every indicator from both parties was that voters wanted change and an outsider, and this has been the case since before Ronald Reagan. They’d seen both Clinton and John McCain as insiders run against Barack Obama, an outsider, and get trounced, suggesting they needed to run an outsider. But instead of supporting Bernie Sanders as an outsider, they threw their support to Clinton, an insider. After weathering sexual harassment charges in a number of elections against her husband, Bill Clinton, and seeing first hand that none of them made a difference, Clinton’s end strategy seemed to be fully focused on the same type of effort against Trump. Clinton had the unique firsthand experience that this kind of attack doesn’t work in presidential politics, yet she deployed it against Trump. The email server should have been a huge security warning for the Democrats and they should have immediately moved to not only respond appropriately to this bad decision by admitting wrongdoing and making a credible statement that it wouldn’t recur, but to anticipate leaked emails. They didn’t even shore up the security of the party email servers, even though what was in Clinton’s email server likely provided things like passwords and IDs, and it wasn’t secure. They instead seemed to believe their own rhetoric that this was a non-issue. Finally, after seeing Obama with his handpicked team of focused analytics specialists roll against both McCain and Mitt Romney with devastating results, they apparently decided to go in a different direction. The result was far closer to Romney’s execution, and a complete revamp on Trump’s side in the last 10 days massively overwhelmed them. Analytics is about optimizing resources and while Trump’s were vastly smaller than Clinton’s, his team used them to better effect. They effectively did to Clinton what Obama did to McCain and especially Romney. Now, instead of Clinton being compared favorably to Obama, Trump is being compared favorably to Reagan. And like it was in both the McCain and Romney campaigns, the losers have to face donors with what has been, for them, a massive waste of money. The AI Advantage What Krzanich was talking about at Intel’s AI event was an AI implementation that was close to the facts, able to use historic precedence in real time, and could advise the user before a mistake was made. At the outset, such a tool might have highlighted that the majority of voters would prefer a younger candidate, who would be tied more closely to a more energetic demographic, someone who would be seen as an Obama heir and still as an outsider with the will to actually fix what needed fixing. Elizabeth Warren would have likely been closest to the ideal candidate, if victory was the goal. On the Trump side, the advice would probably have been to leave the topic of the leaked video alone and double down instead on the other issues people actually cared about, such as jobs, particularly in the states with the highest electoral college votes. The AI would have flagged the email server as a possible deal breaker and alerted of a potential broader security breach. It likely would have suggested the Democrats use it as a reason to establish a stronger security platform and use the reformed sinner mythology, where the reformed sinner looks more holy than someone who didn’t screw up in the first place, to turn a liability into an asset. Finally, it would have constantly recommended practices that had been successful in the past, like Obama’s unique approach to analytics, which would have allowed the Democratic candidate to use superior resources with equal efficiency to Trump to overwhelm him. And that is the potential power of AI as an aid, as Intel describes it. Using AI in this way is in sharp contrast to the current plan of replacing people with AIs and massively increasing unemployment, and it should have been a goal at the heart of both parties’ platforms. Wrapping Up: The Big AI Problem One of the differences between a younger politician and one in my advanced age group is that the younger ones are more likely to have come up with technology and be willing to take the advice, not second guess it. It is doubtful that someone who is as old as any of the candidates and most of the party leaders, with Paul Ryan and Obama as likely exceptions, would be willing to take the advice of an AI. This suggests, as AI becomes more capable, particularly down the path that Intel’s CEO articulated, the younger the politician, the greater the advantage. And that suggests a massive change in the ages for those serving in most elected jobs. After this election, I can’t say that’d be a bad thing. You see, if the Democrats and the Republicans got smarter, we’d make more progress and have less opportunity to argue about who had the most unacceptable candidate. I have to believe that would lead to a far more safe and sane Thanksgiving holiday, and a better nation and world. Wouldn’t that make a great Christmas present? Something to discuss over the Thanksgiving holidays.

 Even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wants to get his hands on this startup's $1399 Surface Pro-killer Matt Weinberger Nov. 22, 2016, 5:18 PM 79,177 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Eve V laptop/tablet. Starting at $1,399, it comes with the keyboard.Eve Microsoft's Surface tablets essentially invented the market for laptop/tablet hybrid computers, setting a standard that even Apple ended up following with its iPad Pro. Now Eve, a Helsinki-based startup with backing from Intel, thinks it can one-up Microsoft with the Eve V (pronounced "Eve Vee") — its own Windows 10-powered take on the Surface Pro, starting at $1399 for preorder via IndieGoGo, though it's backordered to April 2017. Today, Eve says so many people lined up to buy the first run of Eve V devices, it actually briefly overwhelmed IndieGoGo's payment processing system. At the time of writing, the Eve V had raised $722,833, or 964% of its $75,000 goal.  Even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken an interest in the Eve V project after reading about it, says Eve CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis, and will be getting a unit to try out when it starts shipping in February. After all, from Microsoft's perspective, the whole reason it first created the Surface was to inspire PC manufacturers. "[Microsoft] really wanted to see the device," Karatsevidis says.The Eve team, based in Helsinki.Eve The machine is totally finished and functional, thanks to Intel's funding, Eve says; the IndieGoGo campaign is to cover manufacturing costs and handle preorders. At this point, you may be wondering what makes the Eve V so special. If you ask Karatsevidis, the answer is simple: It's all about the community. See, every aspect of the Eve V, from the design to the processor to the keyboard cover material, was decided with full and complete input from Eve's community of fans. "We immediately started to see huge advantages" The Eve V is actually Eve's second bit of Windows hardware. The first, early 2015's Eve T1, was a budget Windows 8.1 tablet, designed to balance price with performance. At the time, Karatsevidis says, Eve was really just two guys looking to make the kind of gadget they themselves would want to use. "We were pretty unhappy with the products in the market," Karatsevidis says. An Eve fact sheet on how the Eve V stacks up against competitors.Eve The Eve T1 got pretty solid reviews, but Karatsevidis says that Eve was getting a ton of feedback, both via e-mail and in the comments sections of press articles about the tablet. A lot of people had a lot of ideas for how the T1 could have been done better.  Karatsevidis didn't just welcome the feedback — he rebuilt the company around it. In June 2015, Eve introduced Eve.Community, a site where anybody could register and help guide the company as it worked on its next project, what would become the Eve V. "We immediately started to see huge advantages to this," Karatsevidis says. "The community stepped in and stopped us" Karatsevidis says that there's this tendency in the market, especially when talking about hybrids like the Surface Pro, to focus on sleekness above all else. The problem, Karatsevidis says, is that this sleekness comes at the cost of things that users really care about, like battery life or additional USB and monitor ports. So while Eve's original designs called for something as thin and light as possible, the community came in and set them straight. Microsoft Surface Pro 4Microsoft "The community kicked in and prevented us from doing so," Karatsevidis says. "As a result, we have a lot of battery life." Now, Karatsevidis says, he realizes that battery life can make or break a product, "no joke." Similarly, the Eve V sports Thunderbolt 3, USB-C and 2 full-sized USB-A 3.0 ports, which beats the Surface Pro 4, which only has one USB port.  The payoff has been this tremendous rush of interest in the Eve V, as a device built by power users, for power users. "We really want to challenge the big guys" Intel found the project "quite accidentally," Karatsevidis says, but was really intrigued by the notion of product development via the wisdom of the crowd, which is a big bet for Eve in the future.  Going forward, Karatsevidis says, he's happy to see the Eve V go head-to-head with Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, and every other PC manufacturer. But he doesn't see the company stopping there: There's no reason why Eve couldn't apply its approach to crowdsourcing designs for phones, tablets, or even electric vehicles, he says. The Eve V is a little thicker than the Surface Pro 4, but that means it can have more ports and some extra battery life.Eve "We really want to challenge the big guys," Karatsevidis says. "We want to crowd-develop all kinds of tech with the community." Still, don't expect to see the Eve V on the shelves at Best Buy or Target any time soon. From Karatsevidis' perspective, a big part of maintaining the relationship with the community is by selling the devices directly to fans.

INTEL CEO Brian Krzanich speaks at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s AutoMobility conference last week.. (photo credit:Courtesy) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter At his keynote address at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s AutoMobility conference, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that Intel Capital is targeting more than $250 million of additional new investments over the next two years to make fully autonomous driving a reality. This follows Intel’s announcement from July this year of the cooperation with BMW and Mobileye, based in Jerusalem, and which aims to have self-driving cars in production by 2021. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. This was the first time Intel has ever participated in the Los Angeles car show, which is one of the most important automotive shows worldwide. Intel has recently undergone a dramatic change with a greater emphasis on the development of Big Data technologies and connectivity, and attaches great importance to the company’s entry into the global automotive industry. According to Krzanich, the automatic industry in now on the verge of great change, which will include groundbreaking advances in computing, data and connectivity. The company will focus on innovative technologies in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cyber security. “The world of today runs on oil – heating and cooling our homes, and powering almost all forms of transportation,” says Krzanich. “Try and drive a car today without oil-based products, and you won’t get far. Without oil, a car’s engine overheats, pistons and rings fuse to the cylinder walls, the engine block cracks and, of course, there is no gas. You could say oil is the key technology that allowed the automotive world we know today. But that’s all about to change. “Today, we think we live in a world flooded with data, but compared to the future, today’s amount of data is relatively small. In 2016, the average person generates 650 MBs of data a day – through use of their PCs, mobile phones and wearables. By 2020, projections show that the average person will generate 1.5 GBs of data a day. That’s an impressive,” Krzanich says. “That is a 200% increase in less than four years – but it pales in comparison to what we’re about to see in autonomous vehicles. “In an autonomous car, we have to factor in cameras, radar, sonar, GPS and LIDAR – components as essential to this new way of driving as pistons, rings and engine blocks. Cameras will generate 20-60 MBs, radar upwards of 10 kBs, sonar 10-100 kBs, GPS will run at 50 kBs, and LIDAR will range between 10-70 MBs. Run those numbers, and each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GBs – or 4 terabytes of data – a day. “Every autonomous car will generate the data equivalent of almost 3,000 people. Extrapolate this further and think about how many cars are on the road. Let’s estimate just 1 million autonomous cars worldwide – that means automated driving will be representative of the data of 3 billion people. “It’s not enough just to capture the data. We have to turn the data into an actionable set of insights to get the full value out of it. To do that requires an end-to-end computing solution from the car through the network and to the cloud – and strong connectivity. “When it comes to the future of driving, Intel’s commitment to our partners, the industry as a whole and our global society is to accelerate automated driving, deliver end-to-end solutions, and lead the next generation of computing transformations. Within our industry, only Intel can make and deliver upon this commitment because of our comprehensive and unparalleled technology portfolio – developed through acquisition and innovation,” Krzanich concludes.

HOMELAND SECURITY AND CYBER CONFERENCE The fourth Israel HLS and Cyber 2016 International Conference, which took place last week at the Tel Aviv Convention Center, was organized by the Economy and Industry Ministry and the Israel Export Institute. The national cyber directorate in the Prime Minister’s Office, the Foreign Ministry, the defense export control agency, the Public Security Ministry and the Airports Authority also took part in the conference. Over 1,700 participants from abroad, who are key players in the fields of homeland security (HLS) and cyber security, contributed to the event, along with 160 Israeli companies, including Elbit, IAI, and Check Point Software Technologies. “We’ve registered a record number of participants from overseas this year at the HLS and Cyber Conference,” said Amit Lang, director general of the Economy and Industry Ministry. “This reinforces the fact that Israel is a technological giant in homeland and cyber security. “Israel has more exports than any other country, even though its population is significantly smaller. Even in the relatively young field of cyber security, Israel exports account for 5% of the global cyber market. “The hard work carried out by economic attachés abroad have resulted in the strengthening of the connection between Israeli hi-tech companies with global enterprises and has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in business transactions. We will continue to do everything in our power to help strengthen Israel’s interaction with global markets,” Lang said. At the HLS and Cyber Conference companies displayed innovative products in the fields of cyber security, intelligence, counter-terrorism, law enforcement, aviation security, protecting critical energy infrastructure, water, oil, gas, management and emergency preparedness, first responders and smart cities.

HP has reinvented the professional workstation — again — with the announcement of the world’s first mini workstation at Autodesk University 2016 in Las Vegas tonight. First to market with the small form factor (SFF) workstation in 2010 and again with the all-in-one workstation in 2012, the computing giant has forged yet another new product category with the HP Z2 Mini, designed for users of CAD and other compute-intensive applications. Last week in Ft. Collins, Colorado, HP hosted myself and one other journalist for an exclusive "VIP tour" behind the scenes of its workstation R&D facility and an advance unveiling of the newest member of the Z Workstations family. Measuring a mere 8.5” x 8.5” x 2.3”, the HP Z2 Mini is ten times smaller than a traditional tower workstation and weighs in starting at 4.5 lb. It is twice as powerful as any commercial mini PC on the market today, according to HP, and can support six displays right out of the box. Shorter than a cup of espresso, the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation is capable of designing anything from state-of-the-art electronics to home and office buildings. System Configuration The HP Z2 Mini runs on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro or Linux and comes equipped with Intel Xeon E3-1200v5 or Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processors as well as optional NVIDIA professional graphics and HP Z Turbo Drive for speedy large-file handling. It is equipped with two SODIMM memory slots, one 2.5” internal drive bay, and one M.2 PCIe expansion slot. Graphics and displays. Intel integrated graphics come standard; the new NVIDIA Quadro M620 2GB discrete mobile workstation GPU is an available option. Dual monitors are possible via the integrated graphics, plus an additional four via the optional GPU, for a total of six possible monitors.   Wolf in sheep’s clothing: The new HP Z2 Mini looks unassuming but packs the power of a full-size workstation. Ports and physical security. On the side, the Z2 Mini has two USB 3.0 ports (one charging); on the back, it has two USB 3.0 and two USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C ports and one audio line in. A mounting sleeve is available to attach the unit to the back of a monitor, the underside of a desktop, a wall, or other location. For locations where this portable unit might walk off, an optional Kensington Security Slot allows for physically locking the unit in place, and a steel enclosure is available that can be padlocked and can block access to USB ports if desired. Short in stature, the HP Z2 Mini isn’t short on ports. When Other Workstations Just Won’t Do HP Z2 Mini designed for what HP sees as the workspace (and the worker) of the future and aims to covert the 42% of designers who still are not using a professional workstation, according to HP. Several trends drove development: Computer performance needs are increasing as CAD users move from 2D to 3D design. Workflows can’t afford downtime so hardware reliability is a must. Desk space is shrinking — in fact, HP reports a 60% space reduction per person in the United States over the past ten years. Workspaces are cluttered on the desktop (38% of users have two or more displays, according to HP, and floor space tends to be crowded, hot, and dirty). Users want attractive products, even when it comes to a computer chassis. According to HP, design is the No. 2 concern among end users; 52% of millennials believe design is important when choosing a PC.      “We realized that we needed to reinvent what it meant to be a workstation," said Josh Peterson, director, worldwide product management, HP Z Workstations. The new model offers more than three times the graphics performance of an HP business-class mini PC, is 63% quieter even when running at a heavy load, and has had three times the quality testing —368,000 hours total. It is ISV certified for more than 20 critical applications, including most Autodesk and Adobe software as well as SOLIDWORKS, the company reported. Everything that goes into an HP Z Workstation is scrutinized and pushed beyond its limits in the R&D labs in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Top left: Paul Mazurkiewicz, Distinguished Technologist, HP Z Workstations and Thin Clients R&D, demonstrates an x-ray machine used in failure analysis in the Material Science Lab. “This lets us see inside complex designs without taking them apart [and risk destroying the cause of the failure].” Mazurkiewicz’s lab also includes an electron microscope, thermal analysis tools, an infrared spectrometer, and many other high-tech devices that analyze and test the material makeup and performance of components and surfaces. “We trust but verify” the specs of plastic products provided by third parties, Mazurkiewicz said. “We want to ensure long life and good looks over time.” Top right: The 3D Graphics Test Lab looks for issues related to integration with other system hardware and software. Across the aisle, the Mass Storage and RAID Test Lab assesses memory reliability and performance. Heather Volesky, Motherboard Expert Engineer for HP Z Workstations, said, “We’ll take issues back to a vendor to resolve before we put them on the approved vendor list. We’re very demanding of our suppliers because our customers are very demanding of us.” Bottom left: Volesky demonstrates one of 28 ovens in the Hardware Test Lab that test heat, electricity, and other product tolerances and overall quality; other machinery there tests impact, shock, and vibration resistance. Bottom right: An inspirational poster in the R&D lab sums up the attitudes of those who work there.   Groundbreaking Design The HP Z2 Mini was a design feat as much as an engineering one. The octagonal HP Z2 Mini, the company claims, is the most uniquely designed system in the company’s 35-year workstation history. Like a mobile workstation, the Z2 Mini packs a lot of powerful (and power-hungry) components into a small space, requiring high-end cooling capabilities. Fans are custom designed, and vents are designed into all four corners of the unit, each with a guard to prevent air-flow blockage should it be inadvertently pushed against or covered by something. The front panel pops off to provide access to machine components, including a fan that swings up to reveal system memory. Lead designer Paul Drew said his team aimed for a design that conveys “luxury” — a premium look and feel — with black chrome on the vents and a surface inside the vent guards “that reflects light onto the chrome and gives it sparkle. “When you express the function visually, it’s usually beautiful,” Drew said. HP has a reputation for listening to its workstation users, and brainstorming with customers resulted in several key design moves. For example, the system features remote power-on using any keystroke or mouse click from as far away as 30 ft. It also is mountable behind a monitor to save desk space. Peterson explained, “This came out of brainstorming about what customers give up and what they gain when the unit is mounted behind the display. Customers identified this need, then HP engineers figured out how to solve for it."   The new HP Z2 Mini workstation mounted behind a dual-monitor setup.   “If we had we not shared our plans with customers, we might not have identified this," Peterson added. “We also moved power button from back to front [to make it more accessible]. We wanted front to be clean but made the change in the interest of customers.” The Z2 Mini will inevitably lure away many users of the HP Z1 all-in-one and SFF workstations; approximately 80% of SFF users could obtain a comparable configuration with the Z2 Mini. But, “We’re committed for now to supporting development of the SFF” as well as the Z1, said Jeff Wood, vice-president and general manager, Workstations and Thin Clients. “Right now the Z2 is as small as we can go,” Wood added. “To go any smaller would require the components to produce less heat. It took six years [to evolve from the original HP Z desktop workstations to the Z2 Mini] so we don’t see getting any smaller in the near future.” Pricing and Availability Covered by HP’s standard three-year workstation warranty, the HP Z2 Mini is expected to be available worldwide in December starting at $699.   About the Author: Nancy Spurling Johnson E-mail Nancy Spurling Johnson About Nancy Spurling Johnson See contents by Nancy Spurling Johnson Note: Comments are moderated and will appear live after approval by the site moderator.

The two versions of the handset have different modems inside, one of which is dramatically faster than the other. Apple's iPhone is famous for being universal – aside from colour and storage, every device is effectively identical. With the iPhone 7, Apple dual-sourced a critical component though. Some handsets have a wireless modem from Qualcomm while others come with one from Intel. The difference here is more important than in other dual-sourced components. The Qualcomm chip outperforms its Intel rival considerably, offering 600Mbps download speeds. In contrast, Intel's offering provides 450Mbps. Both theoretical transfer rates are very high but Qualcomm's X12 has a clear edge overall. Apple supplied the Qualcomm-equipped iPhone 7 to Verizon while the Intel ones are being sold to AT&T. According to the spec sheet, handsets bought from Verizon should offer noticeably faster transfers under test conditions. In practice, this isn't happening, according to reports from Bloomberg and Recode on Friday. Apple appears to have deliberately limited the faster Qualcomm chip's top speed so it matches the performance of its lesser Intel rival. Testing of the two models by Twin Prime revealed the Qualcomm modem is being throttled significantly. It still outperforms the Intel version but is being limited from reaching its full potential. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7, powered by the same modem, it's clear that Apple has tweaked Verizon's iPhone 7 to reduce the performance discrepancies with the AT&T model. Additional testing by Cellular Insights presented the same results. iPhone 7 modem performance - Qualcomm vs Intel vs Qualcomm Samsung Galaxy S7 [Image via Bloomberg / Twin Prime] Twin Prime / Bloomberg "The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities," said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime to Bloomberg. "I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip." In reality, no mobile network user is ever going to see speeds anywhere near 450Mbps, even with optimum wireless conditions. The throttling won't be noticed by customers during regular handset use. Its presence suggests Apple still needs every iPhone to operate identically, even with different, superior hardware, on the U.S. networks. "It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product," Insinet analyst Jeff Kvaal commented to Bloomberg. Apple has aimed to regulate performance to maintain consumers' perception of each phone being the same. It doesn't want customers to give different models individual reputations as this could lead to it losing its image of providing consistent, reliable performance. However, the move has already been criticised by some owners who believe they've bought devices which don't fulfil their potential. "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing," Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said to Bloomberg. "In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models."

It is Intel's first consumer SSD with 3D NAND and it is by far the most affordable NVMe SSD: current pricing is on par with mid-range SATA SSDs. While most other consumer PCIe SSDs have been enthusiast-oriented products aiming to deliver the highest performance possible, the Intel 600p merely attempts to break the speed limits of SATA without breaking the bank. The Intel SSD 600p has almost nothing in common with Intel's previous NVMe SSD for consumers (the Intel SSD 750). Where the Intel SSD 750 uses Intel's in-house enterprise SSD controller with consumer-oriented firmware, the Intel 600p uses a third-party controller. The SSD 600p is a M.2 PCIe SSD with peak power consumption only slightly higher than the SSD 750's idle. By comparison, the Intel SSD 750 is a high power and high performance drive that comes in PCIe expansion card and 2.5" U.2 form factors, both with sizable heatsinks.  Intel SSD 600p Specifications Comparison   128GB 256GB 512GB 1TB Form Factor single-sided M.2 2280 Controller Intel-customized Silicon Motion SM2260 Interface PCIe 3.0 x4 NAND Intel 384Gb 32-layer 3D TLC SLC Cache Size 4 GB 8.5 GB 17.5 GB 32 GB Sequential Read 770 MB/s 1570 MB/s 1775 MB/s 1800 MB/s Sequential Write (SLC Cache) 450 MB/s 540 MB/s 560 MB/s 560 MB/s 4KB Random Read (QD32) 35k IOPS 71k IOPS 128.5k IOPS 155k IOPS 4KB Random Write (QD32) 91.5k IOPS 112k IOPS 128k IOPS 128k IOPS Endurance 72 TBW 144 TBW 288 TBW 576 TBW Warranty 5 years The Intel SSD 600p is our first chance to test Silicon Motion's SM2260 controller, their first PCIe SSD controller. Silicon Motion's SATA SSD controllers have built a great reputation for being affordable, low power and providing good mainstream performance. One key to the power efficiency of Silicon Motion's SATA SSD controllers is their use of an optimized single core ARC processor (via Synopsys), but in order to meet the SM2260's performance target, Silicon Motion has finally switched to a dual core ARM processor. The controller chip used on the SSD 600p has some customizations specifically for Intel and bears both Intel and SMI logos. The 3D TLC NAND used on the Intel SSD 600p is the first generation 3D NAND co-developed with Micron. We've already evaluated Micron's Crucial MX300 with the same 3D TLC and found it to be a great mainstream SATA SSD. The MX300 was unable to match the performance of Samsung's 3D TLC NAND as found in the 850 EVO, but the MX300 is substantially cheaper and remarkably power efficient, both in comparison to Samsung's SSDs and to other SSDs that use the same controller as the MX300 but planar NAND. Intel uses the same 3D NAND flash die for its MLC and TLC parts. The MLC configuration that has not yet found its way to the consumer SSD market has a capacity of 256Gb (32GB) per die, which gives the TLC configuration a capacity of 384Gb (48GB). Micron took advantage of this odd size to offer the MX300 in non-standard capacities, but for the SSD 600p Intel is offering normal power of two capacities with large fixed size SLC write caches in the spare area. The ample spare area also allows for a write endurance rating of about 0.3 drive writes per day for the duration of the five year warranty. Intel 3D TLC NAND, four 48GB dies for a total of 192GB per package The Intel SSD 600p shares its hardware with two other Intel products: the SSD Pro 6000p for business client computing and the SSD E 6000p for the embedded and IoT market. The Pro 6000p is the only one of the three to support encryption and Intel's vPro security features. The SSD 600p relies on the operating system's built-in NVMe driver and Intel's consumer SSD Toolbox software which was updated in October to support the 600p. For this review, the primary comparisons will not be against high-end NVMe drives but against mainstream SATA SSDs, as these are ultimately the closest to 'mid-to-low range' NVMe as we can get. The Crucial MX300 has given us a taste of what the Intel/Micron 3D TLC can do, and it is currently one of the best value SSDs on the market. The Samsung 850 EVO is very close to the Intel SSD 600p in price and sets the bar for the performance the SSD 600p needs to provide in order to be a good value. Because the Intel SSD 600p is targeting a more mainstream audience and more modest level of performance than most other M.2 PCIe SSDs, I have additionally tested its performance in the M.2 slot built in to the testbed's ASUS Z97 Pro motherboard. In this configuration the SSD 600p is limited to a PCIe 2.0 x2 link, as compared to the PCIe 3.0 x4 link that is available during the ordinary testing process where an adapter is used in the primary PCIe x16 slot. This extra set of results does not include power measurements but may be more useful to desktop users who are considering adding a cheap NVMe SSD to an older but compatible existing system.

POST A COMMENT 63 Comments View All Comments vFunct - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link These would be great for server applications, if I could find PCIe add-in cards that have 4x M.2 slots. I'd love to be able to stick 10 or 100 or so of these in a server, as an image/media store. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link You should call intel to let them know they are marketing it in the wrong segment LOL Reply ddriver - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link To clarify, this product is evidently the runt of the nvme litter. For regular users, it is barely faster than sata devices. And once it runs out of cache, it actually gets slower than a sata device. Based on its performance and price, I won't be surprised if its reliability is just as subpar. Putting such a device in a server is like putting a drunken hobo in a Lamborghini. Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link Assuming a media storage server scenario, you'd be looking at write once and read many where the cache issues aren't going to pose a significant problem to performance. Using an array of them would also mitigate much of that write performance using some form of RAID. Of course that applies to SATA devices as well, but there's a density advantange realized in NVMe. Reply vFunct - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link bingo. Now, how can I pack a bunch of these in a chassis? Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link I'd think the best answer to that would be a custom motherboard with the appropriate slots on it to achieve high storage densities in a slim (maybe something like a 1/2 1U rackmount) chassis. As for PCIe slot expansion cards, there's a few out there that would let you install 4x M.2 SSDs on a PCIe slot, but they'd add to the cost of building such a storage array. In the end, I think we're probably a year or three away from using NVMe SSDs in large storage arrays outside of highly customized and expensive solutions for compaines that have the clout to leverage something that exotic. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link So are you going to make that custom motherboard for him, or will he be making it for himself? While you are at it, you may also want to make a cpu with 400 pcie lanes so that you can connect those 100 lousy budget p600s. Because I bet the industry isn't itching to make products for clueless and moneyless dummies. There is already a product that's unbeatable for media storage - an 8tb ultrastar he8. As ssd for media storage - that makes no sense, and a 100 of those only makes a 100 times less sense :D Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link "So are you going to make that..." Sure, okay. Reply Samus - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link ddriver, you are ignoring his specific application when judging his solution to be wrong. For imaging, sequential throughput is all that matters. I used to work part time in PC refurbishing for education and we built a bench to image 64 PC's at a time over 1Gbe with a dual 10Gbe fiber backbone to a server using, which was at the time the best option on the market, an OCZ RevoDrive PCIe SSD. Even this drive was crippled by a single 10Gbe connection let alone dual 10Gbe connections, which is why we eventually installed TWO of them in RAID 1. This hackjob configuration allowed imaging 60+ PC's simultaneously over GBe in about 7 minutes when booting via PXE, running a diskpart script and imagex to uncompress a sysprep'd image. The RevoDrive's were not reliable. One would fail like clockwork almost annually, and eventually in 2015 after I had left I heard they fell back to a pair of Plextor M2 2280's in a PCIe x4 adapter for better reliability. It was, and still is, however, very expensive to do this compared to what the 600p is offering. Any high-throughput sequential reading application would greatly benefit from the performance and price the 600p is offering, not to mention Intel has class leading reliability in the SSD sector of 0.3%/year failure rate according to their own internal 2014 data...there is no reason to think of all companies Intel won't keep reliability as a high priority. After all, they are still the only company to mastermind the Sandforce 2200, a controller that had incredibly high failure rates across every other vendor and effectively lead to OCZ's bankruptcy. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link So how does all this connect to, and I quote, "stick 10 or 100 or so of these in a server, as an image/media store"? Also, he doesn't really have "his specific application", he just spat a bunch of nonsense he believed would be cool :D Lastly, next time try multicasting, this way you can simultaneously send data to 64 hosts at 1 gbps without the need for dual 10gbit or an uber expensive switch, achieving full parallelism and an effective 64 gbps. In that case a regular sata ssd or even an hdd would have sufficed as even mechanical drives have no problem saturating the 1 gbps lines you to the targets. You could have done the same work, or even better, at like 1/10 of the cost. You could even do 1000 system at a time, or as many as you want, just daisy chain more switches, terabit, petabit effective cumulative bandwidth is just as easily achievable.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 22, 2016 at 8:10AM Technology news website BenchLife.info just posted a substantial amount of information about the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors that are set to power most of the desktop computers sold in 2018.  Image source: Intel. It'd be hard to blame investors for not being enthusiastic about new desktop processors, as the market for them has been in a freefall for years. According to Statista, desktop personal computer shipments are set to plunge from 157 million units in 2010 to just 103.3 million units in 2016. That's more than 34% of the industry's shipment volume gone in just six years.  This shouldn't be too surprising. After all, laptop computers, as well as other portable forms of computing, such as tablets and large smartphones, have increasingly replaced desktop computers for many core computing needs.  Nevertheless, even after a sharp decline in industrywide unit shipments, sales of desktop processors are still a large portion of Intel's business, good for around $10 billion in annual revenue. For some perspective, this sub-segment of Intel's business would have easily been one of the top 10 chip companies in the world by revenue in 2015, according to IHS's ranking of semiconductor companies by revenue.  The sheer size of this business and its importance to Intel's overall financial performance makes it worthwhile to follow.  Without further ado, let's take a closer look at what BenchLife reported about Intel's 2018 desktop processor plans. Meet Coffee Lake -- again In January, Intel is set to release new desktop personal computer processors based on an architecture it refers to as Kaby Lake. Numerous reports over the past couple of months have said that Intel's follow-on architecture to Kaby Lake for the desktop personal computer market is called Coffee Lake.  Coffee Lake is also widely reported to be manufactured in some variant of Intel's mature 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. Intel is expected to begin mass-producing some of its products on a newer 10-nanometer technology in the second half of 2017. According to information that Intel accidentally made public on its website, Coffee Lake-based chips were also referred to as Cannon Lake. This suggested that although the Coffee Lake chips wouldn't enjoy the benefits associated with being built using Intel's 10-nanometer technology, they'd at least incorporate more advanced architectures. The architecture of a chip plays a large role in the kind of performance and power efficiency that it can deliver -- that's why chip companies invest so much money in the research and development of newer, better architectures.  A few days ago, a rumor popped up suggesting that this wouldn't be the case, with Intel instead opting to leave the core architecture of the prior-generation Kaby Lake unchanged in moving to Coffee Lake. The leaks from BenchLife confirm that rumor. BenchLife also says that Coffee Lake for desktop computers is on track for a February 2018 launch -- a little over a year after when Kaby Lake for desktops is expected to arrive.  What's the point, then? Coffee Lake's existence might look odd if Intel isn't making any architectural changes relative to the prior-generation Kaby Lake. However, Intel seems to be relying on other tricks to boost performance this time around.  The BenchLife leaks show that the desktop versions of Coffee Lake will come in two variants. The first will be what Intel calls a "6+2" configuration, meaning six processor cores paired with GT2 graphics. This will presumably take the place of the quad-core Kaby Lake processor in terms of pricing and market positioning.  The second will come in a 4+2 configuration, meaning that it will have four processor cores and GT2 graphics. That's identical to the configuration of the top Kaby Lake desktop part.  My suspicion is that the quad-core Coffee Lake will deliver better performance than the quad-core Kaby Lake primarily through improved manufacturing technology, which should allow the Coffee Lake chips to hit higher frequencies than their Kaby Lake predecessors.  Such a move wouldn't be unprecedented. The upcoming desktop-bound Kaby Lake parts share largely the same architecture with their predecessors, called Skylake. The main improvement from Skylake to Kaby Lake is that the latter family uses a higher-performance version of Intel's 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+, to enable higher frequencies in a given power envelope.  Intel's strategy in 2018? More cores It seems that Intel's desktop personal-computer strategy in 2018 is a simple one: improve performance by adding processor cores. From a marketing perspective, this seems like a reasonable move. It shouldn't be hard to sell the idea that having six cores is significantly better than having four. In fact, Intel's mainstream desktop processor lineup has featured up to just four cores for a very long time, and some might argue that it's high time for an increase in core counts across Intel's desktop processor stack. However, there are still many consumer-grade applications that struggle to take advantage of more than a handful of processor cores. That's why Intel can't rely on core count increases in the desktop personal-computer market indefinitely. Post-Coffee Lake, Intel will have to get back to finding ways to improve the performance and power efficiency of its individual cores. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Disney has made a number of announcements over the past several days, with press events happening on both coasts, and with the D23 Destination D event taking place in Walt Disney World this past weekend. The Disney D23 Destination D Amazing Adventures event was held November 18-20 at Disney's Contemporary Resorts. Our Alan S. Dalinka provided extensive coverage for MousePlanet on Twitter and Facebook and will provide a recap later this week. Photo by Alan S. Dalinka. In this update I'll recap the major changes that were announced during Destination D, as well as share new announcements that were made after the event ended. Our Alan Dalinka worked tirelessly to bring you live coverage throughout the weekend, including video interviews with Disney managers, executives, and even a few Disney Legends. If you haven't had a chance to catch up via our Facebook or Twitter accounts, it's well worth spending a coffee break to see everything you missed. So if the conversation over Thanksgiving dinner gets a little awkward this year, just change the subject to one of the many, many changes planned for Walt Disney World over the coming weeks, months and years. Disney's marketing team has certainly given fans a lot to discuss this week. New 4-Park Magic Ticket offer Disney's new 4-Park Magic Ticket is a good sampler ticket for first-time Walt Disney World visitors, or people willing to trade a little flexibility for savings of up to 14% off their admission costs. The ticket is $279 for visitors ages 10 and older, $259 for ages 3-9, and includes four separate days of admission, one to each of the four Walt Disney World theme parks: One day of admission to Magic Kingdom One day of admission to Epcot One day of admission to Disney's Animal Kingdom One day of admission to Disney's Hollywood Studios Compared to the regular $325 / $305 price for a four-day, 1-park-per-day ticket, this promotional offer can save a family of four up to $184, which could definitely pay for some popcorn and ice cream bars. The trade-off comes in the form of flexibility, and the ability to skip a less desireable park—like Disney's Hollywood Studios, which has a large number of attraction closures due to the Star Wars Land construction—in favor of another day at the Magic Kingdom or Epcot. The ticket can not be used for admission to the same theme park more than one day, and does not include park-hopper benefits. The tickets can be purchased now through March 5, 2017, but are subject to the following blockout dates: December 17, 2016 through January 2, 2017 April 10 through April 21, 2017 There is a 14-day fuse on this ticket, and all four admissions must be used within 14 days of the first use, or by May 26, 2017, whichever comes first. The ticket must be used by the same person on all four days. Starbright Holidays - An Intel Collaboration After receiving FAA clearance just weeks ago, Disney premiered its new "Starbright Holidays-An Intel Collaboration" show over Village Lake at Disney Springs last week, making use of 300 "Intel® Shooting Star show drones. There is no admission charge to see the show and it is scheduled to be shown twice nightly through the Holiday season. Photo by Alan S. Dalinka. What happens when Disney releases 300 drones into the nighttime skies above Disney Springs? The resulting show is called "Starbright Holidays - An Intel Collaboration," and our Alan Dalinka was at the first public performance of the show during a media preview last week. The video below is from that first performance, and was shared live on our Facebook page. If you don't already follow us on Facebook, be sure to like our page so you can receive notifications of future live events as we bring them to you from Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Starbright Holidays - An Intel Collaboration. MousePlanet video by Alan S. Dalinka. The new show officially debuted Sunday, November 20, and is currently scheduled to be presented twice each night at 7:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. through January 8. Starbright Holidays uses 300 Intel Shooting Star show drones to carry aloft the LED lights used in the show, which Disney terms "Flixels." Each LED can produce more than four billion color combinations. This show is the largest entertainment use of the drones in the United States. "Starbright Holidays - An Intel Collaboration" can be best viewed on the West Side of Disney Springs. Cabanas of Tomorrow Private cabanas are a common feature at high-end pool and beach resorts, and three Walt Disney World Resort hotels offer the added-cost option at their own pools. You can also rent a cabana at the WDW water parks, and on the Disney Cruise Line. But thanks to a new program just introduced at the Magic Kingdom, you can now rent a private cabana on the edge of Tomorrowland. White tents recently constructed in Tomorrowland are the new Kingdom Cabanas, which can be rented for $650 per day. Photo by Alan S. Dalinka. These new Magic Kingdom cabanas are really just white tents constructed near Space Mountain. Each provides a private seating area for up to eight guests. The full-day rental includes a secure storage locker for personal belongings; a beverage cooler stocked with water and soft drinks; a supply of sunscreen and insect repellent; a fruit bowl and snacks; and outlets for recharging electronic devices. Cabana guests are attended to by a team of cabana hosts, who can provide assistance with dining reservations, and who will arrange for delivery of ice cream novelties or popcorn during the day. The cabana hosts can also arrange for access to reserved viewing for parades and fireworks. And of course, each cabana guest receives their own pair of personalized Mickey Mouse ears. The cost for this private retreat is a mere $650, plus tax. The cabanas can be reserved by calling (407) WDW-PLAY or (407) 939-7529, or through the concierge desk at any Walt Disney World Resort Hotel. While the idea of a private retreat inside the theme parks does sound tempting, and there are no doubt clients for whom $650 is a nominal amount to pay for some midday privacy, these cabanas really seem to be the wrong way to go about offering it. A more attractive (at least to this writer) option would be something like a private airport lounge or club, offering an indoor, air-conditioned place to sit down away from the heat and noise of the theme parks. A nicely themed lounge would seem much more in keeping with the Disney spirit than an out-of-place tent in the middle of Tomorrowland of all places. (If it has to be a tent, why not set up the campsite in Adventureland where there could be some pretense given to theming?) I can't dispute that the demand for such a retreat may exist, but there has to be a much more attractive and immersive way to provide it to a client willing to pay for it. Magic Band 2.0 If you've ever looked at your current MagicBand and said, "gosh, I really wish this thing was a whole lot bigger," your wish is about to be granted. Attendees at last week's D23 Destination D event were the first to try out the brand-new Magic Band 2.0 device for themselves, and learn about the new features and options available with the latest update to Disney's wearable technology. Disney unveiled the new MagicBand 2 at Destination D this past weekend. They feature a new removable contact point that can be inserted into other wearables (keychains and the like) that will be sold in the future. They will be rolled out to new Annual Passholders starting in December (and renewals), followed by Resort Guests and then sales and customizable will also begin. Photo by Alan S. Dalinka. As described by Alan Dalinka, the MagicBand 2.0 is both larger but also a little more comfortable than the original MagicBand device. The major difference is that all of the electronics for the device are now contained in a central "puck," known as a TouchPoint, which can be removed from the wristband and placed into other holders. More on this later. The result is that the wires and antenna which were previously incorporated into the wristband are absent from the new version, which results in a thinner, more flexible band and strap. That's the good news. The bad news is that the TouchPoint makes the face of MagicBand 2.0 much wider than the original, and it is sized more like a mens watch than a ladies watch. However, more good news is that the TouchPoint can be removed from the wristband entirely and installed into a variety of MagicKeeper devices (each sold separately, of course), which will allow you to wear the critical TouchPoint component on a keychain, lanyard or clipped to a carabineer. For those who could never get used to wearing the device on their wrist, or who already wear a watch or other wristband and didn't like to have multiple bands on their arm, this will provide a much more pleasant MagicBand experience. If you already have and love an original MagicBand, there's no reason to throw yours out. You can continue to use your existing MagicBand devices until their batteries wear out, which can be two to three years according to Disney. Disney plans to start issuing the new Magic Band to new Walt Disney World annual passholders sometime in December, and will also begin mailing the MagicBand 2.0 in mid-December, to visitors who are travelling to Walt Disney World for January vacations. It's possible that runners traveling to Orlando for the 2017 Walt Disney World marathon weekend may be among the first large travel segment to receive the new version of the MagicBand. Once the basic MagicBand 2.0 is in general distribution, look for the MagicKeepers and customizable MagicBand options to show up at shops around Walt Disney World. And as always, if you have old MagicBand devices that you no longer use or want, you can return them to any Walt Disney World Resort Hotel front desk to be recycled. They are considered eWaste due to the electrical components contained within, and should not be thrown into your household trash. Epcot International Festival of the Arts Epcot is adding yet another Festival to its annual calendar, and soon the only break between the seasonal events will be the days needed to transition the various marketplaces from one theme to the next. The Epcot International Festival of the Arts debuts January 13 through February 20, 2017 at Walt Disney World, bringing visual and performing arts together with yet another justification for a food festival. For this debut year, the International Festival of the Arts runs weekends only, with events on Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week. The schedule of events has not yet been announced, and will likely be released in dibs and dabs in the weeks leading up to the festival, but one highlight already promised is a Disney on Broadway concert series at the America Gardens Theatre stage. A number of Broadway stars got their start working in Disney theme parks, and of course Disney musical productions like "The Lion King" and "Newsies" have set records on Broadway. This concert series is full of potential, and may prove to be even more of a draw than the visual and culinary art elements. Pandora – The World of Avatar opens Summer 2017 Another big announcement from last week's D23 Destination D event was a more specific opening season for Pandora – The World of Avatar, currently under construction at Disney's Animal Kingdom park. The new land is now slated to open in summer, 2017. During the event, Disney released additional concept art from Pandora, and a very brief video of the Na'vi Shaman animatronic from the Na'vi River Journey attraction. And while not directly related to Pandora, Alan had an opportunity to chat for a few moments with Marty Sklar about the evolution of special effects and animatronics in theme parks, and it's interesting to hear his perspective in light of the major advances evidenced by the new Shaman figure.

Pandora - The World of AVATAR will bring a variety of new experiences to Disney's Animal Kingdom, including a family-friendly attraction called Na'vi River Journey. The adventure begins as guests set out in canoes and venture down a mysterious, sacred river hidden within the bioluminescent rainforest. The full beauty of Pandora reveals itself as the canoes pass by exotic glowing plants and amazing creatures. The journey culminates in an encounter with a Na'vi shaman, who has a deep connection to the life force of Pandora and sends positive energy out into the forest through her music.

ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex Events Check here to see if a sporting competition might fall during your next trip to the Walt Disney World Resort.

By wdwchuck on Tue, 22 Nov 2016 10:57:42 -0800 I still think it is hilarious that an anti American consumerism screed like Avatar is getting a place inside the biggest shrine to American consumerism there is, WDW. There must have been a hundred better movies they could have built up into a land? By Dave1313 on Tue, 22 Nov 2016 11:03:18 -0800 Can't believe those "cabanas" in Tomorrowland. I realize they are probably sort of out of the way in that corner between space and Buzz, but still. Those just look so out of place I can't even come up with words. By carolinakid on Tue, 22 Nov 2016 12:47:46 -0800 I can't decide whether they remind me more of a tail gate tent party or a refugee camp.

Black Friday will be the perfect opportunity to pick up a 4K TV at a healthy discount, but it's not just TVs that have embraced 4K resolutions; monitors have, too. However, you may be surprised to find that owning a 4K monitor doesn't necessarily mean you can watch 4K content on your PC. And in the case of Netflix, chances are you probably can't. This week, Netflix and Microsoft are rolling out support for 4K streaming on Windows 10. But your current PC, however powerful, probably won't be compatible. As The Verge points out, in order for Netflix 4K streams to work you're going to need Intel's latest 7th-gen Kaby Lake processor. You'll also need to watch using Microsoft's Edge browser. Such restrictions may seem overly harsh, but it's not just Netflix that imposed them. The blame also lies with Hollywood. Netflix uses the 10-bit HEVC video-compression standard, also known as H.265, and Hollywood insists on DRM wrapped around its content. H.265 is a successor to the widely used H.264 video-compression standard. It offers double the data compression rate of H.264 while retaining the same video quality, or much higher quality video at the same compression. So you can see why Netflix embraced it. Any platform wishing to play H.265 content requires hardware decoding support. Intel's Kaby Lake processors are the first to offer full hardware acceleration support for encoding and decoding. Older processors can decode the streams, but in order to do so they use significantly higher CPU utilization and therefore power. Kaby Lake offers the required power efficiency missing from previous Intel chips as well as 10-bit HEVC support. Related Netflix Considers Offline Streaming Netflix Considers Offline Streaming The Microsoft Edge requirement is due to the use of digital rights management (DRM) to protect the streams from being recorded and copied. Edge fully supports this protection. Intel's Kaby Lake processors are not widely available yet, making streaming Netflix at 4K on your Windows 10 PC a very niche appeal right now. There's also much easier ways to unlock 4K Netflix streaming using a dedicated streaming device. Your 4K TV may already support it, and if not, then devices including the Chromecast Ultra, Roku 4, and Xbox One S are among a growing list of devices that do. Netflix publishes a regularly updated list of supported hardware.

Intel Vulkan Linux Driver Lands Cull & Clip Distance Support Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 22 November 2016 at 07:00 AM EST. 5 Comments After a number of commits landed in mainline Mesa Git in the early hours of this morning, cull and clip distance support has been enabled for the open-source Intel Vulkan "ANV" Linux driver. After work on NIR and ANV, clip and cull distance support was enabled. Following that ANV driver work was also an i965 driver change to use the NIR-based clip/cull lowering for their OpenGL driver too to benefit from using the same code-path for both drivers. This is now another feature scratched off the Intel Vulkan driver's TODO list. Missing features still to be tackled for the Intel Vulkan Linux driver are FP64, tessellation, image gather extend, storage image without format, pipeline statistic queries, sparse memory, and per-sample-dispatch / minSampleShading. There are also some conformance test suite failures still to investigate on Haswell hardware, more code sharing is possible with the OpenGL driver, and various performance optimizations. More details via the ANV TODO list. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

This is an exclusive Microsoft Edge feature for Netflix subscribers on a Windows 10 PC or 2-in-1 device. Ruiz-Hopper couldn’t make this announcement without a little Google Chrome bashing, of course. According to the post, Windows 10 laptop and 2-in-1 owners streaming Netflix through Microsoft Edge will have the ability to watch “at least” one more episode of Gilmore Girls on a single battery charge than if they were streaming the same content through Google’s browser. Ouch. More: What’s new on Netflix and what’s leaving in December 2016 However, there’s a catch outside the Microsoft Edge and display requirements for enjoying Netflix in 4K. Ruiz-Hopper points out that the Windows 10 device must have a seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” processor from Intel, which isn’t even revealing its new desktop CPU lineup until the end of the year. Because of this limit, there are only a handful of Windows 10 devices that quality, such as the Lenovo Yoga 910. Microsoft actually provides a list of devices that support 4K content here, but some of these don’t have a seventh-generation processor, but rather the previous “Skylake” generation of chips instead. Thus, the device may be able to handle 4K video playback, but not necessarily a 4K stream from Netflix. We can’t find an actual list of specs to go by, but Ruiz-Hopper’s blog does specifically list Intel’s seventh-generation CPUs as a 4K Netflix requirement. Customers currently looking for a new Windows 10 laptop or 2-in-1 device may want to check out Microsoft’s huge online sale starting at 12 a.m. ET on Thanksgiving Day — Thursday, November 24. Unfortunately, the Windows 10 PCs Microsoft has on sale are based on sixth-generation Intel processors: there’s no Kaby Lake in sight. Thus, consumers wanting a device right now that’s packed with a seventh-generation CPU should hunt one down with the Core i7-7Y75 or the Core i7-7500U, and a display capable of a 3,840 × 2,160 resolution on top of that. More: Where to find the best 4K content right now Those who are thinking about subscribing to Netflix and streaming its contents in 4K should take a peek at Netflix’s internet service provider (ISP) speed index for October 2016. The report provides a diagram showing which ISP delivers Netflix streams the fastest across the world, displaying the numbers for five different ISP types: Fiber, Cable, DSL, Satellite, and Wireless. Here in the United States, Bright House ranked as the No. 1 cable-based internet provider in October with an average speed of 3.66 megabits per second (Mbps). Following that service provider was Optimum (3.65Mbps), Cox (3.60Mbps), Comcast (3.57Mbps), Charter (3.54Mbps), Time Warner Cable (3.54Mbps), Mediacom (3.47Mbps), and Suddenlink (3.41Mbps). Outside the cable market, Verizon’s fiber-based FiOS service not only topped its specific category, but the entire ISP chart for October with 3.69Mbps followed by AT&T’s U-verse (3.46Mbps) and Frontier (2.94Mbps). The DSL version of Frontier ruled the DSL chart for October with AT&T, Windstream, Verizon, and CenturyLink trailing behind. Also watch: Share

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets Intel's next-gen Xeon processor has 64 CPU threads Intel's upcoming Skylake-based Xeon CPU will be available with up to 64 threads of CPU power By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Nov 22, 2016 11:02 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel has its exciting Core i7-7700K on the way early next year, arriving with the Kaby Lake architecture, but for the super-enthusiasts and workstation crowd, the upcoming Skylake-based Xeon family is where the fun really begins.     Intel's upcoming Skylake-EP Xeon E5 processor lineup is now being teased, with higher-end SKUs ready to blow not only your minds, but your wallets. The massive Skylake-EP Xeon E5-2699 V5 processor has 32 physical CPU cores, and a total of 64 threads. The previous-gen Xeon E5-2699 V4 processor had 22 physical CPU cores, and 44 threads.   We should expect the Skylake-EP processors to launch at around Computex 2017 (late May, early June next year). Intel will include their new Advanced Vector Instructions-512 that will increase floating point calculations and encryption algorithms, but the company has also integrated Omni-Parth Architecture that will see high-speed network and interconnects enjoy much higher speeds.   Intel's new LGA 3647 socket is massive, something that we revealed as a world exclusive during Computex 2016 earlier this year. The socket can support up to 12 x DDR4 DIMMs, with next-gen 6-channel memory as well as Intel's Optane DIMMs for the very best in bandwidth.

But you need a PC running a chipset not widely available yet, boo! It has been announced that it is now possible to view Netflix in 4K through Microsoft Edge on a Windows 10 PC or laptop. The only problem is that it requires a 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processor to run. Considering laptops and PCs with 7th gen chipsets are only just hitting the market (and for a pretty penny) it's more than likely you haven't got one yet. And if you are the type of person (like us) that builds your own PCs, you can't even buy Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs yet - they are currently only available to OEMs and manufacturers. Netflix review: The leading light in home entertainment How to watch Netflix on TV: Your complete guide Netflix offline viewing finally coming, before end of 2016 It's mind boggling really. Even if your PC has an Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card, Intel i7 Skylake processor and is capable of munching through GTA V in 4K, you still can't play Netflix in 4K in a browser. Still, it's a start. Maybe once it's been tried and tested for a while it'll become more widely available. It should be pointed out you will also need a 4K display and a top level Netflix subscription to access Ultra HD content, which costs £8.99 a month in the UK. You'll also need a broadband connection of at least 25Mbps. Sod it, just buy a PS4 Pro or Xbox One S.

The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' Lara O'Reilly Nov. 20, 2016, 4:09 AM 17,104 facebook linkedin twitter email print McDonald's For some brands, an audio logo is just as important as a visual one. Close your eyes, and you'll know it's an Intel ad from its famous chimes. "I'm Lovin' It" is synonymous with McDonald's. And we all know what the "Green Giant" sings. But which brands have the best-performing sound marks? Scroll down to find which brand jingles stand out from the rest amongst consumers in the US. Methodology Veritonic, a marketing analytics platform for commercial music, surveyed more than 2,600 panelists in October 2016 and asked them to listen to audio logos selected from Interbrand's Best Global Brands ranking, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P. Panelists were asked to record their emotions as the logos played and were asked about the feelings the audio evoked. They were then contacted 48 hours later to test recall of audio logos. Panelists' emotions and engagement were also tracked using Veritonic's patent-pending EchoTime technology. Each brand's overall 1-100 score in the ranking combines unaided recall, plus emotion categories including: Excited, happy, approachable, authentic, confident, empowering, innovative, likable, reputable, simple, trustworthy, and unique. View As: One Page Slides 10. T-Mobile. Overall score: 77.4. Unaided recall: 82 T-Mobile's chimes scored well for evoking happy and excited emotions. It doesn't do so well on the unaided recall front, but the mark is distinctive for people who have heard it before — giving it a high engagement score.   9. Statefarm. Overall score: 78.9. Unaided recall: 84 The insurer's beepy audio logo places scored well for "happy" (84), "excited" (74) and "simple" (72). It placed in ninth place for unaided recall, but didn't score well on the engagement metric. 8. Folgers. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 86 The Folgers jingle — "The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup" — is more than 30-years-old, having first launched in 1984. It scored well for emotions including "happy" (82), "reputable" (78), "approachable" (78), and "authentic" (78) — all the types of feelings a coffee company would be hoping to evoke from listeners. Folgers was tied in third position for unaided recall. 7. Chevy. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 88 Chevy's whistled audio mark is unusual as, unlike many other brands, it sometimes plays at the start of an ad rather than the end (although it plays at the end of the video above). The logo scores well in the "authentic" (78), "confident" (78), "approachable" (76), "trustworthy" (76) and "reputable" categories. However, it underperformed in the "excited" attribute, scoring just 68. 6. McDonald's. Overall score: 79.6. Unaided recall: 85 "I'm Lovin' It" launched globally in 2003, sung by Justin Timberlake, and it has been McDonald's ad jingle ever since. The logo scores 84 for "excited" and "82" for happy. It tied third for unaided recall. 5. Hot Pockets. Overall score: 80.5. Unaided recall: 85 Famous for the memorable microwave "ding," the sung Hot Pockets audio mark scored well for unaided recall. It was also a top performer in the "happy" (86) and "excited" (76) categories.   4. Green Giant. Overall score: 80.8. Unaided recall: 86 "Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant" has been in-market since the 1960s, giving the logo a strong unaided recall score. It scored well for "happy" (86) and "authentic" (78), however, the jingle only scored around average on "excited" (76) and lagged behind the other top scorers in terms of engagement. 3. Intel. Overall score: 82.7. Unaided recall: 88 Probably the most famous audio logo of the bunch, the Intel chimes are internationally recognized, earning them an unaided recall score of 88. Intel ties first for evoking a feeling of "innovation" (70) amongst listeners. It was also near the top of the pile on "excited" (80) and in the overall engagement metrics. 2. Farmer's Insurance. Overall score: 83.2. Unaided recall: 88 "We are Farmers! Bum ba dum bum bum bum bum." The Farmer's Insurance audio mark is a relative newcomer in this top 10, as far as on-air promotion is concerned. It's a top performer in several of the emotion scores including "trustworthiness" (74), "uniqueness" (74) and was joint top on "innovative" (70) and "empowering" (74). 1. Nationwide. Overall score: 87.2. Unaided recall: 92 Nationwide's "Nationwide is on your side" jingle has been on air for more than 50 years and is still as relevant today as it ever was, according to this study. The audio logo demonstrably leads the pack when it comes to unaided recall and was in the top decile of performers for engagement. It also scored big on "happy" (84), "excited" (76), and "simple" (74). "The speed and pattern of the responses by panelists to the audio logo demonstrates how deeply planted the audio logo has become in panelists' psyches," Veritonic writes in the report.  More: Audio Logo Features facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' For some brands, an audio logo is just as...

My main reason to upgrade is to be able to play Total War: Attila and Cities Skylines (I only Play those for a while now). My current setup is not bad as I feel it is sufficient enough to play but once the population reaches 100k in cities skylines the gameplay become undesirable., as these the games I usually play, the reason for this upgrade is in order, I can enjoy playing these games smoothly after work. Sometimes I convert videos to watch on my phone, and I like to multi-task such as playing Cities Skylines and watching Netflix on 4K. Further, my current setup is: CPU: FX-6300 @ 4.5 Mobo: Asus M5A97 R2.0 GPU: PowerColor PCS+ Radeon R9 390 8GB Ram: 2 x 8 GB Kingston KHX1600C10D3 and 2 x 2 GB Kingston 9905403-133.A00LF HDD: Samsung 850 EVO SSD CPU Cooler: Hyper 212 EVO PSU: Antec TPQ-1200 1200W I have two Options to Upgrade to: Option 1: Intel Xeon E5-1650 Six Core CPU - $100 Intel DX79TO Intel X79 chipset - $180 Total cost for Xeon system= $280 Option 2: Intel CPU Core i7 4770K - $240 ASUS Z97-A/USB 3.1 LGA 1150 Intel Z97 - $100 Total cost for I7 system= $340 I have done some calculations that are as follows: Xeon E5 1650 @ 4.6 Cinebench R15 single core score is 169 Cost: USD240 I7 4770K @ 4.6 Cinebench R15 single core score is 181 Price: USD340 The results show that the I7 4770k is 6.85% better performer than Xeon E5 1650. However, the I7 4770k system is 34.4% more expensive. Also, I am on a very limited budget as I have many commitments in the upcoming months. I need help understanding the differences as I calculated it the Xeon have better value than the I7. I am planning to get a decent cooler after a month or two. So cooling won't be an issue. Now after adding the whole cost (motherboard and ram) it made me more confused.

Hi there I just checked prices for X79 boards,those prices are crazy there, they cost lot more than Z97 or Z170 or in many cases they're expensive as X99 boards Where to find boards, check yours local Craiglist or eBay etc Those Intel boards DX79TO not sure if you can OC them as other boards I would ask this on OCN, I didn't have used X79 Hope this helps Thanks, Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11   (#7) crowncobra Newbie   Videocard: PowerColor PCS+ Radeon R9 Processor: Amd FX-6300 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Antec TPQ-1200 1200W 11-22-2016, 23:10 | posts: 6 Thank you all for your valuable advice and support . I really appreciate all your replies. The location of my job got changed today and as per the management it might change again. Now I have mobility in mind. So I decided to wait few months to save more money then I plan to get Dell Inspiron I7559-2512BLK Laptop for around USD 750 on amazon. I have no how it will perform compared to my current rig.     crowncobra View Public Profile Find all posts by crowncobra   (#8) Neo Cyrus Ancient Guru     Videocard: Gigabyte 970 G1 Processor: i7-4770K @ 4.4GHz Mainboard: ASRock Z97 Extreme6 Memory: 16GB 2400 10-12-12-31 Soundcard: ZxR + Beyerdynamic DT 990 PSU: Antec High Current 900W 11-22-2016, 23:17 | posts: 8,265 | Location: GTA, Canada If you can wait two months AMD Zen is being released.

The developer said in a statement that, as part of the association with Microsoft Accelerator, the startups selected as part of Brigade Real Estate Accelerator Programme (REAP) will benefit from Microsoft technology expertise, mentorship and access to global markets. Microsoft will also extend credits in its BizSpark programme and may provide go-to-market assistance to startups whose solutions are built on Microsoft technologies. For Intel India, the collaboration will help extend its engagement with the design community. “Startups from REAP have an opportunity to leverage the Intel India Maker lab, including infrastructure, technology, tools and mentoring support from Intel technologists that it offers,” said Jitendra Chaddah, senior director of operations and strategy at Intel India. The Intel India Maker Lab offers technical support, mentoring, networking opportunities as well as funding through collaborations to Indian startups. Brigade had launched REAP in August to mentor startups whose products and services can be used in residential real estate, office, retail or hospitality segments. Startups with capabilities in Internet of Things, nanotechnology, clean-tech and renewable, virtual and augmented reality, and logistics will be considered. The accelerator programme will also focus on firms in the B2B and B2C segment. The first batch of the programme commenced in October. The REAP team is led by Nirupa Shankar, who is also the director of Brigade Group’s hospitality division. Another top executive at REAP is John Kuruvilla, who was previously the managing director of Reliance Group’s GenNext Ventures. The REAP’s mentor-in-residence is Apul Nahata, who had set up GenNext Innovation Hub, the accelerator programme run by Reliance Industries Ltd. Like this report?

View Latest Posts >>> Secret Deep-Black War to Hijack your mind By Preston James, Ph.D on November 21, 2016 The current state of mind-kontrol is probably far beyond anything you ever imagined possible by  Preston James Note: This article is written for professional Intel and those who understand the Secret Space War program, the back engineering of recovered Alien ET technologies, and technologies obtained by treaties and exchange programs. Because VT is committed to open source Intel and believes that the public has a right to know how their taxpayer funds are being spent, especially when used to wage a secret war to hijack their mind, this information is being made available to anyone who is interested with no limitations. If you are not up to speed on this background reading, this article will probably be a waste of your time. There has been significant intercept actions to prevent this article from ever being published. It was suggested to me that I would not be able to ever complete this article or be allowed to publish it, but here it is. I must extend a big thank you to the Editors of VT who have allowed this article to be published and who are deeply committed to open source Intel, making such available to all who are interested in the truth even when it is hard to fathom.  _________ The current state of mind-kontrol is probably far beyond anything you have ever imagined possible. Mass Mind-kontrol — it’s been going on since the time of Nimrod and ancient Babylonia. And it’s sinister and evil beyond words and description. Since Roswell it has taken a new sinister turn that defies imagination. It’s what empowers the evil Cabal that has hijacked the USG and many of the governments of the world. Some insiders claim it is not of human origin. Until the recent advent of sophisticated remote psychotronic inductive entrainment technologies, mass mind-kontrol has been limited to cultural, educational and psi-powered Mind-kontrol techniques. Cultural and educational methodologies typically have included coordinated efforts to instill certain values, beliefs and attitudes into the societal mass group mind, both conscious and subconscious. The techniques taught by Edward Bernays for controlling the American Mass Mind for purposes of social control and simulated beliefs and increased sales were readily adopted by Madison Avenue advertising agencies and elements of the USG. Bernays-type methodologies predetermined values, beliefs and attitudes in members of society that caused them to carry certain beliefs and mindsets which predispose them to act in ways that are beneficial to the ruling oligarchical class. It is the oligarchical class – folks who consider themselves “elite bloodline individuals chosen to rule over the masses” – who make certain that the educational and religious systems are instilled in this desired group mind set. _________ No real academic freedom exists in American Universities, so don’t expect scientists to help you figure out how your mind is being attacked psychotronically. Despite the illusion of academic freedom in America’s universities, there is none. No classes are ever taught on how the Federal Reserve System is illegal and unconstitutional and how it charges us pernicious usury to use what should have been our own money in the first place. Or that the FRS stole all the US Gold and now replaced real US Dollars with paper debt notes backed by nothing but requiring repayment. Nor does any American University teach that 9-11-01 was a false-flag attack done by the JCS, USAF, NORAD, and the FAA using PNACers, top NeoCons, and Mossad. Doubt this statement that there is no academic freedom in academia in America? Just ask one of VT’s own Editors Dr. Kevin Barrett, or Professor James Tracy, both of whom were illegally and unconstitutionally fired by RKM educational policies adopted by the dupes in charge of faculty. Nor does any American University teach or allow any classes regarding Sandy Hook having been a two-day DHS/FEMA Capstone drill where nobody at all died, or that Adam Lanza never existed, but was a fake construct. The book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook is now a free .pdf download (starts at page 4). Public and private education is designed and deployed to lead We The People away from truth and to instill values, beliefs and attitudes that make it easier for the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) to maintain rule over us, keep us their secret serfs, and asset strip us blind, until America the Republic is destroyed from within. Members of the Warren Commission present their report on the assassination of JFK. L-R: John McCloy, J. Lee Rankin (General Counsel), Senator Richard Russell, Congressman Gerald Ford, Chief Justice Earl Warren, Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson, Allen Dulles, Senator John Sherman Cooper, and Congressman Hale Boggs. Warren Commission member Gerald Ford pressed the panel to change its description of the bullet wound in President Kennedy’s back and place it higher to make “the magic bullet” theory plausible, thereby enabling the Warren Commission to conclude that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman. Ford was J. Edgar Hoover’s informant on the commission and did the FBI director’s bidding to squelch the investigation from naming other assassins. (Photo credit: LBJ Library photo by Cecil Stoughton) The Major Mass Media News Cartel is still lying in lockstep about the JFK Assassination. If you doubt the ability of the RKM’s Crime Cabal, which runs the USG, to control the Major Mass Media to keep the American Mass Mind filled with blatant lies, just consider how, over 50 years later, all the Major Mass Media Broadcast news are still claiming that Oswald assassinated JFK and was a “lone-nut” assassin. Of course, surveys now show that 60-80% of the American People do not believe this at all, and instead many believe that the CIA, using Op40, did it and it was a major America Coup d’Etat involving GHWB, LBJ, J. Edgar Hoover, General Landsdale, General Lemnitzer, Allan Dulles and many more. When you create and control all the money you want, you can buy almost anyone and everyone, and promote those you want to the highest positions of power. The Ruling Cabal controls the creation and distribution of money and can create all the power they need to implement their policies, which are designed to move mankind along a Globalist path leading to their long-desired Satanic NWO System. Dark-side Psi-power is harnessed for evil by the ruling Cabal, which is Satanic and deeply committed to an inhuman, anti-human Globalist NWO Agenda that requires 90% depopulation. Psi-power manipulations of the mass group mind is the little known but real practice of the spiritually based mind-control of the masses through the application of specific Black Arts to “manipulate, fracture and even eventually snatch the human soul” and replace it with non-human spiritual entities from the dark side. Dark-side Psi-power is the technology used in trauma based mind-kontrol, and the means by which psychopaths and narcissists are inducted into the worldwide Satanic pedophile network in incrementally criminal, anti-human Satanic rituals of abuse, rape, torture and even sacrifice of captive innocent children to gain more and more evil Satanic psi-power. Some insiders have reported that top cult members receive their own personal “spirit guide” as a consigliere, which periodically appears to them in private and “advises” them after they reach the level of child torture and child sacrifice. Some have claimed these are “Fallen Ones/Lesser Gods”; others claim they are very evil, deceptive and crafty demons or Djinns. Positive psi-power is now just starting to emerge in dissatisfied Americans, who are now aware they are being abused by the Ruling Cabal and have had about enough. There is the reverse side to Dark-sided Psi-power, which is a spiritual entity. In basic form, it is the spontaneously emerging new populism, which is a direct offshoot of the Internet which is turning out to be the New Gutenberg Press. Some conservative Christians claim they can muster positive Psi-power directly from God Almighty through prayer and faith, and this is reflected in a new and strong desire to do what is right and moral, to serve others, to resist and stop evil and to treat others the way one desires to be treated. I have covered evil psi-power emanating from the ancient Babylonian Talmudic Black arts in prior articles and will get more specific in future articles. But it is so esoteric that it would pose a distraction from the main thrust of this article, which is the new ultra high tech remote mind war that is now being waged against your brain on many fronts, depending on where you reside. A secret alliance between American Intel and the Ruling Satanic Pedophile Cabal. There is a secret alliance between Intel and the Ruling Satanic Pedophile Cabal that specializes in Black Arts for Mind War against We The People, Colonel Michael Aquino Style. Col. Michael Aquino, Army Psychological Operations expert and father of the Temple of Set and the entity which brought Satanism as an accepted religion into the US Army, as well as alleged to have run the pedophile operations at the Presidio in California and at Offutt AF Base in Omaha. One insider alleged that Col. Aquino was actually promoted to General of the NSA and still is active. It is now a well established fact that many of the world’s Intel agencies have formed a secret alliance with the worldwide Satanic pedophile network (an oligarchical cult) and has used the trauma-based mind-kontrol conditioning to create MPD/DID sleepers, agents and secret servants in every walk of life, every occupation and even within the Secret Service. In fact, the Satanic Pedophile Cult Network (Ruling Cabal) inside America has been deputized as an agent of American national Security and is used by America Intel as cover for numerous Mind-Kontrol experiments and deep black covert operations. American Law Enforcement is fully compromised by the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal). Every major police department in America, as well as every FBI office, including the WFO, has a sheep-dipped individual who runs interference for the Satanic Pedophile Cabal that rules America. Aquino Whenever the phrase “going black”, deep black, or “black operations” is used you can be certain that it always is anti-human, evil, based on ancient Babylonian Black Arts of deception, casuistry, equivocation, and sophistry designed to undermine human character and the natural will of the masses. The documentation of MK-Ultra and other CIA mind-kontrol programs is so well established and now so public from declassified docs and vetted personal testimonies in front of Congressional Committees, that it is worthless to try and deny the existence of such programs. Every large city prosecutor knows it would be unwise to attempt to prosecute any of the Satanic crimes linked to the Satanic pedophile Network or any Satanic cult crimes or Satanic Ritual Abuse that would create any public cognizance of this issue. And be certain of this, these MK-Ultra programs which were supposed to have been discontinued after the Church Commission, actually went Black (completely covert inside American Intel inside privatized defense contractors deputized under national security) and are still very active today and even expanding every year. Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora’s box. Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora’s box of remote inductive brain entrainment making it possible for Deep Black Intel groups (often buried deep within defense contractors or proprietaries in unacknowledged special access programs) to deploy incredibly sophisticated new weapons of “mindwar” against the American mass subconscious mind. Ever since crashed UFOs were recovered in 1922 in the Black Forest and in Roswell NM in America in 1947, recovered and back-engineered Alien ET technologies have been a major game changer. New Psychotronic Mindwar weapons have now been deployed in a secret assault on your brain to entrain it and in many cases on your body to make you physically ill and to shorten your life. The purpose is to help the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) attain their inter-generational, age old Globalist NWO Agenda of evil which has been their wetdream ever since ancient Babylon. As the new quantum based physics have evolved into the use of microwaves, pulsed beam microwaves, ELF and scalar (standing waves), it was learned that various sophisticated types of electric induction could be used to remotely entrain the brain to operate at certain desired frequencies. _________ Voice of God Technology. And it was also discovered that voices and self-talk, as well as specific belief patterns, could be entrained directly into the brain remotely by use of sophisticated inductive methods, now referred to as advanced psychotronics. There are numerous vetted and rock solid reports of the deployment of the Voice of God remote inductive technology being deployed against the Republican Guard in the first Gulf War. This resulted in these Iraqi Soldiers hearing Allah’s voice inside their heads instructing them to throw down their arms and surrender after which hundreds were bulldozed into ditches and buried alive to their deaths. This weapon system was then tabled not to be used again because the Cabal was concerned it would become too well known and that would lead to the discovery of their other similar weapons which are now being deployed, weapons much more subtle that instill attitudes and beliefs but usually no direct voices. Some of the new remote entrainment technologies operate by the principal of inter-dimensional or quantum physics, that is immediate remote communication with a target through a medium of a different dimension where the carrier is alleged to be timeless Dimension waves (aka D-waves). Description of D-wave It’s a fact that Mass Mind-kontrol has taken a turn for the worse since Roswell. The new technologies developed from back engineered recovered crashed Alien ET UFOs are so sophisticated and so anti-free will and anti-human that unless taken Deep-Black and protected by numerous layers of “need to know”, extreme compartmenting and special access unaccounted programs, the public would rise up in mass and destroy those programs by whatever means necessary. Without abject beyond-Black secrecy these sinister Mind-kontrol programs utilizing advanced psychotronics deployed and managed in real time by artificial intelligence, they could never survive intact. _________ Now for a presentation of current psychotronic weapons now being deployed against the brains of many Americans in select cities and select regions, and some known countermeasures which have been claimed to be effective. Note: This section is long and those interested can pick and choose the subjects they want. Some of these weapons such as ELF are deployed against a group of randomly selected citizens and a select group of federal and corporate whistleblowers. One group is used as an innocent control and the other as a group of targeted individuals who in some way are deemed a current or future threat to the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal). Do not get discouraged and do not lose hope, help is now on the way on several fronts and you can do many things to protect yourself and your loved ones. I have instituted these countermeasures in my home and the homes of various friends and have been pleased with the results, which are backed up by professional quality meters. As you read about these quite nasty psychotronic weapons now deployed against many of us Americans, please keep in mind that without abject secrecy that is now being denied, these soulless entities who are doing this to us will eventually be stopped cold by the new quite powerful spontaneously emerging populism which is now growing like an out of control wildfire. Smartmeters and Dirty electricity: Activists claim that Smartmeters (they are digital instead of the old analog) are NOT UL rated like the old analog ones and that these Smartmeters have caused unexpected house fires and there are numerous complaints of much larger electric bills with the same prior usage, numerous complaints about sleeping problems, headaches, nervousness, agitation and various strange illness emerging. In some localities it is a violation to install any electrical devise to the AC supply system that is not UL rated so folks need to organize into action groups to expose this and stop their use as a public health issue and a violation of state electrical codes. This ignores the secret mind-kontrol aspects of Smartmeters but to focus on that issue is far too immediately self-discrediting to ever get anywhere. Few members of the public who are not trained Psyops experts can fathom this unless they have been “targeted individuals” and experienced significant symptoms firsthand. Smartmeters can allegedly be remotely “turned up” to emit large EMF pulsed beam microwave bursts (numerous times per minute) and have been alleged by experts to be able to emit significant or very large amounts of dirty electricity (dirty harmonics) in one’s AC circuits. Counter measures include using grounded stainless steel screen or two thicknesses of grounded aluminum screen wrapped around the Smartmeter itself, and by hanging an EMF shield of special fabric or two thicknesses of grounded, hanging aluminum screen inside which adequately blocks the inward emissions reaching your bedroom and living quarters. To be sure that you have reduced the EMF you will need to purchase an Microwave detector. There are many good quality ones available for the range of $80 to $400 which will cover Smartmeters (ask the seller which model will suffice). A certified EMF detector may cost up to $2,000 and will tell the difference between regular microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves and in what intensity in microwatts per square meter and a record of accumulation per time period. Smartmeters have been found in some areas to generate large amounts of dirty electrical harmonics in the AC circuits of one’s home. The gold standard for analysis of these AC dirty electricity harmonics is to analyze them with a properly connected AC oscilloscope, a fairly expensive piece of equipment. I have personally tested my AC circuits for dirty electricity using a Greenwave Dirty electricity meter and after finding very high levels, I then installed Greenwave Electrical Filters which have dual capacitors, are grounded, are UL rated and are RoHC compliant (RoHS, also known as Lead-Free, stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances. RoHS, also known as Directive 2002/95/EC, originated in the European Union and restricts the use of six hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products. I prefer the Greenwave meter because it has an audio function that increases in volume with increased dirty electricity and a calculator that estimates the percentage of decrease when you add a filter. There is also the Stetzerizer®meter and electrical filters available too which are also popular. If you cannot afford to get a dirty electrical indicator/meter, one can detect significant dirty electricity and Lilly Waves by turning on an AM radio and moving the dial through the channels. AM channels will be very buzzy or fuzzy and reception will be very poor. For those that cannot afford dirty electricity filters, one can move their bed a bout 3 feet from the wall where the AC wires are, or turn off the breaker covering where they sleep at night. FM is not affected by dirty electricity. — Lilly Waves: In some locales these special behavior and health altering wave forms (a special type of dirty electricity harmonics) are purposely generated by special outside mounted line boxes into your household AC circuits. The purpose is to mind-kontrol you, make you ill, disturb your sleep, make you disturbed, cause relationship conflict with your significant other and break down the family system. This is a deep-black incredibly sinister system that can be detected by dirty electrical meters (Greenwave or Stetzerizer or by using an Osciliscop which is typically quite an expensive piece of equipment). If detected, these waves can be mitigated by the adequate installation of Greenwave or Stetzerizer Filters. The use of large line filters attached to your electrical supply work great but they start at about $5,000 and for most the cost is prohibitive. Use of the small AC filters which are between $25 and $35 each do an effective reducinfg Lilly waves and other forms of dirty electricity including that from Smartmeters if installed correctly. — Remote phones: I have swept a number of homes for EMF using sophisticated accurate EMF meters of several varieties. I have found that in those where the occupants had serious complaints of sleeping issues, headaches, loss of energy or irritability, EMF levels were in the range of up to 4,500 microwatts per square meter, high enough to cause behavioral and health problems, especially in those who may be electro-sensitive. Now here is the strange part. When I swept a well know federal Whistleblower’s home, I found significant dirty electricity in the AC circuits that were easily reduced down to an acceptable level by the installation of Greenwave Filters. But I also found especially high microwave levels being emitted from his two remote phone base stations which are powerful transmitters. When I mentioned the reading was 4,400 microwatts the level immediately reduced down to about 1,000 microwatts. Later when I crept into the room again it was up at 4,400 microwatts and immediately dropped when I mentioned it verbally. This of course has alarming ramifications if you think it through. This means that language is being monitored in real time through the remote phone system most likely by use of automatic A.I. I have been told by friends that sometimes they will comment to another person I am going to ask my Smartphone a question only to have the answer given as they recite the first word or two into the phone. It’s like the time an individual told his fiancé he was going to ask his Smartphone what day he would have to turn the clock back for the end of Daylight Savings time. As he recited the first word “when” the Smartphone recited the complete answer to him before he could even speak the question enough to understand it. This strongly suggests real time A.I. monitoring of all speech patterns within a certain distance of the Smartphone and has alarming implications for not only A.I. base surveillance but also suggests that perhaps Dimensional wave (D-wave) quantum physics have been integrated into some Smartphones and remote phone systems. — Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi has been removed in an increasing number of public schools in Canada and Europe due to significant health concerns for children and their undeveloped neurological systems which can be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of EMF. Pulsed beam microwave transmitters were first installed in a national sporting good chain as a mind-kontrol test which was an NSA proprietary. Several managers and workers with no mental health histories suddenly and unexpectedly “cracked” and had to be taken away by paramedics. The pulsed beam microwaves had been turned up too high and some employees simply cracked from excessive EMF to their brains. The next place these Wi-Fi systems were installed and tested was in certain select public high schools, especially the one visited by Bush2 when he was president. In one installation I monitored, this Wi-Fi was deployed as a psychotronic weapon system to make some targeted “stand up” highly moral teachers very, very sick. As an adjunct poisonous enzymes were sprayed onto the desks of certain targeted teachers. Some got cancer, some died, some cracked, some just quit. All this covered up under so-called  “national security” which was invoked. Other stand up targeted teachers that survived the EMF assaults were then wrongly accused of accessing pornography websites but with no actual proof. In one particular High School where this was done, the administration was linked to Intel and was stealing million of public funds using sophisticated means while running two sets of books. Complaints to the local US Attorney with good evidence supplied and to the US Department of Education Inspector General resulted in an early retirement for the US Attorney and nothing was done in DC either. The strategy was to drive out any teachers who had strong character and could see what was going on. Good counter-measures for those sensitive to Wi-Fi include hard wiring all computers, eliminating all Wi-Fi especially in one’s home and shielding wall if one lives in multiple dwellings where others Wi-Fi come through with strong signal strength. Wi-Fi has been known to effect some sensitive individuals and can cause the same type of behavioral and health issues that are now linked to dirty electricity, Lilly Waves and excessive EMF in general. We now know for certain that EMF does not have to heat the human cell or human tissue as we have been told for years by the CDC, the USAF and various electrical engineering departments at major Universities to entrain the brain or influence attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. — Cell phone towers: Some experts suggest maintaining a certain distance from these EMF emitters when possible. Those close by cell towers have reported sleeping difficulties, behavioral effects such as irritability, marital conflicts not there before and new unexpected health issues. Insiders have reported that these cell tower systems have been deployed as part of as massive psychotronic war against the American mind to break up relationships and families, make folks sick and to mind-kontrol by remote inductive entrainment. In my city a big mega church was built. Soon after the biggest cell phone tower with the most transmitting antennas installed on it in three levels was built. I noticed that the intensity of the EMF was strangely highest when the church services were being held. I swept the home of a suspected super soldier with an IQ of over 200 living nearby at his request and traced high EMF to the tower and a special dish installed on it aimed at his home. Another pure coincidence I’m sure. Painting and grounding walls will special EMF blocking paint available from www.lessemf.com and other vendors can be effective in reducing cell phone emissions for electro-sensitive individuals or those who are concerned about being too close to cell phone transmission towers. — Radar and Dopplar radar: For years medical effects were denied by the USAF and yet significant proof emerged that those airman exposed to a lot of radar had increased frequency of cataracts and certain cancers. Those  too close to these emitters can use grounded screening on interior walls or special grounded EMF blocking paint. The same paint the NSA uses in their SCIFs is now available from numerous vendors like www.lessemf.com. It is fairly pricey but it is a one time expense and some believe it is worth it. — Ground based, vehicle based, aircraft based or satellite based microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves aimed and/or triangulated at selected targeted individuals: These systems are expensive to deploy and must be scheduled. therefore they are usually only deployed against whistleblowers or in certain experiments. The usual EMF shielding methodologies like the use of special grounded, metallized primer paints can be quite effective, except for the new X-ray lasers which require much heavier, thicker shielding. — Ground based ELF systems aimed and/or triangulated at certain selected individuals: These systems are usually complex working in tandem with other technologies and are deployed against whistleblowers or targeted individuals who have been randomly selected to serve as experimental controls. The talk inside deep Intel circles is that all these systems are still being calibrated and experimented with using A.I. Someday in the future it is expected that the Secret Shadow Government will integrate all this knowledge and turn over control of all the remote inductive entrainment systems to centralized A.I. control run out of the NSA Bluffdale, Utah Base, using the new world’s largest Quantum computer, Vesuvius. Obviously by now most readers have figured out that the NSA is actually run by the same soulless, unimaginably evil Plutocratic Oligarchs from the thirteen Bloodline families who are deploying this Alien ET back engineered/derived psychotronic technology to advance and manage the implementation of their age-old inter-generational Globalist NWO Agenda of pure anti-human evil. — Cell Phones and Smart phones: It is now apparent that many of these have real time A.I. interaction-oriented quantum based surveillance powers. Some insiders have alleged that the particular wave forms and frequencies have been designed to entrain attitudes, thought patterns and even beliefs. The jury is still out on this claim, but based on what I have seen so far it wouldn’t surprise me. Plus there is now a big concern by medical researchers in numerous nations that holding these phones close and making contact with one’s head, like ordinary cell phones and using them too much, can perhaps cause various types of brain cancer. OJ’s attorney Johnny Cochran bragged how he got rid of one of his secretaries after he decided to do all his business by cell phone. He was on it many hours a day, held it close to his head and died of brain cancer soon after the OJ trial ended. Mere coincidence or damage caused by too much, too intense EMF? There are several ways to mitigate this excessive EMF from Smartphones, just like with ordinary cell phones. Talking with the phone at least 4-6 inches from ones head, use of certain styles of remote earphones, air powered the best, or the use of the speaker phone, ,or use of special fabric pockets which block radiation to the head while talking but still allow the phone to work. Note: In European health studies by MDs, 3-6% of the populace has been shown to have altered EKGs and EEGs. In at least one Scandinavian nation, EMF sensitivity is a recognized medical disability and a sanctuary city has been set up with highly reduced EMF emissions for those so designated to live in. _________ References: Here are some places to start to gain more information for those interested and have time.

Most of those working on these projects are so compartmented by “Need to Know” that few understand how these devastating weapons of war are being deployed to mind-kontrol and sicken many Americans. Those that do, who sit at the top of the pyramid or run these special access programs, are criminal sociopaths that lost their souls long ago, and most have been initiated into the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) that runs most of the world. Now for the difficult conclusion to all this. All MK-Ultra sleeper violence in America (including the real mass-shootings in gun-free zones), and all Radical Islamic violence (ISIS type mercenary forces) are created, paid for, trained, supplied and energized and activated by orders and authorization of the Ruling Cabal. Many so-called radical Islamic mercenaries are not really followers of Islam at all, but have been raised in special camps for abandoned children, mind-kontrolled through drugs, trauma-conditioning and psychotronics at an early age. They, as well as other paid mercenaries, are mind-kontrolled and inducted with psychotic belief patterns that make them easy for the Cabal to remotely activate. They can thus be transformed into savage torturers, heartless rapists and murderers of innocent men, women and children — all done to deliver blood sacrifices to Satan on behalf of the Ruling Cabal to provide them more power as promised by Satan (their words not mine). Sadly, it’s a fact that many current social movements are by-products of Bernays-type, Madison Avenue social modeling, cultural Mind-kontrol, as well as ultra high tech remote inductive technologies that entrain the human brain and generate synthetic belief patterns and attitudes which cause individuals to acts in ways contrary to their own long term best interests. At little as five years ago, to even discuss these subjects publicly usually resulted in termination as an immediate sanction. Thanks to the Internet and hundreds of honest Intel and LE individuals who refused to keep quiet about these inhuman crimes, the public can now have access to this information, if they so desire. And more and more folks want to know why they are having trouble sleeping, are tired too much, have difficulty concentrating and feel off kilter. AI (Photo credit: Jupiter Ascending) The Cabal’s Plan is part of the Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil to keep experimenting and fine tuning these technologies separately to spy on Americans while mind-controlling them at the same time. Without these devices such as smart phones and Wi-Fi providing desirable features of convenience, few would use them, and the Cabal would not be able to fine tune these technologies. Once the fine tuning is complete, the Cabal has planned to combine them under control of a massive Quantum computer using A.I. automatic controls and operating through inter-dimensional wave forms. At this point, they believe they will be able to make whole populations completely mind-kontrolled and cloned/hived to the mother A.I. computer; or make sick or even murder whole human populations at will. Then they plan to eliminate 90% of all humans and replace them with their own synthetic race of hybrids, a combination of clay and iron (biology and manufactured electrical components). Looks like the Cabal has been having some recent bumps in the road with the unexpected side effects of the Internet which has turned out to be the New Gutenberg Press and is now undermining the New Roman Empire run out of the Vatican, which was hijacked by the Black Pope and the Old Black Nobility long ago, the folks that really run the Ruling Cabal. When the Gutenberg Press appeared, it undermined the Vatican by making the Bible available to all — something the Vatican desperately wanted to prevent. Right now populism has emerged inside America and much of the western world and is growing in power by the day. If not stopped this will be the death of the Cabal’s Globalist NWO efforts. Never forget — all these various types of Mind-kontrol through these Satanic Black Arts and back-engineered Alien ET technologies do not work well on folks with strong character, integrity and love in their hearts for their fellow man, who have decided to live by the golden rule to treat others the way they want to be treated. It is this immutable human spirit, energized by love towards others, that poses the greatest risk to the Ruling cabal, and cannot ever be snuffed out. I am pretty certain the Cabal will eventually be defanged and stopped and will lose control over these weapons before they can combine them and succeed in their Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil. Disclaimer: None of this is to be taken as health care recommendations. This article is a mere presentation of some basic information to those who are interested. If you are having problems you think are based on electro-sensitivity to EMF or excessive EMF, you can seek consultation with a qualified expert (there are some but you will have to carefully search them out). Before you come to any conclusions about all these issues, spend some time researching these subjects on the Internet. The references provided are mere starting points. Those who live in European nations will probably find it much easier to get access to scientifically based data on EMF sensitivity and EMF levels one should limit exposure to. _________ Joe Bonamassa, Child Guitar prodigy and the newly designated “King of the Blues” since BB King’s passing.

By studying biofeedback in people and understanding what brainwave frequency they’re producing while experiencing different emotional stimulants, it’s possible to then use those same frequencies to induce different emotional responses in people. For instance, the symptoms of an overdose of delta waves (0-4 Hz) can make it impossible to think and it can even cause brain damage. An overdose of theta (4-8 Hz) can cause depression. I bet the psychopaths would love tormenting people with this. It could probably be deployed against an individual, or small group by something like an LRAD. It could probably be deployed against the masses through our idiot boxes (TV’s) and we wouldn’t even know it, because the human ear rarely ever responds to frequencies under 20 Hz. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  November 26, 2016 at 7:28 am Amelius, obviously you are well informed about all these psychotronics and you have described what is already being done. Once they determine a targeted individual’s “prime freak” frequency, they can custom tailor and transmit individual psychotronics against that individual. It has been alleged that these technologies do not work well on marijuana users and those of strong character and integrity, but can cause irritation. Amelius  November 26, 2016 at 9:59 am Thank you for the reply Preston, it’s good to know I’m on the right track. I have my own EEG and have been monitoring my brainwave activity under different circumstances for a couple of years now. I first learned of this stuff from a book I found a few years back called, “The Greatest Power In The Universe” by Ulysses S Anderson. If I’m not mistaken, there are optimal doses of brainwave frequencies which can yield beneficial results like increased mental alertness, concentration, memory retention/recovery, etc. If this is true, it might be possible to use their tech against them. The key would be determining what the optimal dose and proper application would be… medicis  November 24, 2016 at 3:53 pm Preston… a very good article which I will save and re-read. But I particularly wished to thank you for again including a Joe Bonamassa, musical piece….

Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  November 24, 2016 at 4:34 pm Medicis, you are welcome. I have been watching Joe’s climb to the top for quite a while. A humble man who started out as a guitar prodigy. He was so good as a child at the blues riffs that BB King heard about him and asked him to perform with him on stage, a remarkable feat for a child. Joe decided early on not to sell out and become “owned” body and soul by the recording industry which is an abusive system often linked to the eventual destruction of the artist. He came up the hard way, bit by bit by the quality of his guitar playing. Along the way he took voice lessons from the very best, obtained a promoter and music producer who are the best and set up his own company. He also created a non-profit Blues Foundation and has been supporting music programs in schools that could not otherwise have them. Joe is a populist at heart, appreciates and loves his fans and always gives them 100%. He has gone out of his way to provide the best HD music videos of his best performances on his website and on youtube.com. Joe has descended to the top, replaced BB King as King of the Blues after BB’s death and deserves this. Right now Joe Bonamassa is the top blues guitarist, the top stage performer and has some of the world’s very best band members, back up singers and support staff. And he never sold out in the process.

Numerous sources have propagated rumors of chemtrails containing “smart dust” with special mycoplasmas that can be “cross-triggered” by catalytic viruses that are sensitive to psychotronics. None of this is adequately verified or vetted except that we have iron clad proof of what some Chemtrails are comprised of because of actual samples obtained upon takeoff with mistaken early discharge, samples that have been analyzed by accredited labs. There have been rumors and some science that has shown there to be the existence of certain long-acting “stealth viruses” related to chronic fatigue and various sub-clinical polio type disorders. Some of these can apparently be triggered by catalytic viruses which may be psychotronically activated or activated by certain GMO and pesticide residues such as glyphosates. One well respected medical researcher Judy Mikovits who discovered and documented such a stealth virus was arrested, jailed and her research seized by government agents. She has written a book entitle “Plague” about this.

However, in my own history, I know that I have had an implant in my brain long before then which enabled “telepathy” as is commonly described — or all (to my mind reasonable) explanations point to me having it since early childhood — with some of the prototypical “experiencer” phenomena, seeing gray type entities (which to my mind are probably nothing more than robot interfaces, themselves mind-controlled or tailor-made experiences; and let’s face it, what ET with high technology in their right mind would put their physical body anywhere near the government goons which worm their way into everything on this beautiful planet). Long story short, somewhere along the way, one of the enterprising psychopaths was able to steal or blackmail (or otherwise use hostages) to get more advanced technology (“black majick rituals of human sacrifice”). kdk  November 24, 2016 at 3:21 pm Myself, I think any decent individual who understands what has been going on on planet Earth would have long ago eradicated the genotypes for psychopathy and blind-following nature which has perpetuated the egregiously evil goings on of Earth (for many centuries). In other ways, we can see in other behavior of more natural critters of Earth how the overall behavior might be worse if we weren’t already genetically engineered… from my own experiences, I would rather be in the middle of an Apocalyptic warzone than have these psychopathic goons having fairly free reign over my own personal (and psychic) experiences of Earth, IE I would rather be in a nuclear warzone, or in an environment where I physically had to defend myself from being tortured by hyena-like cannibals than the psychopaths already given nearly free access to my brain… Anytime now, Jackasses. kdk  November 24, 2016 at 3:28 pm I also understand how with time-travelling information, all of this is fairly well-known by now, but all that is lacking is a sufficient number of people which lack the will to physically force the evil psychopaths to stop what they have been doing… heck, it doesn’t even have to be violent… terminator type robots merely armed with sedative darts, or choking people out to scan their minds and find where they stand and what sort of person they are is possible, but nobody cares enough to use those means to stop the people they know are in the process of perpetrating this heinous crimes against feeling beings… and that’s why I voted for Thor and Mjollnir, not some pansy afraid of hurting someone in the middle of torturing people. kdk  November 24, 2016 at 3:29 pm *who have the will to physically force kdk  November 24, 2016 at 6:01 pm If they have access to the node you are one, anything short of incredibly abundant foresight will save you from all of the horrible things they can think of.

My own thought on ‘them’ is that ‘they’ too easily align with the targeted fracture of Christianity and the psychic/spiritual vacuum it has created and to with the psychological utility the Devil to explain human behavior. And… I am a Trekkie! Obviously most people are not able to allow emotionally that any entity this evil could thrive…because… ironically… much of the information here has validity and not doubt is being deployed or at least researched… aggressively including black operations and the technologies work and have affected the mass mind including those of us who may at times talk about these efforts. The section on mass mind as a target is especially valuable. In all cognition there are at least 3 interlocutors, the subject mind, its direction often another objective human being or even conscious animal and… thirdly, the mass mind. That third mind… too is always in the room and is profoundly powerful in terms of public action and importantly the very questions that we allow ourselves to ask. Log in to Reply helpingmind  November 23, 2016 at 9:11 am This seems obvious given the fact of propaganda, both government based and commercial. but please allow the idea to get deeper. We as a species depend upon this group thought inclination, it is key to our survival. All psychic directed efforts at control, ride upon this fact especially Marxist/Zionist thought and high WASP security state thinking and frankly most of the evolutionary biological thinking currently in vogue, although mostly they don’t seem to get… it… because the most extreme devotees think the mind is a trick and nothing more than Selection!! with a big ‘S.’ One dynamic that is not largely mentioned here because the article is focused on psychotronics… is drugs. The blatant drugging of an entire generation of human children in America who could be ‘diagnosed’ as having some “hyper active” “syndrome.” Here mind control for a life time, using the author’s word, “entrained,” biologically with the target of of what amounts to experiments very likely, with ‘psychotronics.’ in feedback loops. But I would also direct you attention to the Libertarian… mostly Neocon (Zionist mostly) think shops… line about drugs which to boil it down is that the government should not be involved in any suppression of any drug especially cannabis. As any person who has ever smoke a ‘dubbie’ knows, the last thing that a person high on that drug wants to know about s anything to do with ‘paranoia’ and the last action that they will take on their own… is politically directed. helpingmind  November 23, 2016 at 9:12 am I will concede that MJ can make one very skeptical… which is positive, of all BS, but that effect is minor compared to the damage to the citizenry from escapist directed programing from Hollywood and of emotional dis-engagement and precognitive en-gagement with future programed trauma events and aligned sympathies and guilt etc. . Therefore, legalization of MJ is a political control act on the same level as those noted in the article as active mind control, whether they are lined out here accurately or not but the article’s tone is one of to frame the possible and likely on some level. For those who can not believe the general idea of this article note: ALL action will be taken that will continue the bureaucratic war state/empire because it is a feedback loop with the most animalistic centrally coded element in the human genome, domination and survival. It works itself out in our culture by raising up those who are the most aggressive in what become packs of animals and they then seek a kind of spiritual rational to compensate for the lacuna that was their soul. Simplified but I think accurate. Massive wealth helps too! helpingmind  November 23, 2016 at 9:13 am What can produce a stream of unholy profit will be financed one way or another and what means can continue those streams will be tended until… the fracture gets so overwhelming that no human no matter how mind controlled, can ignore it.

What obviously happens here is the grid in close orbit around Earth, is put in place Trump is pushed aside and the Zionists/High WASP cabals take control of it so that no nuclear weapon on the planet can be used as a defensive threat with terrestrial systems… possibly. kdk  November 22, 2016 at 11:23 pm Thank you for the bleeding edge information on this, one of the darkest areas (along with the other MK ULTRA stuff that make mass murder look like boy scouting activities). They will try to squirm out of it, but there is no physical way for immortality w/o also every secret getting recorded. Makes interrogation totally pointless, once you know how to read it. Heck, mind maps probably don’t even have to be intrusive with the right technology. Knock someone out for 20 minutes and scan their brain to find out everything they know. They’ve probably already been experimenting on how to make people do things w/o remembering or how to erase specific memories. Don’t worry, knowing them they’re all probably totally moral, upstanding experiments with totally consenting people. /sarcasm Log in to Reply the truth please  November 22, 2016 at 1:55 pm Dr James I have always had my doubts about digital TV which was basically forced on us, one has to wonder why when analogue TV was far superior, the picture was good quality and the sound was crystal clear and still is seventy or more years on. With digital TV the picture breaks up, the sound is atrocious (mumbling of actors) you lose channels and have to re-tune your TV. The only good thing about digital TV (for those who do not have our welfare at heart) is that they can control what we see, this could not be done with analogue. They can put items in or remove items to suit what they want you to see, or make you thing you are seeing. Log in to Reply Trakkath  November 22, 2016 at 3:19 pm It is a mindcontrol weapon not a TV Preston James, Ph.D  November 23, 2016 at 8:44 am During my research for this article I heard several rumors about certain new HD cameras with special capabilities but could not substantiate them. However if true it would not surprise me. The rumors were that certain HD cameras had built in psychotronic generators (guns) built in them and that these could be aimed at an individual person to entrain his CNS and cause him to react in his psychomotor system or speech. This system was allegedly tested during certain football games and further calibrated for psychomotor freeze ups, and was allegedly tested on certain reporters and news casters for better fine tuning. Someday supposedly these devices would then be built into street lights, security cameras in stores, televisions and cell phones and would be able to stop nay behaviors deemed unacceptable to the Ruling Cabal. Do I think this could ever be effectively deployed large scale if true? Nope, a lot of this is sales hype to get more DOD money for deep black ops and those receiving it line their pockets well and live lavish lives. So much for their claimed national security. In fact what information I have been able to gain suggest that the whole deep black system is now under extreme stress, is breaking down and secrecy has been completely breached on many fronts, suggesting in time the Cabal’s use of Deep Black is doomed. Trakkath  November 23, 2016 at 8:51 am Go to Leuren Moret and look that all these things you mentioned already happend in the area she lives in and her harrasment by nearby Jesuit college.

Log in to Reply Alex B  November 22, 2016 at 11:01 am Brilliant article! Thank you Dr. James! It explains what I’ve been suspecting for the last 2-3 years, ever since I’ve realized that gang-stalking, authorized and directed by at least 2 Alphabet agencies and represented on the lower (operating ) level on 80-90% by stunning numbers of rank and file Satanists, is not a an aberration from “normalcy”. Neither are the innumerous local “occult-charged” false-flags, openly(!) happening all over the country, most people are taking for what the MSM say these events are. In fact, these are not-stop satanic rituals with purposes varying from pure psy-Ops to real mass-murders, with everything else in between. All, on the top of solving certain “mundane” problems (like elimination of unwanted, promotion of gun control, stirring racial tensions, making money, etc., etc.), are pumping fear and uncertainty into millions, to multiply the waves of negative energy for the utter delight of those who very often look like escaped patients of psychiatric clinic, which is especially frightening when they are wearing quite different uniforms… Log in to Reply Leno  November 22, 2016 at 8:27 am Yo Preston, spill something good about the Arc of Gabriel wontcha? Log in to Reply Trakkath  November 22, 2016 at 8:42 am Ask yourself why they published it openly and don´t do it in secrecy ? Maybe this is also part of the religious mindkontrol… Preston James, Ph.D  November 22, 2016 at 9:56 am Leno, sorry, but I don’t know anything about the Arc of Gabriel. And Trakkath, VT publishes articles on difficult Intel related subjects because the Editors are committed to open source Intel and believe that the public has a right to know. My efforts to disclose these criminal Intel abuses from the Cabal using deep black special access unacknowledged programs are motivated by my disdain for this anti-human abuse of us all which is unacceptable and must be stopped. I truly believe that without abject secrecy these programs will become fully exposed and eliminated bit by bit due to emerging populism which is becoming quite powerful. Trakkath  November 22, 2016 at 10:06 am I know, Mr. James their only way to betrray us all was their secrecy and if their cover is blown away, that is the most they fear, all is unravelld before our eyes. But also sometimes they lead us in the wrong direction by disclose some “secrets” like feeding a wild dog with sausages to calm him down. JS  November 22, 2016 at 1:34 pm That should be Ark not Arc. Ark of Gabriel is supposedly a weapon, also the name of a historical artifact I think. nawlins  November 22, 2016 at 6:35 am The sub-basement ELF band is simply too low a frequency to “point” anywhere. The triangulation methodology was first used for LORAN at 100khz. The reason ELF is used is that it travels along the curve of the earth and can penetrate the oceans. Anyone who thinks that this cabal has only been doing this stuff for the last couple of centuries hasn’t been doing their homework.

One question : is there any complaints or indications that smart meters cause hypertension? I was diagnosed last year with high blood pressure which shocked me as mine has always been normal up to the time before the smart meter was installed on my house.

I happen to have a “Smart” electric meter INSIDE my apartment. I have lived here for about 7 months. Most all my hair has fallen out, having had a nice thick head of hair at rhe age of 59. My blood pressure was like 198/120, two weeks ago during my first doctor visit in about two years. My thyroid was checked and confirmed not to be my hair loss issue. My apartment is tacked onto the back of an old house. This “smart” meter was installed shortly before I moved in, not realizing the meter was inside the apartment. Learning about three months ago that it was also a new “smart” meter. I am moving ASAP. Seems I can not find much information on the safety of these “smart” meters. I have read they emit 1,000x the RF waves of a smartphone, or any other household “wireless” device. Whereas others say “no more emitted” than that of our household “wireless” devices. This phone is the only “other” wireless device I have. I would greatly appreciate any information regarding these “smart” meters. Acquiring a brain tumer is unacceptable, whether inside or outside of the home. By the way, I live in the heart of the Midwest. These “smart” meters have now reached the center of these United States. I have read California has had them for about five years, with some communities demanding they be removed.

The name Moloch results from a dysphemic vocalisation in the Second Temple period of a theonym based on the root mlk “king”. Biblical Hebrew מלך (mlk)[2] usually stands for מֶלֶךְ melek “king”[3] (Akkadian malku) but when vocalized as מֹלֶךְ mōlek[4] in the Masoretic text, it has been traditionally understood as a proper name.

It’s a versatile hardware connector that combines high-speed data transfers with audio and video display. First launched in 2011, with the development name Light Peak, Thunderbolt was invested by a partnership of tech luminaries, including Intel, Apple, LaCie and others. The first iteration of the technology debuted on the 2011 Apple MacBook Pro with other Thunderbolt-equipped models following. On the PC side, manufacturers were reasonably slow to adopt Thunderbolt (preferring the lower cost USB 3.0) despite heavy championing by Intel.  The Thunderbolt 2 (Falcon Ridge) standard arrived in 2013, doubling data transfer speeds to 20 Gbps and the connector began to pop up on motherboards from ASUS, Gigabyte and ASRock, alongside PCs from Dell, HP, Lenovo and others. According to Intel, at the end of 2015, over 100 million computers are equipped with the Thunderbolt interface, with more than 250 peripherals on the market. Here we are in early 2016, and Thunderbolt 3 (Alpine Ridge) is ready to roll! The latest version of the standard brings a big physical change in the switch the USB-C connector (any USB Type-C cable will work in a Thunderbolt 3 port but you’ll need a Thunderbolt cable to connect to a Thunderbolt 3 device). Speeds are doubled to 40 Gbps, and Intel boasts that you’ll be able to drive dual 4K displays at 60 Hz. With the switch to USB-C (as an Alternate Mode), Thunderbolt 3 ports are power enabled, offering up to 100W charging power for notebooks and 15W to bus-powered devices. Thunderbolt cables are now more versatile than ever, supporting a range of protocols including Thunderbolt itself, DisplayPort, USB and PCI Express. Update (October 2016): With Apple announcing a new range of MacBook Pro laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3, we’ve taken the opportunity to refresh this list with another ten great Thunderbolt 3 products to check out. Twenty for the price of ten? Sounds like a great deal! Apple MacBook Pro (2016) While the likes of Acer, Dell and HP have already launched products supporting Thunderbolt 3, it’s the launch of the new Apple MacBook Pro that will drive the technology into mainstream use. The guys from Cupertino have announced 13 and 15″ editions of the 2016 MacBook Pro, all of which rock Thunderbolt 3 ports. The entry level 13″ MacBook Pro is priced at $1,499 and is powered by a 2 GHz Intel Core i5 Skylake processor, partnered with 8 GB RAM. Two Thunderbolt 3 ports are equipped, supporting 40 Gbps data transfers, two 5K displays and accessory charging. While the base model lacks Apple’s new Touch Bar and Touch ID features, you’ll find them included further up the range, which extends all the way to the $2,799 15″ MacBook Pro. It offers four Thunderbolt 3 ports, 16 GB RAM, an Intel Core i7 Skylake CPU, discreet AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB memory and more. Of course, you’re welcome to spec the MacBook Pro with even more advanced features should your wallet allow! The world’s best laptop? Let the debate rage on! Apple Thunderbolt 3 & USB-C Cables Shell out all that hard earned cash on a new MacBook Pro and, of course, you’ll expect all the cables and adapters you need will be included in the box, right? Well, think again. With Cupertino desperate to prop up declining iPad sales, it looks as if the company is driving margins hard by encouraging Mac enthusiasts to plump for a range of reasonably pricey connectors for the new dream machines. The $49 Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter allows you to connect any of your existing Thunderbolt 2 devices to the MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port. It’s a bidirectional adapter, so it can also connect new Thunderbolt 3 devices to a Mac with a Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 port (but you’ll need MacOS Sierra or later on board).   Other cables that you’ll need to check out are the $19 USB-C Charging Cable, $25 1m USB-C to Lightning Cable (for iPhone and iPad users), $19 USB-C to USB Adapter, Belkin’s $34.95 USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and the $69 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter which includes a HDMI connection, a standard USB port and a USB-C charging port. There are, of course, third-party versions of some of these adapters and cables available at cheaper prices. Be sure to check out the reviews of these before purchasing and, if possible, stick to brands you know. New MacBook owners should definitely check out our guide to this year’s Essential USB 3.1 Gen 2 products too. ASUS ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card for Z170 & X99 Motherboards Switching to the Windows desktop world now, owners of newer Z170 and X99 motherboards will want to check out the new ASUS ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card, which provides a reasonably quick and easy way to upgrade desktop PCs with Thunderbolt 3 support. The $69 PCIe card slots into the motherboard, adding one USB Type-C port supporting Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 connections, Mini DP In, plus a secondary USB 3.1 Type-A port. The card supports USB Power Delivery specs for up to 36W charging and upgrades data transfer speeds to 40 Gbps. Akitio Thunder3 PCIe Expansion Box The Akitio Thunder3 PCIe Box is an expansion chassis that provides an additional PCIe slot for Thunderbolt 3 computers. It’s a great solution for scenarios where installing an internal expansion card is not an option or for desktop systems where there is not enough space for additional PCIe cards. Connecting via USB-C, the onboard Thunderbolt 3 interface supports two additional USB-C ports, a dedicated DisplayPort for hooking up an additional monitor, plus a second Thunderbolt port supporting Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, and DisplayPort devices. Clad in aluminium, the Thunder3 allows you to daisy-chain up to 6 Thunderbolt devices The Thunder3’s PCIe (x16) slot supports half-length, full-height, double-width cards with a 4 lane PCI Express 3.0 compliant interface. It’s priced at $299 and available now. HP Spectre X360   If you’re seeking a Windows laptop to give the Apple MacBook Pro a run for its money, the HP Spectre X360 may fit the bill. It’s a convertible 2-in-1 laptop, available in 13 and 15″ sizes. It’s powered by the latest Intel “Kaby Lake” processor and is just 13.8mm (0.54 inches) at its thickest point. A pair of USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3 connections, while an integrated infra-red camera enables Windows Hello biometric authentication. Simply look at the screen, and the Spectre X360 unlocks. The new HP Spectre x360 is available to order now, priced from $1,049.99. Cable Matters USB-C to HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB Multiport 4K UHD Adapter   Adopting new technology can see the costs rack up, so it’s good to know there are some good value Thunderbolt 3 compatible accessories available that won’t break the bank. The Cable Matters USB-C to HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB Multiport 4K UHD Adapter is one of them. Fully compatible with Thunderbolt 3, the $45 adapter supports multiple connections, including Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.0, and an HDMI or VGA video port over a single USB-C connection. 4K UHD (3840×2160 @ 30Hz) display over HDMI is available, while you can also connect a flash drive, mouse, or a smartphone for data transfers and syncing. It’s not the prettiest, but versatile it most certainly is. StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 Dual-4K Docking Station for Laptops StarTech’s $185 Thunderbolt 3 docking station is a sleek accessory for Windows PCs, allowing connection of your laptop to dual-4K displays (60Hz) & multiple peripherals at speeds up to 40Gbps, with a single cable. Sadly, there’s no support for Macs, but Windows users can connect dual UHD displays or a single 5K 60 Hz displays should they wish. The dock features two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, as well as DisplayPort video output. For dual 4K video capability, you can use a 4K 60Hz capable video adapter to connect a second 4K 60Hz display to one of the dock’s Thunderbolt 3 USB-C peripheral ports, the company says. USB fast-charge and sync is supported (compliant with USB Battery Charging Specification 1.2) while you’ll also find an additional USB-C port (5Gbps – data only), and a Gigabit Ethernet port. Intel NUC NUC6i7KYK Mini PC Scoring eleven on the ten point awesomeness scale for mini PCs is the latest Intel NUC, the NUC6i7KYK. Small but mighty, this NUC is powered by a 6th generation Skylake Intel Core i7 processor and Intel Iris Pro Graphics. Its Thunderbolt 3 interface supports up to three 4K displays and allows you to further accelerate graphics performance with external graphics cards and transfer data to and from an external drive at 40 Gbps. As will all NUC’s you’ll need to add your own storage, RAM and OS, but the results are impressive. The base price for the kit is just under $600, while you’ll need to add $300+ for additional components.  A tiny, full-powered gaming rig or video workstation – truly innovative. Belkin USB-IF Certified 3-Foot USB-C to USB-C (Type C to Type C) Thunderbolt 3 Cable While Apple-fans may be happier checking out the white Belkin Thunderbolt 3 cable I highlighted earlier, everyone else will be please to see that the company has also manufactured a black cable which will match a wider range of kit. Their 3 foot USB-C cable is USB-IF certified, but remains pricey at $29.99. It supports 4K/Ultra HD display connections and is rated for 20 Gbps data transfers, with the bonus of powering a laptop with up to 60W of charging power. Kanex USB-C to SD Card Reader With integrated SD card readers seemingly going the way of the dodo (or in Apple’s case, the 3.5mm headphone jack) photography enthusiasts are going to need a solution to transfer their artistry from camera to PC. Sure, Wi-Fi is an increasingly attractive option for those cameras and SD cards that support it. However, for large RAW files and video, an SD card reader remains a strong option. The Kanex USB-C to SD Card Reader is available in Space Gray (MacBook Pro owners, take note) and supports a wide range of storage cards, including Micro SD/T-Flash, SD, mini SD, MMC, MMC Plus, RS-MMC, MMC Mobile, MS, MS Pro, MS Duo, and MS Pro Duo. It’s compatible with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, but will only transfer data at 5 Gbps (still plenty fast). Priced less than $15, the Kanex USB-C to SD Card Reader is a great value addition to your backpack.     Razer Blade Stealth & Razer Core If you’re a gamer, you’ll know all about Razer, Inc. Their newly announced Razer Blade Stealth is a beautiful and powerful 12.5″ ultrabook that can hook up to the external Razer Core enclosure over Thunderbolt 3. That brings you desktop class graphics (you can plug in full-length, double-wide PCIe desktop graphics cards) and a host of additional connections including 4 USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet. Work or play, it’s got the lot.The Razor Blade Stealth starts at $999, pricing for the Razer Core is yet to be announced. AKiTiO Thunder3 Duo Pro With super-fast data transfer speeds, expect to see a wide range of Thunderbolt 3 storage solutions coming down the line this year. The $389 Thunder3 Duo Pro from AKiTiO is one of the first, boasting transfer speeds up to 770 MB/s while simultaneously providing two 4K video streams to connected displays. That’s 8x faster than USB 3.1 Gen 1 and 4x faster than USB 3.1 Gen 2. It’s a dual-bay RAID enclosure, offering RAID 0 striping, RAID 1 mirroring, SPAN, and Non-RAID. Connectivity is strong, with two Thunderbolt 3 Ports, a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-B) port, and a DisplayPort video output for 4K 60HZ displays. The second Thunderbolt 3 port on the Thunder3 Duo Pro supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 (10Gb/s), and DisplayPort devices. It’s coming in the first quarter of the year. Dell Thunderbolt Dock PC manufacturers are waking up to the fact that the concept of “mobile” and “fixed” workers is outdated. Nowadays, many of us working in a hybrid style. We may be travelling, but when we touch down to get some work done, many of us need the same capabilities and connectivity as we’d expect at our own desk. Devices like the Dell Thunderbolt Dock seek to address that need. Plug into your notebook and you get benefit from a single data and power source that can drive can drive up to three 1080p displays or two 4K displays at 60 Hz. Add twin USB 2.0 ports and three USB 3.0, VGA, mini DisplayPort, and HDMI sockets, plus DisplayPort and a Thunderbolt 3 port in addition. Best of all, as it adheres to industry standards, it’s not just for Dell notebooks – everyone’s invited. The Dell Thunderbolt Dock ships this month for $299. HP ZBook Dock With Thunderbolt 3 Following a similar theme as the Dell Thunderbolt Dock, in a less chunky (but longer) form factor, the HP ZBook Dock With Thunderbolt 3 also costs $299 and offers a similarly impressive array of connections. Alongside charging capabilities, you can hook up to 10 devices at once through ports that include Thunderbolt 3 (which also supports DisplayPort 1.2 and USB 3.1 Gen 2), four USB 3.0, RJ-45, VGA, combo audio, and two additional DisplayPorts. ASUS ROG XG Station 2 It’s common for bleeding edge tech to land first on gaming rigs and that’s certainly true for Thunderbolt 3. The ASUS ROG XG Station 2 is an external graphics card docking station and although ASUS says it’s “specifically designed for ASUS laptops and graphics cards”, we’re still waiting to hear whether other brands will be locked out. Plug in your laptop (using its USB-C port) and the dock will both charge your laptop and supercharge its graphics capabilities. You’ll need to bring your own graphics card to slot into the XG Station 2 and ASUS has yet to reveal compatibility details and pricing. Acer TravelMate P648 Notebook If you’re in the hunt for a high-tech travel companion, the 14″ Acer TravelMate P648 Notebook is powered by a 6th generation Intel Core processor with support for super-high speed 802.11ad multi-band wireless connectivity. You’ll need a compatible router though, like the newly announced TP-LINK Talon AD7200, which offers combined speeds up to 7200 Mbps. 4 GB RAM supports the processor, upgradable to a massive 20 GB and there’s ample storage space with up to 1 TB hard drives or 512 GB solid state drives. Graphics are handled by NVIDIA GeForce 840M discrete graphics. Thunderbolt 3 support offers ultra-fast data transfer and 4K display connectivity while eight hours of battery life should keep you occupied for the day. The Acer TravelMate P648 Notebook starts at $799.99 and ships in April. Plugable Flagship Thunderbolt 3 Dock  Plugable’s new Flagship Thunderbolt 3 Dock is designed to eliminate the need to continually plug and unplug devices from your notebook or tablet. You can hook up two uncompressed 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160) displays, three USB 3.0 devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and Stereo audio in/out while keeping your desktop free of clutter. The second Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock operates the same as a Thunderbolt 3 computer port by supporting Thunderbolt 3 (up to 5 daisy chained), USB 3.1 (10Gb/s), and DisplayPort devices. It’ll arrive in Q1 2016.   Plugable Thunderbolt 3 Dual-Display Adapter Meanwhile, the Plugable Thunderbolt 3 Dual-Display Adapter offers a quick and convenient way to hook up multiple displays to your PC. Two versions of the adapters are hitting the market this year. A DisplayPort variant supports the connection of two uncompressed 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160) monitors. A second, HDMI model offers support for two uncompressed 4K 30Hz (3840 x 2160) monitors. Both are coming in Q1 2016.   Startech.com Thunderbolt 3 to Dual DP Adapter/HDMI Adapter Peripheral and accessory specialist Startech.com is introducing Thunderbolt 3 to Dual DisplayPort Adapter, which they’re calling “the highest resolution and simplest dual DisplayPort adapter ever”. Why? Well, it’s bus powered, does not require additional device drivers, and, for the first time, a dual DisplayPort adapter supports two full uncompressed DisplayPort 1.2 video streams from a single Thunderbolt 3 port (that’s nearly 16 million more pixels than an HDTV, from a single Thunderbolt 3 port).   A similar adapter, supporting Thunderbolt 3 to twin HDMI connections, rather than DisplayPort is also available, priced at $91.95. Startech.com Thunderbolt 3 Cables If you like the look of all these Thundrbolt 3 solutions, you’re going to need some cables to go with them. >Startech.com are shipping Thunderbolt 3 cables with USB-C connectors in lengths of 0.5m ($25.99), 1m ($29.99) and 2m ($35.99). Bear in mind, though, that the fastest 40 Gbps connections are only available with the 0.5m cable. Longer lengths result in a speed drop to (a still blistering) 20 Gbps. While we’ve seen a swathe of new Thunderbolt 3 products unveiled at CES 2016, we can expect to see many more announced through the year. Thunderbolt may have had a slow start, but with compatible notebooks, gaming rigs, storage devices and accessories now streaming into the market, it looks like the versatile Thunderbolt 3 standard will be popping up everywhere this year. shares Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Reddit Email Subscribe Join the mailing list Sign up to our mailing list and you will receive the latest news, reviews and how to guides delivered directly to your inbox.

Joe Pleniukas I’m curious – has anyone seen an adapter to go from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2? Some of these docks have display port slots, but it doesn’t seem like you’d be able to use Thunderbolt 2 peripherals on a machine equipped with Thunderbolt 3 in the usb-c form factor unless I’m mistaken. Terry Walsh Hi Joe – looks like Startech.com has one, but it’s pricey: http://www.startech.com/ca/Cables/thunderbolt-3-cables/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-thunderbolt-adapter~TBT3TBTADAP phatkatmeow apple just released a couple of adapters, including t3->t2/t1 Shawn Lopez Is it going to be possible to run a display above 60Hz? I am looking to push a single monitor at 3440x1440p at 100Hz but all I see in these docks, hubs and adapters is 4k @60Hz. 3440x1440p is equivalent of 2.5k and typically when there is a refresh rate limitation it is due to the bandwidth limitation of the interface. According to https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/faq They say that Thunderbolt 3 is based on the DisplayPort 1.2 specification and can support up to 2 streams (eight lanes) of DisplayPort 1.2 video bandwidth. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying up to 100W of power. One 4K display (4096 x 2160) 30-bit @ 120 Hz I am looking to buy an 18ft or 30ft Thunderbolt 3 optical cable so I can put my gaming rig in an open closet right outside my room to eliminate the heat build up in my room.

Two told me that they wouldn’t even fix a product weeks after the warranty was over and they even offered to pay to get them to fix the product. According to their site, they say they do out of warranty repairs, but two people have told me they wouldn’t fix their computers. I’m thinking it was model specific, but still. I have not heard good things about Dell’s support, even when they were doing great during their peak years. Also, Dell recently sold their services division, so it sounds like they have been hurting for cash since their PC’s simply don’t bring in much profit. Oh well.. Eugen Where are the damn optical cables for TB3? Those are the single greatest reason to buy into thunderbolt 3, for moving your desktop to the closet. Khürt L. Williams What’s the use case for “optical cables”? Eugen It puts the pc in the closet/attic in a rack with the storage, ups and dead cats. It runs a long TB3 cable to a dock. It now has no noise and ugly boxes in the room. 🙂 actionjh “First launched in 2011, with the development name Light Peak, Thunderbolt was invested by a partnership of tech luminaries, including Intel, Apple, LaCie and others.” I doubt LaCie ever made an investment on Thunderbolt Chipset. Only Apple and Intel, financially. LaCie and others (G-Tech, CalDigit) can be considered first wave developers on the Thunderbolt platform for the device end. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface) This copper-based version of the Light Peak concept was co-developed by Apple and Intel. Apple registered Thunderbolt as a trademark, but later transferred the mark to Intel, which held overriding intellectual-property rights.[7] Marc Elser Stay away from the ZBook Thunderbolt 3 Elite Dock. It’s buggy as hell. Displays blinking, USB ports crashing (freeze), not beeing recognised by the ZBook. And HP is still no able to make it work reliably. I use it daily at work and have to restart my machine about 2-3 times a day because of this. Roger Firestone That Dell dock was recalled. It had a higher percentage of Amazon one-star ratings than I’ve ever seen. Terry, you should put a disclaimer on you site about the Dell dock before you get served yourself.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Intel possibly moving away from wearables, layoffs imminent By John Hoff - November 21, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter There’s some strong indications that Intel will be moving away from the wearables business. In their defense, it’s a difficult niche to be profitable in – except maybe for the bigger, more established companies in the smartwatch market like Samsung, LG, and Motorola. Intel had its own smartwatch – the Basis Peak – but that was subject to a recall because of some overheating issues. Now it looks like Intel may be getting off this train for good. Sources say that a massive layoff of employees from Intel’s New Devices Group is being planned, and that this would probably herald the company’s retreat from the wearables market. “Reports thus far have been varied, but all point to a large job loss for those in the NDG and the possible shut down of the group altogether,” Tech Crunch wrote about the info from these sources. And in the wake of the Basis Peak getting discontinued, a newer smartwatch was supposed to be launched – called the Basis Ruby. This new device would have come with heart-rate, activity, and sleep tracking features, but it looks like even this is being cancelled because of the general direction of moving away from wearables. There is no mention of the number of jobs being dropped, or when it will be announced. The sources say that this will happen before the year closes, so this is probably in the works right now. We’ll have to see if Intel goes public with this move.

Roston - Nov 21, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 8/10 Pros All-aluminum unibody Crisp and bright display Latest Intel processor Watchband hinge Very responsive touchscreen Cons Webcam is positioned beneath the display Right Shift key is small No SD card slot Lenovo has an update to its previously launched (and quite gorgeous) YOGA 900, and it is called the YOGA 910. This new model is no less beautiful than its 900 counterpart, bringing with it all the luxurious underpinnings and elements of the 900 with some notable updates, including a fully CNC-machined aluminum body and a 7th-gen Intel processor. Is the 910 worth the extra cost over the older 900? Read on to find out. Hardware The YOGA 910 is, first and foremost, a beautiful creation. The watchband hinge found on the previous model (and some other YOGA offerings) is included with the YOGA 910, as well as an all-aluminum body that, while slightly heavier than the previous version, takes the premium feel to a new level. The lid meets the base with a great deal of precision, and the watchband complements that with its slender, almost diminutive appearance. The watchband hinge is the perfect choice for a convertible laptop like the 910, enabling the display to be positioned at any angle from barely opened all the way back into full tablet mode. The display stays put wherever you position it; the hinge doesn’t have any wobble or any give, and it opens smoothly. The hinge aside, the aluminum on the lid, base and palm rest have a satin finish that’s pleasant to the touch, lending a nearly white appearance that isn’t prone to glares or smudges. The laptop’s edges, though, have a brushed high-shine look, adding an element of contrast without deviating from the all-aluminum construction. The left edge is unspoiled, featuring only two small USB-C ports, one for charging (USB 2.0) and the other for video-out (USB 3.0). The right edge features the power button, a 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo jack, and a USB 3.0 Type-A port. Joining these is a 720p webcam nestled below the display (when in regular laptop orientation), and a square silver fingerprint reader beneath the keyboard. The display is shrouded by very slim bezels save for the bottom edge (in laptop orientation), which features an atypically large — though in no way bothersome — black base. Two display resolutions are available with the YOGA 910, both of them with the 13.9-inch touchscreen offering: 3840 x 2160 UHD and 1920 x 1080 FHD. Our review model features the FHD resolution, so I can’t speak for the Ultra HD version’s quality. However, the 1920 x 1080 display is great itself, featuring both saturated (but not inaccurate) colors and a crisp look that doesn’t tread into over-sharpened territory. The YOGA 910’s keyboard and trackpad are arguably its two best features, at least in terms of everyday use. The low-profile keyboard is generously sized with keys that feel very pleasant while typing: they have a somewhat high level of resistance that doesn’t translate into stiffness. The trackpad also stands out as above average, not only responding well to touch but also being very easy to press. Unlike some past Lenovo models, I’ve not had any issues clicking or selecting items using the trackpad — it is very snappy with a low degree of travel and a sharp click when pressed. Finally, the YOGA 910 features four small rubber feet on the bottom, as well as a pair of speaker grilles drilled into the underside of the front edge. You won’t notice the speaker grilles unless you’re looking for them — they’re both relatively small and completely smooth with the underside of the laptop, being nearly imperceptible to the touch. Lenovo paid particular attention to the laptop’s audio; it features two JBL stereo speakers alongside Dolby Audio Premium. The speakers’ position on the rounded portion of the bottom edge means sound travels freely from the laptop to the user when in laptop configuration on a flat surface. Though it does become somewhat muffled in tablet orientation, the sound isn’t entirely sandwiched between the lid and base due to the bottom edge’s rounded design. One of the notable upgrades over the YOGA 900 is the newest model’s inclusion of Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Buyers can get the YOGA 910 is various configurations that include up to a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, as well as Intel HD graphics 620 and up to 16GB of DDR4 2133MHz memory. Storage, meanwhile, is available with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD. TECH SPECS Processor: Up to Intel® Core™ i7 processor OS: Up to Windows 10 Home Graphics: Intel® HD graphics 620 Webcam / Microphone: 720p with dual array microphone Memory: Up to 16 GB DDR4 2133 MHz Storage: Up to 1 TB PCIe SSD Audio: 2 x JBL®stereo speakers with Dolby Audio™ Premium Battery: Up to 9 hours with local video playback Display: – 13.9″ FHD IPS Multi-touch (1920×1080) with integrated camera – 13.9″ UHD IPS Multi-touch (3840×2160) with integrated camera Material: Aluminum Dimensions (inches): 12.72 x 8.84 x 0.56 Weight: Starting at 3.04lbs Backlight keyboard: Yes Fingerprint security: Yes Connectivity: – WiFi 802.11 ac – Bluetooth® 4.1 Ports: – USB 3.0 Type-C with video-out – USB 2.0 Type-C with charging – USB 3.0 with always-on charging – Audio combo jack Software & Performance The YOGA 910 only features two included bits of software: Lenovo OneKey Recovery and Lenovo Utility. The laptop runs Windows 10 Home 64, and so obviously you’ll also have access to Cortana and the other latest Windows features. Lenovo rates the YOGA 910’s battery life at up to 9 hours, depending on usage. This isn’t the longest run time Lenovo offers by any means, but is pretty great for an ultrabook of the caliber. Assuming you’re not doing something that’ll drain the battery rapidly (mining Bitcoins, perhaps), you shouldn’t have much issue reaching that 9-hour mark. Performance, meanwhile, is excellent in terms of both practical usage and benchmarks. Our review model features the 7th-gen Intel Core i7- 7500U 2.70-2.90GHz processor, and its Geekbench score reflects that. You can compare the results to the previous model in our YOGA 900 review from earlier this year. After using the YOGA 910 for a while, my complaints are very few and very minor. The webcam’s position at the bottom of the display is a bit awkward. Imagine taking a selfie by holding your phone near your chest pointed upward — it’s not the most flattering angle, and so you’re going to have to rotate the screen backwards for a more traditional angle — which means losing access to the keyboard for typing in chat at the same time. The only other issue I encountered was the right-side Shift key, which is a small square rather than a large rectangle (the left-side Shift key is a rectangle). This means the average typist is going to hit the “Up” arrow key when moving for the right Shift key until they adjust their muscle memory. If you’re someone who does a considerable amount of typing, this small design choice could be a huge annoyance for the first couple weeks. It should be pointed out that the YOGA 910 does not feature an SD card slot, as is increasingly becoming a trend. You’ll need to use a USB-to-SD adapter. While this may not be a big deal to some users, it does make the laptop a few ticks less attractive for photographers and others who frequently deal with these media cards. Wrap-up The Lenovo YOGA 910 stands out amongst the crowd. It is an eye-catcher in every sense of the word, boasting an all-aluminum unibody, the attractive watchband hinge, slim bezels, and a satin finish. Things only get better from there, with an excellent display and the option of a 4K resolution, both USB-C and USB-A ports, and the latest Intel processors. Even a machine as great as the YOGA 910 is not without its foibles, though, which largely center around the bottom-positioned webcam, the decision to use a small right Shift key rather than smaller arrow keys, and the lack of an SD card slot. If none of those things bother you, the YOGA 910 would make an excellent primary laptop. Price starts at $1,049.99 USD on Lenovo’s website.

Here's what it plans to do with it. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 21, 2016 at 4:10PM Back in August, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced it would purchase deep-learning chip startup Nervana systems. Re/code, citing a "source with knowledge of the deal," says Intel paid around $408 million for the company. Image source: Intel.  Although this acquisition is quite small for Intel, which raked in $3.4 billion in net income last quarter, the company seems to be quite bullish on Nervana's technology for its deep-learning and artificial-intelligence efforts. Let's take a closer look at what Intel's near-term plans are for this technology, then I'll finish off with what I expect to see Intel do with the technology in time. "Lake Crest" arrives in 2017 Intel says it will "test first silicon" of a deep learning-specific chip code-named Lake Crest during the first half of 2017 and will "make it available to key customers later in the year." Lake Crest is probably Intel's name for the Nervana Engine chip that Nervana was working on before Intel scooped the company up. According to Nervana's website, the Nervana Engine is a chip that can deliver deep-learning training speeds "10 [times] faster than conventional [graphics processing unit]-based systems and frameworks." The Nervana Engine. Image source: Nervana.  That chip is manufactured in what the company says is a "commodity 28 [nanometer] manufacturing process." This, the company claimed, "affords Nervana room for further improvements by shrinking to a 16 [nanometer] process in the future." Knights Crest comes later After Intel makes Lake Crest available, it intends to release a product that it calls Knights Crest. That chip, Intel says, "tightly integrates best-in-class Intel Xeon processors with the technology from Nervana." Lake Crest is manufactured on a commodity 28-nanometer technology, and Nervana indicated that the successor to Lake Crest would be manufactured in a 16-nanometer technology. Since only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) offers a 16-nanometer technology, this points to TSMC as the manufacturer for Nervana's products. That means any Intel product that integrates Nervana technology launched in the near term will probably involve two separate chips together on the same package, rather than a single piece of silicon with both Intel and Nervana tech in it. Beyond Knights Crest I suspect that the next step for Intel as it relates to Nervana will be to bring a future version of the Nervana Engine to its own manufacturing technology. Indeed, one of the main reasons Intel bought programmable logic vendor Altera last year was that the company believed it could gain a competitive edge by moving Altera's products over to its own manufacturing technology. We'll see over the next few years how that all plays out. But I don't see why Nervana's technology, which seems as though it should benefit from advanced manufacturing technology, wouldn't be a prime candidate for Intel's manufacturing technology as well. Once Intel can pull that off, I see the company putting together a whole new type of chip that integrates the company's Xeon processor technology as well as Nervana's technology into a single piece of silicon. Such a product could be much more efficient than two separate chips bolted together on the same package. Business implications If Intel's Nervana buy is successful and if the market for deep learning continues to boom, then Intel stands to see increased revenue and profit from the sale of standalone deep learning-oriented products such as Lake Crest and, later, from integrated products. I don't see much of a future for standalone chips, and in the longer term I think all Nervana technology will be integrated with Intel's either on the same package or on the same silicon die as traditional Xeon processors. So once Intel starts selling integrated products, the ultimate financial impact will probably manifest itself as an increase in Intel's server chip average selling prices. This isn't going to be a game changer for Intel's business from a revenue perspective, since it's very hard for any one new product category to move the needle for a company as large as Intel. However, the better Intel can address profitable growth markets, the better off the company will be over the long term. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Brandon Lewis, Technology Editor - Leave a Comment Do you remember when one advantage of the ARM architecture was its limited number of instructions? After all, the “R” in “ARM” stands for reduced instruction set computing (RISC), and the benefit of this smaller instruction set architecture (ISA) was that it was simpler to program than complex instruction set computing (CISC) ISAs such as the x86-64 instruction set (which currently includes more than 2,000 instructions[1]). The more intuitive approach to programming and the fact that instruction sets for all ARM CPUs up to version 2 were available in the public domain helped the architecture gain popularity, and eventually aided in the mass adoption of ARM-based processors seen in the market today. However, as ARM IP took hold in segments ranging from mobile to networking to embedded systems, it became necessary to develop new cores tailored to those applications (Cortex-A, Cortex-M, and Cortex-R variants among them), and with them, new instructions. As a result, an ISA that originally included fewer than 100 instructions ballooned to 1070 in the ARMv8 architecture according to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and ARM eventually elected to make their instruction sets proprietary in order to maintain them in accordance with their burgeoning semiconductor IP business. Unfortunately, the upfront licensing fees for an ARM IP core can range anywhere between $1 million and $10 million depending on the design[2], making the microarchitectures, and hence, the ISA, impractical for consideration by many academics and small startups. Realizing the complexity of the Intel ISA and the exclusivity (and explosion) in ARM’s, a team of academics at the University of California, Berkeley embarked on a what they thought would be a short project to develop a new RISC-based ISA. After completing the ISA in 2010 they made it available to the open source community, but received several complaints when attempting to make a change to it shortly thereafter. At that point the team realized the opportunity for an open-standard RISC ISA that was locked down – indefinitely. And so, RISC-V was born. Fewer and freer RISC-V is an open standard ISA, but as opposed to other open-source RISC implementations like OpenRISC, it is not standardized around a particular processor microarchitecture. Rather, RISC-V defines four base integer ISAs for 32-, 64-, and 128-bit processors that contain fewer than 50 hardware instructions each: the 32-bit RV32I; the 64-bit RV64I; the 128-bit RV128I; and the RV32E, which is a 16-register subset of the RV32I. A number of standard extensions also exist, including the general-purpose ISA (classified extension “G”); integer multiply/divide (classified extension “M”); atomic memory operations (AMOs) and load-reserved/store conditional (LR/SC, classified extension “A”); single-precision floating-point (classified extension “F”); double-precision floating-point (classified extension “D”); quad-precision floating-point (classified extension Q); and an optional compact subset for reduced code sizes (classified extension “C”). In addition, vector and crypto extensions are currently underway in working groups at the RISC-V Foundation. RISC-V was designed to operate independently of microarchitectural features, and, as mentioned, once work on an ISA component is finished by the Foundation it is frozen, forever. The ISA also provides clear separation between system software layers, with straightforward communications between an operating system (OS) and the system or applications facilitated through a system binary interface (SBI) and application binary interface (ABI), respectively (Figure 1). [Figure 1 | The RISC-V ISA communicates with the system execution environment (SEE) through a system binary interface (SBI), with the application execution environment (AEE) through the application binary interface (ABI), and with the hypervisor execution environment (HEE) through a hypervisor binary interface (HBI) in systems that employ a hypervisor.] What this means for chip makers is that, outside of the locked down opcode space reserved for the base ISAs and extensions (both current and planned), the Foundation has guaranteed not to intrude on remaining greenfield opcode space with future modifications. That greenfield opcode space is therefore available for developers to create their own instructions, allowing the standard to be extended in a proprietary way that, as Ted Speers, Head of Product Architecture and Planning for the SoC Group at Microsemi and a member of the Board of Directors at the RISC-V Foundation reveals, allows them to innovate around the “secret sauce that is really in the microarchitecture that you build around it.” “What’s important about the ISA at the end of the day is it’s not important. What’s important is that people can build and innovate a computer architecture with something that is well done,” Speers says. “Ultimately, the goal is that RISC-V becomes the common language of all new computer architectures going forward. “Although at its root it’s just another ISA, a lot of thought has gone into making RISC-V extensible, so there are natural groupings of instructions that you might want to use,” he continues. “For a microcontroller (MCU) you might just want to use the compressed instructions, or not the floating-point instructions. The point there is that the language is built and architected with different extensions that are appropriate for your application.” The minimalist flexibility and technology agnosticism of the RISC-V ISA makes it applicable in processor designs ranging from embedded MCUs to high-performance data center processors, as well as in heterogeneous system on chips (SoCs) that include multiple IP cores (Figure 2). Traditionally, the various IP in complex SoCs has required vast amounts of expertise spread out over large teams just to get the assorted cores talking to one another, much of which can be eliminated through comprehensive RISC-V libraries, such as those being developed by NVIDIA. [Figure 2 | The Microsemi SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA is among the first embedded processing solutions compatible with the RISC-V ISA (RV32IM implementation), and is supported by the company’s Libero SoC Design Suite and Eclipse-based SoftConsole integrated development environment (IDE).] Equally as important as the technology is the fact that RISC-V is license- and royalty-free, and operates under a BSD open source license, not a GNU license. Under a BSD license the standard can be used and extended without having to return those proprietary extensions to the open source community, enabling companies to leverage the foundations of RISC-V while still protecting the differentiation of special instructions tied to a microarchitecture that set their solutions apart. “If you’re in college or you’re at a startup and you want to make an innovation in computer architecture, your starting point should be RISC-V,” Speers says. “With RISC-V you can have complete control over the architecture you want to build with a well-designed ISA.” Reigniting innovation in semiconductors Tech industry giants such as Micosoft, HP, and Google have joined the RISC-V Foundation, alongside startups like Codasip and SiFive that are already bringing RISC-V-based solutions to market. RISC-V has been upstreamed by major open source projects including the Free Software Foundation, BeanUtils, the GCC, and Fedora, all of which indicates not only a growing amount of interest in RISC-V as an accessible technology, but also one with real commercial viability. But it’s just another ISA, right? “The whole vision is how to drive down costs, everywhere actually, starting with the ISA,” Speers explains. “I view RISC-V as the kernel for reshaping how design is done in semiconductors, and starting to dramatically lower the cost of producing new chips. That’s the end goal in mind. It’s not that the RISC-V Foundation can proudly say that they have this ISA, it’s that they want to dramatically lower costs – reignite innovation in semiconductors.” To learn more about RISC-V, the RISC-V Foundation, or upcoming workshops, visit riscv.org.

Image: txking/Shutterstock In this era of acqui-hiring and pressure for tech firms to exit, there may be a danger that start-ups will sell out before they reach their full potential, writes John Kennedy. About a year ago, I met some start-ups in the life sciences world and marvelled at all the regulatory and financial hoops they had to go through, just to come up with a viable product they could bring to market. “Yeah, all I really want to do right now is get it to the point where we can make an exit,” one of the company founders said wearily. ‘In the last 18 months, a number of very exciting businesses were sold that I believe could have gone on and potentially become the next Kerry Group or Ryanair’ – RONAN PERCEVAL “Sacrilege!” my mind screamed. But yet I sympathised. You see, I still dream of a day when an Irish tech company will be a household name worldwide. When I hear of or report companies being acquired, part of my mind wonders: “What might have been?” Every exit is different A decade ago, there was a real sense that when a company was acquired – or sold out, depending who you were talking to – there was frustration that they could have gone the distance and gone public, like the numerous Israeli companies that float on Nasdaq by comparison. Now, an exit is an exit. The buck stops there and no one really asks: was it a successful exit though? Why did they exit? Did the founders get anything for their efforts? Who really wins here? We applaud exits through trade sales as if that was something to celebrate, not asking ourselves what might have been. This is not a black and white issue. Companies sell for many reasons. In the present era, acqui-hiring (buying a company to bring in the talent) is an accepted norm in the technology world. Companies like Apple and Google do this all the time and with such frequency that it rarely hits the news radar. Sometimes, a trade sale is the logical next step for the technology to develop. A tech giant like Microsoft or Intel may have the resources to bring the technology further along, and it is a nice result for the founders and investors. Movidius, the Irish chip firm behind AI technology in Google devices and drones from DJI, was acquired by Intel for a rumoured $300m. I sense it was the logical next step if the technology was to have a future. With Intel’s resources behind it, anything is possible. I sense the logic was the same for Cork firm InfiniLED, which was acquired by Facebook-owned Oculus to bring the technology forward. This was actually good news for Cork, because the company is likely to double employment. The same is likely for Barricade, the Cork company led by David Coallier, which was acquired by infosec giant Sophos for both its people and its AI-based technology. Then there is the mammy and daddy of all exits in Irish tech industry history: Verizon’s $2.4bn acquisition of Fleetmatics, a company founded above a shop in Terenure in 2004, which grew to connect 37,000 business customers and 737,000 vehicles. In a sense, Fleetmatics did go the distance; it became a multinational player and it listed on Nasdaq. Its acquisition came just two months after Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $25bn in cash. And then, of course, there are the acquisitions probably brokered by venture capital investors who want a return on their investment after five to seven years of round after round. This begs the question: how many companies prematurely sell out before their time because investors require a return? This isn’t so much a dirty little secret of the tech world as much as it is going to be an ongoing reality, as venture investments peak but the trickle of tech firms to IPO slows. Twilio and Atlassian were the two biggest IPOs of 2016, and now all eyes are on Snap Inc, with an IPO valued between $20bn and $25bn when it floats in March 2017. Its investors, who backed it to the tune of $1.8bn earlier this year, will do quite nicely out of the flotation. There are a myriad of reasons why a trade sale makes sense. One such reason is that it is the right thing to do for the technology and for the founders to develop to the next step of the journey. But the elephant in the room is the issue of trade sales that happen because investors require the exit for their balance sheets. It is nothing personal. That’s just business. Research in September by Mind the Bridge and CrunchBase on transatlantic M&As focused on 6,000 start-up acquisitions performed by US and European companies. It revealed that a total of 82pc of the deals have been completed by US companies. Only 18pc were by European companies. In other words, three out of four start-ups have been acquired by US companies. Some 21pc of the deals have been completed by Silicon Valley companies. Among the top 15 acquirers in the ranking, there are 11 Silicon Valley companies. None of them are from Europe; the first European one – Germany’s SAP – ranks 33rd. Long-term vision My thoughts on the long-term viability of young Irish tech companies were stirred in the past week by two founders I spoke to, who have eschewed successive rounds of venture capital in order to do things on their own terms. Business software company Teamwork, led by Peter Coppinger and Daniel Mackey, is ploughing $2m of its own cash into a new office refit, aimed at enticing the top developers in Europe to consider Cork. This comes two years after they spent €500,000 on the Teamwork.com domain name. At first, Coppinger recalled, people on internet forums thought this was a pair of entrepreneurs spending VC cash irresponsibly. “We weren’t VC backed, it was our own money,” Coppinger explained at the recent Web Summit in Lisbon. “We could have gone off and bought two Maserati cars but we decided instead to double down, reinvest in our company, and we spent half a million on a domain name. It was the biggest decision we ever made and it was amazing for us. Things have really taken off since that point.” Founded in 2007, Coppinger said that Teamwork – which employs 73 people and has 2.8m users worldwide from among 268,000 paying companies, including PayPal and Disney – is in charge of its own destiny. Turnover at the company has increased year-on-year and in 2015, the company is understood to have recorded €14.5m in revenues, and is eyeing a €20m target for 2016. The objective, says Coppinger, is to become a €100m per annum company. At the Web Summit, Coppinger said he had a boilerplate email prepared for venture capitalists who wanted to meet him. “I politely pointed out that we are not taking on investment but I’d be happy to meet for a coffee or a beer if they wanted to discuss tech trends.” He added: “We have millions in the bank, we are totally self-funded, there are only two owners; myself and Dan. We’re putting a share option scheme in next year to give a chunk of the company to all of the long-term employees. “We don’t have any plans to exit in the foreseeable future. We have a nine-year plan. We have a huge vision for where we want to take the company,” Coppinger said. Another company I spoke to that has no plans to exit any time soon is Phorest, the salon-booking software company founded by Ronan Perceval, Dylan Collins and Sean Blanchfield in 2003. While Collins and Blanchfield went their separate ways to form Demonware, which was bought by Activision in 2007 for $17m, Perceval steadily built Phorest up through tough times and a lot of bootstrapping. Today, Phorest has 110 employees and is profitable with revenues of around €9m. He told me last week that he believes start-ups are actually under too much pressure to sell. “We don’t intend to do another round of funding if we can help it, because we are of the belief that the real opportunity in this industry is over the long run of over 20 years. If we raise more money, then the outlook of the company will naturally become more short-term, as investors need a return within 5-7 years.” Aside from an initial angel funding round of €1.2m, Perceval said the decision not to take further investment had actually been the saving of the company when it went through ropey times and might have had to sell too early. “People sell out too early in my opinion. This isn’t to rain on anyone’s parade, because I know how hard it is to get a company to any sort of scale. But once a half-decent offer comes along, not only are your investors keen to realise their investment, but it means you would be financially secure for life. It is very hard to turn down. “Once a company exits, it usually means the end of the road for that idea. I know there are exceptions but they are very rare. In the last 18 months, a number of very exciting businesses were sold that I believe could have gone on and potentially become the next Kerry Group or Ryanair. “So how do we change that mindset? One way is for companies to bootstrap or be more self-funded, because then they are less under pressure to sell. Another is to encourage a situation where entrepreneurs can take more off the table, so that they aren’t under financial pressure or temptation when an offer comes along. I know the top guys in Enterprise Ireland are thinking deeply about this and am hoping to see some changes in policy from them around this,” Perceval said. The state agency Enterprise Ireland’s role in changing this mindset should indeed be interesting. After all, it ranks third in the world for seed investment, according to PitchBook. I used to hear of consternation at Enterprise Ireland when good software companies sold too early for any number of reasons. Today, those reasons are less obvious in an era where acqui-hiring as the destiny of the technology is seen as good business practice. But if companies are also under pressure to sell too early, that should be setting off alarm bells in the highest circles.

The segment didn’t really manage to take off how the tablets segment did. Some companies are known to have abandoned their plans for building the next smartwatch, and looks like Intel is all set to join the list. A new report claims that the company is laying off almost all of its staff from the wearable division. The report also talks about the unannounced Basis Ruby that can been cancelled, owing to the recall of the Basis Peak earlier this year due to overheating issues. The Basis Ruby was likely to be armed to track heart-rate, activities, sleep and more. The layoffs are likely to take place before the year end, if the report is to be believed. “The NDG was already folded into Intel’s New Technologies Group back in April, so an entire closure of the NDG could lead to wider restructuring within the division,” points out Slashgear. However, Intel had responded to the news article and told TechCrunch that it isn’t stepping back from wearables. However, it didn’t comment on the lay offs directly. An Intel spokesperson told the news site, “Intel is in no way stepping back from the wearables business. In fact, we have several products in the works that we are very excited about, as well as prior launches that highlight our wearable technology such as the TAG Heuer Connected watch and recent Oakley Radar Pace smart eyewear.” Back in 2014, when the smartwatch and fitness tracking segment looked promising, Intel had acquired the fitness-tracking watchmaker Basis.

Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 models on Verizon network should have higher download speeds on paper than Intel-powered ones AT&T, however, in testing, Bloomberg reports it was found that iPhone 7 models from both Verizon and AT&T had similar speeds in real life. The Bloomberg report cited researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights for testing. Recode in a separate report citing sources claims that Apple indeed limited some iPhone 7 models featuring Qualcomm chipset to match the speeds of Intel-powered chipsets. "It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible," said Ina Fried in her report. Apple has however refuted the claims of different download speeds.Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller commenting on the report said, "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." For those unaware, the iPhone 7 models sold through Verizon (and Sprint) feature Qualcomm's X12 modem which is claimed to offer maximum download speeds of up to 600Mbps while iPhone 7 models on AT&T (and T-Mobile) are powered by Intel chipset with a maximum download speed of up to 450Mbps. Gabriel Tavridis, Head of Product at Twin Prime, on similar LTE speeds on the iPhone 7 models from Verizon and AT&T said, "The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities. I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip." Twin Prime from its internal testing claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S7 powered by the same Qualcomm X12 modem was way faster than the iPhone 7 on Verizon. There's no question that two models powered by different modems will perform same, but if the test reports are correct, then it seems Apple thought it would be awkward if iPhone 7 models on Verizon were faster than the ones on AT&T (and T-Mobile).

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Nov 20, 2016 at 3:35PM Image source: Disney. The next generation of nighttime entertainment kicks off at Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Florida resort tonight. The theme-park giant is teaming up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), sending a fleet of 300 illuminated drones up in the air for a nightly spectacle at its Disney Springs shopping and entertainment complex.  Disney received clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones for entertainment purposes earlier this month, and after a few test runs in recent days we've arrived at tonight's debut of "Starbright Holidays -- An Intel Collaboration." The show features the drones with multi-colored lights forming swirling versions of Christmas trees, doves, and other pieces of illuminated art, synchronized to a soundtrack of classic holiday songs. The shows will run at 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. nightly through Jan. 8.  The show will take place over the lake that wraps along the perimeter of Disney Springs, offering decent viewing angles through most of the property. Keeping the drones over the lake also helps with safety concerns, as drones that fail during a performance would simply fall into the water. The drones are all backed with sensors so they don't collide with one another.  It's the season of giving Intel and Disney have a win-win relationship here. Intel gets to show off its Shooting Star drones, and while this is solely an entertainment application the real goal for Intel is synchronized drones in commercial operations that can help speed up everything from security operations to infrastructure inspections. Disney, in return, gets a high-tech spectacle that requires little in terms of human labor in this collaboration. Just one person can control the operation of the 300 drones. It also goes without saying that having a marquee attraction that will draw thousands, if not tens of thousands, of tourists and locals to Disney Springs will pay off in an even bigger way. Disney recently updated what used to be called Downtown Disney, adding several new high-end restaurants and stores to what was renamed Disney Springs earlier this year. This nightly holiday show will be successful, and it's safe to say that it will morph into a non-holiday drone show come January. The world's largest theme-park operator was struggling with Disney World attendance issues earlier this year, but it's fair to say that Disney Springs is drawing better now than Downtown Disney was in the past. Now that Disney's theme-park attendance turned around in Florida during the summer quarter and on-site hotel bookings are starting to pick up it sets the stage for a strong showing at Disney World in general and Disney Springs in particular during the peak holiday shopping season when it matters the most. Disney's drone show takes flight tonight, and if the media giant's aim is true, it will be the only thing that's still up in the air. Rick Munarriz owns shares of Walt Disney.

Buz Investors INTC Stock remains Bullish In October, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Everything seemed great until Intel management threw a wrench into the party and disappointed the street and investors when they lowered their fourth-quarter guidance. The investing community punished INTC stock by taking it down 5.9% the next day. This was only the beginning of the slide as INTC stock continued to sell off until support was finally met at $33.42. All this selling pressure was putting my bullish view on Intel stock to a test, and this is exactly what this investment was doing as it was completing a backtes INTC Stock remains Bullish INTC Stock remains Bullish All this selling pressure was putting my bullish view on Intel stock to a test, and this is exactly what this investment was doing as it was completing a backtest.

This pattern has the potential to take Intel stock back to levels not seen since the dotcom mania. That is when INTC stock peaked at $52.87 in August 2000. The backtest serves to reaffirm that this is still a possibility. In July 2016, INTC stock broke out of this consolidation pattern, signalling that a new impulse wave is underway. The price got off to a good start, but the rise in the price was halted after the disappointing earnings report that sent INTC stock tumbling. The good news is that the weakness in the price has done little in the way of damaging the overall picture. INTC Stock: Backtest Year-to-date, Intel stock has set up and traded along a well defined uptrend line. This line is created by connecting the troughs on the price chart, and this trend line has effectively acted as support when any selling took place in INTC stock. The sell-off in INTC stock, caused by the the earnings report, ended immediately after the price tested this trend line. As long as the price remains above this trend line, the trend toward higher prices is intact and the impulse wave should continue to develop. This article was written by Richard Dambrosi for on .

Ian King, Bloomberg News 7:57 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. (Photo: Kiichiro Sato / AP) It turns out not all iPhone 7s are created equal. The latest Apple Inc. smartphones that run on Verizon Communications Inc.’s network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T Inc. Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights. Neither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn’t using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." It would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts. "They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better," said Jan Dawson, founder of technology advisory firm Jackdaw Research LLC. "If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” But the move could backfire if customers realize their device isn’t performing to its full potential, or that it’s less capable than other handsets, analysts said. "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product," said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. The firm does paid analysis for smartphone suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. The component at the root of the performance gap is the modem, a tiny chip buried deep inside a phone’s innards that turns wireless signals into data and voice. The iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone for several years to have versions with different modems. Verizon users get an iPhone 7 with Qualcomm’s latest X12 modem — capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second. AT&T customers get a handset with an Intel modem that tops out at 450 megabits per second. Apple likely went with multiple suppliers to keep component costs in check. In field tests by Twin Prime, the Verizon version is a little faster than its AT&T stablemate — but not as fast as it could be. The firm proved this by doing the same tests onthe Samsung Galaxy S7, which also runs on Verizon’s network and uses the Qualcomm X12. The S7 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip, Twin Prime found. This was based on data from more than 100,000 phones downloading an image in large U.S. cities. Qualcomm’s X12 is capable of dealing with more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival, according to a report by Milan Milanovic, an analyst at Cellular Insights, which tests phones and networks. Apple didn’t enable this feature "to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel,”Milanovic wrote. Cellular Insights tests phones in labs with equipment that can vary the strength of the signal, basically approximating a phone moving from good coverage to poor coverage. The differences in performance between the handsets Milanovic tested were greatest when the phone signal was weakest, he said. Twin Prime and Cellular Insights have no relationships with chip makers, phone makers or wireless carriers. Four other network testing firms contacted by Bloomberg News said measuring phone data speeds is difficult because performance can be influenced by weather and other factors beyond the control of wireless providers and phone makers. Though none of these other firms disputed the findings of Twin Prime and Cellular Insights. In addition to creating a unified iPhone 7 user experience, leveling the playing field would also keep wireless carriers happy, according to some industry analysts. “Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners," saidJeff Kvaal, an analyst with Instinet LLC. "It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product." Representatives of AT&T, Verizon, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Companies that "de-feature or go with a less-advanced modem" may be left behind as the networks offer faster data speeds, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in a recent conference call, without naming specific firms. Apple is in this situation because it chose different modems for the latest iPhone. By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price. Qualcomm’s modems have for years been almost ubiquitous in high-end smartphones, including iPhones. Intel has struggled to break into this market and has used subsidies to try to win share in mobile. Sacrificing performance in return for cheaper components may not go down well with Apple users. "It was probably multiple factors that drove that decision. But in the end, it was a bad decision," said McGregor. "It is really hard to argue for doing this because Qualcomm really does have the best modem technology." Still, many users may not realize their iPhone is different from their friends’ iPhones. And even if they do, they may decide Apple isn’t responsible. Most consumers blame their wireless service provider when a phone doesn’t work well, Milanovic said. 37 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2gbvPnH TOP VIDEOS Rossetti architects design Ashe Stadium's retractable roof 4:58 Utica schools students study science in 3D 1:21 Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge 1:01 Crash test dummies brought to life at Humanetics 3:04 Mary Barra on the next generation Volt 13:47 Mary Sue Coleman says universities should be 'innovators' in economy 8:18 MSU plant geneticist explains his work 1:50

You Can Run ExTiX Linux with LXQt 0.10.0 and Kernel 4.8 on Intel Compute Stick GO The ultimate Linux system now runs on Intel Compute Stick Nov 21, 2016 01:35 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  GNU/Linux developer Arne Exton announced the availability of a new build of his ExTiX distribution, which has been designed to run on the Intel Compute Stick device. ExTiX Build 161119 is the new version of the Linux-based operating system, powered by the latest Linux 4.8 kernel and using the lightweight LXQt 0.10.0 desktop environment as default graphical interface. However, the most important change in this release is that it ships with a kernel engineered to support the Intel Compute Stick mini computer. "I have made a new version of ExTiX – The Ultimate Linux System. I call it ExTiX 16.5 LXQt for the Intel Compute Stick. Build 161119 is only for Intel Compute Sticks. i.e. you can’t run the system on other computers," said Arne Exton in the announcement. "Build 161119 uses 'my' kernel 4.8.0-26-exton-IntelAtom with special patches." Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" and Ubuntu 16.10 "Yakkety Yak" Just like previous releases of ExTiX, Build 161119 is based on Canonical's latest Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) operating system, and the Debian Testing repositories, which will become Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" sometime in spring 2017. But, as mentioned above, it replaces the Unity user interface with LXQt 0.10.0. All packages included in ExTiX Build 161119 are at their latest versions as of November 19, 2016, and you can study the full list if you're curious to know what exactly landed in the new version. The most important software pre-installed are Google Chrome as default web browser, BlueGriffon WYSIWYG editor, and LibreOffice office suite. Users will also be able to use the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail and news client, SMPlayer video editor, GParted partition editor, and Samba for reaching Windows computers. GCC and other compilation tools are available as well if you want to install software from sources.

Photo: Mint Bengaluru: Helpshift Inc., a start-up making customer support software for mobile apps, on Tuesday said it has raised $2 million of funding from Cisco Investments, a unit of networking equipment giant Cisco Systems Inc. This follows a Series B round that Helpshift raised in June, netting $23 million from Microsoft Ventures, Salesforce Ventures and existing investors Intel Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, True Ventures and Visionnaire Ventures. Helpshift, which started in 2012 in Pune and is now headquartered in California in the US, had earlier raised $13 million from Intel Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, True Ventures and Visionnaire Ventures. Typically, users looking for customer support have to e-mail companies or look up FAQ pages on their websites. Helpshift provides the software for in-app support. With this investment, Cisco will work with Helpshift to integrate its in-app customer support solutions with Cisco’s contact centre solutions. “We continue to invest in strategic solutions to help propel technology developments that will solve challenges for our customers, partners, and beyond,” said Rob Salvagno, head of Cisco Investments and vice president of Cisco Corporate Development, in a statement. “Through our investment, we look forward to supporting Helpshift to enable companies to provide best in-class mobile customer care through their data-centric messaging platform.” “Just like customer service moved away from phone (voice) to email in the era of the Web, we are now seeing a transition where customer service is moving inside apps to eliminate all the friction in the process of supporting users. With the additional funding from Cisco Investments, we are looking to help the entire contact center industry transition from being reactive to proactive while driving higher customer satisfaction and lowering cost,” said Abinash Tripathy, chief executive of Helpshift. The company says its software is currently installed on 1.3 billion devices and works with customers such as VirginMedia, Microsoft, WesternUnion, Flipboard, Shyp, Luxe and WordPress. A large part of its clients list are gaming companies—with thousands of users. They include Supercell, the makers of Clash of Clans, and Zynga.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Microsoft may bring x86 compatibility to Windows on ARM by Zak Killian  3:32 PM on November 22, 2016 Remember the Surface RT? Microsoft's ill-fated attempt to break away from its dependence on Intel was more or less ignored by the market, probably due to its reliance on the Windows Store and its limited selection of ARM-compatible apps. As it happens, Windows on ARM isn't actually dead yet. I know, I was surprised too. A few companies are still producing Windows phones and tablets. There are even rumors regarding an upcoming Surface-branded smartphone. Perhaps in an effort to make those devices more broadly useful in the Windows ecosystem, rumors are surfacing that suggest Microsoft is working on an x86 emulator that could let most of today's Windows applications run on ARM devices. Apps from the Windows Store should already work seamlessly on any Windows device (thanks to the Windows Runtime), but desktop apps obviously aren't going to work on an ARM machine without modification. The ability to run classic Win32 applications on a Windows 10 Mobile device could make those devices a viable choice for organizations that rely on mission-critical apps not found on any other platform. One of the biggest possible beneficiaries of an x86 compatibility layer for Windows on ARM devices might be Microsoft's Continuum feature. For the unfamiliar, Continuum is the company's name for Windows 10 Mobile's ability to automatically sense its usage context. That means that a phone app might change to a desktop version when an HDMI cable is plugged in, and offer to connect to bluetooth input devices. Continuum looks pretty neat as-is, but the ability to seamlessly switch between touch and desktop modes would arguably be more useful with a full range of desktop apps to go with it. An x86-to-ARM compatibility layer could be a good solution for this conundrum. Now, emulators are slow, and for all their wonderful qualities, ARM processors aren't known for being speed demons. A pure x86 emulator on ARM probably wouldn't provide functional results. However, last night Twitter user @h0x0d (who goes by the name WalkingCat) found a reference in the latest Windows Development Kit to "CHPE". That cryptic acronym could mean almost anything, but @h0x0d seems to think it refers to a "hybrid x86-on-ARM64" technology. it looks like Windows's hybrid x86-on-ARM64 tech has a new name "CHPE", whatever it means :-) maybe something like Compound Hybrid PE ? pic.twitter.com/aW1RLYU3dM — WalkingCat (@h0x0d) November 21, 2016 Mary Jo Foley over at ZDnet says her sources have told her that the C stands for "Cobalt." Besides being the name of a fun multiplayer game from Mojang, Cobalt is also apparently the codename of Microsoft's x86-on-ARM technology. She posits that the HP stands for, well, HP, based on strong demand for x86 apps from Elite X3 users. Ms. Foley then goes on to say that, according to her sources, Cobalt is slated to come along with the "Redstone 3" update to Windows 10 coming out in the Fall of 2017.

 Microsoft might get to take its last shot at the iPhone after all Matt Weinberger Nov. 22, 2016, 2:55 PM 33,679 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay with the Microsoft Lumia 950 phone.Getty Images/Andrew Burton Microsoft's dream of making Windows a major player in smartphones is all but dead, with 1% overall market share. Even top executives are signaling that the company is treating Windows 10 Mobile as more of an academic exercise than a serious product. And yet a new report from ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley indicates that Microsoft could have something up its sleeve. Microsoft is said to be working on a project, to be finished by late 2017, that would let full versions of Windows software run on an ARM processor — the same processor used in the vast majority of smartphones. While that tech could be used on any Windows phone, this report just adds fuel to the idea that Microsoft is still secretly hard at work on the Surface Phone, the long-rumored device that the company had hinted would be a serious contender with Apple's ubiquitous iPhone. To understand why, it helps to know a little history. Continuum Windows 10 Mobile's flagship feature is what Microsoft calls Continuum. Basically, you can plug certain Windows phones like the Microsoft Lumia 950 or HP Elite x3 into a display, attach a mouse and keyboard, and use it like a computer. It works, but it's limited to a few specially designed apps from Microsoft's anemic Windows Store app market, including the mobile versions of Microsoft Office. According to various reports and industry whispers over the past year or so, the Surface Phone's breakthrough feature would be the ability to run any piece of Windows software while in that Continuum mode. That would be a huge deal for large businesses, where the majority of work still gets done with PC software rather than apps. Given Microsoft's well-documented ability to sell to those same big customers, it would indeed be a competitive threat to the iPhone, at least among professionals. Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile Continuum in action.Microsoft But it's much easier said than done. Smartphones largely use ARM processors, which balance power consumption with performance. Even Apple put an ARM chip in its newest MacBooks to power the Touch Bar and is rumored to be considering a move to ARM for future MacBooks. The problem is that Windows for PC, and thus Windows PC software, is designed to run only on Intel's trademark x86 processor architecture. And facing competitive pressure from ARM and Qualcomm, Intel scuttled plans to build its next major smartphone chip, seemingly sinking the Surface Phone before it was even officially announced. Emulation What Microsoft is reportedly building is the next best thing to an Intel-powered phone, given the circumstances. In technical parlance, what Microsoft is said to be building is an "emulator" — a way to trick a gadget into thinking it's another gadget. It's similar technology to what Nintendo is using with the NES Classic to get old games to run perfectly on a smaller, more modern console. This emulator would essentially trick Windows software into thinking it's running on an Intel processor, even if it's actually running on an ARM-powered smartphone. Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops use a secondary ARM processor for the Touch Bar.Getty The drawback with emulation is power consumption, since it takes way more processor resources to run software in emulation than it would to run a proper app on that device. It's one thing to run NES games from the '80s in emulation — it's another entirely to use powerful enterprise software, and it would drain any phone's battery in a heartbeat. But as Ars Technica's Peter Bright notes, that's not such a huge deal if you're using the hypothetical Surface Phone in Continuum mode, since you would probably be plugged into the wall anyway. The Surface Phone still isn't a sure thing, especially given Microsoft's recent hesitation to talk about any kind of plans for mobile. From a technology perspective, though, it seems that things are slowly but surely starting to come together, if and when Microsoft decides to take what could well be its last shot at mobile dominance. Microsoft declined to comment.

Lenovo Lenovo’s Miix line of Microsoft Surface-like 2-in-1s just added the Miix 510, which went on sale last month. Yet rumors of an upcoming successor, the Miix 520, are making the rounds today. According to a report and leaked product images from WinFuture, the device won’t look much different than the 510. Yet it will come with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor, a bump in RAM from 8GB to 16GB over the 510, a fingerprint sensor, and an increase in battery life to 10 hours on a single charge. Of course, the Kaby Lake addition is the big selling point here. The Miix 510 is shipping now starting at $599 with Intel’s 6th generation Core i7 chip. For those looking for a boost in performance, it could be worth waiting for a new round of 2-in-1s with Intel’s latest chip. Because Kaby Lake is just an incremental, mid-generation upgrade to Skylake, it’s not going to offer a groundbreaking jump in speed. It will, however, offer some modest gains in power efficiency and double-digit percentage jumps in app and web performance.

Credit: HP More like this AMD provides upgrade path to Zen with new business PC chips 5 burning questions about AMD's Zen chip Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga: The shape of convertibles to come Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana PC makers can't wait to test AMD's mysterious Zen chip in laptops. For now, HP and other manufacturers are making the best out of AMD's current chip offerings, the latest of which target professional users. HP has announced the EliteBook 705 family of laptops with AMD's Pro chips, which were released last month. Starting at $769, the laptops seem pricey for AMD-based systems. The EliteBook 705 family includes the 12.5-inch 725, the 14-inch 745 and the 15.6-inch 755 models. These systems can be configured with full-HD screens, up to 500GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. The laptops are targeted at business users, which may explain the price. Most high-priced laptops have Intel chips, but AMD wants a share of that market as it tries to squeak more profit out of chip sales. The fastest chip option is the dual-core AMD PRO A12-9800B, which draws 65 watts of power and has a clock frequency up to 4.2GHz. For AMD, the chip is comparable to the Intel Core i5 chip based on the Skylake architecture. Notable features in the laptops include AMD's system management and security controls. AMD has a secure processor in which to store cryptographic data like fingerprints. In addition, system administrators can manage remote systems and deploy software updates to remote PCs. However, AMD Pro isn't as rich on security or manageability features as Intel's vPro. For example, vPro has better remote support or shutdown features. But the EliteBook 705 family is still cheaper than HP's vPro-based Skylake laptops, which start at over $900. Other features include 802.11ac wireless, an SD card slot, a micro SIM slot, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB Type-C slot, a DisplayPort slot and an optional webcam.

Or that USD 770 billion was the B2C e-commerce turnover in Asia Pacific, representing 43% of world market share and that 80% of all smartphones will be located in Emerging Markets, by 2020? Seedstars believes that it is fundamental that companies access these high growth opportunities and get the first mover advantage, so with the support of partners such as the SPECo,PayU, TRECC and Intel, they will be hosting the Seedstars Summit to address how technology and innovation from emerging markets will be impacting businesses in the next decade. The highlight of the event will be the final ceremony of the Seedstars World competition, where up to USD 1 million of equity investment will be awarded to the winners, as well as SaaS prizes worth over USD 90’000 for each winning startup from over 20 partners including AWS, Microsoft and Facebook Start.   1,000 guests from 55 countries Last year, the Seedstars Summit gathered 1000 guests from 55+ countries, where the 53 startup finalists gathered together with 100+ mentors and investors, culminating in 400 one-on-one meetings. Important prizes and investments were made such as the co-investment by Seedstars and Omidyar, into the Seedstars World global winner, Giraffe, representing South Africa. For this year’s fourth edition, 70 handpicked startups from 65 countries will be flying over to Switzerland together with other European entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, HNWIs, family offices, corporate executives, business angels, government officials, journalists and startup enthusiasts to join us for this unique experience. The event will take place on April 6th at the Swiss Tech Convention Center in Lausanne, where up to USD 500,000 in equity investment will be made in the “Seedstars World Global Winner”. The best startups in categories such as FinTech, Education, Intel Solutions, Most Innovative Startup, Best Woman Entrepreneur as well as the Public Vote Winner will also be awarded investments and other prizes by top industry leaders.   The competition More than 4’000 startups from Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America applied to participate in Seedstars World this year. Among the amazing startups that have been encountered are some incredible stories such as MyCash Online, winner for Malaysia, who created an e-Marketplace specifically designed for migrants living in Malaysia and Singapore to purchase products without online banking; Dalil the winner from Algeria whose founder is visually impaired and designed an object recognition and navigation system to help people deal with the same condition and Jamii offering a mobile micro-health insurance product for the low income and informal sector population at just $1 per month.   Seedstars Bootcamp & Semifinals 70 finalists will be coming to Switzerland to participate in a two-day Bootcamp where international investors & mentors from top accelerators like The Founder’s Institute and 500 startups, as well as top firms such as eBay, and Swiss Re, will coach these entrepreneurs on their business models, pitching skills and growth strategy. The semifinals, where the startups will not only pitch in front of international investors but participate in one-on-one’s with these investors (400 sessions organized on the last Seedstars Summit), will eliminate most of the startups from the competition. Only the top 12 startups will take part in the final round, the following day, during the Seedstars Summit.   The Summit and Final Ceremony In addition to the final ceremony, where several prizes and investments will be announced, the aim of the Summit is to discuss how to do business in emerging markets and the opportunities in building technology companies. The Summit will kick off with workshops and panels covering a wide range of topics such as: How to sell entrepreneurship and innovation to governments, How to pimp your cross-borders network or Innovations from EM that will impact how you live in 10 years.

Among previous speakers are Fabio Cannavale, CEO of lastminute.com group, Nina Teng, VP of Grab (the first Malaysian unicorn), Bright Simons, president of mPedigree, Dmitry Galperin, Investment Director of Runa Capital in Russia and Jesse Moore, CEO of MKOPA Solar in Kenya.   Prizes and awards In addition to the investment by Seedstars of up to USD 500,000 for the Seedstars World Global Winner, the FinTech investment track powered by PayU, will offer a chance for investment to the best FinTech startup, 1 pass access to the Seedstars Growth program and 5 tickets to Silicon Valley for a FinTech tour.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Skylake Xeon E5-2699v5 may pack up to 32 cores per socket by Wayne Manion  10:00 AM on November 22, 2016 While Intel's mainstream desktop CPUs have been stuck at four cores since the introduction of the Core 2 Quad in 2007, the core count in the silicon giant's Xeon server line of CPUs has continually increased. A Skylake-based Intel Xeon E5-2699v5 chip posted for sale at Chinese e-commerce site Taobao suggests the next round of Intel server CPUs will pack as many as 32 cores and 64 hardware threads into one socket. For comparison, the current top-of-the-line Xeon E5-2699v4 has 22 cores and 44 hardware threads. The actual listing provides scant information about the CPU in question, but TechPowerUp reports that the chip uses Intel's new LGA 3647 socket. Owners of servers with LGA 2011v3 sockets can forget about a drop-in replacement. TPU also says the chip in question is an engineering sample with a base clock of 2.1GHz. The Intel Xeon E5-2699v5 chip has a listed price of 26,500¥, which converts to about $3,850.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Netflix 4K streaming comes to the PC—but it needs Kaby Lake CPU You will also need latest version of Windows 10, Edge browser to get 4K video. by Mark Walton (UK) - Nov 22, 2016 1:57 pm UTC Login to bookmark 129 Orange Is The New Black, Netflix Netflix 4K streaming is coming to Windows PCs later this week—but only for the lucky few using seventh generation Kaby Lake processors from Intel. Netflix launched 4K streaming in 2014 on a select number of TVs before rolling it out to dedicated streaming boxes like the Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Nvidia Shield. 4K streaming on PC was notably missing from the rollout, due in part to piracy and DRM concerns from Hollywood studios and TV networks. In an effort to placate the studios, Microsoft introduced "PlayReady 3.0" with the Windows 10 Anniversary update. PlayReady 3.0 is a hardware-based DRM (digital rights management) system that requires dedicated decoding hardware, either on the CPU or on the graphics card, preventing the video stream from being captured in software or via an external capture device. There's also the matter of hardware decoding support for 10-bit HEVC, the 4K codec used by Netflix and other streaming services. Currently, only Intel's seventh generation Kaby Lake processors support 10-bit HEVC decoding. Older sixth generation Skylake CPUs only support 8-bit HEVC decoding. Technically, Nvidia's 10-series graphics cards—including the GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and GTX 1060—feature 10-bit HEVC decoding and PlayReady 3.0 support, but aren't listed as compatible. And then there's the browser: 4K streaming only works in Microsoft Edge, because it's the only browser that supports PlayReady DRM. Basically, streaming 4K Netflix on a PC requires a CPU that's in barely any devices right now (desktop chips aren't expected until sometime in 2017), the latest version of Windows 10, and using an unpopular browser, making it a largely useless feature. Who says DRM is bad for consumers, eh? This post originated on Ars Technica UK Expand full story Reader comments 129 You must login or create an account to comment.

By Liam Tung | November 22, 2016 -- 12:15 GMT (04:15 PST) | Topic: Mobility Fans of Microsoft Surface Pro challenger the Eve V have snapped up all 500 of the devices within three hours on an Indiegogo fundraiser. The Finnish startup on Monday also finally revealed prices for its sleek, black Windows 10 device, whose design and core features have been constructed from feedback from around 1,000 fans. ed bott Six months with the Surface Pro 4: Patches, lappability, and battery life are key Six months ago, I decided to replace my desktop PC with a Surface Pro 4 and a Surface Dock. Read More Eve has ended up with a 2-in-1 that shares a likeness to Microsoft's Surface Pro but with newer Intel processors, a bigger battery, loads of new and old-style ports, four speakers, and a fingerprint sensor cleverly embedded in the power button. It's also promising not to weigh down the device with bloatware. The brief Indiegogo campaign earned Eve over $500,000 to begin manufacturing the first batch of devices. However, Eve V fans can still preorder each of the three models, which will be delivered in April or May, shortly after the first 500 are sent to early backers. The starting price for the Eve V is $699 for the Intel Core m3 variant, which also features 8GB RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive, or SSD. The Core i5 model costs $959 and comes with 8GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD, while the top-of-the-line i7 model costs $1,399 and features 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Pre-order prices are significantly lower than the expected retail price of the Eve V. At current prices, it's drastically cheaper than a similarly-equipped Surface Pro 4. However, the discount for the i7 model is $770, so after the pre-order period ends it will cost $2,169, which is pretty close an equivalent Surface Pro 4. Fans who don't have the cash to pay the full pre-order price upfront can reserve a device with a down payment. The fee is $399 for the i7 model, $299 for the i5 model, and $199 for the m3 model. While Eve has stated that the device will ship with GPS, the company has not confirmed the feature's availability in its final proposed spec sheet. Eve says it will include GPS if it can confirm it works in the Wi-Fi model. If it doesn't, GPS will be included in a yet-to-be confirmed LTE model.

According to a MacRumors report, in some cases the laptop reports it is running Intel’s Iris Pro 580 integrated graphics card rather than the lower-end Intel HD Graphics 530 that Apple’s own specs list. While initial reports found the issue on laptops with Apple’s retail stores (leading some to believe Apple was using better graphics cards on its demo computers), that’s not the case. Several readers reported a similar inconsistency on laptops sold to them, indicating some type of issue. It does appear to be a bug within MacOS Sierra. Some reports note that the type of card reported changes depending on whether or not it was plugged to external power. The lower-end card is listed when running on battery power, but the Iris Pro 580 when it’s plugged in. More: DigitalTrends’ first impressions of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar More evidence that Apple is indeed using the HD Graphics 530 is found in the Device ID string, which is listed as “191b.” That’s the string for the card listed in the specs. Iris Pro 580 graphics cards are only intended to work with Intel’s Core i5-6350HQ and Core i7-6770/6870/6970HQ mobile processors, which are not included in any of the new MacBook Pros. While just speculation, Apple instead opted for lower end processors within the Skylake family, likely in an effort to extend battery life. At least for now, it doesn’t appear as if the reporting inaccuracies are anything more than just a “reporting error,” as no users reported any type of show-stopping problem. Even so, it’s yet another black mark for Apple’s latest laptop. Friday’s report is the second in as many days on Apple’s stumbles with the new MacBook Pro. On Thursday, reports surfaced that the laptop’s System Integrity Protection feature was disabled on some Touch Bar MacBook Pro models, potentially opening up users to malware attacks.

All week we’re publishing articles focused on everything Open Source, Free Software and Community, so keep checking the OSW tag for the latest updates. Open source is dominating the world, as it can be found everywhere nowadays. Virtual Reality, until recently, was an exclusively proprietary technology. But not anymore — OSVR strives to change this and make a difference. Some readers may already be familiar with the tech as Elio covered it here at SitePoint briefly in one of our Sourcehunt articles on emerging tech. In this article, we’ll look at it in a bit more detail. OSVR stands for Open Source Virtual Reality. The lead developers for the headset and tech are Razer, a company very well known among gamers and Sensics, which focuses on manufacturing VR products. The platform is backed by more than three hundred partners, including industry leaders such as Intel. What is OSVR all about? OSVR is not just about another headset. It is a whole movement. According to its developers, the platform does not aim at competing with its competitors. OSVR is designed to work with several other head-mounted displays and is on a mission to establish an open standard so that existing devices and software can become interoperable. Developers and consumers with OSVR-compatible HMDs, can already get started by configuring their equipment. The OSVR website features a perfect showcase of their software (also called “experiences”) that are compatible and ready to run. There are already games, media players, emulators and more! There is lots of SteamVR-powered content too. At this time, OSVR’s supported operating systems include Android, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Headsets (HDKs) Interested in giving OSVR a try? Right now there are two different headsets — called Hacker Development Kits (HDKs) — which you can choose from. OSVR HDK1 made its debut in July 2015. It features a 5.5 inch OLED display, supporting 1920 x 1080 pixels in resolution (960 x 1080 per eye). HDK1 is bundled with sensors like an accelerometer, gyroscope and compass. Three USB 3.0 ports — two internal and one external — are present. Prices start from 300 USD. OSVR HDK2 was revealed last summer and is very similar to its predecessor but comes with an improved display. It supports 2160 x 1200 pixels in resolution (1080 x 1200 per eye) with a pixel density of 441 PPI and runs at 90 FPS compared to the 60 FPS of HDK1. The base kit costs 400 USD. HDKs offer neither built-in audio output nor input; external gear must be used. As for the system requirements you’ll need — for the HDK1 you are better off with at least an Intel Core i5 3GHz or equal CPU, a NVIDIA GTX 660, and a minimum of 8GB RAM. While for the HDK2, an Intel Core i5-4590 equivalent or greater processor is being recommended as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 280 or equivalent graphics card bundled with at least 8GB RAM. It should be noted the ecosystem is not exclusive to HDKs and is compatible with third party displays. The best part? Any software developed for the OSVR open standard is meant to work with every OSVR-compatible piece of hardware. Openness and inclusion play a key role here. Where is OSVR? The project code is available on Github under the Apache License 2.0; this allows everyone to use, modify and redistribute the software for any purpose. Same goes with the design and schematics for the HDKs — anyone with a 3D printer and the right material can build their own from scratch. Like many other open source projects, OSVR has a broad community of developers, supporters and friends. Online resources include the OSVR Forums as well as the OSVR Subreddit. There is also the Developer Section on the website and the separate Developer Portal. For communications among developers, OSVR has mailing lists too. Additionally, the community chats live using IRC at #osvr on Freenode. As long as user support is taken into account, a Support Portal exists, which can be used for submitting support tickets and connects to the documentation. Last but not least, OSVR is on social media. Make sure to check their profiles out on Facebook and Twitter. Developers When it comes to game engines, major players have jumped in. CryEngine, SteamVR, Unity, Unreal and WebVR are a few. If you wish to get started with game development, the official documentation will come in handy. Extended tutorials should be around the corner too. Not only developers, but also VR aficionados with different skill sets are strongly encouraged to participate in the advancement of the platform. They have a Waffle.io board with an overview of GitHub issues waiting for people to help out with. In terms of programming languages you’d need to know — the vast majority of the project code is written in C++. JSON, which mainly appears in hardware configurations, makes up another large portion. Last June, the OSVR Developer Fund was launched. How much money in the pot? $5 million, and increasing! So far, Razer has invested in fifteen games out of hundreds of submissions. This fund is open to everyone and registrations are still ongoing. Bonus: OpenVR OpenVR is an API linking applications to VR equipment. The API is backed by Valve Software and is licensed under the The BSD 3-Clause License. Last year, Razer announced a partnership between OpenVR and OSVR which continues today. The Road Ahead OSVR headsets go head to head with their rivals, yet cost significantly less. Furthermore, the project is not restricted to specific devices, but rather focuses on increasing collaboration among current and future technologies. There is still a long road ahead. Resources are plentiful, although they are scattered across websites which might be a bit overwhelming and discouraging for new enthusiasts trying to get started. Despite that, the true values of open source and open hardware are proudly reflected, enabling individuals to contribute and even produce their own hardware! All in all, OSVR makes a very promising initiative with a great mission and huge potential. VR to the people!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 22 November 2016 | MYT 6:00 AM Autonomous cars – 'new oil' or 'big brother'? Fierce competition: Automakers are racing to develop the first driverless car. — AFP Relaxnews LOS ANGELES: Just like credit cards, smartphones or search engines, autonomous cars will carry a trove of information about their owners as they make driving more comfortable, raising new concerns about privacy. Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves – such as who is responsible in the event of an accident – a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. "Data is the new oil," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said this week during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. "If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations," Krzanich said. "If not, the car will stop." Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with "intelligent" roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon's Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. "Where are you, where you stop, how often, what's in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience," Krzanich said. "What music you like, craft choices... that's an opportunity as well." He said Intel was investing US$250mil (RM1.1bil) into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximise profit. "If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) 'Oh, he always stops at Starbucks," Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy a bottle of wine. Security concerns One question on many people's mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984," it will be possible to disconnect at some point. "Consumer privacy is an open question," said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. "A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we're getting value in return," he added. "It's the same trade-off with an autonomous car." Cybersecurity was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. "Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking," Egil Juliussen, director of research at IHS Automotive, told AFP. "Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again." In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car's functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges "will require the industry coming together and collaborating."  —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Super Mario Run: Give the plumber a hand What is cloud computing?

Price $1799 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel i7-6700 CPU • 8GB DDR4 RAM • 802.11ac Wi-Fi • 1TB 7200RPM HDD + 32GB cache • Nvidia Geforce GTX 745 GPU. Tweet Email this Print this Feedback A decent, solid box from Dell that could really benefit from an SSD. Desktop computers may be going out of fashion for some, with the mainstream preferring laptops and tablets lately, but that doesn’t mean they’re obsolete. If you need the fastest computer possible, hooked up to multiple monitors, with loads of expansion for RAM and HDDs, a desktop computer still provides excellent value for money.  If you’ve seen a mini-tower computer before, you’ve seen the XPS 8910. The rather sedate looking black chassis features an easy to open side case for constant upgraders. There’s all the ports and stuff you could ever want around the back, including a USB 3.1 Type-C port. On the front there’s four USB 3.0 ports, audio input and output, as well as an SD card reader. Inside the case is an i7-6700, the top of the line non-overclocking CPU from Intel. There’s four DDR4 RAM slots (8GB of 2133MHz stuff installed by default), space for three 3.5-inch HDDs, a 802.11ac mini PCI Wi-Fi card, two PCIe 1x slots, and a single 4x and 16x slot. As a nice bonus, there’s also an M.2 SSD slot to chuck a nice and fast NVMe SSD into.  For those still using them, a DVD burner is ready and waiting for all your optical media. Three internal 3.5-inch drive bays mean there’s plenty of room for extra storage should the need arise. Dell package this new machine with an Nvidia Geforce GTX 745, which is a special product made by Nvidia for OEMs, like Dell. It’s a step below the GTX 750, with the GTX 745 featuring 384 shaders to the GTX 750’s 640. In contemporary terms, this sits near the bottom of the GPU pile in terms of gaming usefulness. If you’re plonking down the cash for a new computer, why get an old GPU in it? The Intel HD Graphics 530 GPU included as part of the CPU for free would do the job for anything non-gaming related anyway, making the inclusion of the GTX 745 even more unusual. The XPS 8910 isn’t a silent PC, but isn’t that loud either. The usual hum of a large case fan, GPU and CPU fans emanate like you’d expect for any other PC of a similar spec. Same with performance – the i7-6700 is a known quantity and plenty fast. There’s nothing mind blowing or new here. The bits inside are the same as practically every other mini-tower PC from the last decade. Most people buy a pre-built PC like a Dell because they want some form of support for it. Dell has plenty of support options, but the basic option is a 1-year warranty with free phone and remote diagnosis support. If something goes wrong, they’ll cover the costs of getting the computer to them for repair. For a bit of extra cash, you can extend that warranty for up to four years and add on onsite support. Value isn’t a strong point with this machine. For comparison, go to almost any local PC store and get them to build a computer with the same specs and a Windows 10 Home licence and it shouldn’t cost more than $1,200. Is the Dell chassis and support worth that extra cost? Dell’s decision to fit the XPS 8910 with the Nvidia Geforce GTX 745 and a HDD are a bit questionable for a brand new computer in 2016, although the HDD does come with a 32GB cache to boost performance a bit. The first thing you’d want to do is grab an  SSD and give this system a nice performance boost. But if you’re the sort of person who is comfortable doing that, maybe the Dell XPS 8910 isn’t for you. Nobody should have to endure life with a HDD as your primary boot drive, so perhaps check if Dell or another OEM has one with an SSD, even as a built to order option. If you’re not a gamer, then the included GPU is a bit of a waste, but it’ll work fine. If you are a gamer, Dell offers an almost identical model with a GTX 960, as well as 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD (and 2TB HDD) as an option, for $2,099. Whilst there’s nothing bad or wrong with the XPS 8910, it’s not exactly innovative or great value for money either. Buy one and you’ll likely be happy and not regret the purchase, but there’s plenty of better priced options on the market.

This was what made last week’s AI Day from Intel so interesting for me.  Yes, they had the typical comments on performance and smart robotic devices which catch everyone’s interest, but they also uniquely had a focus on AIs that could be used to make us better people.  After the last few months of a nasty primary election here in the U.S., I’m pretty sure I know at least two people that could have used one of these things.   Let’s talk about how an AI could make you appear a ton smarter and less likely to hurt people you care about.  The Technology Problem We all do things we later regret, ranging from shopping to tweeting under the influence, to responding in anger inappropriately, to forgetting that what sounds funny in our head may sound racist, sexist, or like grounds for termination to the folks that receive our poorly thought through email, instant message, social media post, or text.  Sometimes just spending an extra few seconds thinking about what folks might actually think when they read what we wrote could save a friendship or a job and yet, I’m sure, every one of us has said or written something, likely a number of something’s, that we now wish we hadn’t.   This isn’t just an electronic issue either, as I’ve ended important relationships with letters that were ill thought through, and this was after I’d observed my father, who was particularly bad at this, destroy companies with his ill thought through correspondence.  But, at least sometimes, because it took so long to write and then post a letter, there was at least the chance we’d think better of what we were doing and not actually mail the thing.  Back then a lot of us wrote things that we never actually mailed because our slow brains actually kicked in before we took that final step of putting the letter in the mailbox.  But technology made things faster; particularly with Twitter, where you can formulate and execute a comment often before you’ve even thought through what you are writing, let alone whether you should hit send.  So, technology, at least with regard to our doing stupid things, focuses first on speed, with the end result being that a lot of us are doing far more public stupid things.  What we need is an alert system that warns us, before we hit send, of the implications of our action.  AI Guardian Angel You know there are two modes for the AI being considered for autonomous cars; one is where you don’t drive at all and the car does all the work.  The other is called “Guardian Angel,” and this is where you seem to be driving but, should you do something stupid or unsafe, the car instantly takes over and prevents it.  A drunk driver, in that latter mode, would be like a child in a car seat with a steering wheel, completely disconnected from the car’s systems but still thinking they were driving and free to say “vroom, vroom” anytime they wanted.  This can be applied to social media and email. What Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, seemed to be talking about is a system that would intercept your hasty post and first advise you not to send it, articulating the likely repercussions, and then actually help you formulate something else that made you look far smarter and would be more likely to accomplish the goal you intended rather than the one you did not, like getting fired.   This same AI could flag fake news before you clicked on it, or worse, before you forwarded it. This would work not by preventing you from seeing it, but by suggesting you take that extra step and make sure you either assured its accuracy or included the language “I found this interesting but, be aware, my AI says this may not be true” when you forward it to others, better protecting yourself.  Like you, I have a number of relatives that apparently believe anything and I’ve given up chastising them about it, concluding, like I expect many on their distribution list, that they are incurable idiots.  If an AI like this could make people that seem to relish in being idiotic look smarter, think what it could do to those of us who actually try to think before hitting send? Wrapping Up: Over the next few years we’ll have AIs that translate what we say, with nuance in place, to any other language; AIs that can, with punctuation, do speech-to-text for us, speeding up our correspondence and decreasing dramatically our chances of looking stupid and ending our careers.   It is somewhat comforting to know we will also have AIs that could be used to significantly offset, and perhaps eliminate, this risk so that instead of appearing insanely foolish we actually look smarter.   With so many warning that AIs will be the end of us, it is nice that firms like Intel are working to prevent that eventuality—even if it is only to make sure we don’t become our own worst enemy.   Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles The Myths and Legends of Artificial Intelligence By: Special Guest    12/27/2016 Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the hot and trending topic everyone's been talking about these days.

While a number of TVs and set-top-boxes already support 4K Netflix streams, the PC has largely been left out of the high-quality streams due to piracy fears. Netflix is now supporting 4K streaming through Microsoft's Edge browser, but you'll need a new PC to actually make use of it. Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren't many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors. As a result, Microsoft is using the 4K Netflix support as a marketing effort for its Edge browser and to encourage people to upgrade their hardware to watch new episodes of the Gilmore Girls. It all might seem like a bit of a con, but it's largely the fault of DRM requirements from Hollywood studios and TV networks. Content providers have strict controls for 4K playback, so that streams can't be captured and redistributed illegally. The latest hardware decryption features simply aren't available on older Intel processors, and the new Kaby Lake chips now support 10-bit HEVC, a popular 4K video codec. So if you don't have a new PC, you'll have to wait until you need a hardware upgrade before you'll be watching Netflix in 4K. Or, just buy a streaming stick like the Chromecast Ultra or the latest Roku to take advantage of Netflix in 4K.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Intel Coffee Lake will take hexa-core CPUs mainstream in 2018 by Bruno Ferreira  11:54 AM on November 21, 2016 Laptops with Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs inside are becoming more and more common, but the company's seventh-generation CPUs have yet to materialize on the desktop. That's not stopping the rumor mill from dredging up information on products that are further out still. Today's leak comes from BenchLife and contains info about Coffee Lake CPUs, which are purported to come out in 2018. Most tantalizingly, the new chips might come in variants including a six-core desktop part. Source: BenchLife What we can glean from Google's translation indicates that Coffee Lake (henceforth known as CFL) come in U, H, S, and X lineups. The H version seems to be aimed at mobile devices, the S version appears to be targeted at desktops, while the X model will be the high-performance model for Socket 2011. BenchLife suggests the U variant has a "4+3e" die arrangement, which we can interpret as a quad-core CPU with Iris Pro graphics and eDRAM on board. The listed die size is particularly large, something that at first sight would indicate a desktop part. However, the U label has historically been reserved for mobile parts, so your guess is as good as ours. The rumored desktop S parts will come in four- and six-core flavors. Don't expect much in the way of GPU changes in the new lineup, since all the listed variants mention Kaby Lake's "Gen9" graphics architecture. Meanwhile, CFL-H is only available with six cores. Interestingly enough, there's no mention of any dual-core parts at all. That might lead one to wonder if Intel will just keep Kaby Lake humming along to fill out the range of low-end CPUs. Source: BenchLife The leaked slide mentions an "LGA 37.5 mm x 37.5mm" socket for CFL-S, but it's tricky to assume that means Intel will continue using the LGA 1151 socket, especially since a new chipset called Cannon Lake will reportedly underpin the CFL chips. Cannon Lake should bring native USB 3.1 support and direct connectivity to NFC readers and fingerprint sensors, in what we presume is a Secure Enclave-like arrangement. BenchLife says all these new chips will arrive in 2018. The desktop S version will reportedly arrive in February 2018, while the U variant will come in March of that year. Meanwhile, CHL-H should arrive in April 2018.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Apple reportedly limits Verizon iPhone 7 modem speed to match AT&T model Verizon iPhone users will have to survive with "only" 450Mbps download speeds. by Jon Brodkin - Nov 21, 2016 5:20 pm UTC Login to bookmark 45 The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Andrew Cunningham Apple has been limiting the modem speeds of the iPhone 7 built for Verizon Wireless's network in order to match the slower speeds of the AT&T iPhone, according to reports Friday by Bloomberg and Recode. The Verizon iPhone 7 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon X12 modem that is capable of LTE download speeds of up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T model uses an Intel XMM 7360 that goes up to 450Mbps. But Apple limits the Verizon model so that it performs similarly to the AT&T one; to achieve this, Apple may disable certain features of the network chip, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg's report is based on data from testing firms including Cellular Insights, which wrote about its findings on its blog. "Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41," Cellular Insights analyst Milan Milanovic wrote. "Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers." The Verizon iPhone was still slightly faster than the AT&T one despite not reaching its full capabilities, according to field tests by Twin Prime, Bloomberg wrote. The iPhone was significantly slower on Verizon than the Samsung Galaxy S7, which uses the same Qualcomm chip. The Verizon model is also used for the Sprint network, while the AT&T model is also used on the T-Mobile USA network. The AT&T/T-Mobile variant does not support the CDMA voice and data networks used by Verizon and Sprint. An iPhone user isn't going to hit 450Mbps under typical network conditions, so it's unlikely anyone would notice the speed limitation without doing some extensive testing. But the enforcement of consistent speeds despite the use of different chips demonstrates how Apple and carriers view the importance of similar performance across networks, even when that requires limiting one phone's capabilities. Apple historically used Qualcomm modems for the iPhone but this year decided to use both Qualcomm and Intel ones. "By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price," Bloomberg noted. Apple also uses components from multiple suppliers to make sure it can produce enough iPhones to meet consumer demand. For example, Apple used both Samsung and TSMC to make the A9 chip for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Since carriers had no control over the modem decision, "it would be a little unfair if Apple allowed, say, Verizon and Sprint to say that their iPhone performs better than AT&T and T-Mobile’s," Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said, according to Recode. Dawson also noted that it isn't uncommon for phone makers to leave some features disabled to save on battery life, "so you rarely see a phone that’s maxed out on all possible performance parameters." Apple provided a statement to Bloomberg and Recode confirming that iPhones across different networks perform similarly, but the statement did not address how Apple limited the speeds of the Qualcomm modem. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models," Apple said. We contacted Apple today, but the company declined to provide any further information. Expand full story Reader comments 45 You must login or create an account to comment.

Here's his list: AWS will introduce server SAN software storage system for enterprises Introduction of volume ARM-based servers Big Data and Map-reduce functionality inside flash drives announced Open Power with CAPI and NVIDIA GPUs will radically outperform x86 for big data and AI computing Steep decline of HDDs shipped XPoint will stall Amazon introducing a Server SAN offering? Why? He thinks it's growing in acceptance because "the cost of moving data, especially large amounts of IoT data, is far more expensive than processing the data locally". Wikibon supports the idea of Server SAN replacing SAN. He says that with large amounts of IoT data both in the cloud and on-premises (local clouds) then "having the same storage software and APIs in both the central and local clouds is a giant step towards cost-effective and performant hybrid clouds". Floyer believes consumer acceptance of and hence volume for a technology is vital for its development and adoption by business. The phenomenal rise in smartphones using ARM processors is displacing low-end PCs and eroding the PC market, leading to declining x86 processor volumes. This, together with Xeon's upmarket functions, feature set and cost is proving the impetus for developing ARM servers. Indeed, he sees a role for ARM CPUs to be embedded in flash controllers to run Big Data applications at a drive level, such as Map Reduce. This is a different take on Seagate's smart drive idea, which they applied to disk drives with the Kinetic technology of Ethernet-accessed, object-style, key:value store disk drives. As far as market acceptance goes, Kinetic disk drives appear to have fallen short, and Floyer evidently prefers smart flash drives. The Wikibon CTO sees OpenCAPI, with its CPU-memory-IO adapter interconnect scheme, as a game-changer, not least because NVIDIA GPUs have consumer volume support. The progressive flash takeover of disk drive storage responsibilities will continue in 2017. Performance disk drives (15,000rpm) are being given the heave-ho by flash, with 10,000rpm spinners facing an increasing onslaught as 3D flash gains layers and so capacity, and loses per-GB expense. The proportion of PCs using SSDs instead of disk drives is steadily increasing. Flash foundries are increasingly talking of QLC (4bits/cell) flash as a fast-access, cold data store, raising the prospect of disk archiving getting squeezed out between cheap and fast flash on the one hand, and cheaper-still tape on the other. The lack of any consumer acceptance for 3D XPoint systems or volume application demand for XPoint leads him to believe XPoint will not be a significant aspect of the 2017 tech scene. This is at least partly due to Intel over-hyping the technology and indications that products using it are coming in way under early specifications. He doesn't think that XPoint ship volumes will be too low to fund future investments and manufacturing volume increases, which might drive down prices. There is a prospect here that XPoint could fail. Alternative post-RAM non-volatile memory technologies such as Resistive RAM are being developed and the bulk of the non-volatile memory foundry suppliers have absolutely no interest in XPoint succeeding, meaning Samsung, SK Hynix, WD-Toshiba, and others. With Diablo and Xitore pushing the idea of DRAM caches front-ending flash or ReRAM or even XPoint and so enjoying DRAM speed rather than slower NAND, ReRAM or XPoint then the relative speed on NAND vs ReRAM vs XPoint becomes less important. XPoint isn't the only filler for the DRAM-flash gap and Intel, with its marketing function's effectiveness devalued because of the seemingly gross over-hyping of XPoint, has a tremendously difficult job in establishing a generally perceived role that only XPoint can meet. XPoint could be coming closer to a crossroads. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Intel's Optane XPoint DIMMs pushed back – source First media unsuitable for DIMM use and ASIC tuning needed 2 Comments Double-DIMMed XPoint wastes sockets Analysis It makes me cross 15 Comments Want to use 3D XPoint DIMMs with Intel Purley Xeons?

The leading manufacturer of industrial embedded computer modules designed its PX1-C415 SBCs to capitalize on the latest-generation PCle/104® OneBank® expansion to support rugged applications. Not only do they withstand temperatures ranging from -40°C to +85°C, they deliver exceptional functionality and processing performance while supporting the latest Microsoft® Windows® 10 and Linux operating systems. The full-featured PX1-C415 SBCs incorporate dual video interfaces, dual Ethernet ports, four serial ports, 24x bidirectional GPIO lines, and USB Type-C and M.2 connectors in a form factor barely 4.5 inches square. “Engineers designing embedded systems for Industrial IoT applications look for the latest technology and a long product life cycle along with reliable operation and the ability to add functionality,” said Technology and Engineering Director Jack Smith. “The PX1-C415’s dense I/O mix is unique in this compact size and extended temperature range. It allows customers to easily connect and control the specific elements in their system for optimal performance.” Expanded I/o Options And Enhanced Performance A full spectrum of I/O expansion options, provided by its ecosystem of PCle/104 and M.2 modules, allows designers to easily add functionality and satisfy their unique project requirements. WinSystems’ evolution of the rugged PC/104 form factor is also ideal for other embedded systems within the industrial control, transportation, Mil/COTS and energy markets that demand greater computational capabilities. Furthermore, these modules improve the performance of low-power x64 PC-compatible designs. The cutting-edge Intel® Atom™ E3900 (formerly known as Apollo Lake) processors deliver more computing performance, faster I/O, and higher-resolution graphics than previous industrial CPUs while consuming less power. The PX1-C415 series offers quad-core or dual-core System on Chip (SOC) for processing and graphics. It provides up to 8GB of DDR3-LV System RAM with support for error detection and correction. It accommodates up to two simultaneously active displays with interfaces available for DisplayPort and LVDS connections. For networking and communications, the PX1-C415 series utilizes dual Intel i210IT Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, and provides eight USB 2.0 channels, one SuperSpeed USB 3.0 channel, four serial COM channels, 24 general purpose I/O (GPIO) lines, stereo audio and a watchdog timer. Linux, Windows® and other x86 operating systems can be booted from the eMMC SSD, SATA 3.0 or M.2 (PCle, USB, SATA) interfaces, supporting multiple data storage options. WinSystems provides drivers for Linux, Windows® 10 and other PC-compatible, real-time operating systems. Accelerating Development – Extending Service Life The new PX1-C415 line leverages and supports the latest processor technology to improve performance while capitalizing on newer interfaces for greater design flexibility. It compresses time to market compared to designing a CPU or carrier board internally, or sourcing additional modules to attain the same robust functionality. “By integrating the latest industrial CPU designs, this state-of-the-art, small-scale SBC increases users’ avenues for expansion, extending the useful life of their high-reliability embedded systems,” added Smith. “What’s more, WinSystems’ customers benefit from a full seven years of product life before their system becomes obsolete, further extending the return on their investment.” Product Availability Engineering units will be available early 2017 with full production targeted for Q2 2017.

We have fourteen different teams and fourteen different takes on which system configuration is best suited to take on the applications in this year's competition. We're seeing some changes from previous competitions. Average node counts are down significantly from 6.5 nodes and 9 nodes per team at the last ISC and ASC competitions to 4.2 nodes (when the outlying 37 node FAU system is subtracted). We're also seeing accelerator usage spiking, with the average team using 7.9 accelerators (almost all GPUs) versus 6.8 at the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC16) and 4.0 at the Asian Student Cluster Competition (ASC16). Average memory per cluster this year is down, with students running 760 GB per system at SC16 versus 1.1 TB at ASC16 and 948 GB per system at ISC16. Interesting trends indeedy... It's all over the map this year. Let's go through it team by team... FAU: This is the third competition for Friedrich-Alexander University, Germany, and the first time they're running an unaccelerated cluster. The team is hoping that having a lot of CPU cores (592) and the most memory (by a large margin) will give them the upper hand on the applications. They're using the highly modular HPE Moonshot system, equipped with 37 nodes of ProLiant M510 server cartridges. Like most teams, they'll be throttling down their processors in order to stay under the 3,000 watt power cap. Interconnect wise, the team is utilising the integrated 10GbE RoCE, which gives them the ability to use RDMA over Ethernet. HUST: This team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology won the ASC16 cluster competition in their hometown of Wuhan. Huazhong is using their standard time-tested configuration of four Xeon nodes plus eight accelerators. This is same basic configuration that gave them the win at ASC16 and punched their ticket to ISC16. The major difference is that they're using NVIDIA P100s rather than K80, which should give their cluster a lot more punch. The HUST team is sporting the least amount of disk in the competition, giving them a bit more power to use for processing, but shorting them on disk capacity when it comes to application storage and check-pointing. Nanyang: This veteran Singapore-based team from Nanyang Technological University won the LINPACK battle at ASC16 so they've tasted the sweet nectar of victory and are hungry for more. They seem to favour smaller node counts with lots of accelerators, which tends to make me think they're again aiming for the LINPACK title. At SC16, they're running a Dell four-node box with 176 CPU cores, and a total of eight NVIDIA P100s, with 512GB of memory. It's all tied together with speedy 100Gbps Mellanox EDR InfiniBand, which is what most teams are using these days. Nanyang is a team to keep an eye on, they feel like they're ready to break out of the pack. NTHU: National Tsing Hua University from Taiwan is another university that has participated in plenty of cluster competitions and has notched more than their share of victories. NTHU was one of the first teams to win with accelerators and is always a solid competitor. They typically sport eight-node systems, but this year, they're slimming down with a four-node sportster. Like other teams, they're augmenting their 176 CPU cores with eight NVIDIA P100 GPUs. They've also configured an above average amount of memory with 1 TB total. NE/Auburn: The combined team of Northeastern University and Auburn University turned out to be the one to suffer significant hardware problems at the SC16 competition. In this case, "significant" problems turned out to be their entire cluster being lost in shipping. They were forced to scour the show floor to find enough systems to cluster up, which they did very well. Unfortunately, they ended up with a small mishmash of three boxes that yielded 44 CPU cores, some memory, four NVIDIA K40 accelerators, and four AMD R9 Nano accelerators. They did a hell of a job putting all of this together at the last minute and being able to run all of the applications – so hats off to them for showing the real Student Cluster Competition spirit. Peking University: Now this is a team that's breaking barriers when it comes to cluster competition hardware. They are the first team to run with the whole schmear of OpenPOWER gear. Their cluster consists of dual nodes fuelled by dual Power 8+ processors running at 4GHz for a total of 32 CPU cores. What's really exciting is that this system includes the NVIDIA NVLink connector to give Peking's 10 (TEN) P100 GPUs an up to 80GBps connection directly to the CPUs. But the team didn't stop there. They added dual Xilinx FPGAs in order to help out with the password-cracking application. This is one hell of an accelerated system and it'll be interesting to see how it does in the competition. San Diego: This is the first student cluster competition for the San Diego State University. The Aztec Warriors are driving an Intel Kennedy Pass motherboard-based system with four nodes and 348 CPU cores on the compute node (28 cores on the head node). The system is rounded out with 256 GB total memory and an Mellanox InfiniBand FDR interconnect. MGHPCC: A perennial competitor, Massachusetts Green HPC Center is a combined team from several Boston area universities. They've also been dubbed (by me) "Team Boston" or "Team Chowder". Some of the team members competed at this year's ASC, where they were initially confounded by InfiniBand. This year, the team seems much more comfortable with this technology, using it to drive their three-node cluster. Their system this year should be called "the unity cluster" since it's a combination of AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon nodes. They've also cobbled together dual NVIDIA P100 GPUs and four AMD R9 Nano accelerators. Like the team itself, it's quite an eclectic bunch of equipment. TUM: The Technical University of Munich is another team that's setting new precedents in the cluster competition. They're the first to field a cluster entirely made up of Intel Knights Landing processors – used in host mode. Their cluster consists of eight one-socket nodes, each with one 72 core Phi processor running at 1.5 GHz. They've gone all in with Intel, using Omni Path Architecture as their interconnect. As you'll see in the upcoming team video, they've also started a "Phi Club", complete with rules (the first two being "you must talk about Phi Club"). EAFIT: The Universidad EAFIT team from Colombia is rapidly becoming one of the most experienced in the competition. I've seen this version of the team at ASC, ISC, and SC competitions over the past few years. This year, they are driving a OpenPOWER 8-based cluster complete with four NVIDIA K80s and a speedy Mellanox EDR interconnect. While the processors and interconnect are pretty fast, bringing the venerable K80 to SC this year is like bringing a knife to a machine gun fight. I'm not sure the plucky kids from Colombia have fast enough hardware to hang with the big boys. Experience counts for a lot in student clustering, but it can't overcome a lack of hardware. Illinois: The team from University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana (or Urbana-Champaign, according to the team) is another first-time competitor. They're running a fairly standard cluster with five compute nodes, each outfitted with dual Xeon 20 core processors (total 200 cores), a NVIDIA K80 GPU, and 256 GB of RAM. They have a decent enough cluster, but are a bit weak when it comes to accelerators in comparison to other teams. USTC: The University of Science and Technology of China is really bringing it this year. This will be their third cluster competition and it looks like they're going all out to either take LINPACK or break the power monitors on the PDUs. Their six-node system is jam-packed with 216 CPU cores and 18 (eighteen!) NVIDIA accelerators. They're sporting ten P100s and eight GTX 1080s. The rationale is that the P100s will help them out with LINPACK and general application processing, while the GTX 1080s will be particularly useful for the rendering associated with the Paraview application. This is a LOT of hardware – we'll see if it can take them to glory. Texas: This team is a combination of students from the always powerful University of Texas at Austin and Texas State University programmes. As all cluster competition aficionados know, the Austin team was the first to three-peat at SC cluster competitions – a feat yet to be duplicated. However, they're sporting all-new personnel, although it does have highly experienced coaches. Their cluster is a bit of a departure for the Texas team. In past competitions, they've shied away from accelerators, figuring that the applications just weren't accelerator-centric enough to justify their use. This year, however, the team is using six NVIDIA P100s to accompany their eight-node, 224-core system. Will this approach take the Lone Star State back to their past glory? Utah: The University of Utah is the home team this year, since the competition is being held on their doorstep in Salt Lake City. This Dell backed team is driving a smallish two-node cluster with only 40 CPU cores. For extra compute power, each node is stocked with dual NVIDIA P100s. The team is also using Intel's Omni Path interconnect to link their two nodes together. As the team points out in their proposal, using only two nodes allows them to minimise internode communication – which is absolutely true – but does this give them enough compute power to challenge for the title? In our next updates we'll meet the teams via the miracle of video, discuss the LINPACK results, show some more video content, then slice/dice and analyse the overall results. So stay tuned for more... ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register We wanna give IoT folk kilobit data rates, beam NB-IoT telcos MBBF2016 Um.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple possibly throttling data transfer speeds on certain iPhone 7 models Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, November 21st, 2016, 05:48 Category: Hardware, iPhone, News, Samsung The bad news is that Apple may be throttling the LTE performance on the Verizon iPhone 7 to keep it on par with the AT&T model. According to research conducted by Twin Prime and Cellular Insights, the Verizon iPhone 7 performs about as well as the AT&T iPhone 7, but it does not reach the data transfer speeds that it is capable of hitting. The Verizon (and Sprint) iPhone 7 models use different LTE hardware than the AT&T (and T-Mobile) iPhone 7 models, adopting a Qualcomm LTE modem instead of an Intel LTE modem. The Qualcomm modem is capable of reaching a maximum theoretical download speeds of 600Mb/s, while the Intel LTE modem tops out at 450Mb/s, but the Qualcomm-equipped Verizon iPhone 7 is only marginally outperforming the AT&T iPhone 7. Researchers believe Apple may be hobbling the Verizon iPhone 7 by not taking advantage of “a crucial component,” thereby ensuring all models of the iPhone 7 perform at a similar level. Field tests show the Verizon iPhone 7 as “a little faster” than its AT&T counterpart, but not as fast as it could be. Tests were conducted by comparing iPhone 7 performance on the Verizon network to a Samsung Galaxy S7, which also uses the Qualcomm X12. Data collected from more than 100,000 phones downloading the same image indicates the S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7. Apple offered the following comment on the situation: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Past testing by Cellular Insights suggests that data speeds change somewhat when signal strength is an issue. In areas of weak reception, the Verizon iPhone noticeably outperforms the AT&T iPhone by maintaining a stronger connection and enabling faster low-signal transfer speeds. Other network testing companies have stated that reliably measuring data transfer speeds is difficult due to the many factors that can affect performance, but the information collected from Cellular Insights and Twin Prime was not disputed. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Intel stock reached levels not seen since the turn of the century in mid-October and it has struggled ever since. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr Indeed, INTC stock is off more than 6% since its last peak. Note that you can’t blame the surprising results of the general election for this underperformance. Intel stock slumped well before voters went to the polls and shrugged off the outcome. Rather, the selloff looks like profit taking after Intel stock reached such lofty levels. But you can bet it will get up there again. In addition to offering a compelling valuation, INTC is making big bets in a number of growth areas. Robotics, self-driving cars, virtual reality and the Internet of Things are just some of the endeavors Intel is plowing resources into. Perhaps most exciting is the company’s breakthrough in its core chip business. In a development that one analysts says “could be one of the most important of our generation,” INTC may have found a way to overcome limitations in silicon chip performance. The 10 Best Pharma Stocks Under President Trump Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland describes it this way: “Early this year, Intel released Silicon Photonics (SiPh) transceivers used to optically connect servers and network equipment. While this announcement was important, it is NOT the type of silicon photonics technology we will be discussing. Early this year, Intel released Silicon Photonics (SiPh) transceivers used to optically connect servers and network equipment. While this announcement was important, it is NOT the type of silicon photonics technology we will be discussing. We understand that Intel has ‘proof of concept’ silicon, is looking to improve today’s low yields, and that a commercialized product could be ready in as little as three to five years. This technology is nothing short of miraculous and we view it as a potential game changer for Intel and the semiconductor industry.” Intel Stock’s Affordable Valuation If these areas of investment pan out — especially the new chip technology — Intel stock is clearly underpriced. But even absent those growth drivers, INTC stock isn’t particularly pricey. Intel trades at about 12 times forward earnings on a five-year compound annual growth forecast of 10%. That’s cheap by the standards of today’s bull market.

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 12 Intel's 9th gen Coffee Lake chips to make 6-core mainstream by Mark Tyson on 21 November 2016, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadbc5 Add to My Vault: Chinese tech site BenchLife.info has leaked (via VR Zone) some interesting information regarding what are purported to be Intel's 9th generation Core processors. It has published slides said to show an Intel roadmap which includes 'Coffee Lake' processors. These processors look to bring six-core CPU designs to the mainstream. BenchLife also published a platform layout diagram and a chart comparing the various features of Coffee Lake U, H and S (Desktop) processors. A slide bearing Intel's logo and corporate house style, shown above, charts a roadmap that extends to 2018 and outlines the Intel H and U processors at the top end of the mobile product roadmap. Right at the end of the time period covered we begin to see the emergence of the 'Coffee Lake' (CFL) chips. You can see that the CFL-H processors will have a 45W TDP and 6C configuration, while the lower power 15/28W CFL-U chips will be limited to 4C parts. Above you can see BenchLife claims that the desktop Coffee Lake Core (DT CFL-S) processors will be made available in both 6C and 4C configurations. The new platform will go further along the integration road, with new interfaces and connectivity stuffed in the chipset. Thus it is expected that Coffee Lake S processors won't be compatible with earlier motherboards and sockets. A 14nm 6C Coffee Lake chip is expected to measure 149mm squared, while the 4C parts won't be core disabled but actually purposely designed and measure 126mm squared.

Intel is also talking about Knights Mill, which is the next generation of the Xeon Phi processor family. Intel said that Knights Mill will deliver a 4x increase in deep learning performance compared to existing Xeon Phi processors and the combined solution with Nervana will offer orders of magnitude gains in deep learning performance. Diane Bryant, Executive VP of Intel’s Data Center Group said that the Intel Nervana platform to produce breakthrough performance and dramatic reductions in the time to train complex neural networks. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that Nervana’s technologies will produce a 100-fold increase in performance in the next three years to train complex neural networks, enabling data scientists to solve their biggest AI challenges faster.

By: Tech Desk | Published:November 21, 2016 1:08 pm Apple iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modem can outperform the ones with Intel. (Source: AP) Apple iPhone 7 smartphones with the Qualcomm modem are capable of faster LTE downloads, but it seems Cupertino is intentionally reducing these speeds. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple iPhone 7 devices running on Verizon network in the US are capable of delivering faster speeds than those on AT&T. But research from Twin Prime Inc shows they are performing at the same speeds. Bloomberg quotes Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime as saying, “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities.” He adds that it looks like Apple has not enabled certain features of the chip. However another report in Re/Code which quotes sources says Apple has a perfectly good reason for doing this: To ensure a similar and uniform experience for iPhone 7 users  regardless of the network.  The report points out that the Verizon version might be superior, but it is not working at its full “potential,” for uniformity of experience. An Apple spokesperson had also issued a statement on the Bloomberg report saying all devices meet their quality and standard tests, and “there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Even analysts admit the reason for Apple is to do this is to offer a uniform experience across the board. An earlier report from Cellular Insights, which had released in October, had also shown the Qualcomm chip to be outperforming the Intel one. The report said iPhone 7 devices powered by Qualcomm did 30 per cent better in performance, and 70 per cent better in terms of signal strength compared to the Intel ones. Also read: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Buy it for camera Cellular Insights had done the tests on the iPhone 7 devices in three different LTE bands in the US. In its report, the research firm wrote, “In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone.” For now, the controversy is on whether Apple was right to scuttle the performance of the faster Qualcomm modem. However analysts told Recode this was the right decision to ensure an equal performance for iPhone across network carriers. Also it is not unusual for manufacturers to limit the potential of a component and there are variety of reasons for choosing to do so. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple iPhone 7 Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

The Royal Shakespeare Company's collaboration with technology giant Intel has dominated much of the attention surrounding this new production of The Tempest. The two companies are given equal footing on the programme, alongside performance-capture company Imaginarium Studios. Yet for all the puffed-up, digital wizardry on show, it is the human moments of deflation, exhaustion and forgiveness and that truly resound.   The technological contribution mostly orbits Mark Quartley's Ariel, a spirit that flits between forms to guide, mislead and occasionally terrify the island's shipwrecked parties. With the help of real-time motion capturing, and avatars projected onto smoky tubes lowered from the rafters, these transformations are interpreted literally. We are told Prospero found Ariel trapped in a cloven pine, for example, and lo-and-behold a tree-like avatar is writ large above the heads of the actors. There is a clear justification for this approach to the character, described as he is through Shakespeare's text as a shape shifting, ethereal being. Indeed, the use of digital technology chimes with the play's overall theme of illusion, and the falsity of those illusions. But instead of leaning into these very potent ideas of technology – foregrounding the digital as a theme that rings true with Prospero's talk of “baseless fabric” – these novel techniques are framed as little more than tools for spectacle. The RSC puts this approach in the context of Stuart masques. These were lavish extravaganzas, stemming from the court entertainment of King James I, which would use experimental (candle) lighting, mechanical apparatus and elaborate costumes to deliver illusionistic spectacles. Real-time motion capture and floating digital avatars are here pitched as successors, and so the emphasis is on creating an opulent piece of theatre magic. You are not supposed to see the strings, as it were. This is fine, in theory. But it doesn't entirely work for one main reason: we are so much more inured to digital technology; have had so much more experience with touching, controlling and manipulating digital visuals, than a Stuart audience would with the effects of a masque. In theory, an enormous, fiery, real-time projection of an actor should knock our socks off, in reality it taps into our already-brimming grammar of CGI, of computer interfaces, of video games, and it ultimately falls a little short. The most effective and intelligent use of digital technology in the play comes around the actual masque scene, where Prospero conjures up a lavish play-within-a-play to delight his daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law. The scene itself is a garish wash of fields and flowers. It may have been intended to be spectacular, but it comes across as excessive and gauche – like a particularly ostentatious screensaver – complete with Opera-singing goddesses and dancing, charmingly pastoral sprites. Chastising himself for wasting time with such an “insubstantial pageant”, the stage becomes a void. The flip, then, when Prospero pulls the plug, is a powerful gut-punch. Chastising himself for wasting time with such an “insubstantial pageant”, the stage becomes a void, the lights gone, the actors all frozen. We are shown, if only for a moment, the empty computer screen, and are left with Prospero's sorrow and self-reproach. Simon Russell Beale's take on Prospero is masterful. While this review is understandably angled towards the play's use of technology, to talk about these things separate from Beale's performance misses a crucial tension. More scientist than magician, Beale's unassuming physicality is coupled with an unpredictable inner anxiety. When he isn't gripping his staff he stuffs his hands in his pockets, pointed and uneasy with his own daughter, as he is with his moral standing in the latter stages of the play. Yet he seemed distanced from his own powers – embodied through the computerised spectacle – as if unconvinced by the digital projections that seem to captivate other characters. In many ways I wished the RSC had gone further in this direction, foregrounding the glitchy, abject falseness of the digital avatars, as opposed to treating them like convincing illusions. Stephen Brimson Lewis's set, built of a rotting ship hull, is brilliant, but it would have been interesting to see such a tangible design clash against something explicitly contemporary and screen-based. Ultimately, though, that is a different production – one that wants to look at technology as a theme rather than a tool. What I took away from this production isn't the illusion, but what remains when the illusion is switched-off, and you're left facing the bodies who betrayed you, and have to decide between revenge or forgiveness.

The new rugged 6U OpenVPX™ board is ideal for memory-bound applications that require the maximum amount of memory per VPX slot as possible. While the original CHAMP-XD2, with its dual Intel Xeon Processor D devices was designed specifically to address demanding compute-bound applications, the single processor CHAMP-XD2M board is uniquely able to keep up with the “firehose” of incoming data from memory intensive applications such as sensor fusion. The board expands Curtiss-Wright’s supercomputer-class DSP module family with the industry’s first 16-core Xeon Processor D based COTS module to support up to 128 Gbytes (GB) of onboard DDR-4 memory, the maximum supportable by the processor. The CHAMP-XD2M also features a Xilinx® UltraScale™ Core Function FPGA. The CHAMP-XD2M provides system designers with an ideal set of building blocks to deliver maximum compute power and system memory per VPX slot. While processing in-coming sensor data, ISR systems often shift between requiring more processing capability or more memory, depending on which stage of the processing pipeline the data resides in. The CHAMP-XD2M eliminates ISR data bottlenecks in memory-bound applications. It combines the maximum amount of memory with the highest core-count Xeon Processor D device. The rugged module is designed for the most demanding deployed HPEC systems, to support applications such as next-generation Radar, EW and C4ISR applications and SAR, cognitive EW, and airborne cloud computing. It is ideal for use in applications that require the realtime processing of vast quantities of sensor data, such as that generated by emitters, SAR, Camera, and EO/IR imagery. The CHAMP-XD2M has already been selected for use in a sensor fusion system onboard a major High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial system (UAS). “We are very excited to deliver the industry’s first Intel Xeon Processor D-based COTS DSP board optimized for the most challenging memory-bound ISR applications,” said Lynn Bamford, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Defense Solutions division. “Our CHAMP-XD2M module, with its 128 Gbytes of memory and 16-core supercomputer processor, is the sensor fusion data turbocharger that ISR system designers have been longing for.” Curtiss-Wright’s family of 6U and 3U CHAMP-XDx open architecture COTS modules feature high-speed DDR4 memory, high bandwidth PCIe Gen 3 data paths on the expansion plane. They also support a combination of 1 Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) interfaces, as well as support for 40 GbE and InfiniBand. 3U and 6U CHAMP-XDx modules increase application scalability and transportability because they support software compatibility, share the same architected memory and compute nodes, and provide similar I/O. This enables system designers to cost-effectively re-use solutions across multiple platforms with differing size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) constraints and program requirements. To maximize system configuration flexibility, the modules also feature XMC card expansion. To ensure the protection of critical technology and data, the CHAMP-XD2M supports Curtiss-Wright’s TrustedCOTS™ hardware and software security features that enable customers to implement protection plans quickly and economically. 6U CHAMP-XD2M Performance Features: The single-processor CHAMP-XD2M brings the performance of independent 16-core Intel Xeon Processor D to a single 6U chassis slot. It supports either 40 GbE or InfiniBand on the Data Plane in addition to its 1 GbE and 10 GbE interfaces on the Control Plane. • Intel Xeon Processor D with Intel® AVX2 • Integrated Platform Controller Hub Technology • Four ports of 40G/10G Ethernet or DDR/QDR/FDR10 InfiniBand on OpenVPX data plane • 2 ports of 10 GbE Intel® Ethernet on OpenVPX control plane • Up to 128 GB DDR4 @ 2133 megatransfers per second per Intel® Xeon® Processor D-1500 Family socket • XMC PCIe up to Gen 3, designed for up to 25W thermal dissipation • Dual x16 PCIe Gen 3 on OpenVPX expansion plane with switch • Xilinx UltraScale Core Function FPGA and MicroSemi SmartFusion™ IPMI • Air and conduction-cooled • Trusted COTS support About OpenHPEC™ Accelerator Suite: The new DSP module also supports Curtiss-Wright’s recently introduced OpenHPEC Accelerator Suite™ of best-in-class software development tools. OpenHPEC Accelerator Suite speeds, simplifies, and lowers the cost of developing HPEC systems through the use of non-proprietary open standard based software. The OpenHPEC Accelerator Suite brings the benefits of open standard HPC software to the COTS market to effectively remove the risk from developing large scale embedded computer clusters. It includes a broad and comprehensive array of open standard drivers, middleware and libraries. It also includes proven solutions for cluster-wide debugging tools, performance profiling, performance reports, data flow performance analysis, and built-in-test tools, all of which have already been developed and qualified for commercial HPC use.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Here are the shockingly modest minimum specs for Windows 10 VR Mike Wehner BGR NewsNovember 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Virtual reality was the shiny new toy that all the early adopters were blowing huge wads of cash on, but then Microsoft came along and said that it was going to make VR affordable with headsets as cheap as $299. Now we know exactly what kind of a computer you need to be able to run Microsoft’s budget-friendly virtual reality hardware.  DON’T MISS: Jony Ive may no longer be ‘directly involved’ with designing the iPhone First, let’s keep in mind that the minimum system specs for the two big dogs on the VR block — the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive — are pretty beefy for casual users. A graphics card on par with a GTX 970, an Intel i5 4590, and 8GB of RAM are basically the bottom floor when it comes to Vive and Rift-ready PCs. You can probably get away with 4GB of memory, but even that would be pushing your luck. If you want something that meets recommended specs you’re looking at an even pricier build, and don’t even think about building a top-of-the-line rig without a couple thousand dollars ready to burn. Microsoft, on the other hand, is shockingly lax in its requirements. Using its Windows Holographic platform, Windows 10 will test your computer to verify that it meets its own minimum specs. Here’s what it’s looking for: DirectX12-capable GPU Quad-core CPU (or dual-core CPU with hyperthreading) 4GB of RAM USB 3.0 Those are some seriously low-end specs. Many graphics cards released as far back as 2010 offer DirectX 12 support today, such as the GTX 570, though you’d never dream of installing one in a modern gaming PC. Likewise, quad-core CPUs have been the standard for the better part of a decade. The 4GB memory requirement is also an easy hurdle to clear. It’s funny to think about, but the fact that the new crop of Microsoft-approved VR headsets will require a USB 3.0 port might be the only thing stopping some would-be buyers from plugging them into a computer from 2010 or even earlier. Now, just exactly how Microsoft’s Windows Holographic platform will turn these computing relics into VR-capable dream machines is still to be determined, and it’s probably safe to say that if you want the best virtual reality experience, updating your aging rig can’t hurt.

A recent deal with Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to use AMD’s processing units for its cloud computing platform has probably contributed to some of this momentum. It certainly hasn't hurt as shares are up 23 percent from about $7 last week to $8.70. See how crowdsourced ratings can help you time the market. Currently, Vetr’s average target price for AMD is at $10.23, well above the average analyst target price of $5.85. Less than 2 percent of Vetr users are holding AMD in their watch lists.

Credit: BeagleBoard.org More like this Open-source movements butt heads over logo Open-source hardware movement wants legitimacy Review: 6 slick open source routers Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Four years ago, Alicia Gibb was trying to unite a fragmented open-source hardware community to join together to create innovative products. So was born the Open Source Hardware Association, which Gibb hoped would foster a community of hardware "hackers" sharing, tweaking, and updating hardware designs. It shared the ethics and ethos of open-source software and encouraged the release of hardware designs -- be it for it processors, machines, or devices -- for public reuse. Since then, OSHWA has gained strength, with Intel, Raspberry Pi, and Sparkfun endorsing the organization. Its growth has coincided with the skyrocketing popularity of Arduino and Raspberry Pi-like developer boards -- many of them open source -- to create gadgets and IoT devices. In recent weeks, OSHWA also met one of its initial goals: To start certifying open-source hardware. The goal of certification is to clearly differentiate open-source hardware from the mish-mash of other hardware products. The certification allows hardware designs to be replicated. For certification, OSHWA requires hardware creators to publish a bill-of-materials list, software, schematics, design files, and other documents required to make derivative products. Those requirements could apply to circuit boards, 3D printed cases, electronics, processors, and any other hardware that meets OSHWA's definition of open-source hardware. When hardware makers fill out a legally binding agreement, they are allowed to use an Open Hardware mark. OSHWA will host a directory for all certified products, something that doesn't exist today because the community is so fragmented. "Users feel more confident about a product when they can see how it works," Gibb said. "Knowing your product's privacy features, compatibility with other tools, and ease of customization can encourage buyers to choose you over a competitor." Open-sourcing hardware offers other benefits, Gibb said. The typical patent process for hardware can be costly and time-consuming, and open-sourcing hardware can instead get a product to market more quickly without a giant financial burden. That's especially relevant at a time when more individual makers are swiftly creating compelling products at home. Cheap commodity components are powerful enough to create what could be the next big hit product. Some notable open hardware products certified by OSHWA in just a few weeks include the BeagleBone Black Wireless and a number of other boards from SparkFun. The list will grow over the coming months. There are many open-source developer boards, like MinnowBoard, Orange Pi, and 96boards' single-board-computers, that could be registered. Products being certified also include 3D printed devices. 3D Central has certified 3D printable over-ear headphones and has published the print files, documented CAD, and assembly instructions. "If a customer buys a pair of our headphones, the certification provides a way for a user to easily access the documentation," said Chris Caswell, lead designer at 3D Central. For example, buyers can easily "replace the foam pads when they wear out or reprint a part that's broken," he added. As a maker himself, Andrew Sink, director of business development at 3D Central, is excited about the open-source hardware directory because it shows existing products he can incorporate into projects. The certification solves a problem of attribution for the creator. "Most of our designs are published using Creative Commons Share-Alike copyright license, and it is always painful when our designs are sold by competitors who do not provide the attribution," Sink said. For products that are Open Hardware certified, the logo effectively is an attribution that stays with the product, Sink said. OSHWA has built credibility in the open-source hardware community through its popular Open Hardware Summit. The organization has been endorsed by universities, makers, companies, and hacker spaces. With the certification, hardware makers will feel a sense of belonging to the community, said Michael Weinberg, a board member for OSHWA and intellectual property lawyer and general counsel at Shapeways. "People want to be associated with open source," Weinberg said. For OSHWA, certifying products could set in motion the creation of a central resource for open-source hardware. But like open-source software licensing, it's a long process. Unity among the makers on the definition of open-source hardware will be important. Some approvals for products that don't deserve certification could initially slip through the cracks, but the vetting process to ensure that hardware is really open source will intensify over time, Weinberg said. The certification has limits, however. The Open Hardware label won't protect companies from getting sued for copyright infringement, Weinberg said. If another hardware maker alleges an Open Hardware product infringes copyright, then OSHWA will talk to its maker about expectations and definition of open-source hardware. The organization will learn and grow, he said. Gibb has more plans for OSHWA. She wants to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to refer to the open-source product directory as a source of prior art.  "Prior art is what allows open source hardware to be recognized and [blocks] the ability to patent the same work. It is integral to open-source hardware," Gibb said. Once the definition of Open Hardware matures, the certification directory could become a full-fledged open-source hardware repository, Gibb said. For now, there are no such plans because creating and managing a repository is a huge task. "It may take a while for the community to determine what the core functions and features of a repository would be, but the certification has started that conversation," Gibb said.

So was born the Open Source Hardware Association, which Gibb hoped would foster a community of hardware "hackers" sharing, tweaking, and updating hardware designs. It shared the ethics and ethos of open-source software and encouraged the release of hardware designs -- be it for it processors, machines, or devices -- for public reuse. Since then, OSHWA has gained strength, with Intel, Raspberry Pi, and Sparkfun endorsing the organization. Its growth has coincided with the skyrocketing popularity of Arduino and Raspberry Pi-like developer boards -- many of them open source -- to create gadgets and IoT devices. In recent weeks, OSHWA also met one of its initial goals: to start certifying open-source hardware. The goal of certification is to clearly identify open-source hardware separate from the mish-mash of other hardware products. The certification allows hardware designs to be replicated. For certification, OSHWA requires hardware creators to publish a bill-of-materials list, software, schematics, design files, and other documents required to make derivative products. Those requirements could apply to circuit boards, 3D printed cases, electronics, processors, and any other hardware that meets OSHWA's definition of open-source hardware. When hardware makers fill out a legally binding agreement, they are allowed to use an Open Hardware mark. OSHWA will host a directory for all certified products, something that doesn't exist today because the community is so fragmented. "Users feel more confident about a product when they can see how it works," Gibb said. "Knowing your product's privacy features, compatibility with other tools, and ease of customization can encourage buyers to choose you over a competitor." Open-sourcing hardware offers other benefits, Gibb said. The typical patent process for hardware can be costly and time-consuming, and open sourcing hardware can instead get a product to market more quickly without a giant financial burden. That's especially relevant at a time when more individual makers are swiftly creating compelling products at home. Cheap commodity components are powerful enough to create what could be the next big hit product. Some notable open hardware products certified by OSHWA in just a few weeks include the BeagleBone Black Wireless and a number of other boards from SparkFun. The list will grow over the coming months. There are many open-source developer boards, like MinnowBoard, Orange Pi, and 96boards' single-board-computers, that could be registered. Products being certified also include 3D printed devices. 3D Central has certified 3D printable over-ear headphones and has published the print files, documented CAD, and assembly instructions. "If a customer buys a pair of our headphones, the certification provides a way for a user to easily access the documentation," said Andrew Sink, director of business development at 3D Central. For example, buyers can easily "replace the foam pads when they wear out or reprint a part that's broken," he added. As a maker himself, Sink is excited about the open-source hardware directory because it shows existing products he can incorporate into projects. The certification solves a problem of attribution for the creator. "Most of our designs are published using Creative Commons Share-Alike copyright license, and it is always painful when our designs are sold by competitors who do not provide the attribution," Sink said. For products that are Open Hardware certified, the logo effectively is an attribution that stays with the product, Sink said. OSHWA has built credibility in the open-source hardware community through its popular Open Hardware Summit. The organization has been endorsed by universities, makers, companies, and hacker spaces. With the certification, hardware makers will feel a sense of belonging to the community, said Michael Weinberg, a board member for OSHWA and intellectual property lawyer and general counsel at Shapeways. "People want to be associated with open source," Weinberg said. For OSHWA, certifying products could set in motion the creation of a central resource for open-source hardware. But like open-source software licensing, it's a long process. Unity among the makers on the definition of open-source hardware will be important. Some approvals for products that don't deserve certification could initially slip through the cracks, but the vetting process to ensure hardware is really open source will intensify over time, Weinberg said. The certification has limits, however. Open Hardware is only a certification, and it won't protect companies from getting sued for copyright infringement, Weinberg said. If another hardware maker alleges an Open Hardware product infringes copyright, then OSHWA will talk to its maker about expectations and definition of open-source hardware. The organization will learn and grow, he said. Gibb has more plans for OSHWA. She wants to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to refer to the open-source product directory as a source of prior art.  "Prior art is what allows open source hardware to be recognized and [blocks] the ability to patent the same work. It is integral to open-source hardware," Gibb said. Once the definition of Open Hardware matures, the certification directory could become a full-fledged open-source hardware repository, Gibb said. For now, there are no such plans because creating and managing a repository is a huge task. "It may take a while for the community to determine what the core functions and features of a repository would be, but the certification has started that conversation," Gibb said.

A lot of young couples relocate to Bengaluru with dreams in their eyes given the opportunities they see in the job market. Lavina Durgani and husband Krishna Agarwal moved here from Dhar, near Indore in Madhya Pradesh, three years ago. It was their jobs that brought them here. Lavina is working with IBM as a data specialist and Krishna is with Intel as a design engineer. The couple work long hours through the week. During the weekends, they try to explore the city. “We both work in different streams and the city offers a umpteen opportunities in our areas of specialisation. If you are ambitious and career-oriented, then Bengaluru is the place to be,” says Lavina. She also feels that their circle of friends and relatives here make them feel at home. The couple say there could not have been a better place than Bengaluru to settle down. They have no complaints and have adapted to its culture and ethos pretty well. “There were a few teething troubles but those were things that we could handle. We also learnt a lot of new things during our initial days here. It took me a while to get a break here with respect to my work but with the support of family and friends, we managed to overcome the hiccups,” reasons Lavina. The couple love the open spaces that the city is blessed with like Cubbon Park. Krishna adds, “The Cubbon Park is a very well-maintained space.” As far as learning about the city is concerned, he says, “It was a challenge to remember the names of some of the roads in the beginning but we’ve got used to that now and our pronunciation of the names have also improved.” Everybody loves the food culture here and Lavina and Krishna are no different. They spend their spare time discovering new eateries and shopping. They try not to miss a chance to eat at restaurants that offer traditional fare. “We have colleagues and friends from different parts of the country who have settled down here. They always introduce us to the authentic dishes from their respective states. So, we end up trying out different kinds of cuisines like Andhra, Kerala, Bengali and Kashmiri among others. The city has a lot of restaurants to satiate one’s craving for good food,” shares Krishna. He adds that they also keep looking for places that offer authentic Indore food, especially the ‘chaat’. Bengaluru doesn’t lack when it comes to places of entertainment. “One can either go clubbing or dine out at a great place with good music. Sometimes, traffic jams make it tough to move around the city, but now, we’ve got used to that as well,” they say. They also find the people in the city very proactive when it comes to proposing measures to improve various aspects of the city. It could be offering solutions to ease the traffic congestion or tackling the garbage problem. “We are eager to see some of the city’s problems solved at the earliest. If the authorities and people work together, I am sure there will be a change,” says Krishna. He also adds that the city is very safe. “We feel very safe here. You can walk around at 1 am in the morning and still not worry about your safety. This is also one aspect that makes us feel welcome here,” says Lavina. So do they miss home? Lavina says “Bengaluru is a huge city when compared to our hometown but there are so many aspects here that we feel connected to. We are happy that we have made this city our second home.”   Tweet Go to Top Videos Mulayam Singh avoids question on rift in... Bengaluru rings in New Year in style...

(CBS Photo) WASHINGTON (CBS/WLFI) — When Margaret Hamilton was writing the code that would become the onboard flight software for NASA’s Apollo project, her target was the moon, not the White House. But now, four decades after the Apollo moon landings, the NASA computer scientist has a rendezvous in Washington to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That honor will also be going to another pioneering woman in tech, Grace Hopper. Their honoring Tuesday by President Barack Obama will mark another step forward in the long trail being blazed by women in technology and science. Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees (26 photos) Hopper and Hamilton are two of this year’s 21 recipients of the Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian honor in the U.S. The award goes to those who have made “especially meritorious contributions” in a wide range of fields, from national security to cultural endeavors. Other recipients from the tech world this year include Bill and Melinda Gates. The Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000, addresses issues like poverty and combats the spread of infectious diseases like malaria. Just in September, Melinda Gates said she would be turning her attention, in some form apart from the foundation, to helping women in tech succeed. The subject of women in tech has roots back many decades, but it has become a high-profile cause in the last several years. Even as tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Intel rally resources toward diversity initiatives aimed at everything from recruitment to retention, the regular reporting of low percentages of women in technical roles shows the depth of the challenge. Figures like Hamilton and Hopper aren’t guaranteed acknowledgement, any more than modern-day women can’t be sure of inclusive work environments. But Tuesday’s recognition could help, to some degree. A recent study from the nonprofit Women Who Code and online educator Pluralsights found that among the women it surveyed, one of the biggest obstacles in their careers was the lack of role models. There’s an adage that goes, “you can’t be what you can’t see” and role models like Hopper and Hamilton could show that a path forward is possible. Hopper and Hamilton did indeed forge paths. Hopper, who already had a Ph.D. in mathematics, joined the U.S. Navy in the 1940s and eventually earned the rank of rear admiral. She worked on the early Mark I computer during World War II, helped create mainframe programming language COBOL in the late 1950s, and is credited with coining the phrase “bug in the system.” Hopper died in 1992, but has since become a rallying figure in the women in tech movement, even lending her name to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference. This year’s event, which took place in Houston, Texas, attracted about 15,000 attendees. Hamilton, who is now 80 years old, was a computer scientist — her team at NASA created the software used aboard Apollo’s lunar and command modules. She was a crucial figure in the development of software, back when software was in its infancy. In fact, reports Wired, the Apollo mission’s initial engineering requirements didn’t even include the word “software.” NASA, as well as the Anita Borg Institute, which runs the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Hopper and Hamilton aren’t the first women in tech to receive the Medal of Freedom. During Obama’s administration, he’s also given the award to Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. Johnson was a mathematician from NASA who helped make the calculations necessary to put John Glenn in orbit. Her story, along with those of mathematicians Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, are the subject of a book and the upcoming movie “Hidden Figures.” Ride was the first American woman in space. Ride died of pancreatic cancer in 2012. These days, Hamilton’s famed code is available on code repository platform GitHub for anyone to see. In 2015 she told Time, like a true programmer, when Apollo 11 made it to the moon, “I was so happy. But I was more happy about it working than about the fact that we landed.” This article originally appeared on CNET.com.

But as these products make their way into the hands of the less tech-savvy, an ever-increasing number of hackers are targeting insecure gadgets. According to the second annual McAfee Most Hackable Holiday Gift List from Intel Security, less than half of those who receive a connected device take the proper measures to secure it. And while 96 percent of people know it’s important to protect against threats, 47 percent don’t know if they’re taking the right precautions. The survey shows that a high percentage of people are aware of the vulnerabilities in traditional products such as laptops and smartphones, but most “lack awareness about the potential risks associated with emerging connected devices, such as drones (20 percent), children’s toys (15 percent), virtual reality tech (15 percent) and pet gifts (11 percent).” The report breaks down the five most hackable holiday gifts this year. The most vulnerable presents a person can buy are, unsurprisingly, laptops and PCs, though the guide points out that malicious apps aren’t restricted to Windows-based devices. Next on the list are smartphones and tablets; 52 percent of people surveyed said they planned to buy one of these items this Christmas. The third most hackable gifts are media players and streaming sticks, followed by the notoriously insecure IoT smart home devices, and finally drones, which could have their GPS signals disrupted or controls hijacked by hackers. Intel offers some security tips to prevent falling victim to hackers and malicious programs: always use good security software, avoid public Wi-Fi, keep everything up-to-date, use strong passwords, and never click on suspicious links. While this advice will be obvious to readers, there are plenty of people – many of whom will be receiving tech gifts this year – that haven’t a clue about the dangers connected devices can pose.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Netflix 4K coming to a select few PCs by Wayne Manion  12:00 PM on November 22, 2016 Microsoft has announced that Netflix 4K support is coming to a small number of Windows PCs over on its Windows Blog. Owners of 4K TVs and high-end HTPCs shouldn't get too excited, since this support has some meaningful restrictions. First, Netflix 4K streaming is supported only on seventh-generation Intel CPUs, more commonly known as Kaby Lake. These chips pack hardware support for the 10-bit HEVC encoding scheme Netflix uses for 4K content, unlike past iGPUs. Second, high-resolution Netflix will require playback through Microsoft's Edge browser running on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, something that could limit market appeal, to say the least. The popular Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers do not support Microsoft's PlayReady 3.0 DRM scheme at this time. According to Ars Technica, Nvidia Pascal GPUs have support for Microsoft's PlayReady 3.0 DRM and have 10-bit HEVC hardware acceleration, but are still not on the support list for Netflix 4K streaming. So far, Kaby Lake chips are only offered in recent laptop releases. Apple's recently updated MacBook Pro laptop line does not include Kaby Lake CPUs, so those running Windows on Apple hardware will apparently have to wait until the next hardware refresh. Desktop Kaby Lake CPUs are expected to arrive in early 2017. For now, despite the existence of 4K Netflix support on the PC platform, most PC owners will still have to view 4K Netflix content using set-top boxes like Amazon's Fire TV, Roku Premiere, or the Nvidia Shield.

Hopper and Hamilton are two of this year’s 21 recipients of the Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian honor in the U.S. The award goes to those who have made “especially meritorious contributions” in a wide range of fields, from national security to cultural endeavors. 26 Photos Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees President Barack Obama recognized 17 Americans, including Steven Spielberg and Yogi Berra --with the nation's highest civilian award -- the Presi... Other recipients from the tech world this year include Bill and Melinda Gates. The Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000, addresses issues like poverty and combats the spread of infectious diseases like malaria. Just in September, Melinda Gates said she would be turning her attention, in some form apart from the foundation, to helping women in tech succeed. And outside of tech, honorees this year include Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, actors Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks, architect Frank Gehry, and Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial. The subject of women in tech has roots back many decades, but it has become a high-profile cause in the last several years. Even as tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Intel rally resources toward diversity initiatives aimed at everything from recruitment to retention, the regular reporting of low percentages of women in technical roles shows the depth of the challenge. Figures like Hamilton and Hopper aren’t guaranteed acknowledgement, any more than modern-day women can’t be sure of inclusive work environments. But Tuesday’s recognition could help, to some degree. A recent study from the nonprofit Women Who Code and online educator Pluralsights found that among the women it surveyed, one of the biggest obstacles in their careers was the lack of role models. There’s an adage that goes, “you can’t be what you can’t see” and role models like Hopper and Hamilton could show that a path forward is possible. Hopper and Hamilton did indeed forge paths. Hopper, who already had a Ph.D. in mathematics, joined the U.S. Navy in the 1940s and eventually earned the rank of rear admiral. She worked on the early Mark I computer during World War II, helped create mainframe programming language COBOL in the late 1950s, and is credited with coining the phrase “bug in the system.” Hopper died in 1992, but has since become a rallying figure in the women in tech movement, even lending her name to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference. This year’s event, which took place in Houston, Texas, attracted about 15,000 attendees. Play Video 60 Minutes Overtime Grace Hopper: She taught computers to talk In a fast-moving tech world, it's worth taking time to remember Grace Hopper. A navy admiral and math whiz, she taught computers to talk. Hamilton, who is now 80 years old, was a computer scientist -- her team at NASA created the software used aboard Apollo’s lunar and command modules. She was a crucial figure in the development of software, back when software was in its infancy. In fact, reports Wired, the Apollo mission’s initial engineering requirements didn’t even include the word “software.” NASA, as well as the Anita Borg Institute, which runs the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Hopper and Hamilton aren’t the first women in tech to receive the Medal of Freedom. During Obama’s administration, he’s also given the award to Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. Johnson was a mathematician from NASA who helped make the calculations necessary to put John Glenn in orbit. Her story, along with those of mathematicians Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, are the subject of a book and the upcoming movie “Hidden Figures.” Ride was the first American woman in space. She died in 2012, 17 months after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. These days, Hamilton’s famed code is available on code repository platform GitHub for anyone to see. In 2015 she told Time, like a true programmer, when Apollo 11 made it to the moon, “I was so happy. But I was more happy about it working than about the fact that we landed.” This article originally appeared on CNET.com.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Lenovo’s upcoming Surface clone, the Miix 520 leaks 0 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Nov 22, 2016 at 17:47 GMT1 month ago Earlier this year at IFA, Lenovo introduced its Miix 510 — a cheap Surface alternative. The company seems to be working on a successor to the Miix 510, and that, of course, is the Miix 520. A couple of images of the Miix 520 along with all of the main specs of the device have been leaked by the folks over at WinFuture. The report reveals almost everything you might want to know about the device — so here’s a quick breakdown: The Miix 520 will feature a 12.3-inch display with a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels, protected by Gorilla Glass. Under the hoods, there will be Intel’s latest Kaby Lake U series (7th Gen) processors — clocked at up to 2.7GHz. The device will also pack up to 16GB of RAM (DDR4), up to 1TB of SSD storage, and up to 10 hours of battery life. Gallery The device will feature an interesting set of cameras on the back — it’ll come with an 8MP and a 2MP camera on the back which will apparently be used in augmented reality applications. As for the front, the Miix 520 will feature a 5MP camera. The device also has the usual things such a fingerprint scanner, one USB 3.0 port, two USB Type-C ports and a microSD card reader. The Miix 520 includes a fanless design thanks to the Kaby Lake U-series processors. The price and release date of the device are unknown at the moment, but it’ll likely be officially launched at CES 2017 which is just over a month away.

Gal Fridman and his team were pitching a new kind of internal combustion engine. The idea was simple: a single piston firing continuously would be more efficient and compact than anything currently on the market. “Nobody wanted to speak with us,” remembers Fridman, the co-founder of Israeli-startup Aquarius Engines. “It sounded so far-fetched that we had to do the first generation by ourselves.” Fast forward two years and the Aquarius Engine is now undergoing testing at a Formula 1 center in Belgium. Peugeot is evaluating the engine, and Fridman says other car manufacturers are interested as well. “We already have three generations of engines,” Fridman says. “I can tell you this is very fast, especially for a country that has no ecosystem of engine manufacturing.” Israel has earned a reputation as “Startup Nation,” but its innovation has largely focused on high-tech, cyber and medical sectors. Now, it’s moving into new areas. Here are three Israeli companies working on automotive innovation: Mobileye Jerusalem-based Mobileye is working with Intel and BMW to develop a fully autonomous, self-driving vehicle by 2021. The Israeli firm, which was founded in 1999, is a leader in autonomous driving. Its technology helps cars navigate on and off ramps independently and even pass other vehicles without input from a human driver. The firm’s main business had been sensors that alert drivers if a pedestrian is in the road, or if they’re approaching another car too quickly. The partnership with BMW, announced in July, promises a new chapter for the company. “Hardware infrastructure is something that’s very, very difficult for Israel because it’s a small country,” says Mobileye chief technology officer Amnon Shashua. “But mathematics, computer science, anything that requires just a pencil and paper is something that is very natural for Israel.” Softwheel Daniel Barel didn’t set out to reinvent the wheel. He just wanted to make a better suspension system for wheelchairs. When it became clear to him that putting the suspension on the chair itself wouldn’t work, the team at Softwheel put the suspension inside the wheel. The technology, Barel says, makes for a much smoother ride. The wheels were then put on bicycles, and now, Softwheel is adapting its technology for cars. “Instead of the impact — the energy — having to travel all the way through the wheel, through the chassis, and then absorbed in the suspension in some way, here it has been absorbed within the wheel itself,” says Barel. The entrepreneur says he has met with car manufacturers, but declined to name them. Aquarius If Mobileye is innovating the driver and Softwheel is reinventing the wheel, Aquarius is revolutionizing the engine. After the initial cold shoulder from investors, inventor Shauli Yaakoby built Aquarius’ first engine in his workshop. The company says that testing shows its product is two to three times more fuel efficient than the average car engine. “This is probably the most efficient engine the world has ever seen,” boasts Yaakoby.

Things are also great on the 4K Random Read/Write performance as the Phison 5007-E7 controller supports the NVMe 1.2 host controller interface specification. You are talking about having up to 170,000 IOPS for 4K Random Reads and when it comes to 4K Random Write performance you will get either up to 185,000 IOPS on the 240GB HellFire M.2 drive or up to 210,000 IOPS on the 480GB drive. Yes, there are just two capacities available; 240GB ($129.99 shipped) and 480GB ($229.99 shipped). That makes picking one out super simple and the pricing is fairly competitive with the M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD market. They are about $30 more than the Samsung SSD 960 EVO and $50 less than the Samsung SSD 960 PRO when  looking at comparable capacities. Patriot is aiming the Hellfire M.2 series at content creators, gamers and PC enthusiasts, which doesn’t come as a shock since this is their flagship series of storage drives. Patriot Hellfire M.2 Features:   Phison 5007 Series M.2 PCIe Gen 3 x 4 DRAM Cache: 240GB = DDR3L 256MB 480GB = DDR3L 512MB TRIM support (O/S dependent) Static and Dynami Wear-Leveling Bad Block Management Advanced Garbage Collection Operating Temperature – 0° ~ 70°C ECC Recovery: Up to 120bits/2KB MTBF: 2,000,000 hours 4K Aligned Random Read: 170K 4K Aligned Random Write: 240GB = 185K IOPs 480GB = 210K IOPs ATTO: Sequential Read & Write Transfer: 240GB: Up to 3000MB/s Read | Up to 2300MB/s Write 480GB: Up to 3000MB/s Read | Up to 2400MB/s Write CDM: Sequential Read & Write Transfer: 240GB: Up to 2740MB/s Read | Up to 1090MB/s Write 480GB: Up to 2550MB/s Read | Up to 1260MB/s Write Max Power: Read: 240GB/480GB: 2.8W Write: 240GB/480GB: 5.5W Endurance: 240GB: 115 TBW 480GB: 230 TBW Warranty: 3-Years Patriot fails to impress on the warranty side of things as the Hellfire M.2 drives come with a bare minimum 3-year warranty as many other PCIe SSDs come with a 5-year or longer warranties. The endurance ratings are also on the low side at 115 Terabytes Written (TBW) on the 240GB drive and that doubles up to 230 TWB on the 480GB drive. Lower cost M.2 PCIe NVMe drives like the entry-level Intel 600p 256GB/512GB are rated at 144TBW and 288 TBW, but to be fair more expensive drives like the Samsung SSD 960 EVO 250GB/500GB drives are rated lower at 100 TBW and 200 TBW, respectively. Just keep an eye on the Media Wearout Indicator (MWI) S.M.A.R.T. value on any SSD that you purchase as it looks at the finite program/erase cycles the SSD has consumed and give you a look at how much life is left. The Patriot Hellfire M.2 drive is a double-sided M.2 PCIe drive that uses the 2280 form factor. This means that it can’t be used in low profile solutions that require single-sided modules. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing as the Patriot Hellfire M.2 doesn’t look like it is designed for notebook use. In fact, Patriot fails to mention any power numbers or anything about thermal throttling on their site or product sheet, which in the past is usually bad sign. We asked and found that both the 240GB and 480GB drives use up to 5.5 Watts of power, but have not been given any of the idle information just yet. Under the large label on the front of the Hellfire M2 you’ll find the Nanya 512MB low-power DDR3 DRAM cache chip, Phison 5007 eight-channel quad-core controller and two Toshiba 128GB 15nm MLC NAND Flash chips. We spoke with Phison and found out that the E7 controller is rated at up to 125C and that the temperature sensor is located on the controller itself and not externally like some other designs. This is interesting as Patriot rates the operating temperature as being between 0° ~ 70°C (We have been told that this is the room temperature range and not for the device itself). Flipping the drive over you’ll find two more Toshiba 128GB 15nm MLC NAND Flash chips and a spot for more LP-DDR3 memory. Here is a closer look at the Toshiba planar 15nm MLC NAND Flash chip for those that wanted to see the part number. The drives warranty label is also on the back. The Patriot Hellfire M.2 drive can be used with the Hellfire M.2 toolbox, which is a free utility that allows end users to access more of the drives features. This utility will let you check how much of the drives endurance is left, show how much space is being use, the S.M.A.R.T. details, perform a secure erase and even update the firmware. The user interface isn’t that pretty to look at, but it works and is certainly better than nothing. The Patriot Hellfire M.2 PCIe SSD series does not require NVMe drivers to work properly on a PC. That said, you need to understand that standard Windows NVMe driver in Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 doesn’t pass the Force Unit Access (FUA) command. FUA commands bypass the DRAM cache on the SSD and write directly to the drives cache resulting in really bad performance. Storage review sites that use AS SSD, Anvil and PCMark may show low write performance due to this. You can do registry hacks to disable FUA or simply turn off Windows write-cache buffer flushing in Windows Device Manager for the storage drive you want to benchmark. Companies like Intel, Samsung and OCZ have released special NVMe drivers for some of their NVMe drivers to remedy this situation. We’ll show you AS SSD and Anvil scores with Windows Write-Cache Buffer Flushing on and off to ensure you’ll see some performance numbers that look like what you’ll get at home. Let’s take a look at the test system and then jump into the benchmarks. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this Proliant Hpe Data Center Servers Rumble in the off-the-shelf server jungle: HPE comes out swinging 5 processor types, 4 basic form factors in server gallimaufry HPE Synergy rack detail 22 Nov 2016 at 15:44, Chris Mellor Backgrounder HPE has the biggest cojones in the server business, bending tin, designing silicon and pushing photonics, all the while mixing it in the rough and tumble of the COTS jungle. It has a multifaceted range of servers varying by processor architecture and type, processor carrying card form factor, and chassis design and intent. We're going to try to make sense of this by reviewing the range and then zooming in for a closer look in subsequent articles. HPE has servers using ARM, AMD, Intel Itanium, Xeon and Atom processors, with Xeons being by far the most used processor type. The basic server processor components come in rackmount, tower, blade, and cartridge form factors. The blade and cartridge products can be packaged inside rackmount chassis of various kinds, and into complete racks which may be clustered together to provide servers for specific application classes, such as Big Data analytics, transaction or database processing. Here's a stab at tabulating an overview of HPE's server products: Integrated systems Synergy Hyper-converged Converged BladeSystem servers Rack servers ProLiant racks Apollo Integrity Superdome NonStop Tower servers – SMB ProLiant Xeons Blade servers – ProLiant workhorses for various blade chassis Moonshot – compute-dense chassis of mostly x86 cartridge servers with one ARM cartridge SGI UltraViolet NUMA servers Edgeline Internet of Things servers 50,000ft snapshot Let's try to add a little more detail, like a snapshot from 50,000 feet. The ProLiant Xeon processors are the workhorses of HPE's servers. Itanium and NonStop processors are/were for high-end and mission-critical servers running core banking transaction processing-type systems; mainframe or near-mainframe equivalents. However, they are getting squeezed out between the vice-like jaws of mainframe longevity and strengthening Xeon use in core systems. Apollo servers are scale-out, rack-scale systems with a lot of storage, intended for Big Data, analytics, object storage, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. HPE Apollo 2000 Integrity servers means the Superdome ones running HP-UX with Intel's fading Itanium processors and NUMA. NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) is a vital part of HPE's server technologies. It involves processors accessing two levels of DRAM: local (near) DRAM on the CPU_memory bus, and remote or far (non-local) memory on attached servers, which is slower to access. The cache memory contents on each server in a NUMA setup can be kept coherent by using an inter-processor communication system between the cache controllers. HPE Integrity Superdome X components Synergy is HPE's composable infrastructure hardware and software bet. The Apollo range has server systems intended for high-performance computing and Big Data analytics. The idea here is to separate out server and storage, decompose them, so that reach can develop separately. HPE Synergy rack views SGI was bought in August and brings HPE UltraViolet servers that can be linked via NUMAlink to provide up to 256 processors sharing an SGI NUMA. HPE's own version of NUMA, jointly developed with NEC, is limited to 16 servers and is used in the Integrity Superdome servers. The BladeSystem is a rackmount chassis carrying blade servers, vertically mounted server cards. Cartridges by the way are physically smaller than blade servers; baby blades you could say. The tower format servers are for small and medium businesses who don't have or need full racks of gear. Edgeline servers Edgeline servers are embedded systems specifically designed to aggregate and process sensor, Internet of Things, data at the edge of networks, such as factories, hotels, car parks, etc. These are based on Xeon or Atom blades and are in their first generation. Reg Comment This is the world's largest and most complicated set of servers from a single vendor. It makes HPE the strongest server vendor by far in terms of market and use-case coverage, especially since IBM sold off its x86 line to Lenovo, leaving it with just the mainframes and proprietary Power processor-based products. Dell is an x86 architecture-only server supplier, as are Cisco, Huawei, Lenovo, and the various ODMs such as Supermicro, Quanta, and so on. HPE has a history of deep hardware and software development of its servers, from big iron behemoths to embedded small boxes, from commodity Xeon ProLiants to bleeding edge developments like Moonshot. It has taken big and expensive bets on decomposing server components (Synergy), and replacing local DRAM with shared non-volatile memory. HP's Invent tagline has led to tangible results when you look at the company's server products. There's been no retreat into a proprietary heartland (like IBM) or total adoption of x86 as the core server processor with a sideline in Atoms (Dell for example). Whether HPE can keep this up as it slims down to its Meg Whitman-designed core is a question one can reasonably ask. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Meg Whitman: HPE software's new owner?

The firm had raised raised $23 million (around Rs 153.6 crore) in its Series B round in June this year, led by Microsoft Ventures and Salesforce Ventures along with existing investors Intel Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, True Ventures and Visionnaire Ventures. Helpshift and Cisco will explore opportunities to integrate Helpshift’s in-app customer support solutions with Cisco’s leading contact centre solutions, the firm said in a statement. The company said it has raised more than $38.2 million so far. According to VCCEdge, the data research platform of News Corp VCCircle, the company’s overall investment stood at $36.2 million after its first round of Series B funding. This means Cisco’s venture capital arm has now added around $2 million, taking the Series B funding to $25 million. “We continue to invest in strategic solutions to help propel technology developments that will solve challenges for our customers, partners, and beyond,” said Rob Salvagno, head of Cisco Investments and vice president of Cisco Corporate Development. Helpshift is a CRM provider for companies building mobile apps and smart devices. It provides a native mobile software development kit (SDK) that can be integrated into any mobile app to enable two-way communications, helping companies talk to their customers directly inside their apps. Its customer support platform includes in-app frequently asked questions (FAQs), in-app chat, CRM ticketing system, in-app campaigns and in-app surveys on any device. “Just like customer service moved away from phone (voice) to email in the era of the Web, we are now seeing a transition where customer service is moving inside apps to eliminate all the friction in the process of supporting users,” said Abinash Tripathy, CEO and co-founder of Helpshift. “With the additional funding from Cisco Investments, we are looking to help the entire contact centre industry transition from being reactive to proactive while driving higher customer satisfaction and lowering cost,” Tripathy said. Tripathy, along with Baishampayan Ghose, founded Helpshift in Pune in 2012. Ghose serves as chief technology officer of Helpshift. An alumnus of American University, Tripathy previously also founded Infinitely Beta. In the past, he has worked at Yahoo, Openwave Systems and Oracle. Ghose previously co-founded Paisa.com and oCricket.com. He holds a BE degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Shivaji University. In 2014, Helpshift had raised $10 million in its Series A round of funding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Silicon Valley-based early-stage investor Visionnaire Ventures besides existing investors True Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners. In 2011, it had raised $3.2 million in seed funding from Nexus Venture Partners and True Ventures. The company claims that Helpshift has been installed on 2 billion devices worldwide and serves over 400 million mobile customers monthly.

However, users need a computer with the latest generation Intel CPU, a 4K display and are limited to the Edge browser to view the content. It’s for the first time 4K content is available on computers. Previously it was only possible to view content in such a high resolution on some TVs, set top boxes or consoles. In order to view the content on the PC, users need a Netflix  Premium subscription (which is the only plan with Ultra HD support), a computer with a Kaby Lake generation CPU and a 4K display. Besides that, they also need to use Microsoft’s Edge browser, as it’s the only browser that (currently?) supports Netflix 4K content. Why Netflix streaming in 4K on the PC requires Edge is unclear, but Microsoft uses the opportunity to underline again how Edge has a better battery life than Chrome as it states, “When streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery”, which the company previously also claimed in popups shown to Chrome users in Windows 10 and which refer to tests performed by the company. Microsoft adds however that “Battery life varies significantly with settings and other factors”. The requirement of Intel’s Kaby Lake generation CPU is likely because the CPU has better DRM features than its predecessors.   Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: netflix microsoft edge ultra hd windows 10 coolcolors MyCE Resident Posted on: 22 Nov 16 13:28 Quote: Originally Posted by DoMiN8ToR We've just posted the following news: Netflix brings 4K / Ultra HD streaming to Windows 10 but requires Edge and Kaby Lake[newsimage]http://www.myce.com/wp-content/image...logo-95x75.png[/newsimage] Read the full article here: http://www.myce.com/news/netflix-bri...by-lake-80951/ Please note that the reactions from the complete site will be synched below.

I have an HTPC with an i5-3470 and an NVIDIA video card that will play 4k without a hiccup. I see arrangements like this and would like to be a fly on the ceiling when Netflix, MS and Intel met to screw the consumer just to stream 4k video. I also wonder how they can be so out of touch with consumers to think that this business model has any chance of success. 3 Agree neonard2 New Member Posted on: 15 Dec 16 06:31 Netflix is continuously in a process of expanding its services. Though PC based service is good for people who have <a href="http://moviesitesapps.com/free-netflix-account-usernames-passwords/">Netflix accounts</a> but it requires Edge kaby lake. Moreover it needs edge kaby lake to stream movies. Its really a sad news.

Total War: WARHAMMER Out Now for Linux and SteamOS, Ported by Feral Interactive GO Works with both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards Nov 22, 2016 13:40 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  A few moments ago, Feral Interactive officially announced the release of the Total War: WARHAMMER addictive turn-based strategy video game for Linux and SteamOS operating systems. Developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega, Total War: WARHAMMER launched on Valve's Steam digital gaming distribution platform earlier this summer, on May 24, 2016, but only those with a Microsoft Windows PC were able to install and play it. Today, November 22, you can also enjoy Total War: WARHAMMER on your Linux PCs, thanks to the hard work made by UK-based video game publisher Feral Interactive, the same company that brought us, Linux gamers, two other superb AAA titles a couple of months ago, namely Mad Max and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. Total War: WARHAMMER works with both AMD and Nvidia GPUs Because AMD Radeon support for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Mad Max is not officially endorsed, yesterday, November 21, 2016, Feral Interactive was kind enough to inform users of Linux-based operating systems about the minimum and recommended system requirements. Long story short, you'll be able to play the game with both AMD Radeon and Nvidia graphics cards. Feral Interactive managed this time to implement support for the latest Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library compiled using LLVM 3.9 or newer for AMD Radeon GPU support. However, it looks like AMD GPUs are not supported on SteamOS. The minimum requirements on Linux are a PC with an Intel Core i3-4130 running at 3.4GHz or AMD FX6300 processor running at 3.5GHz, with 4GB RAM, and at least an AMD Radeon R9 270 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti graphics cards with 1GB VRAM. Nvidia users should have the latest 367.28 video drivers installed. "The following graphics cards are not supported: AMD Radeon HD 4xxx series, AMD Radeon HD 6xxx series, AMD Radeon HD 5xxx series, ATI X1xxx series, ATI HD2xxx series, Intel GMA series, Intel HD4000, Intel HD3000, NVIDIA 8xxx series, NVIDIA 9xxx series, NVIDIA 1xx series, NVIDIA 3xx series and NVIDIA 7xxx series," said Feral Interactive in the press announcement. However, to fully enjoy the awesome effects of the game, you'll need a PC with an Intel Core i7-4770 processor running at 3.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card with 4GB VRAM or better.

The Cobalt project should bear fruit within the year, when the "Redstone 3" release of Windows 10 is due to arrive, Mary Jo Foley reports. Ideally, Microsoft wants everyone to convert their old Windows apps to be UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps, which are adaptable to different input methods and display sizes. So a phone or tablet to double up as an ad-hoc PC; a UWP "phone" app becomes a "desktop" app when docked to a larger display, and keyboard and mouse, via Continuum. But a large proportion of business apps will never be converted, hence the need to run legacy apps too somehow. Intel dealt Microsoft's strategy a serious blow when it said it wouldn't announce any more new Atom smartphone chips until 5G came around. These chips support the x86/AMD64 instruction sets natively, and could (and probably would) have powered a Surface Phone. A sharp-eyed developer found a reference to "CHPE" architectures as build targets in the header files of the SDK for Windows 10 build 14965. Windows watchers were puzzled when support for next year's flagship Qualcomm MSM8998 processor (as yet unreleased) appeared, then disappeared, from Windows builds. Mary speculates that the Qualcomm part, most likely to be marketed as the Snapdragon 830, would contain hardware that better supports virtualisation. We can't corroborate that – but knowledgeable readers can get in touch. Without native emulation available, HP opted for a streaming solution for its major Continuum-based effort around the Elite x3 (reviewed here), billed as a "three-in-one" for business. Microsoft has to walk a fine line. Legacy x86/amd64 apps aren't "adaptable" and are unsuited to mobile use, having been written for full-blown PCs... but they do provide users with the jam they need today. Microsoft had publicised a major Android emulation initiative for Windows 10, which allowed APK executables to run unmodified on Windows 10. This was called Project Astoria, and for a few surreal weeks, Android apps flooded onto Windows mobile via sideloading. But fearing this would remove any incentive for developers to create UWP apps, Microsoft canned the project. So the instruction set that would never die gets to live a little longer – in a nice little granny flat.

By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch.

Stuart McClure, CEO/President and founder of Cylance. CREDIT: Ethan Pines via Getty Images Advertisement Editor's Note: Inc. Magazine announced its pick for Company of the Year on Tuesday, November 29. It's Riot Games! Here, we spotlight Cylance, a contender for the title in 2016. In 2011, cybersecurity researcher and entrepreneur Stuart McClure spent his last year working at McAfee, as the company's global chief technology officer, apologizing a lot. McClure said hackers were slipping into McAfee customer networks and each subsequent breach seemed worse than the last. McClure would have to meet with each of the big McAfee corporate customers to explain why the software failed and at the end of each meeting someone would ask McClure the same question: "'What type of security software do you use on your machine to prevent cyber attacks?'" The customers would then wait, pens poised above a piece of paper to jot down the long list of layer after layer of high-end software that the global CTO of a multimillion-dollar security company would surely recommend. But McClure would have to tell them his dirty secret: He didn't use any security software. Not even his employer's. "I would tell them I only trust my brain and my hand, because there are no new ways to breach a network," says McClure of his former employer, which is now owned by Intel. "I would walk them through what I did each day to prevent attacks," he says. "I asked myself, 'Why can I prevent attacks on my computer with my behavior and we can't train a computer to do the same thing?'" That was the seed for Cylance, the Irvine, California company co-founded in 2012 by McClure and McAfee's then-chief scientist, Ryan Permeh. Contrary to what most big security vendors tell customers, McClure explains, there are only a handful of ways a hacker can penetrate a company's systems. If you know your way around a system, you know the ways a hacker can get in and you know how to protect your machine. Though Cylance has signed up high-profile customers like Toyota, Gap, WWE, Panasonic, and a long list of clients it cannot name, the biggest endorsement of its software, which uses both artificial intelligence and machine learning, came in 2016. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a report in which it detailed arguably the worst data breach perpetrated against the U.S. government and credited Cylance for finding and fixing the problem. The widely cited report put Cylance on the map, for its part in successfully throttling a months-long data breach of the United States Office of Personnel Management. Before Cylance was hired to mitigate the hack, cyber crooks had swiped the sensitive personal information of 21.5 million Americans, both current and former federal government employees. This year, Dell announced that it would include Cylance on the machines it sells to corporate customers. Those accolades are forcing investors to take notice. Blackstone, Insight Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, and others have flooded Cylance with $177 million--giving the company a valuation of $1.1 billion. This year, the company also landed the 26th spot on the Inc. 5000, which tracks the three-year revenue growth of the fastest-growing private companies in America. Cylance brought in $11.1 million in 2015 revenue, up 7,613 percent from 2012. Prioritizing prevention The key difference between Cylance and its competitors is that it moves to prevent hacks, rather than to simply detect them. Most legacy antivirus software is maintained by humans, says McClure. Researchers find a virus and tell a security company, an employee has to give it a signature and a name, and then an update is issued and sent to all the antivirus software users. This process, which is prone to human error, can take weeks, McClure explains. Co-founder Ryan Permeh explains why Cylance's method works: "Bad guys change their hacking methods slowly over time. They are approaching glacial speeds. The snow and ice on top changes, so their tools appear new, but the glacier doesn't move that much." In other words, since there aren't many new ways to break in, you can plan around the known vulnerabilities. And rather than task a team of humans to watch a company 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible to teach a machine to do the work. "Our machine-learning model continues to go through iterative experiences to learn incrementally, like a human brain," says McClure. "The more data we feed it, the smarter it gets, the more aware it becomes, and the easier it is to recognize objects and names." To be sure, this method of security is seen by many in the industry as a fool's errand, after companies from Adobe to Sony have been breached. As attacks become more plentiful--and bad actors breach the security of some of the world's biggest companies and governments--many security companies have turned to detection instead of prevention. Even so, McClure says it is possible to prevent breaches. The entrepreneur cut his chops in the 1980s studying the Morris worm, the first autonomous virus. He also co-authored the seminal book on breaching networks, Hacking Exposed, and, with former partner George Kurtz sold his first security startup, Foundstone, another Inc. 500 company, to McAfee in 2004. Kurtz, who quit McAfee to start detection security company Crowdstrike, and McClure are now battling it out on either end of network security theory. Kurtz, in the detection camp, can also boast $1 billion valuation. "There is no such thing as 100 percent security," says McClure. "There is always some way in. But now, as artificial intelligence and machine learning have improved, you can prevent hackers of today and tomorrow, because hackers use the same techniques." Leading edge Confidence has also been key to Cylance's success. Even before the company's software existed, Mark Hatfield, who was a partner at Fairhaven Capital at the time, says he remembers sitting down to dinner with McClure. The entrepreneur took a napkin and mapped out the whole company--the problem it would solve, how antivirus software doesn't work, how they would use machine learning to teach a mathematical model to recognize malware, and how in two years they'd have a product better than anything on the market. Hatfield was sold. "There was no code. It had to be built, but his vision and his experience with what wasn't working at McAfee, and his ability to recruit smart people, which is key, was all there," says Hatfield. "The napkin said it all: McClure was able to break down a complex problem into something anyone could understand." "McClure knew the problem better than anyone, and at the end of day, people follow his lead," says Jay Leek, managing director and the chief information security officer for Blackstone. Today, the company is now protecting more than three million computer networks, Permeh says. In 2014, Cylance revealed that Iranian hackers had breached the networks of airports all over the world and were printing out security badges. McClure and Permeh add that after they discovered this breach, it reinforced their belief that preventing hacks was the right thing to focus on. "Honestly, most hacks, most major breaches, are not that complicated," says Permeh. "What's more concerning is that there is a lot of malware out there on networks. At Cylance, we let machines do what machines do well, to sift through big data to find those patterns of maliciousness at scale and stop attacks before they start."

Despite a rocky start, the “tablet that can replace your laptop” has created a new category that now everyone is trying to emulate or compete with, including, to some extent, Apple. There is, however, always room for something better, which is what Finnish startup Eve Tech is proposing with the Eve V. And, unlike Microsoft, the Eve V was designed right from the start with consumers on the co-pilot seat. There is no shortage of Surface Pro rivals, and even clones, but how many of those involved consumers and potential buyers in the development of the device. Given the business risks and complicated processes, none. Except the Eve V. The company actually crowdsourced the feature list for this portable computer, with the specs finalized just a few days ago. And it’s a list that would make computer users, especially tablet believers, drool. • CPU: Intel 7th gen Core m3 or i5 or i7 • RAM: 8 or 16 GB LPDDR3 • Storage: 128 or 256 or 512 GB SSD • Dispaly: 12.3-inch 2736×1824 IGZO LCD • Battery: 48 Wh, 12 hours • Connectivity: 2×2 MU-MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 • Ports: 1x Thunderbolt 3, 1x USB-C, 2x USB 3.1, 1x 3.5 mm audio • Sensors: Fingerprint, Hall, Gravity, Gyro, Light • Accessories: Wired and wireless backlit keyboard, N-Trig V Pen with1,024 levels of pressure Short of Microsoft coming out with a Surface Pro 5, this easily outranks the current Surface Pro 4 titleholder. And that’s just in the raw specs of the tablet. Other features, like an iPad Pro-esque quad speaker setup, fingerprint scanner on the tablet itself, not the detachable keyboard, zero bloatware Windows 10 installation, and that popular Scandinavian design, make the Eve V an even more compelling buy. Well, not exactly buy, as the Eve V is still at Indiegogo. Given the support it received during the crowdsourcing stage, it’s really no surprise that the campaign already raised 7 times its $75,000 goal in just a day. And that’s thanks to yet another unique thing about this campaign. Eve V’s Indiegogo run is using a reservation system so that you won’t have to pay the full price of the device in one go. You can “reserve” or lock down a slot for a third of the full amount. The remaining balance will be charged in January when Eve Tech starts purchasing the components for production. Before then, backers can still back out and refund their full pledge.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Business ATOS :The CEA Tera1000 Bull sequana by Atos enters the TOP500 most powerful supercomputers in the world PR-Inside.com: 2016-11-22 11:05:02 ·         Marks the launch of the second stage of Tera1000 project at CEA, which heralds the arrival of exascale supercomputers Atos adds a 20th HPC in the TOP500 using a revolutionary BXI technology Paris, 22 November 2016 - Atos, an international leader in digital services, and CEA announce that the first Bull sequana equipped with BXI (Bull eXascale Interconnect) has entered the TOP500 ranking of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. A total of 20 supercomputers developed by Atos are currently ranked in the TOP500 list*. The Bull sequana supercomputer equipped with BXI is the first "cell" of the 25-petaflop supercomputer that Atos will supply to The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in 2017 as part of the Tera1000 project. Its architecture heralds the next generation of exascale supercomputers for the 2020s. The first phase of the Tera1000 supercomputer at CEA is currently ranked #55 in the TOP500. One single cell ranked in TOP500 The system that is ranked in the TOP500 is a single Bull sequana cell, featuring 85 compute blades interconnected by a BXI network, with a total of 220 Intel® Xeon Phi(TM) 7250 processors, coming to a theoretical peak power of 670 teraflops[1]. It is developing a Linpack performance of 380.5 teraflops. For the first time in the world, a supercomputer is equipped with the new generation BXI network developed by Atos. BXI is one of the key technologies that will eventually enable us to reach exascale level performances. Designed and developed in France Bull sequana supercomputers are produced at the Atos factory in Angers, France. They are designed based on the worldwide expertise of engineers from the Atos group, as well as long-standing partnerships with major customers such as the CEA: the tried-and-tested methodology of co-design aims to optimise the performance of the simulation code - supercomputer pairing. As François Geleznikoff, Head of the CEA's Military Applications Division, says: "Meeting the challenge of exaflops and big data is a major issue for research, defence and industry, as it opens up a whole field that today remains unexplored and inaccessible, making it possible for us to not only understand, but also simulate complex physical phenomena and industrial systems. In Europe, the CEA, in partnership with Atos, is particularly well positioned to meet this challenge - both in terms of the expertise of its teams, and the dynamism of its computing facilities, which are open to all fields of research and industry." Philippe Vannier, Executive Vice-President in charge of Big Data & Security and the Chief Technology Officer in the Atos Group, adds: "Atos is incredibly proud to see the concrete results of the Tera1000 project. Today we are taking a major step on the road towards exaflops. Undoubtedly, the interconnect technologies will provide a crucial contribution in achieving exaflops performance. With BXI, Atos is confirming its leadership in the field of supercomputers and beyond in the processing of very large volumes of data." The Atos supercomputer 'Santos Dumont' at LNCC in Brazil ranked #364 received an award from the TOP500 organization as it is the largest supercomputer in South America. *List of Atos supercomputers worldwide that are ranked in the TOP500: #34 - DKRZ - Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum in Germany #50 +51 - Meteo France in France #55 - CEA in France « Tera1000 » #64 -Grand Equipement National de Calcul Intensif - Centre Informatique National de l'Enseignement Suprieur (GENCI-CINES) in France #73 - Atos in France #74 - CEA/TGCC-GENCI in France "Curie" #75 - CEA/CCRT in France #82 - International Fusion Energy Research Centre (IFERC), EU(F4E) - Japan Broader Approach collaboration in Japan #83 - Atos in France "Diego" #97 - SURFsara in the Netherlands "Cartesius" #104 - CEA in France « Tera100 » #107 - TU Dresden, ZIH in Germany #128 - EDF in France #211 - Centre Informatique National (CINES) in France #364 -Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica in Brazil « Santos Dumont »- number 1 supercomputer in South America #393  - Bull in France « Manny » #400 - National Centre for Nuclear Research in Poland #456 - Atos« Bull sequana BXI » in France #476 - Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica in Brazil About the CEA and the Military Applications Division The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) is a public research organization working in four main areas: defense and security, nuclear and renewable energies, technological research for industry and fundamental research.

This CPU is actually coming out along with Naples (which also has 32 cores). Intel has very strong CPU performance, but AMD's interconnects are usually superior.

The video streaming service has now announced that users with Windows 10 PCs will now be able to stream content in Ultra HD resolution using the Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft has clarified that in order to stream 4K content from Netflix, the user's set up "must have a 4K-capable screen and use a 7th Gen Intel Core Processor." Further it should be noted that neither all content is available in Ultra-HD resolution nor all subscriptions allow streaming in 4K. In order to enjoy the 4K content users will be required to upgrade to Premium monthly subscription, which is available for Rs. 800 a month in India. (Also see: Microsoft Woos Users to Edge Browser by Touting 1080p Netflix Playback)"Your binge-watching favourites on Netflix are now available in 4K exclusively on compatible PCs and 2-in-1 devices, on Windows 10. Check out the new streaming experience with Microsoft Edge, the only browser that supports Netflix 4K content," Microsoft said in a blog post on Monday. The blog post includes a plug for Microsoft Edge's power consumption claims, says that Edge users will be able to watch at least 1 more episode than Chrome users due to the improved battery life they will enjoy. The new Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, premieres on Friday. Netflix has clearly stated on its website that a download speed of at least 25Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD content. Recently, Google started testing 4K UHD movie purchase and rental options through Google Play store and Google Play Movies & TV app. The company also started shipping its Chromecast Ultra dongle, with support for 4K, earlier this month in the US.

Investors will want to know what President-elect Trump sees as a winning negotiating strategy. A full-blown trade war with China would surely rock global markets.

Friedman: Dancing in a hurricane Trump rode in on howling winds of change November 22, 2016 12:00 AM By Thomas L. Friedman Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump’s election in America constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I’ve been working on a book about what’s been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that’s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That’s such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you’ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyze enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable both Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what the Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When President-elect Trump wants to be heard, he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at “Jeopardy!” or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalization and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalization and more globalization drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn’t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organize vast illicit migration networks to get there. No wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilized. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there’s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many, diversity has too fast for them to adapt. That’s why my favorite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called “The Eye,” the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalization and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we’re all being asked to dance. Mr. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of millions and promised to build a wall against the howling winds of change. I disagree with them. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to adjust to these accelerations and to draw energy from them — but also to provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them.

It looks like Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS includes mostly updated drivers, for ACPI, GPU (Intel i915), iiO, IOMMU, DMA, CLK, MMC, Ethernet (Intel i40e), NFC, SCSI, TTY, USB, and PINCTRL devices, but there are also minor changes to the s390, MIPS, and ARC hardware architectures, a fix for the Btrfs file system, and an updated sound stack that adds small fixes to the sun4i-codec and Cirrus Logic CS4270 ASoC. Therefore, if you’re using a Linux-based operating system powered by a kernel from the long-term supported Linux 4.4 series, you are urged to update to version 4.4.33 as soon as possible, or more precisely as soon as it lands in the stable repositories of your favorite distro.

Price $3199 AUD > Pricing info Specs GeForce GTX 1070 GPU • Intel i7-6700HQ CPU • 8GB DDR4; 15.6-inch IPS display • 1TB HDD • 256GB SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Welcome to a new world of mobile gaming. It’s finally here. Two months after the release of the desktop GeForce GTX 1070 comes the mobile version, and it’s quite unlike anything we’ve seen from a mobile GPU release before. Whereas past mobile versions of chips were huge cut-backs from their desktop equivalent, Nvidia has actually beefed this up when compared to the desktop GeForce GTX 1070. Asus was the first partner to get us a machine powered by this revolutionary new GPU, the GL502V5.  As part of the premium ROG Strix range, this is most definitely a product aimed at those with money to burn. It’s got enough glowy RGB bits to make it look like a gaming product, yet Asus has gone for a relatively simple design, with straight lines and a matte black finish. Its overall size is dictated by the 15.6-inch IPS display, which has a nice wide viewing angle of 178 degrees. The native resolution of 1920 x 1080 isn’t exactly mind-blowing, and the lack of G-Sync is a bit of a bummer given the incredible performance of the GPU. Colour and contrast are solid, if not quite at the stunning performance of Razer’s latest screens.  Weighing in at 2.34kg it’s a decent middleweight machine, but delivers the performance of 4 to 5 kilogram behemoths. Measuring at just 235mm thickness, this thing is just small and light enough to fit into your backpack without causing undue pressure. Our sample had a weird keyboard, with several of the keys in the wrong place, but we’re guessing this is just a result of it being an early sample. The keyboard is advertised as full-sized, though we found it a little cramped; at least it’s backlit. We weren’t big fans of the touchpad either, which lacked the accuracy and finesse of the very best touchpads.  A great range of I/O options are included; three USB 3.0 Type A sit alongside a single USB 3.0 Type C/Thunderbolt 3 connection. There’s also HDMI – sadly it’s only 1.4b though. This thing would make for a great 4K media device to connect to your TV. There’s also a mini DisplayPort output though, which will handle the job given the right cable. A single Ethernet port delivers wired connectivity, while 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.1 handles wireless.  It’s what’s inside that really counts though. Intel’s ubiquitous i7-6700HQ is a quad-cored, Hyper-Threaded powerhouse, which ramps up to 3.5GHz under maximum load. Asus has paired this with 8GB of DDR4 memory, which seems a little light considering the price point. Those looking for lots of long-term storage should be satisfied by the 1TB mechanical drive, but like most laptops these days there’s also a 256GB M.2 SSD. It’s all mounted on Intel’s high-end HM170 Express Chipset, but the real explanation for the amazing performance has to go to Nvidia’s GTX 1070. As mentioned in our deep dive, this is in some ways even better than the desktop version of the GeForce GTX 1070. Based on the exact same GP104 GPU found in the desktop part, it’s got an extra Streaming Multiprocessor (SM), up from 15 on the desktop to 16 on the mobile version. This in turn delivers more CUDA cores and texture units. The desktop GeForce GTX 1070 has 1920 CUDA cores, while the mobile version has 2048. This is a revelation, as we’re accustomed to seeing the number of CUDA cores axed in mobile versions of Nvidia’s chips. The number of texture units has also increased thanks to the extra SM, up from 120 to 128. The total number of ROPs remains identical, at 64.  However, all these extra CUDA cores equals more heat, so Nvidia has slightly dropped the frequencies of the GP104. The desktop part has a Base clock of 1506MHz, which drops slightly to 1443MHz in the mobile component. The Boost clock has also been decreased but only by the smallest of amounts, down from 1683MHz to 1645MHz. Both the desktop and mobile variants come with the full 8GB of GDDR5X running at 8Gbps over a 256-bit memory bus. The end result is a product that delivers double the speed of its predecessor, the GeForce GTX 970M. As you can see from our Razer Blade benchmarks, which has a 970M, the new 1070 absolutely wipes the floor with it. However, it’s not exactly quiet, hitting 52dB under load, which is rather rowdy to say the least. Asus has built a very solid machine around an incredible new GPU. We would have liked a slightly better screen, but then the price would have been even higher. Regardless, this laptop has totally revolutionised the performance we can expect from a laptop, putting many regular desktops to shame.

FRIEDMAN Nov. 21, 2016   Today’s Opinion stories Happy New Year, Putin Good year, bad year Large-scale farms and dairies depicted unfairly Americans believe crazy, wrong things The 2016 Sidney Awards, part deux More Opinion »   Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump’s election in the U.S. constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I’ve been working on a book about what’s been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that’s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That’s such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you’ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyze enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at “Jeopardy!” or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalization and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalization and more globalization drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn’t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organize vast illicit migration networks to get there. So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilized. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there’s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many others they’ve come faster than they can adapt. That’s why my favorite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called “The Eye,” the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalization and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we’re all being asked to dance. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them — but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them.

It’s been a strange old year, and it’s a testament to just how strange that this headline doesn’t seem too out of place anymore. Microsoft – once the poster company for closed software – has joined The Linux Foundation as a platinum member. What was unthinkable just a few short years ago makes much more sense if you track the company’s recent conversion towards elements of open source. .NET Core 1 was made openly available; the company partnered with Canonical to build Ubuntu into Windows 10; and it worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure. When Microsoft acquired Xamarin, they open-sourced the company’s software-development kit, and they seem to have a good working relationship with the likes of Red Hat and SUSE. In short, Microsoft’s attitudes have been changing for some time, and in joining The Linux Foundation as a platinum member (something that costs around $US500,000), it's joining companies such as IBM, Fujitsu, Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, Oracle, Facebook and Cisco. “As a cloud platform company, we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,” explained Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of the Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group. “The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community’s most innovative open-source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalise on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.” Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, was warm in welcoming the group’s old rivals to the fold, despite acknowledging to TechCrunch that the move might prompt “some scepticism”. “Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology,” he explained. “The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects,” he added. “Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open-source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions.” For Microsoft’s part, membership of The Linux Foundation grants – according to the group’s website – “events, training and certification, open-source best practices, marketing, and promotion necessary for corporate members to build, scale, and sustain critical open-source projects and communities for commercial adoption”. But perhaps more importantly, this is another big step in Microsoft’s plan to win over the hearts and minds of the open-source sector.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Walmart Black Friday 2016: Best Deals, Store Hours And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Nov 21 2016, 3:26pm CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 22 2016, 7:45am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad   The Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale is possibly the most popular of the season. Here is what you need to know to get the best Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals. I'm doing that Black Friday thing since over a decade. The Walmart Black Friday ad was always the highlight of the season. This year is different. The advertised deals are ok, but nothing really is exciting or totally unique. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Walmart killed what I thought was one of their best ideas for Black Friday. This year there are no 1-hour guarantee deals, despite what some reports I have seen on major newspapers are still claiming. This year all customers at Walmart have to get wristbands for the doorbuster deals. Once the wristbands are gone, there is no way to get the deal. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad features 4K Ultra HDTVs deals, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4K TV for $398. Other television offers consist of a Vizio 60-inch HDTV for $398, a 40-inch HDTV for $125 and $225 50-inch Emerson 1080p HDTV.  Best Walmart Black Friday Deals $98 24" Samsung UN24H4000 720p TV $99 10.1" RCA Atom 2GB 32GB SSD Laptop $99 New Nintendo 3DS $99 iPhone 5S StraightTalk (Prepaid) $125 40" Hisense 1080p TV $199 iPad mini 2 32GB $199 15.6" AMD E2 4GB 500GB HDD Laptop $225 50" Emerson 1080p TV $249 Sony PS4 Slim Uncharted 4 Bundle w/ $30 Gift Card $249 15.6" HP Touch Intel Pentium 4GB 500GB HDD Laptop $279 Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Bundle w/  Controller $298 55" Philips 4K Smart TV $349 15.6" HP AMD A10 8GB 1TB HDD Laptop + Accessories  $369 DJI Phantom 3 Standard $398 60" Vizio D60N-E3 1080p TV Walmart has unveiled the Walmart Cyber Monday 2016 Deals. Now customers can compare the Cyber deals with the offers Walmart has on Black Friday. The deals Walmart is offering on Black Friday and Cyber Monday are different. Walmart's Cyber Monday deals are not beating Black Friday deals. Walmart Pre-Black Friday Deals In the days ahead of the Walmart Black Friday sale, the retailer is offering Pre-Black Friday deals online at walmart.com. The offered deals are already of Black Friday quality. Walmart is added new deals every day. Walmart Samsung Savings Event The Walmart Samsung Event is a special Black Friday sale on Samsung device, mostly dominated by deals on Samsung TVs. Walmart is offering deals that go beyond the announced Samsung Black Friday deals as the retailer has vast inventory on 2015 Samsung TVs. The Samsung Savings event continues all Thanksgiving week on walmart.com. Time of Walmart Black Friday Online Sale  Walmart confirmed the launch time of the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale online. The Black Friday deals will be released at 9pm PST on Wednesday, November 23. This is midnight for east coast shoppers. Based our observations of the Walmart Black Friday sale, deal hunters can expect to find leaked Black Friday deals available before 9pm PST. It is advised to visit walmart.com before the official launch time. Walmart Black Friday Store Hours Walmart will once again open on Thanksgiving Day. The 6pm store opening time is the same as last year. Wristbands for doorbuster deals could be handed out as early as 2 hours before the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale begins. Ask at the associates at your local Walmart store when wristbands have been handed out last year to prepare your shopping schedule. Walmart Black Friday Store Maps The Walmart Black Friday 2016 store maps are available for download online and in the Walmart Shopping app. Walmart lists the locations of 24 Black Friday deals in the Walmart Black Friday 2016 store map. The listed deals include the DJI Phantom 3 drone, HP Touch Laptop, HP Non-Touch Laptop, 40-inch TV, the Philips 55 4K TV deal, Samsung 24" TV and 50" TV.

Apple Intentionally Keeps Verizon iPhone 7 From Reaching Max Speed, To Match AT&T Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Intentionally Keeps Verizon iPhone 7 From Reaching Max Speed, To Match AT&T Image courtesy of YouTube November 21, 2016 4:38 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc not actually the same apple iphone iPhone 7 at&t verizon wireless You would think an iPhone 7 is an iPhone 7, right? Apple’s famous for making one consistent device that’s the same inside, and works the same way, from carrier to carrier. So it’s a little surprising that one carrier’s version of the phone actually could work faster than another’s… and even more surprising that Apple’s set it up not to perform as well as it can. The Verizon Wireless version of the iPhone 7 is technologically capable of downloading data at 600 Mbps over LTE. That’s super fast! But as two research firms told Bloomberg News, in practice the phone is not optimized, and can’t exceed 450 Mbps — the maximum download speed that the competing AT&T iPhone 7 can reach. Now, granted, most users won’t notice the difference. Real-world tests, like the one PC Mag runs every year, find that the average 4G LTE connection speed you get ranges between 19 and 30 Mbps depending what city you’re in and which of the four major carriers you’re using. The top download speed recorded in their tests last year was 160 Mbps, on a Verizon phone in the northwest part of the country. That means the 450 Mbps download speed a Verizon iPhone 7 limits itself to, and that AT&T users get, is still a solid four times faster than anything most users will ever be able to connect with. iPhone parts are sourced from a whole bunch of different companies. It’s not just that one company makes glass and another makes CPUs and a third makes modems; for a huge number of internal components, there are several different manufacturers for each individual part, too. That’s basically the key difference here, the research firms tell Bloomberg: the Verizon/Sprint model has a Qualcomm chip in it; the AT&T/T-Mobile one uses a sligtly different Intel chip. The Qualcomm one is both newer and faster than the Intel one. MORE: It takes dozens of companies to make your iPhone Still, analysts told Bloomberg — it’s straight up weird for a technology company to throttle itself in this way. But that brings us back to the top, and most consumers’ (and developers!) assumption that an iPhone is an iPhone is an iPhone. “They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better,” one analyst told Bloomberg. “If Apple had a guiding principle, it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” Other analysts pointed out that not only does Apple need to create a unified customer experience, but also will want to keep all wireless carriers equally happy. “Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners,” a different expert told Bloomberg. “It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product.” Was this helpful?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet By Thomas Friedman - - Published: 4:00 AM, November 22, 2016 Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Mr Donald Trump’s election in America constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the past three years I have been working on a book about what has been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that is roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That is such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an Internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you have never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyse enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable both Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from US$100 million (S$142.6 million) in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the Internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what the Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times, social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: The power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When President-elect Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at Jeopardy! or chess, they are also starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs, and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and further than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet (9,000m) you see that technology, globalisation and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalisation and more globalisation drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they did not want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their smartphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organise vast illicit migration networks to get there. So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilised. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there is now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many others they have come faster than they can adapt. That is why my favourite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called The Eye, the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/But I never was afraid that it would die/You can dance in a hurricane/But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalisation and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we are all being asked to dance. Mr Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them — but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them. More on that another day.

DatArcs Is Aiming For Dynamically-Tuned, Self-Optimizing Linux Servers Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 21 November 2016 at 02:24 PM EST. 9 Comments DatArcs is a new software start-up aiming to provide software to dynamically tune Linux servers for maximum performance and energy efficiency in the data-center. The DatArcs optimizer analyzes the server's workload over time and optimizes the server "several times per minute" to achieve better performance or lower power use. DatArcs appears to be like an Intel PowerTOP on steroids but is self-learning and tunes the system by itself for maximum performance (or lower power use). The company says, "The 100’s of knobs in your system are tuned for your workload within hours, with no manual intervention...DatArcs Optimizer achieves the greatest speedups and greatest energy reductions on bare-metal servers that run native applications and containers. It can even tune within virtual machines." So far DatArcs is in a closed-beta so there isn't easy access to it for testing. It also appears that it will be a closed-source, commercial product when launched. The company did share some basic results via the Phoronix Test Suite when running Apache and the results are promising. CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04 appear to be the supported operating systems so far for their closed-beta. Those interested in learning more can visit DatArcs.com. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Shares Are Up Today The circuit and microchip maker got a flattering offer. Bradley Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 21, 2016 at 2:31PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (NASDAQ:AMCC) are up more than 11% as of 2:18 p.m. EST today following the news that the microchip company is going to be acquired by the larger Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (NASDAQ:MTSI). This follows a similar jump in October when Applied Micro reported better-than-expected Q3 sales growth.  So what Macom's offer of $770 million to acquire Applied Micro Circuits is a 15% premium over the price of shares at the time of the announcement. The deal as announced would provide Applied Micro Circuits shareholders with $8.36 per share made up by $3.25 of cash and 0.1089 Macom shares per AMCC share.  Image source: Applied Micro Corp. The reason for Macom's move seems to be that the large chipmaker is trying to consolidate power in an attempt to compete with its even bigger rivals in the space like Intel. A few different law firms have already filed today for increased scrutiny of the buyout deal, but so far the market's reaction seems to indicate that Wall Street expects the deal to go through.  Now what Macom is not the only one in the industry looking to consolidate power and gain more market share of some of the high-growth areas these chipmakers are vying for, including autonomous driving cars, artificial intelligence, defense technology, and much more. Macom's purchase of Applied Micro seems to be a play specifically to gain in the data center segment of the market, but it could help the company to grow in various segments. This highly competitive industry is one that benefits those companies with the best technology, the most resources for increased innovation, and the best brand name to land big partnerships, which is why a company like NVIDIA is thriving in this space now. For Macom, we will wait to see how well this acquisition can help it to gain ground in these new segments and compete with this much bigger rivals.   Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fruit Street is a leading telehealth software platform that is licensed to healthcare professionals allowing them to conduct HIPAA-compliant video visits to monitor their patients’ health, diet, and lifestyle using medical and wearable devices. The conference will be held at the Four Points by Sheraton located at 1471 N 4th St, San Jose, CA 95112. More information on the event can be found at the conference website: https://vsee.com/telehealth-failures-conference/ The size of the telehealth market is expected to expand to $30BN by the year 2020, yet many of the most well-funded telehealth startups continue to fail. The purpose of the conference is to identify best practices in the telehealth industry through an examination of industry case studies.  The conference will be attended by leading companies in the telehealth industry including MDLive, Salesforce, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Dell, CloudDX, Get Real Health, International SOS, DaVita, Qualcomm, CEP America, Ascension Healthcare, Cooper University Hospital and the University of Michigan. Fruit Street CEO and Co-Founder Laurence Girard will address the conference on the use of telehealth for weight management. Fruit Street will also be represented at the conference by Co-Founder and CTO Dr. Milton Chen, PhD who will deliver an address titled “The Telehealth Adoption Black Hole” in which he will analyze the challenges of Health Spot, Doctor on Demand, American Well and other leading telehealth companies. Dr. Chen is also the founder of VSee, Fruit Street’s joint venture software development partner, which is well-known for being selected by NASA as the provider of video software for use on the International Space Station and is the same video technology used in Fruit Street. On the telehealth industry, Laurence Girard recently remarked that “obesity costs the US healthcare system over $147BN each year and two in three Americans are overweight or obese. Our healthcare system must use technology such as Fruit Street to find more cost-effective solutions to address the obesity epidemic.” About Fruit Street Telehealth Fruit Street Telehealth is a public benefit company, licensing telehealth software to healthcare professionals allowing them to conduct HIPAA-compliant video consultations with their patients to monitor health, diet and lifestyle using medical/wearable devices and mobile applications.

(Reuters photo) In a new prophecy shared at The Elijah List, Stephen Powell, a revivalist minister who preaches the word under Steve Toliver of Abundance of Rain Ministries and Todd Bentley of Fresh Fire Ministries, says the election of Donald Trump and Mike Pence was the first step in what could lead to third Great Awakening in America. The day after Trump's election, he said he saw "two peacocks come together as one mighty bird," which then took off into the air with "an incredible sound of power," while a large eagle landed on the ground at the same time. He then heard the voice of the Lord, booming from the heavens, say, "The Eagle has landed, and now the prophet will soar." He said the eagle landing represented God securing the presidency in the Cyrus anointing of President-elect Donald Trump. He said the double portion peacock is "the double portion seer prophetic anointing being released in the nation right now." "This anointing is for the nation, and is being offered to the nation, to be received like never before," he wrote. "Prophetic authority is rising in our land and will influence our government in increasing ways moving forward. "God is offering Heaven's Intel to governments in the nations, including our own. This prophetic authority will pierce the news media establishment as well as the entertainment mountain like we've never seen. This will continue to weaken the antichrist spirit's hold on these establishments and thus the entire nation, even the mind of the nation." He delved deeper into this prophecy, and then offered another regarding prophetic justice in America: <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=641924889" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=641924889" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Those who would harm these little ones, says the Lord, it would be better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself into the waters; for you will not be able to hide from My justice as I release it on the wings of the fear of the Lord in the days to come. I will be a Terror to terror, a Force against evil, a hindrance to wickedness, a plague against those who would bring harm to these innocent ones, says the Lord. You will not find a place to hide, a place to cover yourself, in my renaissance of justice, if you harm My little ones, says the Lord. You will flee across the sea from whence you came. You will find no shelter, no harbor for your wickedness in My nation of liberty and justice for all, says the Lord. You will run for I will chase you, because I will not rest day nor night, until all of My little ones are safe in this land, says the Lord. My prophets will speak and expose your ways, and My arm of justice will be extended in this land, to take hold of the syndicates, to take hold of the rings, to take hold of the cartels, the traffickers—even the power brokers. Their evil shall not breathe. I will snuff out their funds, I will capture back their wealth, turn the flow of their riches for the poor, the widow and for those in need. I will send you back from whence you came. Watch and see, watch and see.

Schiller’s response reveals that doubling the RAM from 16 to 32 gigabytes would have required a different logic board design versus the notebook’s mustache-shaped logic board, one that would have reduced space for batteries. Schiller’s alleged response, in full: To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.  In other words, doubling the RAM would have required using DDR4 RAM that’s unsupported by the Intel chips powering the new Pro. Slaney found out that LPDDR3E RAM chips in the new Pro (a low power, enhanced version of DDR3 RAM) normally use 1.5 watts of power whereas faster DDR4 memory would use about 3-5 watts of power: It’s impossible to get an exact figure on it, but depending on the usage it can be estimated that between two and five watts are saved using LPDDR3E RAM instead of DDR4. And since the system averages to drawing about 20 watts on battery in normal usage, this can be said to be the difference of the RAM using two watts versus three to six watts for DDR4. Translated to overall power usage that would make the difference of ten percent of power being dedicated to RAM versus the 20-30 percent it would be for DDR4. When an average notebook with DDR4 RAM enters sleep mode, which is known as background power draw, the RAM itself consumes nearly half the overall power draw versus just 20 percent when using LPDDR3 RAM. Using DDR4 RAM would have decreased the Pro’s standby time from 30 days to less than one week, he concluded. With DDR4 they’d have produced a notebook that would have a completely drained battery if it was at 50 percent charge and you closed the lid and left it for a few days. Not only would that be annoying, but by running the battery flat often it would end up damaging a percentage of their batteries because they’d frequently get 100 percent discharged, which puts a lot of stress on them, and sometimes even kills them. In conclusion, Slaney wrote that several high-end Windows notebooks that utilize DDR4 RAM don’t get nearly as much battery performance as advertised. Battery life of the Dell XPS 15 with 32GB RAM was found to be disappointing, garnering only 5 hours 40 minutes of video playback from its 84 Whr battery. “This is a far cry from Dell’s advertised battery life of 17 hours,” wrote ExpertReviews. Schiller previously emailed a reader inquiring about the RAM situation on the new MacBook Pro, saying doubling the RAM would have negatively impacted battery life: To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system. The 16GB-limit stems from Apple’s decision to use Intel’s Skylake chips rather than the latest Kaby Lake platform that was unveiled in August. As we thoroughly explained, while Skylake chips in the new Pros do support 2133 MHz LPDDR3E RAM—they don’t support for LPDDR4 RAM. Summing up, costly Kaby Lake chips are needed to support DDR4 RAM. It gets even more complicated than that because Kaby Lake is set to include support for a power-sipping “LP” variant of DDR4 RAM, but only for the slower “U” category of chips for ultra-thin notebooks like the MacBook Air and the twelve-inch MacBook. Kaby Lake may not support LPDDR4 RAM on notebooks until late next year or 2018.

That first quote was 37 words long. Your TL;DR version of it was 46 characters long JulianZH First world problem right there. Agneev Mukherjee WTF? Rolf Bause What is next? “Schiller: Including physical ESC button would’ve dramatically reduced space for batteries too.” Mr_Coldharbour Maybe if the chassis wasn’t obsessively thin, battery capacity would not have been an issue. askep3 Honestly, I have the 13 inch and the battery life is 6-7 hours so far Kevin Paterson Remember when you first get a MacBook it’s doing lots of first-time stuff like indexing and updates. Battery life should level out soon. askep3 It’s almost been a week (will be on Wednesday) how long does it usually take to finish indexing? I set up as new so it doesn’t have old files Mr_Coldharbour It depends what you do on the Mac, if you do any graphics intensive or CPU intensive tasks then it’s normal. Also it depends how old your battery is. There might also be a bad process or something running rampant causing less than expected battery life. The next time you’re on your Mac, open up Activity Monitor found in the Utilities folder, click on the Energy tab and see what’s eating away at the battery. Maybe take into the Apple Store or have Apple send someone over to take it in for a checkup and possibly change the battery. Also, if you happen to be sitting on your desk all day it’s better to just leave it plugged in to the power outlet. The less charge cycles the less wear on the battery in the long run. When not in use unplug of course. Use the actual Mac’s battery no more than once a week and don’t be in the habit of draining it completely or reaching the red too much. askep3 I’ve been keeping tabs on activity monitor all the time, the mac is brand new, and I’m just web browsing occasionally watching videos and listening to music via headphones. I’m guessing the issue is that it is the MacBook Pro Mr_Coldharbour If you feel there’s something wrong then take it in to Apple for repairs or you can call them up and they’ll send someone over to pick it up for you. As I said, if you do a lot of your work sitting on a desk on your Mac then keep it plugged in while in use then unplug when not in use. Use the battery no more than once a week but do not be in the habit of completely draining it, it just puts more wear on the battery. Idea is to keep charge cycles to a minimum if you can. Let a charge cycle last longer. leart I’m with you but for the most people I know who have a MacBook they go crazy for the slim size of their Mac burge Instead of telling your customers (Apple) what they want, why don’t you listen to what your customers are asking for. mwpitt52 Hate to break the news but the new MacBook Pro is nothing more than a 13 -15 inch iPhone. gary Lol you can’t be serious… Go back to whatever Windows circle jerk blog you came from. mwpitt52 Nope. Just bought the 2015 MacBook Retina. Maybe your profile pic can be used for the Windows circle jerk blog. gary So then why did you just buy a MacBook if it’s nothing more than a large iPhone? Also, I think it’s funny you don’t recognize my profile picture… mwpitt52 Gezz your an idiot. I said the new MacBook Pro looks like an iPhone. The 2015 MacBook Pro is the old style. gary lol I know exactly what you said, and I have the same MacBook. And you didn’t say it LOOKS LIKE an iPhone, yout just said it’s LIKE an iPhone. Which couldn’t be more wrong. mwpitt52 I guess your right, Apple did leave in the headphone jack. No usable ports, keyboard is horrible, no more iconic glowing Apple logo just a metal sticker( like the iPhone), smaller ( getting close to iPhone Plus size),cannot upgrade storage. What a deal for a higher price. jaimem17 I’m sure people looking for a new laptop will choose the Macbook because it is the same as last gen except thinner. Next Macbook will be a screen and a touchscreen as a keyboard, same RAM, same screen, same battery life, one USB C port and paper thin. Same same but different.

Seagate nibbles on tiny slice of SSD pie But world SSD shipments up 46%, 128-layer 3D incoming 21 Nov 2016 at 15:39, Chris Mellor The utter irrelevance of Seagate as an SSD shipper is shown by TrendFocus's estimated total SSD unit ship numbers for 2016's third quarter, with just 0.1 per cent of the 38.25 million units shipped, 46 per cent up on a year ago. Stifel MD Aaron Rakers has revealed some of the TrendForce numbers. They cover both enterprise and client SSDs. The enterprise portion of the total ship number was 4.54 million, an increase of 47 per cent annually and up 12 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Of that total, PCIe drives numbered 417,000, which Rakers says is "up significantly from ~200,000 and ~113,000 units shipped in the prior and year-ago quarters". He says: "SATA SSDs totalled 3.41 million versus 3.2 million in the prior quarter, while SAS enterprise SSDs grew to 712,000 units shipped versus 450,000 SSDs shipped in the year-ago quarter." Client (PC) SSDs totalled 33.7 million, up 46 per cent year-on-year and up 14 per cent sequentially. A pie chart we have crafted from the numbers shows the dominance of Samsung, WD, Toshiba, Intel, Lite-ON, Kingston, and SK-Hynix. The latter shipped 1.61 million SSDs, while Seagate shipped far less, just 38,300 – 0.1 per cent of the total. Trendfocus's total SSD unit ships by supplier Q3 cy2016 Rakers writes: "Trendfocus's estimates would imply total SSD capacity shipped equates to approximately 8 per cent of combined HDD and SSD capacity shipped in 3Q16, up from 5 per cent in the year-ago quarter and flat sequentially." 3D NAND roadmap Currently SSDs are adopting 3D NAND as it is more cost-effective to grow die capacity by layering planar or 2D NAND than by shrinking 2D NAND cell size below c15nm. We understand that Samsung is at 64 layers now, and WD (SanDisk) and Toshiba will be mass shipping 64 layers (BiCS3 technology) in the first half of next year, having started pilot production. Rakers attended a LAM Research analysts' day where it revealed that the bulk of the flash industry will be at 64 layers in 2017-18, with 96 layers starting production towards the end of 2018. We understand that this means it provides a theoretical 50 per cent capacity increase at the die level, from say 256Gb to 381Gb, unless a die shrink takes place to increase capacity further. LAM research NAND roadmap The company sees 128 layers starting production mid-2020, with another 50 per cent capacity increase. We understand that QLC (4bits/cell) NAND will emerge and play an increasing role in data storage from next year onwards. Planar, 2D NAND effectively stops production in 2017; 3D NAND being more cost-effective at the 64-layer point. DRAM carries on shrinking slowly, below 16nm from the end of this year onwards. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register You know how that data breach happened?

However, Eve is allowing users to reserve a device by making a downpayment: You can reserve your Eve V of any configuration today by making a downpayment. If you do so you will get: Eve V at a very special Indie GoGo price (saving up to 770USD off retail MSRP) Guarantee that next time we run preorders we you will not miss the chance to buy. Preordered device will be shipped in April-May 2017 (Original article follows below) The Eve V is finally going on sale. Eve, the company behind the Eve V today announced its Indiegogo campaign on its official website and revealed the prices. Eve’s V is a device which the company likes to call “the first-ever crowd developed computer” as all of the main parts of the device were based on feedback from the Eve community. Eve’s V device is a lot like Microsoft’s Surface Pro line of devices and that’s not anything surprising to see. However, Eve V’s specs are better than what you get with the Surface Pro 4 which is quite interesting. First up, the Eve V comes with Intel’s 7th gen Core i7/i5/m3 processors. As for the RAM, you can get up to 16GB of LDDRP3 RAM with the Eve V and up to 512GB of internal storage (128GB and 256GB variants are also available). For the display, Eve is including a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD panel with a resolution of 2736×1284 pixels that’s protected by Gorilla Glass. As for the security, you can’t get Windows Hello’s face recognition feature on the Eve V but there’s a fingerprint scanner that’s integrated into the power button of the device. In case you are wondering about the ports on the device, there’s 1 Thunderbolt 3 port, 1 USB Type-C port, two regular USB ports, a 3.55mm port for audio and there’s also a microSD card reader. More importantly, the device boasts a 48Wh battery which, according to Eve, provides 12 hours of battery life.  All of this comes in a device that weighs less than a kilogram and has a thickness of 8.9mm. Gallery Eve is also selling a keyboard (the V Wireless Keyboard) for the Eve V similar to the Surface Touch Keyboard, and a stylus (the V Pen) as well. The device starts at $699 for the Core m3 model with 8GB RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. For $959, you’ll get the Core i5 variant with 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The company is also selling the Core i7 variant with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of internal storage for $1399. All of these variants come with the V Pen and the Alcantara Keyboard. The device comes with Windows 10 Home out of the box, but you can pay $50 now to get Windows 10 Pro. You can pre-order the Eve V at Indiegogo here, and it should start shipping in February 2017. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

"Everyone should learn how to programme a computer, because it teaches you how to think," Apple tycoon Steve Jobs insisted 20 years ago. And it seems parents have taken the message to heart since CoderDojo was set up as a charity five years ago. The multi-national movement, which was set up in Cork, has provided free classes in coding for more than 70,000 people, both in Ireland and abroad. Kids aged seven to 17 sign up to a Dojo, where they can learn to code, build a website, and create their own apps and games. Often they teach themselves or each other, and the adult volunteers simply act as facilitators. In some areas, such as Dun Laoghaire in South County Dublin, there are long waiting lists of up to 300 kids for coding classes. Now, there is a clamour for coding to be taught in schools from primary level upwards, and there are calls for a fully-fledged computer science subject at second level. Big computer companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft want Ireland to copy the example of Britain and turn computer coding into a significant part of the school curriculum. "The US and the UK are quite advanced in introducing computing and coding in schools. It is seen as giving them a competitive advantage. Computing and coding in schools are an attribute that companies will be looking at when they are making long-term investment decisions," says Paul Sweetman, who represents the tech industry as director of ICT Ireland. "Other countries are stealing a march on us and companies are noticing this." In schools in England and Wales, kids are now taught to code from the age of five, and computer science is part of the curriculum for students aged five to 16. Education Minister Richard Bruton has asked Ireland's curriculum planners to consider coding classes for all primary schools. Coding is seen as the key to a brave new world, but some sceptics wonder whether forcing it onto the curriculum is just a faddish nod in the direction of the tech economy with little educational value. Should our schools be led by the needs of tech giants in terms of what they teach? Teachers wonder whether it should be added to an already crowded curriculum in primary schools, where maths and English have to compete for time with religion, Irish, science, and creative arts, and other subjects can be squeezed out. Publisher Norah Casey, who used to be an ambassador for CoderDojo, has no doubt that coding should be taught in schools. She first brought her son Dara to CoderDojo classes at the Science Gallery in Dublin when he was 10, and believes he grew enormously in confidence as a result. "When you look at what kids are being taught about computers in schools, it is light years away from what the CoderDojo kids themselves are doing - it's almost like they're in a different century." So what is coding all about? Coding, in simple terms, involves telling a computer what to do through a string of typed instructions. It could be anything from the instruction "print 'hello world'", to developing the code used for logging on to Facebook, withdrawing money from an ATM, or even blasting a rocket into space. All rely on instructions developed by a coder or programmer. Smartphones, laptops and tablets are everywhere, but how many of us actually know how their apps and websites work? "For my son Dara, learning to code took the mystery out of how things work, but it also helped him to be more creative," says Casey. "Because he knew how to code, Dara could do animation and develop his own games. He ended up building his own computer." The point made by the publisher, that schools sometimes seem as though they are working in a different century, seems like a valid one. The current primary curriculum in schools was launched in 1999 in an era before Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, iPhones and iPads. Google had only just been launched the previous year. While the technological world is in a constant state of revolution, the education authorities move at snail's pace in devising what should be taught in schools. By the time they have planned their curriculum, it may already be obsolete. However, some Irish teachers have not waited around to introduce the subject in their classes, and have moved ahead themselves in teaching kids to build computer programmes. They often use a simple coding programme called Scratch. Using Scratch, children may move a cat called Felix across the screen, using simple commands. Children customise the background and the cat's appearance, and select its activity by putting blocks in sequence. At St Peter's primary school in Little Bray, Co Wicklow, teacher Ciara Brennan gives lessons in coding. In a typical experiment on a Wednesday, pupils are using computer programming skills, learned from Scratch, to turn themselves into a human piano. Brennan does not believe that coding should be introduced as a separate subject at primary level, partly because of the enormous time demands on teachers," she says. "I am more interested in taking the principles of coding and applying them to other subjects. "We have done it here with music and maths. It can be a very useful way of teaching problem-solving. "Many schools are passionate about bringing this into other subjects, because the children are already doing this in their spare time - it could be at CoderDojo classes, or informally themselves at home." At Lacken National School, Co Cavan, pupils learn coding and are able to use these skills to fly mini-drones around the room. "They have to use code to make it work. The kids jump right into it, because of course they want to fly a drone," says resource teacher Tony Riley. "We are helping children understand how the world around them works. Coding is part of that, it prepares them for when they leave school. There are going to be numerous jobs in the future where they are going to need to have coding skills or design skills, or other creative skills." One problem for teachers, particularly at primary level, is that they are preparing their pupils for a world that it is impossible to envisage, given the pace of changing technology. "We don't know what is going to happen beyond a certain time. We need a populace that is as broadly educated as possible, so that they cope with the issues that confront them," says Shane Bergin, professor of science education at UCD. Professor Bergin believes the education system only rewards a narrow range of skills. "Giving kids the opportunity to do things like coding is as important as giving them the opportunity to play on a sports team, play in an orchestra or do art." However, he has mixed feelings about industry getting involved in what should be taught in schools. "I would be cautious about letting industry dictate too much the curriculum that should be used in schools. Our current Government has a view of education that is driven too much by the market." While he has reservations about tailoring the curriculum to the needs of industry, Prof Bergin gives credit to companies such as Intel and Google for pressing for reform in education. Minister Bruton may hope to introduce coding into the curriculum, but school principals could face a tough job trying to implement it. Multinational tech companies frequently complain that they cannot find staff with the right programming skills. If schools try to teach computer and coding curriculum, they are likely to face the same problem in trying to find qualified staff. "Schools will also have to have the resources and equipment to be able to do it, and in many areas the lack of good broadband is a huge issue," warns Professor Bergin. Coding may be the word on the lips of ministers as they try to keep up with the cool kids on Silicon Docks, but, in many ways, the cultivation of the creative arts in schools is just as important. A study published last month by the Economic and Social Research Institute found that Irish children who participate in artistic and cultural activities at the age of nine perform better academically by the age of 13. These activities could include painting or attending classes in drama, dance or music. "The findings clearly show the positive emotional and educational effects of taking part in artistic and cultural pursuits," says Dr Emer Smyth, who carried out the study. Dr Smyth believes children should not only be delving into the digital world, but also engaging in the physical activities of painting and drawing. Professor Bergin says: "The creative arts should be a crucial part of our education system, but usually they are the first thing to be cut." It now seems likely that coding will be part of the curriculum in the future, but the Education Minister will have to ensure that enough teachers are properly trained and classrooms suitably equipped to make it successful.

Ohio Turnpike Listen Listening... / 3:43 In the next month you could start seeing self-driving vehicles in Ohio. The state has been quietly marketing itself to manufacturers as a ready, willing and able partner in the self-driving vehicle arena. According to the Executive Director of the Ohio Turnpike Randy Cole, companies have already done some preliminary mapping in central and northwest Ohio and are preparing to do more on the Ohio Turnpike and St. Rt. 33 between Columbus and Marysville. The robot car market is projected to be worth $42 billion by 2025. Intel just announced its investing $250 million to drive the development. It makes the processors for sensors, sonar and cameras in the cars. Many manufacturers expect to produce self-driving cars by 2020. Ohio is drafting legislation for autonomous cars. Seven states and the District of Columbia already have laws. Will the testing be safe in Ohio? According to Cole, "What we've been contemplating here is having a driver in the seat. So even if the vehicle itself is driving in a self-driving capacity there is still a human ready to take control if necessary and even a second engineer that's watching the systems to make sure is operating and anticipating where there could be problems." He says, "We're making sure every bit of safety that can is being followed and all the rules and regulations and insurance are in place." Ohio is among several states competing for a share of the self-driving market. People in Pittsburgh can now get a ride with a self-driving Uber. Ride along with an NPR reporter from Pittsburgh. Ohio is expected to release the specifics of tests on the state's roadways sometime in December.
