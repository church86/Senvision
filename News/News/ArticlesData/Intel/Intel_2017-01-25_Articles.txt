There are several reasons why that might be the case. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 26, 2017 at 5:41PM On Jan. 23, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share, which will be paid out on March 1 to stockholders of record on Feb. 7. Intel had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share for the past four quarters, so there was some expectation that the chipmaker would boost its dividend this time around. In fact, about a month ago, I wrote that I expected a "modest increase" in the company's dividend. The lack of a dividend increase could give us some insight into Intel's thinking around its cash generation and use during 2017. Image source: Intel.  Why keep the dividend flat? At $1.04 per share, at a share count of approximately 4.74 billion, Intel is paying out roughly $5 billion in dividends per year. Over the past 12 months, Intel has generated about $10.54 billion in free cash flow, meaning that the company is already returning a significant portion of its free cash flow in the form of the dividend. INTC Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts There are a several reasons for Intel's keeping the dividend flat for, potentially, the entirety of 2017. The first may simply be that the company was already "running hot" in terms of the percentage of its free cash flow that it allocated to the dividend. So by not increasing the dividend this year -- even if the company expects to generate more free cash flow in 2017 than it did in 2016 -- Intel may simply be trying to reduce how much of its free cash flow goes to the dividend. The next, and perhaps the most pessimistic, of the explanations is that Intel is expecting to see free cash flow stay flat or even decline over the next year. This wouldn't necessarily mean Intel is expecting its business to crater, although such an expectation could mean reduced free cash flow. However, if the company expects to, say, spend substantially more on semiconductor capital equipment for its factories this year than it did in 2016 without a correspondingly large or larger improvement in operating cash flow, then free cash flow could decline. And, finally, Intel may simply be planning a very big use of cash, perhaps in the form of a large acquisition. If Intel goes out and, say, spends $10 billion or more to buy a company, then the company is going to need to take on debt to finance such an acquisition. Then, since Intel's goal is to keep its balance sheet largely net-debt neutral, it would likely want to redirect free cash flow not committed to the dividend toward getting that debt paid off as quickly as possible. Not too much to be read from this It's hard to read too much into Intel's thinking about the future from this lack of dividend increase, given the several potential explanations for it. However, investors won't have to wait too long to find out what Intel's expectations around its business performance in 2017 are as the company should go into that in excruciating detail at its Feb. 9 investor meeting.

On Thursday, Intel reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results led by strength in its cloud computer and internet of things businesses. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 26, 2017 at 1:58 pm | UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 4:10 pm SANTA CLARA — Strong growth in its data center and internet of things product lines gave Intel a boost and helped the semiconductor giant report better-than-expected fourth-quarter results Thursday. After the close of trading, Intel said it earned $3.6 billion, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding one-time items, Intel earned 79 cents a share, topping the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast Intel to earn 75 cents a share on $15.8 billion in sales. Related Articles Tesla’s Elon Musk confesses reaction to his Trump role is getting him ‘down’ Smart cars with Silicon Valley tech dominate CES During the same period a year ago, Intel earned 74 cents a share on revenue of $14.9 billion. On a conference call to discuss Intel’s performance, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the company completed “a transformative year for Intel,” which included integrating the company’s acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera and a round of 12,000 job cuts. “I’m confident we’re making the right investments to compete and win,” Krzanich said. “By 2020, the average person will generate 1.5 gigabytes of data a day, and the resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunities.” Intel remains the world’s top maker of semiconductors for personal computers, but as worldwide PC sales have declined for years, the company has branched out into other areas for new opportunities. In the last three months of 2016, Intel said revenue from cloud computing, or what it calls its data center group, rose 8 percent from a year ago, to $4.7 billion. Intel’s internet of things (also called IoT) sales for the quarter climbed 16 percent from a year ago, to $726 million. “There were a lot of positives out of today’s report,” said Mark Hung, of technology research firm Gartner. “Revenue growth in the client computing group and strong growth in the IoT group being two of the brightest spots.” Intel’s client computing sales, which include chips used in PCs, posted a year-over-year gain of 4 percent, to reach sales of $9.1 billion. While Intel’s PC-related sales grew during the fourth quarter, overall sales of PCs fell 3.7 percent, according to Gartner. Rob Enderle, president of the Enderle Group, said Intel had “an impressive quarter.” The performance of the company’s PC segment suggests “the belief that [the PC market] has bottomed and is, again, moving toward growth,” he said. For its first quarter of 2017, Intel said it expects to earn 65 cents a share, excluding one-time items, on $14.8 billion in revenue, which would exceed last year’s first-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, on sales of $13.8 billion. Intel shares initially rose 2.2 percent, to $38.37, in after-hours trading following the release of the company’s results, but the stock then pulled back to remain near its regular-session close of $37.56 a share.

(Intel image) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 26, 2017 at 2:45 PM, updated January 26, 2017 at 3:01 PM comments One of Intel's best-known researchers, anthropologist Genevieve Bell, said Thursday she's leaving the company to teach at the Australian National University in Canberra. Her departure is one of a number of notable Intel exits to start the year. Originally from Sydney, Bell earned a doctorate in anthropology at Stanford University and joined Intel in 1998. Working from Hillsboro, Bell helped lead Intel's research into how people use technology and guide the chipmaker's efforts to predict the long-term changes in the direction of technology. As a researcher, Bell liked to observe people in their homes - watching them in living rooms, kitchens and verandas to see how they responded to technology and interact with it. "It's easy inside a technology company to get seduced by the technology itself," Bell told The Oregonian in a 2004 interview. "We're all sucked in by the whistles and the bells. One of the nice reality checks that an ethnographic perspective provides is a sense of what people really care about, these kind of unexpected truths." In a tweet Thursday, Bell said she will remain a senior fellow at Intel, indicating she will continue to participate in the company's research. New year, new jobs. I'm Oz bound to be Prof at ANU (@anucecs) & collaborate with @Data61news. Will remain Sr Fellow @intel too. Woohoo!! pic.twitter.com/MklcT5wQUN -- Genevieve Bell (@feraldata) January 26, 2017 Also Thursday, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich notified employees that human resources vice president Richard Taylor is retiring in March. His successor is Leslie Culbertson, a longtime Hillsboro executive who was most recently Intel's director of finance. Culbertson takes over after a difficult year for Intel employees, as the company eliminated 15,000 jobs worldwide as part of an overhaul designed to position the company for long-term decline in the PC market. Intel is also in the process of updating its annual employee review process, an exacting system called Focal. In layoffs in 2015 and 2016, Intel changed the way it determines which employees are eligible for layoff, using the level of merit-based stock grants workers receive as a key criteria. That unexpected change produced frustration and confusion within Intel's ranks. Additionally, Jill Eiland, Intel's Oregon public affairs director since 2006, is retiring this month. Intel has declined to say if it will appoint a successor. The chipmaker is Oregon's largest private employer. It had 19,500 employees in the state before last year's cutbacks; Intel won't say how many it currently employs. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that 2016 was a transformational year for the company on a variety of fronts. Intel cut its staff, absorbed its Altera acquisition, and closed the year with strong sales in the data center, PC, and Internet of Things markets, Krzanich said in a conference call with analysts. Client computing sales, which include processors for desktops and laptops, had strong execution and higher average selling prices (up 7 percent from a year ago) as customers opted for more gaming computers and high-end PCs, Krzanich said. During the quarter, Intel saw that the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy and had inventory get used during the three months, said chief financial officer Bob Swan. “Q4 was a strong finish to a record year,” Krzanich said. In the data center, growth was good. Cloud service provider revenue was up 24 percent, and communications service provider revenue grew 19 percent. Internet of Things revenue was also strong. Krzanich was optimistic that data growth would continue to skyrocket, creating demand for Intel’s processors. He said that a connected car could generate 4,000 gigabytes of data per day. He noted that the company has good design wins in connected cars with BMW, Baidu, and Delphi. In artificial intelligence, Krzanich said Intel processors are used in more than 90 percent of machine learning applications. Of course, there’s pressure on Intel from competitors, and the PC continues to lose ground to other devices in the era of the smartphone. Intel dropped out of mobile processors, but it is still competitive in wireless data 4G and Wi-Fi chips, and it is positioning to be a player in 5G. Intel’s investment in 14-nanometer cost improves drove costs down 30 percent in the client computing business. The world’s biggest chip maker reported fourth-quarter earnings that were mixed, missing its target on earnings per share but beating estimates for revenues. The results were driven by revenues from desktop and laptop computer chips, data center chips, and the Internet of Things. The latter was up 15 percent for the full year. Analysts had expected Intel to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $15.8 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, they were expected earnings per share of $2.67 on revenue of $58.9 billion. Q4 earnings came in at $3.6 billion, or 73 a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion. A year ago, earnings per share were 74 cents, with revenue at $14.9 billion. Intel stock rose 2 percent to $38.32 a share in after-hours trading, and it has since dropped to $37.77 a share, up only 0.56 percent. During the quarter, Intel shipped more of its code-named Kaby Lake processors for computer makers showing off systems based on the chip at CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas in the first week of January. Enterprise and government business was weaker in the quarter. Advanced Micro Devices is expecting to be more competitive against Intel in 2017 as it readies its new Zen processors for PCs, laptops, and servers. “Intel had a pretty good quarter. Client computing revenue has not only flattened but actually saw some slight increases even though units declined,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “I attribute this to customers embracing more premium PCs driven by commercial upgrades, gaming and VR. Datacenter got back on track and while it wasn’t double-digit growth, many customers are waiting for the latest Purley server chips to their big upgrades, so I think there’s pent-up demand. Memory hit a home run, driven by 3D [flash memory]. It was a good end to a solid 2016 where I saw Intel making big moves and investments for the next five years.” Net income for the year was $10.3 billion, while overall revenue for the year was $59.4 billion. A year ago, net income was $11.3 billion on revenue of $55.4 billion. Intel cut about 12,000 jobs during the year as it restructured to get behind the company’s focused priorities. As part of that process, Intel is spinning out McAfee, formerly Intel Security, as a separate business that is half-owned by Intel. Intel’s most profitable segment is the data center group that sells chips for servers, the computers that process transactions in huge data centers. Data center group revenue was $4.7 billion in Q4, up 8 percent. Internet of Things revenue was $726 million, up 16 percent. Client computing revenue was $9.1 billion, up 4 percent. Non-volatile memory revenue was $816 million, up 25 percent. Intel Security Group revenue was $550 million, up 7 percent. And programmable solutions were $420 million, with no comparison to the year before because of the 2016 Altera acquisition. Krzanich said that Altera has a record pipeline for its programmable chips. Swan added that the outlook assumes a stable macroeconomic environment. Intel is more cautious about demand for chips in emerging markets like Russia, China, and Latin America. For the full year, Intel expects 2017 to be flat in terms of revenue. Krzanich said the company is taking a conservative view of 2017 PC unit sales than other analysts, but he noted there was record demand for Intel PC chips in Q4. Unit sales for 2017 could decline in the mid-single digit percentages, Krzanich said. Intel is positioning itself to lower its costs during the coming year. “What we focus on in that market is how do you make money, how do you sell up?” Krzanich said.

The company is chasing makers with open-source tools needed to add artificial intelligence to consumer, industrial, and retail devices made using board computers. The plan may include machine-learning tools, which are central to AI. AI helps Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions, and also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely. "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year," a Google spokesman said in an email. Earlier this week, Google published a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing "smart tools" to makers. In a blog entry, Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful. Devices could get Google AI technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets. Google's voice recognition is the company's most visible AI technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3. Providing a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs. The spread of Google's AI tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets. Companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud. Samsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and AI technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers. It's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends. But boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful AI and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle. Some companies like Movidius -- which is a part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones. Google is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS. The company hasn't talked about AI technologies available in Android Things.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to US$4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to US$9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to US$16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of 79 cents. Revenue for the quarter came in at $16.37 billion. Analysts expected Intel to post earnings of 74 cents a share and 15.752 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The stock rose more than 2 percent in after-hours. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," said Brian Krzanich Intel CEO, in a release. "In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products,successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities." The chipmaker beat revenue estimates for the key categories client computing and Internet of Things. Intel reported client computing sales of $9.1 billion, above a StreetAccount estimate of $8.55 billion. Sales for "Internet of Things" rose 16 percent year-over-year to $726 million, topping a StreetAccount estimate of $703.6 million. Revenue for Intel's data center group came in at $4.7 billion, an 8 percent year-over-year increase for the quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of $4.78 billion this quarter, according to StreetAccount. Intel has made efforts to move away from reliance on the generally declining PC business. The company's focus has shifted to the Internet of Things and to its data center group, which creates chips for large computers.That's the company's most profitable segment. Yet, the 2016 third-quarter revenue for the group grew less than 10 percent year-over-year at $4.5 billion. Intel's guidance is flat for revenue and gross margins in the first quarter of 2017, despite strong fourth-quarter numbers. On the conference call company leaders said the sale of gaming systems in the holiday season helped their higher end chip business. As they are expecting a weaker PC market moving forward, Krzanich noted the companies capabilities to play a major part in more innovative technologies. "Autonomous cars for example will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day," Krzanich said on the earnings conference call, "The resulting explosion of data each day is creating tremendous opportunity...our products are key to turning raw data into high value insight and information." Intel also gave strong guidance for it cloud computing business. Last November, Google partnered with Intel to challenge Amazon's dominance in cloud services and has continually tried to restructure itself, including making 12,000 job cuts. Earlier this year the Santa Clara, California-based company announced plans to buy a 15 percent share of mapping software company Here Maps. The German car-maker backed company provides information for self-driving vehicles. Intel has also created other partnerships in the growing self-driving car space and has moved into the virtual reality space for live sports, too. Shares of Intel are up 25 percent in the last 12 months. Anita Balakrishnan and Rachel Cao contributed to this report.

Washington: An 18-year-old Indian-American boy has won the prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award in the US for inventing a device that quickly shuts down undersea oil spills. Karan Jerath of Friendswood, Texas, claimed $50,000 top prize on Friday at 2015 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (IISEF). Jerath was also one of the five students selected for the Intel and Indo-US Science and Technology Forum Visit to India Award. Jerath designed a sturdy device that can collect the oil, gas and water spewing from a broken well on the seafloor. "Sensors inside the 350-ton device would measure the temperature, pressure and density of the mix of gases and fluids erupting from a well. "A computer would then calculate how valves in the gadget should be adjusted so that the gas and oil can be collected. That should stop a spill in its tracks. The device could help prevent an ecological catastrophe. It also would reduce cleanup costs," Karan said. The top position was shared by two other teen researchers. One developed a technique to more quickly diagnose infections by HIV. The other used sophisticated software to improve the flow of air inside aircraft cabins that could reduce the transmission of disease among passengers. Maya Ajmera, an Indian descent who heads the Society for Science and the Public that conducts the IISEF, congratulated the winners and said, "These talented young students are the problem solvers and innovators of their generation." Scores of Indian-American students won awards in various categories, five of them getting the first award in their specialisations, biochemistry, behavioural sciences, environmental engineering, mathematics and energy physics. The IISEF honours the world's most promising high school student scientists, inventors and engineers selected through rigorous competitions held around the world.

The results were driven by revenues from desktop and laptop computer chips, data center chips, and the Internet of Things. Analysts had expected Intel to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $15.8 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, they were expected earnings per share of $2.67 on revenue of $58.9 billion. Q4 earnings came in at $3.6 billion, or 73 a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion. A year ago, earnings per share were 74 cents, with revenue at $14.9 billion. Intel stock is up 2 percent to $38.32 a share in after-hours trading. During the quarter, Intel shipped more of its code-named Kaby Lake processors for computer makers who launched the system at CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas in the first week of January. “The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities.” Net income for the year was $10.3 billion, while overall revenue for the year was $59.4 billion. A year ago, net income was $11.3 billion on revenue of $55.4 billion. Intel’s most profitable segment is the data center group that sells chips for servers, the computers that process transactions in huge data centers. Data Center Group revenue was $4.7 billion in Q4, up 8 percent. Internet of Things revenue was $726 million, up 16 percent. Client computing revenue was $9.1 billion, up 4 percent. Non-volatile memory revenue was $816 million, up 25 percent. Intel Security Group revenue was $550 million, up 7 percent. And programmable solutions were $420 million, with no comparison to the year before because of the 2016 Altera acquisition. Intel faces threats from multiple competitors. It has largely lost the mobile processor battle to Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors are used in almost all mobile smartphones and tablets. Nvidia is increasingly competitive in the data center and connected cars with its artificial intelligence chips. And Advanced Micro Devices has touted its Zen architecture for desktops, laptops, and servers coming this year. Those are big challenges that Intel faces in a multi-front war. But it is still benefiting from trends such as demand for the Internet of Things, or making everyday objects smart and connected. Devices such as internet-connected cars, refrigerators, thermostats, and pet collars will represent a huge opportunity that could grow into the billions of units over time. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel forecasts revenue of $14.8 billion and gross margin percentage of 62 percent. Full-year capital spending for 2017 will be $12 billion, while R&D spending will likely be $20.5 billion.

There are plenty of reasons to build a custom computer. While custom computers may initially be more expensive than prepackaged desktops or laptops, they can provide you with nearly endless possibilities, whether you're looking for a top-notch gaming machine, a system for mixing music, or the ideal choice for developing Web applications. A custom computer is the way to go if you want both performance and flexibility. Upgrading individual parts often is less expensive than buying a new computer, which could save you money in the long run. Following are the essential parts you'll need. Processor and Motherboard The component to start with is the processor, which will dictate your selection of other necessary parts, like the motherboard. UserBenchmark's exhaustive list of user-rated processors is a good resource to help you decide. AMD and Intel are the top manufacturers, but I prefer Intel. Intel is the industry standard when it comes to processors, so you can't go wrong if that's your choice. Its Core series comes in three families: i3, i5 and i7. The i3 series is good for average computing needs, while the i5 offers a little more horsepower. The i7 series offers you the best performance. For the price, a Core i7-6700k really can't be beat. After you choose your processor, select a motherboard to go with it. Make sure it is USB 3.1/3.0-capable for optimal speed. One factor to consider is whether you plan on overclocking, which involves running your PC at a speed higher than manufacturer recommendations. While you can benefit from short-term performance boosts, overclocking may lead to a shorter lifespan for your computer, so you'll need to consider a compatible motherboard if you plan to do it. Storage and Memory Next, choose the storage you want to use. HDD drives are the traditional hard drives that most computers have, and they are extremely affordable. However, SSDs are the choice for sheer performance, and their prices are dropping. I prefer a hybrid option that includes both. A computer built with its system files on a smaller SSD will boot faster, while a larger and cheaper HDD in the 2-TB range gives plenty of storage. Decide how much RAM you need. If you plan on running a 32-bit OS, then you only need 3 GB of memory since the OS won't support any more. Most likely, though, you will be using a 64-bit architecture where 4 GB is the minimum. RAM is a relatively cheap upgrade for the performance you get in return. Choose 8, 12, or 16 GB for a better user experience. You can also put in a DVD/CD drive, though it is not necessary, thanks to portable storage and cloud-based software. Video and Audio Cards If you intend to play video games, create digital graphics or edit video, you should invest in something more advanced than a basic video card. For enhanced graphics, AMD, ATI or Nvidia cards will do the trick. The AMD Radeon RX 460 is a reasonably affordable option that can also handle the needs of most casual gamers. The same goes for your audio card: If you are editing audio files, you should always opt for a higher-quality card that's compatible with the peripheral equipment you want to connect. Case, Power and Cooling You have to buy a case to hold all of that amazing hardware! There are many types of cases on the market with different features. Many cases have a rudimentary power supply and cooling fans. However, if you are building a high-performance system, they are probably inadequate. All that performance generates heat. Too much heat will cause your computer to crash and may even damage hardware, so be sure to invest in some quality computer cooling fans. At a minimum, you will want one attached to your CPU heatsink, one larger fan to exhaust heat from the case -- and if not built in, one to disperse heat from your graphics card. The more powerful your components, the more power you'll need to run your system properly. You don't want to burn through a cheap power supply and have everything shut down on you. Plan on at least a 500w power supply, but if you've opted for a bigger processor, graphics card, and the requisite fans, you'll need something with more juice. Your components may come with recommended power allowances. If not, I suggest at least a 750w power supply. Final Thought: Don't be afraid to invest more money up front, as your custom machine can provide years of use before you'll need to upgrade it again. Good luck with your project -- and most of all, have fun! Get Permission to License or Reproduce this Article Print Email Reprints Author Search Reader Comments Join the discussion!

The new unit packs the latest Intel’s Kaby Lake CPU, a NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU, memory, an SSD and a hard drive. The system weighs just about three kilograms and its dimensions are smaller than dimensions of Microsoft’s Xbox One. Current-generation game consoles, while closed systems ripe for optimization, can have difficulty providing performance sufficient for Full-HD gaming. Many console gamers prefer to play their games on HDTVs rather than on monitors, and so makers of boutique PCs were set on introducing console-like computers featuring gaming-grade hardware. Manufacturers of computer components were, for various reasons, reluctant to launch their own SFF gaming PCs for the living room until last year. However in the recent months we have seen a number of computers from motherboards/GPU vendors cards that are both small and powerful. MSI began to sell its Trident system in November-December timeframe without making any loud announcements, and this month the company upgraded its mini PC with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors but retained the chassis and the platform. The MSI Trident 3 is based on a custom Intel H110 powered motherboard, along with a choice of Intel’s Core i7-7700 / i5-7400 processors and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 / 1050 Ti graphics cards. By default the PC comes with 8 GB of single-channel DDR4-2400 memory (upgradeable to 32 GB), a 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD, one 1 TB hard drive and a 230 W external PSU. Despite the miniature size, the MSI Trident 3 is upgradeable: the CPU, the graphics adapter, the DRAM and storage devices may be changed. Due to lack of space inside, it is impossible to install a video card longer than 17 cm or additional drives, but such limitations are understandable. Moreover, keeping in mind that many SFF PCs use mobile components soldered to their motherboards, so using desktop-class components is a tradeoff between replaceability and size.

PC gaming makes sense though, with sites like bundlestars and humble bundle, you can save $100s by buying PC vs console games, and get better graphics quality. You can also use it as a HTPC and do Netflix or KODI. Guess tough to compete with Alienware. Reply ddriver - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link Looks like it went through some rough shipment. The chasis is skewed and cracked open in one corner. Reply close - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link I get buying a cheap console, I get buying an expensive high end PC. But an expensive console-like PC? They managed to pick the worst of both worlds. Reply meacupla - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link There is a market, albeit niche, for being highly compact and portable, while still being a PC. For example, if you want to take it over to a friends house and use their TV to game on, this would be much easier to carry, compared to a mid tower weighing over 30lbs. Reply shabby - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link This is beyond niche, they should of included a game pad to append to its "gaming" audience. Reply ddriver - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link You can get a laptop of equal performance that will be more portable and compact, plus the ability to run on batteries and the integrated display.

Quite by accident, I visited the Edraw Max website only to discover that they now have a Linux version of the software. Now I could live my Ubuntu fantasy or so I thought. After a few minutes of using the open source video driver. I was about ready to pull my root hairs out. After hours of work I finally figured out how to install the official Intel graphics driver and the internet was not really that helpful. The TLDR version This is a guide about how you can install the latest Intel graphics driver in Ubuntu 16.04. I constantly digress to tell you how awesome I am; because I am totally awesome but you will find it helpful if you are using Ubuntu on a computer with the Intel Graphics chips e.g. HP laptops. Why Ubuntu 16.04? It’s an LTS (Long Term Support) edition which will receive updates until April 2021. In other versions, support only lasts for 9 months. Change is distracting. Why do I need this driver anyway? After installing Ubuntu your system will be using open source graphics. The developers at Ubuntu have worked really hard to make sure that you will have some sort of working desktop even when there are no drivers. The experience, however, is not ideal. advertisement Some of the annoyances of not installing graphic drivers are quite cosmetic. A rubbish desktop that is not so crisp looking, resolution not living up to its billing etc. Often times lacking proper drivers can be catastrophic for example you want to close your laptop lid and go for a break. When you come back you are met with a black screen no matter what you do. YouTube videos flicker, you cannot make screencasts, you cannot take screenshots without kittens dying on your screen, your software is busy chewing through some of your processor’s power instead of the GPU wasting resources. You cannot play awesome games. You cannot use the HDMI port. Need I go on? You need a graphics driver made by the people who made your graphics card. So how do you go about it? This part is easy and well documented all over the web. Go to the web Intel Website drivers website and download the installer for your platform. For most people, the 64-bit installer should do it. Once it has finished downloading, double-click on the installer and click on begin Click on install The installer will download and install the drivers for you. It will also add the Intel repository in /etc/apt/ for future updates The undocumented part You will need to launch the additional drivers’ app and install the Intel firmware Restart your computer You are still not done Now we get to the slightly hairy part. Not so long ago Microsoft (I know they love Linux now) decided to make things difficult and introduced secure boot. What it all means is that you will need permission (signed binary) from Redmond if you want to mess with the boot process. It protects devices from certain types of malware but it also complicates things. The way of installing drivers we have just outlined above works by using the DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) framework. What it means is that drivers (modules) are created on the fly on your system. The system cannot load them unless they are signed if you are using Secure Boot and there is no easy way for the Kernel to sign them. To use the drivers you have to secure boot mode. sudo update-secureboot-policy Select yes in the ncurses dialog Enter a temporary password as asked and confirm it Reboot the system You will be presented with the MOK management dialog countdown when system starts, press any key to activate it You will be asked to enter the password. You will not usually be asked for the entire password. To make sure you are paying attention you are asked for random characters from your password e.g. “Enter the third letter of your password” Be sure to press enter after typing each letter.

But if you are dual booting, most of the time Micro$haft updates their OS, then always enable it and you will be faced with black screen with “No disk found” error. Just go through the process again. You left the actual part of installing driver, do you first install the driver and disable the secure booting or the other way round? Why Ubuntu 16.04? I would further say Ubuntu LTS versions are meant for business and people who do not want changes to their OS every 6 months. LTS are stable versions which only gets security and critical updates without altering the OS which might affect business users. Other Ubuntu versions are for enthuasiasts who are always chasing cutting edge changes and tech Reply Garikai says: January 13, 2017 at 12:29 PM The Installer (a .deb) takes care of the installation process. Then you will have to disable UEFI to allow the driver to load. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name Email Website Yes, add me to your mailing list.

MEADE, MD, UNITED STATES 01.26.2017 Story by Staff Sgt. Anthony Hyatt  70th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing ✔ ✗ Subscribe 1 “The end goal was to establish a Wing standard strength and conditioning program to minimize the effect of Intel jobs,” said William. “The Intel lifestyle includes lots of sitting, poor flexibility and strength, all of which can be corrected easily.” MOVE also provides a structured approach to physical development which may help Air Force members succeed on physical training test, according to William. “The Air Force spends a great deal of money and time investing in our Airmen to make sure they are mentally and technically able to work on robust weapon systems; and we execute our assigned missions with deadly accuracy,” said William. “But, when it comes to developing the complete continuum of fitness for individuals, I thought there was something missing, and the MOVE program was designed to fill that need.” Physical training failures also played a part in the creation of the MOVE program. “We want to come up with the best case scenario to set these folks up for success,” said Hickey, referring to those Airmen who have difficulty with physical training. “Usually, it’s not a matter of ‘I need to go out and exercise,’ instead, it’s really about changing their movement patterns, and not just exercising, but exercising well.” Those who want to take advantage of the MOVE program first need to visit the 70th ISRW Health Promotions Office to complete a Functional Movement Screen. “The FMS uses seven different assessments to identify weak and improper movement patterns,” said Hickey. Potential participants perform the movement assessments and receive a score from zero to three in each category. The evaluators assess the FMS and determine a corrective exercise program to address inefficiencies, Hickey said. The seven exercises are the deep squat, hurdle step, inline lounge, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability and rotary stability. “The actual exercise intervention is going to be dependent on what each individual scored on their FMS,” said Hickey. “If you score poorly in one of the categories, we will show you what you should be doing to improve.” According to William, the MOVE program initially started as a study to prove people who had service-related health issues due to injuries could return to fully deployable status. However, they found the program could be used by anyone, as long as they are coachable and are willing to work hard, he said. “Our approach is comprehensive and holistic, designed to pinpoint improvement areas and provide external and internal motivation through physical and online support,” said Staff Sgt. Kaz, unit fitness program manager, 29th Intelligence Squadron. “Our goal is to help you in any way possible. As always, fitness is a two-way street, but give us your all and we’ll give you ours!” For more information about the MOVE program, please call 301-688-2161 LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 01.26.2017 Date Posted: 01.26.2017 10:56 Story ID: 221448 Location: FORT GEORGE G.

It'll be customizable, interactive, and it will put them at the center of the experience. If it goes as envisioned, Intel's multi-year plan will allow viewers to tailor their own live sports broadcasts, and watch events as if they were on the field. The live sports broadcasts will be available for VR headsets, PCs, and even TVs. The experience will be unlike live sports today, in which the views and angles are selected by the broadcasters. Instead, viewers in real-time will be able to create their own 3D broadcast of a sports event. Viewers will be able to select any type of view or camera angle they want for the live broadcast. For example, users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Alternately, users will be able to view the same experience from a player's perspective. It depends on what a viewer selects, and many angles will be covered. Intel's goal is to roll out this 360-degree live broadcast technology starting in 2019, and the company is working with broadcasters to deliver the real-time interactive experience. Watching live content is now a linear experience, but live broadcasts tailor-made to viewers will revolutionize the way people watch sports, said James Carwana, general manager at Intel's sports group. Intel is already working with a number of broadcasters to deliver these unique 3D experiences in real time to viewers, said Jeff Hopper, general manager of immersive experiences at Intel. Broadcasters are eager to bring more interactive experience to live sports, Hopper said. Some sports, such as football and soccer, are ideal for this interactive 3D live sports experience. It may be difficult to bring the same experience to sports like skiing, with the action happening over long distances. But Carwana said Intel is eager to bring this experience to a variety of sports and broadcasts worldwide. Watching live sports from any angle will especially be fun on VR headsets, which allows users to view 3D content. In the future, viewers will be able to switch angles in real time and roam through a field as a play is taking place. Interactive live sports is a killer application for VR, a market that is still emerging. Games are being received with a lot of enthusiasm on VR headsets, and live sports will bring a similar experience, except a viewer isn't playing. But broadcasting live interactive content is easier said than done. It involves implementing an army of cameras in stadiums, creating a full 3D video experience so any particular scene can be viewed from any angle, and a new media format to support the interactive experience. It also requires a powerful back-end of servers to process all the data required to create an experience customized to each viewer. Intel's starting off modestly with interactive replays instead of live broadcasts, allowing it to test the technology before it goes big time. At Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5, Fox Sports will show interactive replays based on Intel's 360-degree replay technology. Intel has already used similar replay technology in sports like baseball and basketball. Further down the road, as technology is closely integrated into sports, users will be able to view live statistics as part of the experience. Intel has already done that, with live statistics on display during a live broadcast of the Winter X Games last year. In real-time, users were able to view key athlete performance data like how high a snowboarder jumped and how far they rotated. The data was captured from sensors on the snowboards. Intel is working on technology that will make all of this happen. It is using a media format called FreeD, which will be central to live interactive sports broadcasts. Instead of pixels, which are used in regular images and video file formats, FreeD will have voxels, which composes image content in a three-dimensional format. In each stadium offering live interactive video, 38 cameras will be installed, which is enough to generate a full view of all angles needed to generate a custom broadcast for each viewer. The cameras will generate terabytes of image data every few seconds. During a live broadcast, a viewer will be able to select the angle they want to see a sport from, and that request will be delivered to a server. The server will compile the custom broadcast by processing and cutting images from all 38 cameras to generate the desired angle. Servers will need a lot of horsepower to do that. Intel will use FreeD rendering technologies from its acquisition of Replay Technologies, which specializes in video formatting. It will also rely on algorithms to help generate those interactive for live sports broadcasts. Intel has targeted the TV market several times previously, including a plan to launch its own TV service, but failed. This is the most ambitious experience so far, and it'll require many years of commitment. Intel has also acquired companies like Voke -- which provides technology to deliver live 3D broadcasts to VR headsets -- that are playing a central role in the chipmaker's efforts. The amount of data generated for an interactive live sports broadcast leads to bandwidth challenges, the Intel executives acknowledged. But with technologies like 5G -- which could transmit mobile data at speeds of up to 20Gbps -- coming, some of those issues could be resolved, Hopper said. The live sports technology touches upon the key markets Intel is pursuing, including 5G, servers, and the internet of things. The technology is still not here, and Intel's plan to make it possible by 2019 seems ambitious considering the numerous challenges. But Intel has a clear vision of how live sports broadcasts will look, and it's exciting.

I find it difficult to believe just how fast things are moving with regard to using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning techniques (for example, see Deep learning machine vision system aids blind and visually impaired, Deep learning hits a sweet note, Machine learning platform speeds optimization of vision systems, Unlocking the power of AI for all developers, and Push-button generation of deep neural networks). Of course, one really interesting application is to perform object detection and identification, including the really tricky task of recognizing and identifying faces in images and videos. This sort of task benefits from the extreme parallelism offered by FPGAs. Of particular interest are Intel's current generation of FPGAs, whose hard-core DSP slices offer both fixed-point and floating-point capabilities, making them suitable for a wide range of artificial intelligence (AI) and embedded vision applications. Intel's midrange Arria 10 FPGAs, for example, provide up to 1.5 teraflops (TFLOPs) of single-precision floating-point processing performance, 1.15 million logic elements, and more than a terabit-per-second high-speed connectivity. Working with Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, engineers at ZTE -- a Chinese multinational telecommunications equipment and systems company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong -- have used Arria 10 FPGAs to implement a cloud inferencing application using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to perform high-accuracy facial recognition on more than 1,000 images/frames per second. (Source: Getty Images) Traditionally, facial recognition technology has been primarily of interest to law enforcement agencies, who use these systems to isolate and identify faces in crowds (at airports, for example). But there is tremendous potential for this technology in a wide variety of applications, such as informing blind and visually impaired persons if someone they know is approaching them.

Troubling study claims machine-learning algorithm predicts criminal tendency based on facial traits Omron Face Detection Technology Fact Sheet In the case of your humble narrator, I'm dreadfully bad at remembering names and recognizing faces. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that I attend a lot of conferences, and people are always coming up to me saying things like "Max, how are you?" And I have to dance around (conversationally-speaking), desperately trying to work out who they are and how I know them. Based on this, I can easily envision how useful a Google Glass-type device would be if it had the ability to identify people in a crowd and present me with useful information -- possibly using bone conduction so as to leave my ears free and also prevent anyone else knowing what was going on -- like "Professor Cuthbert Dribble is approaching. You last saw him at the Embedded Conference in Copenhagen in November 2015. He loves cats and it's his turn to buy a round of beers." How about you? What applications can you see (no pun intended) for this sort of facial identification and recognition technology?

Yes, we do this at ESC now -- that's very handy -- it seems like badges naturally want to be the wrong way round. But when someone comes up to you shouting "Max, how good to see you," it's a bit "obvious" to try to look at his badge to work out who he is. That reminds be of the joke that a cat always lands on its feet, and a dropped piece of buttered toast always lands butter-side down, so if you duct-tape a piece of buttered toast to th eback of a cat, it will end up hovering in mid-air.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      While we and everyone else have been focusing on Washington, life goes on elsewhere. Without a doubt, the regime change in DC is dramatic. It is bound to significantly affect and alter the future course of our political, economic, and financial systems—well, at least for the next four years. However, the near and distant future may very well be even more significantly affected by what is happening in Silicon Valley. Certainly, recent developments in autonomous cars, robotics, and artificial intelligence have captured the imagination of tech investors. One way they’ve played the future is by investing in the manufacturers producing the semiconductor chips that will run all of these new technologies. The S&P 500 Semiconductor industry index gained 42.9% over the past 12 months through Tuesday’s close (Fig. 8). The Semiconductor Equipment industry index gained even more over the same period, 72.4%, making it the second best-performing of the S&P 500 industries we track for the period (Fig. 9). Semi stocks have also been boosted by lots of M&A activity and hopes that semiconductor revenues growth will pick up to the mid-single-digits this year. Gartner expects that last year’s lackluster 1.5% y/y sales growth will be followed by a 7.2% y/y increase in worldwide revenue to $364.1 billion in 2017, according to the company’s 1/23 press release. The pickup in growth doesn’t come from traditional areas like cell phones and computers. Those segments have moved from growth mode to replacement mode. Instead, the growth is coming from new areas like self-driving cars, the Internet-of-things, and cloud computing. Here’s a look at some of the recent developments charging up the chip industry: (1) Driving sales. The more our cars can do, the more computing power they must include. That’s good news for the semiconductor industry. “J.P. Morgan estimated that the total available market for semiconductors used in semiautonomous and fully autonomous cars will reach about $7.3 billion by 2025, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 62.5% starting in 2017,” reported an 8/27 MarketWatch article. “That estimate assumes that semiautonomous and fully autonomous cars together will make up about 15.7% of a projected 109.6 million light vehicles produced globally. The total cost of all the chips per vehicle will rise to $400 to $500 a car, up from $300 to $400 from ADAS functions.” The total world market for automotive semiconductors grew to $30.3 billion last year, and is expected to hit about $41 billion in 2020. (2) Game on. Nvidia has been one of the best-performing semi stocks over the past year, climbing 269.4% y/y through Tuesday’s close. Known for graphics processing chips that power video game machines, Nvidia’s shares have performed so well because investors believe the company’s chips will be used in gadgets that have artificial intelligence and in driverless cars. Nvidia has “an ambitious goal of getting a Level 4 driverless car--an almost fully autonomous car--on the market by 2020, which it is executing through a partnership with Audi. It also announced an initiative with Bosch to enhance artificial intelligence in automobiles, e.g., cars that can sense when you are sleeping or texting while driving, as well as a smart home hub through its Shield brand that will be powered by Alphabet Inc’s Google Now artificial intelligence,” relayed a 1/7 MarketWatch article. According to the FT, Nvidia has a technological lead over industry titan Intel. Nvidia “is widely credited with having developed the best chips for training the artificial neural networks built by companies including Google, Amazon and Baidu to do things like recognize images or understand language,” as a 12/30 FT article explained. It quoted Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy: “I’ve never seen such agreement about a technology. I think they’re two to three years ahead of Intel.” But he added that Intel also has the same market in its sights and shouldn’t be counted out. After their strong rally over the past year, Nvidia’s shares, at a recent $107.33, trade at almost 40 times Wall Street analysts’ 2017 consensus earnings estimate of $2.75 a share. If achieved, that would mark earnings growth of 13.6%. (3) Stale chips. Not all semiconductor stocks have been moonshots. Intel shares, for example, have risen 25.7% y/y, modestly faster than the S&P 500’s 19.6% gain. The company has been held back relative to other semiconductor peers because more of its chips are used in personal computers, which have suffered from declining sales, and in servers, which have slowing sales. Worldwide PC shipments fell 3.7% y/y in Q4, and for all of 2016 they declined 6.2% y/y, estimates Gartner in a 1/11 press release. PC shipments have declined annually since 2012 and are expected to remain stagnant. Semis for servers kick in about a third of Intel’s revenue, and that market is also undergoing radical change. Fewer companies are buying servers because they’re using cloud services from Amazon.com, Alphabet’s Google, and Microsoft. Those cloud companies are certainly buying servers, but their large size gives them a better bargaining position. “Their growing market clout gives them the ability to push Intel for more specialized designs, which raises Intel’s costs. The data-center group’s operating earnings fell 1.6% year over year for the 12-month period ended Oct. 1, despite a 7% gain in sales in that time,” noted a 1/23 WSJ article. Shares of Intel, which reports earnings today, trade at 13.4 times Wall Street analysts’ fiscal 2017 consensus earnings estimates. (4) M&A boost. The semi industry has been blessed with a torrid M&A environment as small companies specializing in some of the new technologies are getting snapped up by larger competitors. A 11/14 WSJ article reported: “Semiconductor companies have capped more than $240 billion worth in mergers and acquisitions in the past two years, according to Dealogic. This year’s total to date--$130.2 billion--is a record, 16% above the previous high set last year. Big deals skew the dollar total, but there have been plenty of those, too. Six transactions in the past two years have been worth more than $10 billion and three topped $30 billion.” More normal years since 2000 have seen only $20 million to $40 million of deals done annually. The author’s conclusion: The pace of M&A will likely slow as the best companies have been purchased and those with the ability to do a deal have already done so. That conclusion leaves us wondering how much of an acquisition premium remains in smaller stocks and whether that premium will dissipate. (5) The numbers. Analysts expect the S&P 500 Semiconductors industry to grow revenue by 8.9% this year and 4.4% in 2018 (Fig. 10). The industry’s forward profit margin has increased by 4.2ppts to a record high of 24.2% since the beginning of 2016 (Fig. 11). As a result, earnings are thought to grow 15.9% this year and 8.3% in 2018 (Fig. 12). Net earnings revisions have been positive since the second half of 2016, with readings of 15.6% in January, 17.1% in December, and 15.6% in November (Fig. 13). The S&P 500 Semiconductors industry’s forward earnings multiple has ranged between 10 and 20 times over the past 20 years, with the exception of the 1999-2000 Tech bubble when the multiple soared much higher (Fig. 14). With a forward P/E of 15.2 and earnings still growing, this industry looks like it still has room to head higher. (6) Shovel-makers. Another way to invest in the sector is to purchase stocks in the S&P 500 Semiconductor Equipment industry, composed of companies that make the equipment to manufacture the chips. However, this strategy is far from a secret. As we mentioned above, the industry has gained 72.4% over the past year, and one of its largest stocks, Applied Materials, gained 99.6% over the past year. That leaves Applied Materials’ shares trading at 14.4 times 2017 expected earnings and leaves the industry’s forward P/E at 13.8. Normally a below-market multiple would be a good thing. However, semi equipment companies are typically cyclical. Earnings multiples are high at the bottom of the cycle when earnings are low and shares are undervalued. Conversely, multiples are low when earnings are high at the top of the cycle. The S&P 500 Semiconductor Equipment industry cycle, Joe informs us, lasts about a year or two, and the current cycle is long in the tooth, having begun in 2015 (Fig. 15). Earnings are at record levels, as are margins (Fig. 16 and Fig. 17). In the past when forward earnings peaked, the industry’s forward P/E was between 10 and 15. There were two exceptions: During the tech boom of 1999-2000, when the forward earnings multiple exceeded 30 and earnings were hitting a peak, and in 2002, when the excesses of the tech boom were still being shed (Fig. 18). So while the technology being developed seems awfully cool, the numbers are warning that there have been better times to buy this industry.

Miller January 25, 2017 10 Comments The new phones at CES were nice, but the new technology for future phones was what I found really fascinating. CES is never really a phone show—the upcoming Mobile World Congress, which takes place in a few weeks, usually features more mobile products—but this year's CES did see the introduction of a number of interesting mid-tier phones, and more importantly, some new technology that may well find its way into phones later on this year. The most interesting new phone was probably the Asus Zenfone AR, one of the first phones able to run both Google's Daydream VR and Tango augmented reality systems. It's an interesting concept, and I'm curious to see the quantity and quality of AR apps that will be ready when the phone ships in the second quarter. Asus also announced the Zenfone 3 Zoom, which adds a dual-camera setup to the already quite interesting Zenfone 3, which I tried at the end of last year. I was also very interested in the U.S. version of Huawei's high-end Mate 9, which is most notable for including Amazon's Alexa service preinstalled. The Mate 9 has a 5.9-inch display, runs the Kirin 960 processor, and Android 7.0 Nougat. Another large phone is the LG Stylus 3, a mid-range device that stands out for having a stylus (which is increasingly rare in the U.S. market following the removal of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7). When it comes to phones at this year's CES, much of the story was about value. The show saw the launch of LG's K series (above) and Samsung's A series—both reasonable lines of mid-range phones that aren't special but look to be good values. I would say the same about the Huawei Honor 6X, which shows that you can have a dual-camera phone for just $249. Still, I was more interested in what some of the technologies I saw could mean for future phones. The Move to 10nm Chips One of the big trends for this year will be the likelihood that higher-end phones will use chips produced on 10nm processes, which should allow for more performance and/or better battery life. Keith Kressin, SVP of Product Management at Qualcomm Technologies, demonstrated what may be the first such chip to ship, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, which is manufactured using Samsung's 10nm process. Kressin said this chip will be 35 percent smaller than the existing 14nm Snapdragon 820/821, yet will offer 35 percent lower power or 2.5 hours more battery power. Quick Charge 4.0 will allow a five-minute charge to give a phone five hours of talk time, Kressin said. Adreno 520 graphics should enable 25 percent faster graphics, which Qualcomm said should allow for better VR/AR applications. The chip will also have improved security and machine learning features, as well as an X16 "gigabit class" modem along with support for such new standards as 802.11ac and ad. This should be in phones in the first half of this year. I expect we'll hear more at Mobile World Congress. Samsung is also likely to have a version of its own Exynos processor on the 10nm processor (widely rumored to be the 8895) at about the same time. Meanwhile, the other leading-edge foundry, TSMC, has also promised 10nm processors for later this year. It seems likely that we will see Apple and MediaTek processors using this process, though neither company has confirmed this. The third major foundry, GlobalFoundries, is taking a different tact. It is now ramping up its 14nm process, as well as an alternative known as fully depleted silicon-on-insulator, which it calls FDX. Alain Mutricy, senior vice president for product management, says its 22nm FDX process delivers similar performance to 14nm FinFETs at the cost of 28nm planar. GlobalFoundries believes its 12nm FDX process, which is due in 2019, will match the 10nm processes in performance but at a much lower cost, as it will require fewer masks. High-end processors will still require FinFETs for maximum performance, but Mutricy says chips for mid-range and low-end phones, as well as other Internet of Things devices, are good candidates for FDX. GlobalFoundries plans to skip 10nm, which it says won't be cost-effective with existing lithography tools, and skip directly to 7nm FinFETs with a process that will be compatible with new EUV lithography tools when they are ready for volume production. TSMC is also rushing to get 7nm ready, and recently revealed it will use a similar strategy, offering a second version of 7nm with EUV lithography. Samsung has opted to wait for EUV before shifting to 7nm. Intel showed off a running 2-in-1 design with its 10nm Cannon Lake chips, though these are designed for laptops and 2-in-1s, not phones. (Most observers think that Intel's 10nm process will have finer details than the 10nm process from Samsung or TSMC, though it's clear that 10nm is now more of a name than a measurement of any particular dimension.) Intel continued to repeat its mantra that Moore's Law is alive and well, with CEO Brian Krzanich saying he was sure it would be going long after he retires. Thinking about processors that are yet to come, one thing that has become increasingly clear is that security will be a big concern. ARM, which makes the IP behind the processor cores in virtually all phones, talked about further work on its TrustZone technology, and work on a "crypto cell" key store and cryptography engine. In addition, ARM is working on a suite of cloud services enabled by its processors designed to provide provisioning, identity management, and authentication, particularly for IoT devices. ARM also talked about just how far processors have come in the past few years, pointing out that they now support better cameras and more sensor input, and not just fast CPU and GPU performance. ARM executives said they expect similar levels of improvement over the next couple of years. 5G on the horizon Of course, processors aren't the only mobile technology that is changing. 5G was also at the show, with Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf promoting the concept of "the 5G future," at one of the keynotes. "5G isn't an incremental improvement in connectivity, or even just a new generation of mobile," Mollenkopf said, "5G will be a new kind of network, supporting a vast diversity of devices with unprecedented scale, speed, and complexity." Qualcomm, Ericsson, and AT&T announced plans to conduct testing and over-the-air field trials based on the expected 5G New Radio specifications, and also pushed millimeter Wave tests. Meanwhile, at the show, Intel announced what it called the world's first global 5G modem supporting both sub-6Hz bands and mmWave spectrum. The company hopes this modem, which is due to be sampling in the second half of the year, will be used in many of the 5G trials that are now ongoing. I'm sure we'll learn more about other trial processors at MWC. Batteries, Scanners, and Displays There were other technologies I found quite interesting at the show. Panasonic showed off its flexible lithium-ion, which it says it hopes to have ready for production in 2018. This is still a lithium-ion battery, but it has a very different design compared to conventional batteries, with more of a flat rectangular shape for the battery cells versus the more common cylindrical shape. The battery, which is 0.45 mm thick, is bendable enough to fit around a soda can. At the show, the company showed three different versions, ranging from 17.5 to 60 mAh—not enough for a phone, but certainly enough for some kinds of IoT devices. I was also very interested in seeing Synaptics's demonstration of how it could now place an optical fingerprint sensor underneath a standard cover glass on a phone, thus enabling a fingerprint sensor on the front without the need for a physical button. At first, this feature would likely be deployed in a fixed location on the screen, but over time it could be applied anywhere on the screen. One can imagine how this could change the design of smartphones, most of which now either have a fingerprint scanner in a button below the screen or on the back of the phone. I didn't really see many new display technologies for phones at the show—the phones mostly used existing LCD or AMOLED screens—but I did see a lot of people who are trying to come up with better displays for VR headsets. Resolution is a big deal here because every VR system I've tried to date suffers from the "screen-door effect" at the short distance you wear VR or AR glasses. A "retina" display would offer a much higher resolution than anything you'd need on your phone. While there were a couple of different solutions in prototype headsets, the most advanced display I saw came from Kopin, which showed a 1-inch OLED panel with a 2048 by 2048 resolution and a 120 Hz frame rate. That's probably overkill for phone resolution, but I can imagine it could be used in some very nice companion VR glasses. Of course, I saw many wireless charging solutions and was particularly intrigued by the concept of truly wireless solutions, as I discussed in yesterday's post. It's unlikely that we'll see all of these advances in any one device this year, but taken together, we should see a variety of different mobile devices with some quite new features later in the year. It should be interesting. Back to top Previous : Truly Wireless Charging Edges Closer New Processors, Notebooks, and Desktops Highlight CES's New ... Next : By Michael J. Miller Michael J.

By John Kimelman Biography Jan. 24, 2017 6:20 p.m. ET Getty Images Unfortunately for financial journalists, the speed of markets vastly exceeds the time it takes for journalists to cover those markets. Anyone needing a reminder of that only had to see how quickly stocks moved once it was clear on election night that Donald Trump would be the next president. Stocks in sectors ranging from financial services to Big Pharma rose on the expectation that Trump, who favors a lower corporate tax and less industry regulation, will help usher policies favorable to corporate bottom lines. In the days and weeks that followed, financial writers had to play catch-up in writing about stocks and other investments that would be both helped and hurt by the GOP controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Some of this catch-up journalism has its place. Still, it can’t be forgotten that stocks absorb all available information fairly quickly in hours, if not minutes. They certainly don’t wait around for writers on a daily, weekly or monthly deadline to weigh in. That fact hasn’t stopped Fortune veteran writer Shawn Tully from writing about the likely investment impact arising from GOP plans to create a tax break on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations that would repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tully attempts to quantify how much capital could potentially infuse the bottom lines of U.S. companies should President Trump and Congress agree to tax foreign profits at a low level – say 10%. The odds of such a tax holiday are quite high since both political parties favor it. “According to data assembled by Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer, S&P 500 companies held $2.2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings, or UFE, at the close of 2015,” adds Tully. “Add non-S&P 500 companies and 2016 profits, and today’s total is most likely closer to $2.6 trillion.” Tully writes that investing pros estimate that about 40% of the untaxed foreign profits – or roughly $1 trillion, will come back to the U.S. – and that companies would net at least $850 billion after they pay their modest tax bills on it. He points out that two stock sectors account for much of that money: technology and health care, chiefly pharmaceuticals. Moreover, neither industry is likely to use much of the money for research and development or new plants. “Instead, they will channel their windfalls toward goals that could be a boon for investors,” Tully adds, namely dividends and share buybacks. “For now there’s no guarantee that a repatriation bonus will help investors in the long run,” concludes Tully. “If the world’s Apples and Pfizers buy back shares at too high a price or overpay for acquisitions, their shareholders could suffer later. Still, in the short term, stocks will do a lot better if $1 trillion in foreign profits flows to U.S. shores.” It’s hard to argue with such a restrained assessment. While Fortune’s Tully focuses on stocks that can benefit from a Trump proposal, MarketWatch columnist Nigam Arora wonders whether the new president’s protectionist ideas could, if enacted, do damage to the overseas earnings of blue-chip companies. Trump has threatened countries like China and Mexico with tariffs, leading free-market advocates including Barron’s to openly worry about a potential trade war that could hurt U.S. exporters and lead to a global recession. Along those lines, Arora has tried to identified U.S. exporters that could be victims of retaliation by trade rivals. He is particularly concerned about U.S. chip makers because the Chinese and Americans compete head-on in this industry. No. 1 on Arora’s list is Nvidia NVDA 1.9334245326037391% NVIDIA Corp.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is known for graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market as well as technology for self-driving cars and machine learning. “As protectionism heats up, Nvidia’s products could be dropped in favor of those of local companies, damaging earnings of this expensive stock,” he writes. In recent weeks, Nvidia’s stock has been under pressure in part because of concerns about a potential semiconductor trade war. Indeed as a piece on Seeking Alpha recently pointed out, “if a semiconductor trade war between the U.S. and China materializes, the onset of Nvidia’s retracement may be markedly sooner, and the low may be significantly lower. The prospect of a semiconductor trade war is not presently reflected in the stock’s price.” Email: editors@barrons.com Follow @johnkimelman Like Barron’s on Facebook Follow Barron’s on Twitter Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Read This, Spike That 1.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this IBM brings Google's AI tools to its powerful computers Intel's BigDL deep learning framework snubs GPUs for CPUs AWS machine learning VMs go faster, but not forward Video Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on When Intel unveiled its BigDL machine learning framework, it emphasized CPU rather than GPU power. With this move, Intel hopes to keep its present and future hardware competitive in the expanding world of machine learning. IBM also is interested in boosting the use of its CPUs for machine learning in PowerAI, though with a different strategy. It pairs IBM's Power8 processors with Nvidia GPUs, and IBM says it's a prime method for running common machine learning applications like Caffe, Torch, and Theano. [ Deep learning reviews: Spark lights up machine learning. | TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning. | Microsoft takes on TensorFlow. | MXNet: Amazon's scalable deep learning. | Caffe deep learning conquers image classification. | Scikit-learn shines for simpler machine learning. | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter. ] Now IBM has added TensorFlow to the mix. Google's deep-leaning framework spans both CPUs and GPUs, and IBM is pushing PowerAI as the perfect hardware blend to make the most of TensorFlow. While the Xeon Phi chip sits at the heart of Intel's machine learning hardware push, PowerAI uses IBM's Power8 processor with the Nvidia Tesla Pascal P100 GPU. Nvidia's Pascal line of GPUs is a next-generation machine learning server, due to a specifically tailored instruction set. But machine learning applications have to be written specifically to run that instruction set, and many cloud-based machine learning systems (like AWS) don't use Pascal hardware. IBM's plan is to provide a whole package: CPUs, GPUs, and software, all designed to complement each other. The GPUs, for instance, use Nvidia's custom NVlink bus to provide high-speed GPU-to-GPU and GPU-to-CPU connections, which IBM has already featured in other servers aimed at the high-performance computing market. IBM also wants a slightly narrower focus for PowerAI compared to some of its competition. Mainly, it'll be used for training machine learning models from raw data. This is the slow and computation-intensive phase of any machine learning project, particularly for TensorFlow-powered deep learning applications. Thus, IBM emphasizes having high-end CPUs and GPUs, and on building out the hardware underneath to accelerate the entire product. IBM's PowerAI ambitions are also likely to be carried forward by the introduction of the Power9 processor later this year.  As always with IBM, the bigger question is the size of the prospective market for this iron. IBM's issue isn't that customers are more readily served by commodity Intel processors; having Linux on the Power platform has helped knocked down that problem. Instead, it's that businesses interested in machine learning have the luxury of opting for the cloud to obtain cheap, flexible access to GPU-powered services where TensorFlow and other algorithms are available.

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 01.25.17 in Personal Computing Comments 576 Shares Share Tweet Share Save This year marks a first for Dell's education-focused computer family: 2-in-1 laptops. Like the company's other computers destined for schools, the Dell Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles are built to withstand classrooms and student abuse. They both sport the same basic design -- rubberized shock protection for falls, sealed keyboards to handle spills and lots of rounded corners -- but one runs Windows 10 and the other is powered by Chrome OS (we'll let you guess which is which). Gallery: Dell's 2017 Education Laptops | 8 Photos 8 +4 As with most convertibles -- including Dell's recent XPS 13 2-in-1 -- the new 11-inch laptops can be used in a traditional mode, folded in a tent formation, or have their screen wrapped all the way around like a tablet. Stylus-wise, they support Dell's optional Productivity Active Pen. The Latitude 11 Convertible will be powered by Intel's seventh-generation Pentium and Celeron chips, while the Chromebook model runs sixth-generation Celerons. Dell also redesigned its 11-inch and 13-inch Latitude and Chromebook laptops with a slimmer, more minimalist look. They're also built to withstand falls and spills, and they've received the requisite processor upgrades over the last generation. Once again, the Windows versions will get more CPU options, with seventh-generation Intel Pentium and Celeron chips for the Inspiron 11 and newer Core i5 processors for the Inspiron 13. The Chromebook variants, meanwhile, are stuck with sixth-gen Celerons (the Chromebook 13 also has a Core i3 option). All of the company's new education laptops will be available on February 7th. The Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles will start at $579 and $349, respectively. The traditional Latitude and Chromebook 11 laptops, meanwhile, will start out at $349 and $219. And the flagship Latitude and Chromebook 13 models will go for $519 and $299. As usual, Chromebooks are an enticing deal for schools that want to get as many computers as possible in their classrooms. In other news, Dell also announced two new Interactive Touch 4K displays, a 55-inch and 86-inch model. They follow in the footsteps of the company's 70-inch 1080p touch display, and they're meant to offer more options for educators who want to have a large collaborative screen for their classes and meetings. They pack in DisplayPort and VGA connections for plugging in computers, as well as the expected HDMI ports (three for the 55-inch and four for the 86-inch). They'll be available on March 30th below $5,000 and $11,000, respectively (we still don't have an exact price).

Close Skip to main content The Guardian The long read Vanishing point: the rise of the invisible computer For decades, computers have got smaller and more powerful, enabling huge scientific progress. But this can’t go on for ever. What happens when they stop shrinking? by Tim Cross For decades, computers have got smaller and more powerful, enabling huge scientific progress. But this can’t go on for ever. What happens when they stop shrinking? by Tim Cross Vanishing point: the rise of the invisible computer Thursday 26 January 2017 00.59 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In 1971, Intel, then an obscure firm in what would only later come to be known as Silicon Valley, released a chip called the 4004. It was the world’s first commercially available microprocessor, which meant it sported all the electronic circuits necessary for advanced number-crunching in a single, tiny package. It was a marvel of its time, built from 2,300 tiny transistors, each around 10,000 nanometres (or billionths of a metre) across – about the size of a red blood cell. A transistor is an electronic switch that, by flipping between “on” and “off”, provides a physical representation of the 1s and 0s that are the fundamental particles of information. In 2015 Intel, by then the world’s leading chipmaker, with revenues of more than $55bn that year, released its Skylake chips. The firm no longer publishes exact numbers, but the best guess is that they have about 1.5bn–2 bn transistors apiece. Spaced 14 nanometres apart, each is so tiny as to be literally invisible, for they are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelengths of light that humans use to see. Everyone knows that modern computers are better than old ones. But it is hard to convey just how much better, for no other consumer technology has improved at anything approaching a similar pace. The standard analogy is with cars: if the car from 1971 had improved at the same rate as computer chips, then by 2015 new models would have had top speeds of about 420 million miles per hour. That is roughly two-thirds the speed of light, or fast enough to drive round the world in less than a fifth of a second. If that is still too slow, then before the end of 2017 models that can go twice as fast again will begin arriving in showrooms. This blistering progress is a consequence of an observation first made in 1965 by one of Intel’s founders, Gordon Moore. Moore noted that the number of components that could be crammed onto an integrated circuit was doubling every year. Later amended to every two years, “Moore’s law” has become a self-fulfilling prophecy that sets the pace for the entire computing industry. Each year, firms such as Intel and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company spend billions of dollars figuring out how to keep shrinking the components that go into computer chips. Along the way, Moore’s law has helped to build a world in which chips are built in to everything from kettles to cars (which can, increasingly, drive themselves), where millions of people relax in virtual worlds, financial markets are played by algorithms and pundits worry that artificial intelligence will soon take all the jobs. But it is also a force that is nearly spent. Shrinking a chip’s components gets harder each time you do it, and with modern transistors having features measured in mere dozens of atoms, engineers are simply running out of room. There have been roughly 22 ticks of Moore’s law since the launch of the 4004 in 1971 through to mid-2016. For the law to hold until 2050 means there will have to be 17 more, in which case those engineers would have to figure out how to build computers from components smaller than an atom of hydrogen, the smallest element there is. That, as far as anyone knows, is impossible. Yet business will kill Moore’s law before physics does, for the benefits of shrinking transistors are not what they used to be. Moore’s law was given teeth by a related phenomenon called “Dennard scaling” (named for Robert Dennard, an IBM engineer who first formalised the idea in 1974), which states that shrinking a chip’s components makes that chip faster, less power-hungry and cheaper to produce. Chips with smaller components, in other words, are better chips, which is why the computing industry has been able to persuade consumers to shell out for the latest models every few years. But the old magic is fading. Shrinking chips no longer makes them faster or more efficient in the way that it used to. At the same time, the rising cost of the ultra-sophisticated equipment needed to make the chips is eroding the financial gains. Moore’s second law, more light-hearted than his first, states that the cost of a “foundry”, as such factories are called, doubles every four years. A modern one leaves little change from $10bn. Even for Intel, that is a lot of money. The result is a consensus among Silicon Valley’s experts that Moore’s law is near its end. “From an economic standpoint, Moore’s law is dead,” says Linley Gwennap, who runs a Silicon Valley analysis firm. Dario Gil, IBM’s head of research and development, is similarly frank: “I would say categorically that the future of computing cannot just be Moore’s law any more.” Bob Colwell, a former chip designer at Intel, thinks the industry may be able to get down to chips whose components are just five nanometres apart by the early 2020s – “but you’ll struggle to persuade me that they’ll get much further than that”. One of the most powerful technological forces of the past 50 years, in other words, will soon have run its course. The assumption that computers will carry on getting better and cheaper at breakneck speed is baked into people’s ideas about the future. It underlies many technological forecasts, from self-driving cars to better artificial intelligence and ever more compelling consumer gadgetry. There are other ways of making computers better besides shrinking their components. The end of Moore’s law does not mean that the computer revolution will stall. But it does mean that the coming decades will look very different from the preceding ones, for none of the alternatives is as reliable, or as repeatable, as the great shrinkage of the past half-century. A smartphone that packs more computing power than was available to nations in 1971 can last a day on one battery charge Moore’s law has made computers smaller, transforming them from room-filling behemoths to svelte, pocket-filling slabs. It has also made them more frugal: a smartphone that packs more computing power than was available to entire nations in 1971 can last a day or more on a single battery charge. But its most famous effect has been to make computers faster. By 2050, when Moore’s law will be ancient history, engineers will have to make use of a string of other tricks if they are to keep computers getting faster. There are some easy wins. One is better programming. The breakneck pace of Moore’s law has in the past left software firms with little time to streamline their products. The fact that their customers would be buying faster machines every few years weakened the incentive even further: the easiest way to speed up sluggish code might simply be to wait a year or two for hardware to catch up. As Moore’s law winds down, the famously short product cycles of the computing industry may start to lengthen, giving programmers more time to polish their work. Another is to design chips that trade general mathematical prowess for more specialised hardware. Modern chips are starting to feature specialised circuits designed to speed up common tasks, such as decompressing a film, performing the complex calculations required for encryption or drawing the complicated 3D graphics used in video games. As computers spread into all sorts of other products, such specialised silicon will be very useful. Self-driving cars, for instance, will increasingly make use of machine vision, in which computers learn to interpret images from the real world, classifying objects and extracting information, which is a computationally demanding task. Specialised circuitry will provide a significant boost. Facebook Twitter Pinterest IBM reckons 3D chips could allow designers to shrink a supercomputer that now fills a building to something the size of a shoebox. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images However, for computing to continue to improve at the rate to which everyone has become accustomed, something more radical will be needed. One idea is to try to keep Moore’s law going by moving it into the third dimension. Modern chips are essentially flat, but researchers are toying with chips that stack their components on top of each other. Even if the footprint of such chips stops shrinking, building up would allow their designers to keep cramming in more components, just as tower blocks can house more people in a given area than low-rise houses. The first such devices are already coming to market: Samsung, a big South Korean microelectronics firm, sells hard drives whose memory chips are stacked in several layers. The technology holds huge promise. Modern computers mount their memory several centimetres from their processors. At silicon speeds a centimetre is a long way, meaning significant delays whenever new data need to be fetched. A 3D chip could eliminate that bottleneck by sandwiching layers of processing logic between layers of memory. IBM reckons that 3D chips could allow designers to shrink a supercomputer that currently fills a building to something the size of a shoebox. But making it work will require some fundamental design changes. Modern chips already run hot, requiring beefy heatsinks and fans to keep them cool. A 3D chip would be even worse, for the surface area available to remove heat would grow much more slowly than the volume that generates it. For the same reason, there are problems with getting enough electricity and data into such a chip to keep it powered and fed with numbers to crunch. IBM’s shoebox supercomputer would therefore require liquid cooling. Microscopic channels would be drilled into each chip, allowing cooling liquid to flow through. At the same time, the firm believes that the coolant can double as a power source. The idea is to use it as the electrolyte in a flow battery, in which electrolyte flows past fixed electrodes. There are more exotic ideas, too. Quantum computing proposes to use the counterintuitive rules of quantum mechanics to build machines that can solve certain types of mathematical problem far more quickly than any conventional computer, no matter how fast or high-tech (for many other problems, though, a quantum machine would offer no advantage). Their most famous application is cracking some cryptographic codes, but their most important use may be accurately simulating the quantum subtleties of chemistry, a problem that has thousands of uses in manufacturing and industry but that conventional machines find almost completely intractable. A decade ago, quantum computing was confined to speculative research within universities. These days several big firms – including Microsoft, IBM and Google – are pouring money into the technology all of which forecast that quantum chips should be available within the next decade or two (indeed, anyone who is interested can already play with one of IBM’s quantum chips remotely, programming it via the internet). A Canadian firm called D-Wave already sells a limited quantum computer, which can perform just one mathematical function, though it is not yet clear whether that specific machine is really faster than a non-quantum model. Like 3D chips, quantum computers need specialised care and feeding. For a quantum computer to work, its internals must be sealed off from the outside world. Quantum computers must be chilled with liquid helium to within a hair’s breadth of absolute zero, and protected by sophisticated shielding, for even the smallest pulse of heat or stray electromagnetic wave could ruin the delicate quantum states that such machines rely on. Each of these prospective improvements, though, is limited: either the gains are a one-off, or they apply only to certain sorts of calculations. The great strength of Moore’s law was that it improved everything, every couple of years, with metronomic regularity. Progress in the future will be bittier, more unpredictable and more erratic. And, unlike the glory days, it is not clear how well any of this translates to consumer products. Few people would want a cryogenically cooled quantum PC or smartphone, after all. Ditto liquid cooling, which is heavy, messy and complicated. Even building specialised logic for a given task is worthwhile only if it will be regularly used. But all three technologies will work well in data centres, where they will help to power another big trend of the next few decades. Traditionally, a computer has been a box on your desk or in your pocket. In the future the increasingly ubiquitous connectivity provided by the internet and the mobile-phone network will allow a great deal of computing power to be hidden away in data centres, with customers making use of it as and when they need it. In other words, computing will become a utility that is tapped on demand, like electricity or water today. The ability to remove the hardware that does the computational heavy lifting from the hunk of plastic with which users actually interact – known as “cloud computing” – will be one of the most important ways for the industry to blunt the impact of the demise of Moore’s law. Unlike a smartphone or a PC, which can only grow so large, data centres can be made more powerful simply by building them bigger. As the world’s demand for computing continues to expand, an increasing proportion of it will take place in shadowy warehouses hundreds of miles from the users who are being served. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google’s data centre in Dalles, Oregon. ‘As the world’s demand for computing continues to expand, an increasing proportion of it will take place in shadowy warehouses hundreds of miles from the users who are being served.’ Photograph: Uncredited/AP This is already beginning to happen. Take an app such as Siri, Apple’s voice-powered personal assistant. Decoding human speech and working out the intent behind an instruction such as “Siri, find me some Indian restaurants nearby” requires more computing power than an iPhone has available. Instead, the phone simply records its user’s voice and forwards the information to a beefier computer in one of Apple’s data centres. Once that remote computer has figured out an appropriate response, it sends the information back to the iPhone. The same model can be applied to much more than just smartphones. Chips have already made their way into things not normally thought of as computers, from cars to medical implants to televisions and kettles, and the process is accelerating. Dubbed the “internet of things” (IoT), the idea is to embed computing into almost every conceivable object. Smart clothes will use a home network to tell a washing machine what settings to use; smart paving slabs will monitor pedestrian traffic in cities and give governments forensically detailed maps of air pollution. Once again, a glimpse of that future is visible already: engineers at firms such as Rolls-Royce can even now monitor dozens of performance indicators for individual jet engines in flight, for instance. Smart home hubs, which allow their owners to control everything from lighting to their kitchen appliances with a smartphone, have been popular among early adopters. But for the IoT to reach its full potential will require some way to make sense of the torrents of data that billions of embedded chips will throw off. The IoT chips themselves will not be up to the task: the chip embedded in a smart paving slab, for instance, will have to be as cheap as possible, and very frugal with its power: since connecting individual paving stones to the electricity network is impractical, such chips will have to scavenge energy from heat, footfalls or even ambient electromagnetic radiation. As Moore’s law runs into the sand, then, the definition of “better” will change. Besides the avenues outlined above, many other possible paths look promising. Much effort is going into improving the energy efficiency of computers, for instance. This matters for several reasons: consumers want their smartphones to have longer battery life; the IoT will require computers to be deployed in places where mains power is not available; and the sheer amount of computing going on is already consuming something like 2% of the world’s electricity generation. User interfaces are another area ripe for improvement, for today’s technology is ancient. Keyboards are a direct descendant of mechanical typewriters. The mouse was first demonstrated in 1968, as were the “graphical user interfaces”, such as Windows or iOS, which have replaced the arcane text symbols of early computers with friendly icons and windows. Cern, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory, pioneered touchscreens in the 1970s. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The computer mouse was first demonstrated in 1968. Photograph: Getty Images Siri may leave your phone and become omnipresent: artificial intelligence will (and cloud computing could) allow virtually any machine, no matter how individually feeble, to be controlled simply by talking to it. Samsung already makes a voice-controlled television. Technologies such as gesture tracking and gaze tracking, currently being pioneered for virtual-reality video games, may also prove useful. Augmented reality (AR), a close cousin of virtual reality that involves laying computer-generated information over the top of the real world, will begin to blend the virtual and the real. Google may have sent its Glass AR headset back to the drawing board, but something very like it will probably find a use one day. And the firm is working on electronic contact lenses that could perform similar functions while being much less intrusive. Moore’s law cannot go on for ever. But as it fades, it will fade in importance. It mattered a lot when your computer was confined to a box on your desk, and when computers were too slow to perform many desirable tasks. It gave a gigantic global industry a master metronome, and a future without it will see computing progress become harder, more fitful and more irregular. But progress will still happen. The computer of 2050 will be a system of tiny chips embedded in everything from your kitchen counter to your car. Most of them will have access to vast amounts of computing power delivered wirelessly, through the internet, and you will interact with them by speaking to the room. Trillions of tiny chips will be scattered through every corner of the physical environment, making a world more comprehensible and more monitored than ever before. Moore’s law may soon be over. The computing revolution is not.

Tim Brugger (timbrugger) Jan 25, 2017 at 9:23PM Investors and pundits have clearly been in NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) corner compared to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). In the past 12 months, NVIDIA shareholders have enjoyed an astounding 277% share price appreciation. After such a stellar run, it could be argued that NVIDIA stock is overvalued. On the flip side, Intel, similar to NVIDIA, is putting its efforts and resources into conquering new high-growth markets. Though Intel's stock performance pales in comparison to NVIDIA's -- as does most every stock on the planet -- its 28% gain in the past year is nothing to sneeze at. So, which is the better buy, Intel or NVIDIA? Image source: NVIDIA. The case for NVIDIA It's not difficult to see why investors have been so enamored with NVIDIA lately. One peek at its most recent earnings explains it. NVIDIA's outstanding quarter was driven by "strength across all product lines." The result was a record-breaking quarter including a 54% jump in revenue year over year to $2 billion. Gross margins of 59%, up from last year's 56.3%, were also a new NVIDIA record, along with earnings per share (EPS) that skyrocketed 104% to $0.94 excluding one-time items. As impressive as NVIDIA's top and bottom lines were, what made the quarter even better was that it was able to accomplish those results, along with develop and introduce industry-standard graphic processing units (GPUs) like its GeForce lineup, and increase operating expenses a mere 11% to $544 million. As if its third-quarter results weren't enough, NVIDIA's revenue forecast of $2.1 billion for the current quarter would be a 33% improvement over last year's $1.4 billion. And NVIDIA is increasing its capital return initiative to $1.25 billion from the expected $1 billion this fiscal year. NVIDIA is the preeminent gaming GPU provider, and has already upgraded its GeForce units to enhance the gaming experience even further. NVIDIA is also expected to launch its next-gen Voltus GPU this year to power its super computing, artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Along with self-driving cars, NVIDIA's offerings are targeting all the right markets, at the right time. Image source: Intel. The case for Intel Intel has many pundits beginning to change what had been a fairly muted tone. The concerns regarding Intel's reliance on the PC market simply don't apply. The PC market isn't "dead," just ask HP (NYSE: HPQ), which continues to gain market share and could become the world's PC leader when fourth-quarter sales results are released. CEO Brian Krzanich has Intel heading in new directions, including self-driving cars, AI, virtual reality (VR), and drones, among others. Intel is also making strides in the Internet of Things (IoT) and utilizing its new technologies ideally by targeting specific markets. The recently released Responsive Retail Platform (RRP) incorporating real-time data, 3D, and sensors for brick-and-mortar retailers is one example. Intel is taking a similar approach to its drone strategy designed specifically for commercial use, which many expect will be the driving force behind a nearly $127 billion market in 2020. But its future isn't entirely reliant on a steady PC market and budding new technologies. The shift to cloud data centers is in full force, and Intel already owns a dominant position. Don't be surprised when Intel announces another quarter of record-breaking data center revenue on Jan. 26, just as it did last quarter. Intel's data center revenue climbed 10% to $4.5 billion in the third quarter. Though it remains a small piece of Intel's total revenue, quarterly IoT sales jumped 19% year over year in to $689 million. Add in the potential of Intel's other forays and the future looks bright. Compared to NVIDIA's valuation of 40 times future earnings, Intel's modest stock price of 13 times makes it a slam dunk as the better buy, right? Not necessarily. NVIDIA, despite its incredible run and lofty valuation, is still a sound growth play given its inroads into gaming, autonomous cars, and deep learning. For the more conservative income investor who can take slow but steady growth, Intel and its 2.75% dividend yield won't keep you up at night but still offers plenty of appreciation potential.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 25, 2017 at 5:43PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is known for its industry-leading gross profit margins. Though the company's gross profit margins are down from the peak of 66% seen in 2010, the company has managed to achieve greater-than-60% gross profit margins annually since 2014, after dipping slightly below 60% during 2013. INTC Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Investors (and companies themselves) like higher gross profit margins for one simple reason: The higher those margins, the more of each dollar of revenue Intel can ultimately convert into profits. Even with this in mind, as investors assess new business opportunities that Intel might go after, it's important that they recognize that there are actions that the company can take to dilute its reported gross profit margin percentage while still delivering increased value to shareholders. I'd like to walk through such an example. A great example -- non-volatile memory One market that Intel executives seem to be extremely excited about is non-volatile memory. Intel's plays in non-volatile memory include NAND-flash-based solid state drives, as well as products based on Intel's and Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) jointly developed 3D XPoint technology. Image source: Intel.  On a recent investor call, Intel executive Stacy Smith made it clear that he thinks that, on its memory products, it will "make good margins" and even "better-than-industry margins" but was quite plain that gross profit margins on non-volatile memory products are "highly unlikely" to be at Intel's current corporate average margins. What this means is that if Intel's revenue from non-volatile memory products grows at a rate faster than the rest of the company's business, Intel's overall gross profit margin percentage should decline. Now, the extent of that decline isn't likely to be all that significant in the near-to-medium term as Intel's non-volatile memory business is quite small, but over time investors may start to notice gross profit margin "dilution" if that business takes off. Isn't a decline in gross profit margin bad? Declines in a company's average gross profit margin percentage aren't always bad -- it really depends on why that figure came down. A gross profit margin decline resulting from fast growth of a lower-margin business relative to the higher-margin businesses isn't necessarily a bad thing. Remember, even if the gross profit margin percentage comes down, the total revenue to which that percentage is applied is much higher. In other words, operating income and net income would increase, ultimately increasing the value of the business, even if the average gross profit margins come down. Indeed, Smith even said on the aforementioned investor call that Intel doesn't want to "truncate growth in certain segments to hit a corporate average" gross profit margin. Now, what investors do need to be mindful of is a gross profit margin decline that's not simply due to dilution caused by a fast-growing-but-low-margin business. So, for example, if Intel had previously been able to command 65% average gross profit margins on, say, its data-center chips, but some combination of competitive pressures and manufacturing cost structure problems (perhaps from lower-than-expected manufacturing yield rates) leads those margins to come down to 62%, then that's a problem. In that case, the total revenue to which the gross profit margin percentage is applied hasn't gone up -- it may have even gone down -- so total operating profit and, ultimately, net profit decline. Those kinds of declines negatively affect earnings per share and, in many cases, the stock price. Investor takeaway At the end of the day, it's important for investors to avoid looking at financial figures without keeping a close eye on the bigger picture. Gross profit margin percentage is a critical figure to Intel investors, as it has historically been a measure of the company's competitive positioning in the markets that it serves. Nevertheless, company starts to diversify into new, potentially more competitive markets like non-volatile memory, it will be important to focus on the operating margins of each individual Intel business rather than on the consolidated gross profit margin figure.  As Smith put it, Intel wants to make sure that "every business is growing, every business is expanding its operating margin."  If Intel can consistently achieve this goal, then it should be able to generate additional value for its stockholders through increased profits and thus earnings per share. We'll see how the company does over the next several years.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

James Martin/CNET Bring it on, Apple -- at least, that's what Qualcomm's top executives seemed to be saying Wednesday. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, head of the wireless chipmakers's licensing business, fired back at lawsuits filed over the past week by Apple in the US and China. Those suits, they said, are all about the money, an effort by Apple to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier. "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property," Mollenkopf said during a call with analysts about its quarterly earnings report. "They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." While the value of Qualcomm's patents have "tangibly and meaningfully increased over time," it has never raised its royalty rates, Mollenkopf added. "If you peel apart all of the arguments Apple's making, we believe firmly they're all without merit," Aberle said. "At the end of the day, they essentially want to pay less for the technology they're using. It's pretty simple." Qualcomm plans to keep supplying chips to Apple even as they battle in the courts. "I'm confident we'll address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past," Mollenkopf said. See also Apple expands Qualcomm legal spat to China Apple sues Qualcomm over unfair licensing terms Qualcomm forced Apple into exclusive chip deal, FTC says The legal challenges he's referring to included one filed last week by Apple in the US and two others filed this week by the iPhone maker in China. The US Federal Trade Commission also has accused Qualcomm of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in exchange for lower licensing fees. Qualcomm spent the first 20 minutes of its hourlong call talking about Apple's litigation. Many of the questions from analysts also focused on the lawsuits. Apple referred CNET back to its comments and lawsuit from Friday. Its statement said, in part, that "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." Apple v. Qualcomm Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to handset manufacturers and others. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple, through its manufacturers, pays it a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property utilized in the chips and mobile phones. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price. For the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced this year, Apple also started buying 4G LTE chips from another supplier, Intel. Because Intel's chips use some of Qualcomm's essential technology, Apple pays Qualcomm a licensing fee for those processors, as well, which is based on the total value of the iPhone ($650) versus the value of the Intel chip (closer to $20). (Like most licensing terms, this gets complicated pretty quickly, but essentially, Apple bears a cost for using Qualcomm technology in its phones, whether or not the chips it includes are directly from Qualcomm.) Apple's lawsuit filed in the US on Friday alleges the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple's iPhone 7 wants you to cut the cord With the launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple has removed the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. To listen to music, you need a wireless set of earbuds or a separate adapter to connect corded headphones. by Lexy Savvides 1:49 Close Drag Apple wants a US court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The company said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based off the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. In one lawsuit filed in China, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "abused its clout in the chip industry," a violation of China's anti-monopoly law. Apple seeks 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. A second accuses Qualcomm of not making its cellular standard essential patents available broadly and cheaply. It asks the court to determine the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple. Aberle said Qualcomm has been collecting royalties based on a phone's selling price for decades and said there's no legal precedent to suggest royalties should be collected based on a chip. "This is well understood, a well laid out concept," Aberle said. "It's consistent with the way not only Qualcomm has licensed in our own industry for decades but virtually every other patent holder seeking to collect royalties on their intellectual property." He added that Qualcomm offered Apple the same terms as its other licensees in China. It refused, he said. Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices. The US FTC also has accused Qualcomm of illegally dominating the cellular chip market. Aberle said Qualcomm plans to appeal the KFTC ruling. And he accused Apple of making "false and misleading" statements to regulatory bodies around the globe. "Apple has been actively driving regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in jurisdictions around the world," he said during a call with analysts. Lots of chips On Wednesday, Qualcomm reported its fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders dropped to $682 million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share. (That $850 million fine was a factor in the loss.) Excluding acquisition costs and other expenses for the quarter ended December 25, per-share earnings jumped to $1.19 from 97 cents. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.18 a share. 14 ODG's Qualcomm-powered glasses tout AR, VR Revenue climbed 3.9 percent to $6 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecast for $6.12 billion. Revenue from Qualcomm's licensing business increased 10 percent to $1.86 billion. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall estimates about a third of Qualcomm's earnings are tied to Apple's royalty payments. If Apple stops paying royalties, Qualcomm's full-year earnings are at "material risk," he said. Qualcomm said during its call with analysts that about 40 percent of its revenue comes from selling chips and licensing its technology to Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the phone market. For the second quarter, Qualcomm expects per-share earnings of $1.15 to $1.25 on revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.20 a share on sales of $5.9 billion. Aberle said Qualcomm doesn't expect a financial impact from the litigation in the second quarter. Qualcomm shares slid 3.2 percent to $55.09 in after-hours trading. The company's stock has lost about 14 percent of its value since Apple filed its lawsuit in the US.

Roston - Jan 25, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 9/10 Pros Incredible multi-day battery life Exceptional durability Small, lightweight ultrabook design Great keyboard for typists Multiple hardware configurations offered Cons No touchscreen option If you liked Lenovo‘s X250 laptop, you’ll love its newer X260 model. All the best things about the X250 are back in Lenovo’s X260, including the crazy long battery life that can, in some cases, get users through a full day of work with charge to spare. As you’d expect, though, these two models aren’t entirely alike, and those who pick up the X260 are getting a newer beast. Is it worth the upgrade? Read our review to find out! Hardware If you’ve ever held the X250, you’ll find the X260 looks and feels very, very similar. The somewhat small 12-inch laptop’s frame is black with that iconic business-chic ThinkPad look, the texture vaguely soft, and the keyboard is exactly what we’ve come to expect from a ThinkPad. The trackpad boasts a trio of physical buttons, and as always, there’s the small red TrackPoint nub included for those who simply refuse to love to learn the trackpad. A generous array of ports line both sides of the ThinkPad X260, including a trio of USB 3.0 ports (there’s no USB-C on this model), Ethernet, a mini DisplayPort, and more. There’s a webcam nestled in the bezel above the display, a power button positioned to the side of the keyboard, and, depending on which secondary offering you use, a battery jutting out of the bottom of the machine. The X260 is described as an ultrabook by Lenovo, though it should be noted that it doesn’t have the common ultrabook tapering at the front edge like the X1 Carbon or MacBook Air. Rather, this ThinkPad is completely square in shape, with flat sides and slightly rounded edges. Overall, the laptop’s profile is only 0.8-inches at its thicket point, and the weight starts at 2.9lbs. While it’s not the thinnest or lightest laptop on the market, it is no way heavy or cumbersome. The small size is welcomed for travelers and others who frequently slip their laptop into a bag and under a plane seat. This ThinkPad, like most of them, have a love-it-or-hate-it design; personally I find it endearing. It’s definitely a no-nonsense design, quite unlike the Yoga 910 and other more luxurious, flashy models. That’s perfectly fine, though, if you simply care about getting down to work and all of the things that aid you in working. Notably, the ThinkPad X260 includes MIL-SPEC durability, and was tested across many different categories, including pressure, salt fog, vibration, sudden temperature changes, high temps, low temps, dust, and even fungus. Needless to say, the laptop can probably hold its own through many overhead bins and trunks if you travel frequently for work. The keyboard is the same variety found in the X250 and most other ThinkPad models — the keys are reasonably low-profile with a soft report and moderate amount of resistance. The trackpad is high-quality, and doesn’t skip or have any tracking issues.

The processor offerings are joined by Intel Integrated Graphics with up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and either a 500GB/1TB 5400rpm hard drive or up to a 512GB SATA SSD. Performance will depend on which configuration you get, of course, but in general the laptop ran very well during testing, and didn’t present any troubles. I used it throughout a normal workday, which involved a lot of Web browsing, downloading and uploading, toggling between more than a dozen tabs, moderate photo editing, all while music was streaming. The laptop didn’t have any trouble handling this, and got me through the entire day with battery life to spare. (Review unit features a Core i5-6300U, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 Pro) That’s because the ThinkPad X260, like the X250 before it, has excellent battery life. This is thanks to the external hot-swappable battery that joins the laptop’s internal battery. The smaller of the two swappable batteries sits flush with the back of the laptop so that you can’t tell it is there until you’re looking for it; the larger external battery option protrudes from the bottom of the laptop somewhat, though it doesn’t interfere with usage or add any readily noticeable weight. It’s important to stress here that the battery life isn’t merely long, but is in fact beyond what you’d find on the vast majority of laptops, putting the X260 into a category nearly entirely it’s own. With a full charge and the larger of the two hot-swappable batteries, you can go days without charging the laptop under moderate use scenarios. Even using the laptop non-stop during the day, there’s a good chance you’ll make it to the next morning. Assuming you have both external batteries, the larger and the smaller one, you can swap in the charged spare after the in-use batteries run low, boosting your run time by another few hours. Wrap-up Lenovo has long had a winner with this particular X lineup model, and that truth remains for the X260. There’s nothing to dislike about this iteration unless you want a touchscreen display. Laptops are, at their foundation, meant to be portable, and portability depends on two things: a lightweight design and ample battery life. This laptop gets positive marks in both those categories, but especially the latter. Road warriors will find it hard to adjust to lesser laptops after basking in the X260’s 20+ hour run time, and that’s not a bad thing. The ThinkPad X260 (2016) model is available from Lenovo starting at $818.10 USD.

Mobile by Shara Tibken January 25, 2017 1:17 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Qualcomm CEO Stephen Mollenkopf shows off the company's new Snapdragon 835 chip at CES 2017. James Martin/CNET Bring it on, Apple -- at least, that's what Qualcomm's top executives seemed to be saying Wednesday. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, head of the wireless chipmakers's licensing business, fired back at lawsuits filed over the past week by Apple in the US and China. Those suits, they said, are all about the money, an effort by Apple to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier. "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property," Mollenkopf said during a call with analysts about its quarterly earnings report. "They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." While the value of Qualcomm's patents have "tangibly and meaningfully increased over time," it has never raised its royalty rates, Mollenkopf added. "If you peel apart all of the arguments Apple's making, we believe firmly they're all without merit," Aberle said. "At the end of the day, they essentially want to pay less for the technology they're using. It's pretty simple." Qualcomm plans to keep supplying chips to Apple even as they battle in the courts. "I'm confident we'll address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past," Mollenkopf said. See also Apple expands Qualcomm legal spat to China Apple sues Qualcomm over unfair licensing terms Qualcomm forced Apple into exclusive chip deal, FTC says The legal challenges he's referring to included one filed last week by Apple in the US and two others filed this week by the iPhone maker in China. The US Federal Trade Commission also has accused Qualcomm of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in exchange for lower licensing fees. Qualcomm spent the first 20 minutes of its hourlong call talking about Apple's litigation. Many of the questions from analysts also focused on the lawsuits. Apple referred CNET back to its comments and lawsuit from Friday. Its statement said, in part, that "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." Apple v. Qualcomm Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to handset manufacturers and others. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple, through its manufacturers, pays it a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property utilized in the chips and mobile phones. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price. For the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced this year, Apple also started buying 4G LTE chips from another supplier, Intel. Because Intel's chips use some of Qualcomm's essential technology, Apple pays Qualcomm a licensing fee for those processors, as well, which is based on the total value of the iPhone ($650) versus the value of the Intel chip (closer to $20). (Like most licensing terms, this gets complicated pretty quickly, but essentially, Apple bears a cost for using Qualcomm technology in its phones, whether or not the chips it includes are directly from Qualcomm.) Apple's lawsuit filed in the US on Friday alleges the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple's iPhone 7 wants you to cut the cord With the launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple has removed the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. To listen to music, you need a wireless set of earbuds or a separate adapter to connect corded headphones. by Lexy Savvides 1:49 Close Drag Apple wants a US court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The company said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based off the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. In one lawsuit filed in China, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "abused its clout in the chip industry," a violation of China's anti-monopoly law. Apple seeks 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. A second accuses Qualcomm of not making its cellular standard essential patents available broadly and cheaply. It asks the court to determine the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple. Aberle said Qualcomm has been collecting royalties based on a phone's selling price for decades and said there's no legal precedent to suggest royalties should be collected based on a chip. "This is well understood, a well laid out concept," Aberle said. "It's consistent with the way not only Qualcomm has licensed in our own industry for decades but virtually every other patent holder seeking to collect royalties on their intellectual property." He added that Qualcomm offered Apple the same terms as its other licensees in China. It refused, he said. Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices. The US FTC also has accused Qualcomm of illegally dominating the cellular chip market. Aberle said Qualcomm plans to appeal the KFTC ruling. And he accused Apple of making "false and misleading" statements to regulatory bodies around the globe. "Apple has been actively driving regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in jurisdictions around the world," he said during a call with analysts. Lots of chips On Wednesday, Qualcomm reported its fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders dropped to $682 million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share. (That $850 million fine was a factor in the loss.) Excluding acquisition costs and other expenses for the quarter ended December 25, per-share earnings jumped to $1.19 from 97 cents. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.18 a share. 14 ODG's Qualcomm-powered glasses tout AR, VR Revenue climbed 3.9 percent to $6 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecast for $6.12 billion. Revenue from Qualcomm's licensing business increased 10 percent to $1.86 billion. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall estimates about a third of Qualcomm's earnings are tied to Apple's royalty payments. If Apple stops paying royalties, Qualcomm's full-year earnings are at "material risk," he said. Qualcomm said during its call with analysts that about 40 percent of its revenue comes from selling chips and licensing its technology to Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the phone market. For the second quarter, Qualcomm expects per-share earnings of $1.15 to $1.25 on revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.20 a share on sales of $5.9 billion. Aberle said Qualcomm doesn't expect a financial impact from the litigation in the second quarter. Qualcomm shares slid 3.2 percent to $55.09 in after-hours trading. The company's stock has lost about 14 percent of its value since Apple filed its lawsuit in the US.

Mesa 12.0 Gets an Extra Release, Mesa 17.0.0 and 13.0.4 Receive New RC Builds GO Mesa 17.0.0-rc2, 13.0.4-rc1 and 12.0.6 available for testing Jan 25, 2017 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov has announced today the availability of three Mesa builds, one stable for the Mesa 12.0 series, and two development releases for the upcoming Mesa 17 branch, as well as the fourth maintenance update to Mesa 13. We'll start with Mesa 12.0.6, which appears to be an extra, but also the last point release to the 12.0 stable branch, patching a CSO (Combined Sewer Overflow) issue that could lead to lockups of the graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other unforeseen performance of the Gallium graphics drivers. From the release announcement, it would appear that Mesa 12.0.6 fixes a total of 43 bugs discovered lately in the RadeonSI, Intel i965, and Nouveau open-source graphics drivers, along with the Intel (ANV) Vulkan driver, the GLX DRI3 GPU offloading support, and NIR, the new IR (internal representation) for the Mesa shader compiler. "This is an extra release for the 12.0 stable branch, as per developers' feedback. There are no plans to have further 12.0.x releases. Users are encouraged to migrate to the 13.0 series in order to obtain future fixes," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora, in the mailing list announcement. Mesa 17 RC2 fixes 34 bugs, Mesa 13.0.4 RC1 adds many fixes for RadeonSI The development of the highly anticipated Mesa 17 series is on track, and today we're seeing the availability of the second Release Candidate, which attempts to address a total of 34 bugs since last week's RC1 build, improving the Freedreno Gallium3D driver, as well as the Intel i965, r600, RadeonSI, Radeon (RADV) and Intel (ANV) Vulkan drivers. Also today, the fourth maintenance update for the Mesa 13.0 series got its first Release Candidate, which should go stable in two days from the moment of writing this article, on January 27, 2017. Mesa 13.0.4 promises multiple fixes for the RadeonSI and Intel i965 open-source graphics drivers. It also attempts to patch an unusual glitch in the Freedreno Gallium3D driver and the popular glxgears OpenGL test tool. However, it looks like the star of the Mesa 13.0.4 point release will be the Intel (ANV) Vulkan driver, which will gain compatibility improvements with newer Vulkan loaders, some compliance and rendering fixes, and smoketesting. With Mesa 12.0.6 being the latest stable release for the Mesa 12 branch, it is recommended that you immediately migrate to the stable Mesa 13 series, at least until Mesa 17 is hitting the stable channels in early February. In the meantime, you can test the new RCs by downloading them from our website. #Mesa 17.0.0-rc2#Mesa 13.0.4-rc1#Mesa 12.0.6#Mesa 3D Graphics Library#Linux graphics subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Mozilla Firefox 51 Is the First Web Browser to Support the New WebGL 2 Standard Tails 2.10 Amnesic Live System Adds OnionShare Tool for Anonymous File Sharing Official Arch Linux ISO Image to Drop 32-bit (i686) Support Starting March 2017 NetworkManager 1.6 to Support PKCS#11 Tokens with 802.1x Authentication, More Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 25, 2017 at 2:58PM The launch of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones market what was, arguably, the most significant design win that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had ever scored in smartphones. Image source: Intel.  A large portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones include Intel's XMM 7360 cellular modem, and the chipmaker seems to be working hard to ensure that it builds compelling enough products to continue to win future iPhone business. At a recent investor conference, the head of Intel's Client Computing Group, Navin Shenoy, spent some time talking about the company's investments in and strategies related to cellular modems. In this column, I'd like to go over the salient points of that discussion. A "strategic investment" Shenoy began by saying that cellular modems represent a "strategic investment" for the chipmaker. "We do think that as the world gets more smart and connected, you're going to need modems -- it's going to be a core intellectual property, much like graphics was 10 years, 15 years ago," for Intel, he explained. Autonomous vehicles stand to benefit from cellular connectivity. Image source: Intel.  Shenoy went on to say that modems are going to be important in many of the key areas that Intel wants to participate in, including personal computers, cars, smartphones, and "other [Internet of things] applications." One modem a year keeps Apple interested The executive reiterated a commitment that other Intel executives have made in the past -- Intel intends to release new cellular modems each year. He also said that the company's next generation cellular modem, branded the XMM 7480, is scheduled to go into "high-volume manufacturing" during 2017. The 7360 entered mass production in 2016. Image source: Apple.  Considering that Apple is pretty much the only major buyer of Intel's cellular modems, it's clear that Intel is aiming to deliver new modems on this schedule so that its chips are ready to go for when Apple launches new smartphones each fall. Modem manufacturing strategy It's well known that all the modems that Intel has released thus far haven't been manufactured by Intel -- they're designed by Intel and manufactured by third parties. Shenoy declined to comment on where Intel will be manufacturing the next-generation XMM 7480 -- or, as he was quick to point out, future modems -- but made it clear that Intel's manufacturing choices would be made on a "pragmatic basis" and that the company is evaluating both in-house manufacturing as well as external options for future modems. Catching up with the market leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is known for being the leading manufacturer of cellular modems, but Shenoy did take the opportunity to brag a little bit about the company's recently announced 5G modem, referring to it as the "world's first global 5G modem." Image source: Qualcomm.  "All I can tell you is the investment in the modem portfolio -- and the commitment to invest in the modem portfolio -- is very strong and we think that over time we can be in an absolute equivalent position to our competitors," Shenoy asserted. The executive conceded that the company is "coming from a position of being behind and so it's going to take us a few generations to catch up." Catching up with the market leaders, particularly Qualcomm, is going to be a tall order, but if the company can pull it off, I'm sure that Apple -- which likes to have multiple sources for critical components -- will be extremely happy.

With identical performance to Skylake, Intel brings desktop performance to a standstill. Mark Walton (UK) - Jan 3, 2017 5:35 pm UTC Enlarge Mark Walton reader comments 450 Share this story Specs at a glance: Intel Core i7-7700K Architecture Kaby Lake Cores/Threads 4/8 Core Clock 4.2GHz Boost Clock 4.5GHz L3 Cache 8MB Memory Controller Two channel DDR4 TDP 91W Price £330/$350 Intel's Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K is what happens when a chip company stops trying. The top-end Kaby Lake part is the first desktop chip in a brave new post-"tick-tock" world—which means that instead of major improvements to architecture, process, and instructions per clock (IPC), we get slightly higher clock speeds and a way to decode DRM-laden 4K streaming video. Huzzah. For the average consumer building or buying a new performance-focused PC, a desktop chip based on 14nm Kaby Lake remains the chip of choice—a total lack of competition at this level makes sure of that. But for the enthusiast—where the latest and greatest should perform better than what came before—Kaby Lake desktop chips are a disappointment, a stopgap solution that does little more than give OEMs something new to stick on a label in a 2017 product stack. What's new? Further ReadingIntel pushes out the rest of its Kaby Lake processor lineup for 2017Which is not to say that the whole of the Kaby Lake lineup is a bust. There are some performance gains to be had further down the product stack, particularly in the graphics department. 15W U-series processors for thin-and-light laptops feature new Intel Iris Plus graphics, which promise as much as a 65 percent performance boost over older Intel HD graphics, while the more mature 14nm manufacturing process (dubbed 14nm+) promises better battery life. 45W H-series chips for laptops are unlocked for overclocking, and there's the new Core i3-7350K, an unlocked dual-core processor with hyperthreading for overclocking on the cheap. Know your codenames Codename and year Process Prominent consumer CPU branding Tick/tock Westmere (2010) 32nm Core i3/i5/i7 Tick (new process) Sandy Bridge (2011) 32nm Second-generation Core i3/i5/i7 Tock (new architecture) Ivy Bridge (2012) 22nm Third-generation Core i3/i5/i7 Tick Haswell (2013) 22nm Fourth-generation Core i3/i5/i7 Tock Broadwell (2014-15) 14nm Fifth-generation Core i3/i5/i7, Core M Tick/"Process" Skylake (2015-16) 14nm Sixth-generation Core i3/i5/i7, Core m3/m5/m7 Tock/"Architecture" Kaby Lake (2016-17) "14nm+" Seventh-generation Core i3/i5/i7, Core m3 "Optimization" Cannonlake (2017?) 10nm TBA "Process" The quad-core i7-7700K, which sits at the very top of the Kaby Lake lineup, is less interesting. Compared to the sixth-gen i7-6700K Skylake processor that preceded it, the i7-7700K gains a small bump in base and boost clocks to 4.2GHz and 4.5GHz respectively, as well as the deceptively named Intel HD Graphics 630. The latter, while new in name, is largely identical to the Intel HD Graphics 530 found in the i7-6700K. There are no major architectural changes, and it runs at the same 1150MHz clock speed. What you do get is support for 4K media decoding inside Windows 10's PlayReady 3.0 DRM, which makes 4K Netflix possible on PC. Further ReadingNetflix 4K streaming comes to the PC—but it needs Kaby Lake CPUKaby Lake motherboards are much like Kaby Lake processors: there's little of the way of actual performance improvements. Useful for storage fans, however, is the addition of four extra PCIe lanes to the top-end Z270 and Q270 chipsets, for a total of 24. With high performance storage having moved to the PCIe interface over SATA (see the NVMe-based Samsung 950 Pro), PCIe lanes are quickly becoming scarce. Combined with the 16 PCIe lanes on the processor, a Kaby Lake system now sports a total of 40 PCIe lanes. Up to six SATA 3.0 ports are supported by the Intel chipset, along with a total of 14 USB ports (2.0 and 3.0), three PCIe 3.0 storage slots, and three independent displays when using integrated graphics. Any other features are manufacturer specific. Mark Walton Mark Walton Mark Walton The spectacularly l33t gamer ASUS ROG Maximus IX Code, for instance (as used to benchmark the i7-7700K for this review), features an extra pair of USB 3.1 ports (one Type-A one Type-C) on the rear via an additional Asmedia controller. Interestingly, Asus has also placed a USB 3.1 header on the board itself for use with front panel Type-C connectors. Unfortunately, since this header is non-standard, only a handful of cases from Lian-Li and In-Win actually support it. Elsewhere, there are the usual array of Asus enhancements, including its excellent 2X2 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MU-MIMO Wi-Fi, SupremeFX Audio S1220 solution (featuring a ESS Hi-Fi Sabre DAC), Intel I219-V Gigabit Ethernet chip, dual M.2 SSD slots, and enthusiast-friendly features like dedicated water pump headers, PMW/DC support across all five fan headers, and SLI support. Naturally, since it's now apparently a prerequisite for all enthusiast PC hardware, there's built-in RGB lighting tucked underneath the Code's hardy plastic cladding. It's worth noting that the Code is but a small part of what is a huge, horribly confusing line-up of Z270 motherboards from Asus, each of which has an ever so slightly different price point and set of features. The Code sits near the top of the pile with a £307 price tag (the most expensive being the £554 Maximums IX Extreme), but prices go as low as £117 for the Prime 270-P. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the motherboard market is needlessly intimidating to new PC builders. How anyone is supposed to know whether to buy a Deluxe, a Code, or whatever without some serious research is a mystery. What's wrong with good, better, best?

Ars Staff - Jan 6, 2017 12:30 pm UTC reader comments 68 Share this story What happens at CES, ends up in a video montage. Jennifer Hahn LAS VEGAS—The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas tries to get consumers (and the media) excited for the new year with a treasure trove of new devices. Most of the big names in computing, gaming, fitness tech, smart home, and more show off some of their newest products that will come out later in the year. And until they hit shelves (if they hit the shelves), CES is the only way to get a glimpse of them. While the show's vastness results in a lot of seemingly useless hardware and even some vaporware—Ars UK has intel on the smart hairbrush, LG wants to make sure no one ever has to open a fridge manually again—there are always a few products that stick out and manage to get us genuinely excited for the year ahead. You can find all our coverage from the ground here if you want to wade through both the crazy and cool, but these are our picks for the best technology coming out of CES 2017. Best laptop or convertible: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Enlarge Valentina Palladino Traditionally when buying a laptop, one has to compromise. You’ll find a system that has almost everything you want, but there’s always something missing. We wrote about some of the basic features that we're going to insist on for laptops in 2017, and one machine shown at CES stood out as doing all the things we want. With Thunderbolt 3, NVMe storage, Precision Touchpads, biometric authentication, touch screens, and so much more, we're ready to lay hands on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. The Yoga nails the basics. It also includes the 360-degree hinge that's invaluable on a plane or in a kitchen, a stylus that docks within the unit for safekeeping, built-in LTE connectivity, 802.11ad/WiGig, and (unusual these days) wired gigabit Ethernet. That's a compelling start, but it's the range of options that takes the Yoga to the next level: you can add an OLED screen, Iris Plus graphics, both a fingerprint reader and an IR camera supporting facial recognition, and NFC. The result is a machine that sets a new standard for connectivity and capabilities, showcasing some of the latest technology—and doing so without compromises. Best desktop or all-in-one: Intel Kaby Lake NUCs Enlarge Intel Further ReadingIntel’s new mini PCs have new chips, an updated design, and Thunderbolt 3 We've seen some interesting-looking all-in-one desktops at the show this year, including Dell's XPS 27 and HP's Pavilion Edge All-in-One with Micro-Edge Display. But in terms of sheer versatility and appeal, we've got to give the moniker of best to Intel's new NUC mini desktops. We've been fans of these PCs for years. Like the older NUCs, the new ones put decent Ultrabook-level performance suitable for productivity tasks and light gaming into a little box that will fit just about anywhere. The new models get an attractive makeover, the latest Kaby Lake CPUs and GPUs, HDMI 2.0 and HDMI-CEC support that will be sure to interest home theater enthusiasts, and a Thunderbolt 3 port that will allow for fast external storage, external GPUs, and all kinds of other possibilities. Best PC peripheral: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ 27-inch gaming monitor Enlarge Asus Simply being first to something in the tech world isn’t necessarily a guarantee for quality or excellence. But when someone can lay claim to launching the consumer market's first monitor to combine 4K resolution, 144Hz refresh, HDR-10 compatibility, and Nvidia G-Sync support, they're bound to get our attention. Just finding three of those four in a PC monitor is tough these days. (The best we've seen, up until now, is Dell's UP3017Q, which maxes its 4K resolution at a 120Hz refresh without G-Sync.) Adding the wider color gamut and luminance differential of HDR to that package is a nice, brightly rendered cherry on top. You'll need quite the powerful computer to render such crisp, colorful, and smooth content, of course, but if you're already spending so much on a gaming powerhouse, what's another pricey monitor to you? Best gaming hardware: HTC Vive's TPCast Enlarge While the HTC Vive's room-scale VR experience is unquestionably amazing, it's also unquestionably annoying to deal with a thick, three-piece wire that tethers you to a nearby PC tower, tugging on the back of the headset and creating a tripping hazard while you walk around. That's why we're excited about the TPCast, which promises to make the Vive a truly wireless experience by streaming video and audio to the headset from a PC over the air (though there is still a wire running to a pocketable battery pack). There have been other untethered VR experiences, of course, but so far they tend to rely on underpowered mobile technology and have trouble with full head-tracking through space. TPCast promises the best of both worlds—high-end VR graphics and tracking without the annoying tether. If you can afford the $250 cost and can tolerate the reported two-hour battery life, this could greatly increase the quality of your virtual life.

By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 25, 2017, 2:01 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: Intel Corporation (INTC) Q4 Earnings Preview Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is No Moonshot 3 3D Printing Stocks That Could Catch Fire Again Recent Posts: Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Still Your Best Big-Energy Bet Intel Corporation (INTC) Q4 Earnings Preview 3 3D Printing Stocks That Could Catch Fire Again View All Posts Semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings results after the bell Thursday, Jan. 26. At 5 p.m., it will hold its conference call to provide details on sales, profit and cash flow trends to INTC stock holders and analysts. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr Intel is the undisputed leader in semiconductors. By a fairly wide margin, it is the largest chip maker in the world. Its dominance came from rapid growth in personal computers in the 1990s, and it still controls the market; 8 out of 10 PCs are powered by Intel’s chips. But as PC sales have slowed in recent years, Intel has had to reboot its growth strategy. Thanks to its dominance, which results in billions of dollars of free cash flow annually and an unmatched R&D budget that is one of the largest of any company in the world, it has a firm plan in place. INTC stock holders are looking forward to hearing the current state of Intel’s business tomorrow. Here are some details on what to expect. Analyst Expectations for Intel Earnings The 30 analysts covering Intel expect fourth-quarter earnings of 75 cents per share. The estimate has bounced within a penny of that figure over the past 90 days, so looks to have been relatively steady. That is also within a penny of the 74 cents that INTC posted in last year’s fourth quarter. Back when it released third-quarter results in October, Intel provided Q4 estimates of its own. It said to expect quarterly sales of $15.7 billion, a gross margin of around 61% and a tax rate of 22%. Companies generally provide these estimates so analysts can build out their own financial projections, which in turn results in consensus estimates for investors to follow. For the full year (so including the three quarters already reported and coming fourth-quarter earnings), 35 analysts have an estimate and expect EPS of $2.67. Again, that figure has been pretty steady over the past three months. Analysts collectively expect sales growth just north of 6% and total annual sales of $58.8 billion. The Bigger Picture for INTC Stock For decades now, Intel’s bread and butter has been selling semiconductors for personal computers and related devices. It literally dominates rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and boasts a total market share of 80%. But of course, PCs aren’t growing like they used to, and Intel has been working hard to diversify into other lines of business. In Intel’s corporate speak, it says its strategy is to use “core assets to move into profitable, complementary markets.” An important market is to get more chips into mobile devices such as tablets and mobile phones. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) currently dominates the smartphone chip market. Chips that power data centers, which help store and retrieve digital information in the cloud, is another huge growth focus. This area has generally been called the internet of things.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) and QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), according to a note from Benchmark. Qualcomm Vs. Intel: Thin Modems The Apple-Qualcomm litigation suggests souring relations between the two companies, and the iPhone maker could procure more thin modems from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). This potential move would benefit CEVA, as Intel’s thin modems utilize CEVA’s DSP (digital signal processor), while Qualcomm’s thin modems do not. Intel and Qualcomm are the two primary thin cellular modem suppliers for Apple’s various iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm’s modems power CDMA versions, while Intel’s modems are used in GSM/non-CDMA networks. CEVA To Maintain, Gain Market Share “With the suit pitting Qualcomm and Apple against one another, and as validated with AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)’s October certification of Intel’s 4th generation modem, it is likely CEVA will maintain or gain market share when Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is launched next fall,” analyst Gary Mobley wrote in a note. Mobley pointed out that the fourth-generation Intel XMM7480 modem now supports CDMA networks, accomplished via the acquisition of VIA Telecom. The analyst believes Intel could gain share at Apple despite delivering only about half the downlink speed versus comparable Qualcomm modems. “While the Intel modems has about half the downlink speeds as the comparable generation Qualcomm modem, speed are sufficient for Apple’s needs, and the 4th -gen Intel modem handles 33 LTE bands as well as the necessary envelop tracking,” Mobley explained. Analyst's Estimates Mobley estimates that Apple most likely bought $500 million–$800 million worth of Intel thin modems in 2016, which would translate into $5 million–$8 million in royalties for CEVA. This in turn could bring about $0.25 in non-GAAP EPS for CEVA, based on the midpoint. In fact, CEVA could more than double its royalties generated from Intel if Qualcomm loses all share at Apple for the iPhone 8 (10th anniversary). At last check, shares of CEVA had risen 3.42 percent to $36.30, close to its 52-week high of $36.81. Mobley has a Buy rating on the stock, with price target of $40.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 25, 2017 at 11:59AM Right now, one of the hottest trends in the semiconductor industry is the emerging market for autonomous vehicles. It is generally accepted that to do proper autonomous vehicles, a lot of computing power is going to be needed inside of the cars to give them the required "intelligence." Image source: NVIDIA.  Two companies that have made public their intentions to aggressively pursue the market for the "brains" inside of self-driving cars are microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both companies have announced major partnerships and deals with automotive makers and suppliers. Intel, for instance, announced last year that it would be collaborating with Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) and Delphi Automotive to build platforms for use by automotive manufacturers. Intel has also said that, in 2016, it booked self-driving car deals collectively worth more than $1 billion in lifetime revenue. Last year, NVIDIA and Audi announced that they would, together, try to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020. NVIDIA's components are also found inside of Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) new vehicles, as well. So, both NVIDIA and Intel both look well-positioned to capitalize on a potential self-driving car boom. Which stock is the better way to play it? These are adjacent businesses for both It's important to understand that self-driving car platforms aren't either of these companies' core revenue drivers today -- they're adjacent businesses. Intel's core business is microprocessors and related components for personal computers and data centers, and NVIDIA's core businesses are graphics processors designed for gaming, workstations, and data centers. An Intel chip designed specifically for automotive use. Image source: Intel.  For Intel, autonomous vehicles are just one (potentially significant) part of the company's Internet of Things business (though the company did recently announce that it'd be forming an autonomous driving group within its Internet of Things group). NVIDIA specifically calls out automotive as a key long-term growth segment.  The reason that both companies look well-positioned to play in the self-driving car market is because the technology that they've developed for other markets (high-performance computing technologies) look to be applicable to self-driving cars. However, there is additional technical and sales/marketing work required to succeed in self-driving cars, and both companies appear to be making the required incremental investments to capitalize on these opportunities. Automotive could be a bigger deal for NVIDIA than for Intel Here's the thing: Both NVIDIA and Intel have an opportunity to make some real money from the self-driving market. Furthermore, the market for significant computing capabilities inside of self-driving cars could be quite substantial, especially if many (if not most) cars over the long term are endowed with such computing capabilities. However, I think that the self-driving car market could be much more interesting for NVIDIA than for Intel by Intel's sheer size relative to NVIDIA. If Intel manages to grow its Internet of Things business from about $3 billion in annual revenue to $5 billion in annual revenue, then that'd certainly be nice, but not a game changer for Intel, which is expected to have generated more than $58 billion in revenue during 2016. However, if NVIDIA -- which has generated about $6.1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months -- generates an incremental $2 billion in automotive-related revenue from self-driving cars over time, then that's not only going to significantly boost the company's top line, but its bottom line as well. Answering the titular question Although I wouldn't recommend buying either Intel or NVIDIA solely based on the potential for self-driving cars (these are complex businesses that generate most of their revenue from outside of the automotive market to begin with), NVIDIA's business does appear to be more likely to benefit from growth in self-driving cars than Intel's because it's a smaller one to begin with.

X Intel and DCU agree deal on research collaboration Research planned on health, water quality management and Stem education initiatives Wed, Jan 25, 2017, 16:27 Ciara O'Brien The Dublin City University campus. Intel has teamed with DCU to collaborate on research into connected health, water-quality management and Stem education innovation.         Intel has teamed up with Dublin City University to collaborate on research into connected health, water-quality management and Stem education innovation, to help develop technologies that could change how we live, learn and work in the future. The agreement pinpoints joint areas of interest, using developments in the internet of things and data analytics. It will also look at how creative arts and design can be used alongside technology. The two organisations have worked together in the past, but this is the first time there has been a formal agreement to join forces on research and innovation. Among previous collaborations, Intel and DCU have worked on the development of plasma diagnostics to improve computer chip manufacturing processes and the identification of new materials for use with future device fabrication protocol. Platform It also yielded a project that used Intel’s internet-of-things platform for DCU’s Smart Stadium at Croke Park to provide data on player metrics, queue times for refreshments and even traffic information on the stadium routes. “At Intel we have been proactively developing our advanced manufacturing capability, together with a design, research and innovation footprint in Ireland over the last 27 years,” said Intel Ireland general manager Eamonn Sinnott. “This development has been underpinned by the strong relationships we have built with academic institutions and the innovation community across Ireland. The signing of this memorandum today signals a new strategic approach to our engagement with DCU which will consolidate and build on our existing relationship and pave the way for exciting new collaborations.” Learning DCU and Intel will also work to influence policy on sustainability, education and ageing, using technology to enhance learning and living. The two organisations will also host an annual science, technology, engineering, arts and maths student hackathon, with Intel backing 16 master’s student bursaries each year. ADVERTISEMENT “Both organisations are committed to fostering the development of creative talent and our respective research interests intersect and overlap in areas that have the potential to transform lives and societies. We are excited that the formalisation of our relationship today will allow for further opportunities to embrace the creative arts as drivers of the next wave of economic growth in this country.”       Topics: Eamonn Sinnott Dublin City University Intel Ireland Read More The Netflix of software is about to disrupt the disruptors US court refuses to reconsider decision in Microsoft email case Messaging service Line sees quarterly profit and sales fall short New health Bill creates ‘insurmountable conflict’ for data watchdog Are you a specialist?

There’s a reason why NVDA stock is up 650% in the past five years By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 25, 2017, 11:18 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to America Apple Inc.

Recent Posts: Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29 Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)? View All Posts For decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was at the heart of the technology industry. As the company whose CPUs dominated the PC era, it was second to none. But Intel missed out on the mobile revolution and with PCs losing relevance every year, its leadership position has weakened. Nudging itself into Intel’s place? Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Click to Enlarge Source: NVIDIA Nvidia started as a PC graphics card manufacturer, but now, NVDA stock is riding a wave of virtual reality gaming, artificial intelligence, deep data analysis, cloud computing and self-driving cars. As its GPU-accelerated products take over processor-intensive computing, is Nvidia set to dethrone Intel? GPUs Make the Leap From Graphics to Raw Processing Power In the old days of computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) played second fiddle to central processing units (CPUs). Intel’s processors were literally at the heart of almost every computer sold. The CPU was responsible for running the computer, including its operating system. When a GPU was installed, the CPU was still primary, but it farmed off graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. Most PCs used integrated graphics that were built into their Intel CPU. Graphics cards from companies like Nvidia — with a standalone GPU — were primarily used in specialized gaming PCs. It helps to think of the CPU as a generalist, while the GPU does one thing over and over. This difference began really turning to the advantage of NVDA about a decade ago. Desktop PC CPUs from Intel might have four cores, letting the CPU manage a handful of different tasks simultaneously. GPUs were equipped with hundreds of cores, and software developers realized they could take advantage of this raw parallel processing power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be used to greatly accelerate software performance when repetitive tasks are being performed — encoding video, for example, or data analysis. GPU acceleration can make some tasks 100 times faster than a CPU alone. Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose — everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers — NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power. Why GPUs Are in Higher Demand Than CPUs Why the demand for GPUs? Think of how the demand for processor-intensive computing power has increased over the past decade. One early example was Bitcoin. The virtual currency could be purchased, but it could also be “mined” by using a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miners soon discovered that a GPU — with its parallel number-crunching capability — was far more effective than a CPU at mining Bitcoins. Anywhere from 50 to 100 times faster. Soon miners were running rigs consisting of multiple GPUs connected together. Meantime, GPUs have rapidly become more powerful, with more cores and faster clock rates, even as CPU development has become relatively incremental. Intel’s new seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop computers still has four cores. In comparison, Nvidia’s latest Titan X graphics card has 3,584 processing cores on tap. The Intel CPU costs less than a third of the Titan X’s $1200 MSRP, but when used in number-crunching applications, the Nvidia card’s price is a steal.

This week during the BETT 2017 convention in London, Dell introduced a new portfolio of laptops and monitors for the educational system. Overall, the company revealed three Windows 10 laptops and three Chromebooks for the K-12 student crowd across the globe, aimed at making the learning environment an easier, more fun experience. The two new monitors aim to do the same, offering huge screens and multi-touch input for better interactions between teachers and their students. Dell Latitude 11 Education Series 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop This model boasts a rubberized LCD and base trim to help absorb shock from bumps and devices drops. It also includes a fully sealed keyboard and clickpad just in case snack time turns into an accidental disaster. The convertible also promises all-day battery life thanks to the power-sipping Celeron and Pentium processors from Intel. One thing to note is that the Windows 10 Latitude model supports input from Dell’s Productivity Active Pen peripheral. It also includes a rear-facing camera when the device is positioned into tablet mode. The screen is capable of rotating 360 degrees, offering Clamshell, Tablet, and Tent positions. The Windows 10 unit relies on 7th-generation Intel Celeron and Pentium processors whereas the Chromebook uses 6th-generation Celeron CPUs. Latitude 3189 Chromebook 3189 Operating system: Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) Chrome OS Display size: 11.6 inches with Touch 11.6 inches with Touch Resolution: 1,366 x 768 1,366 x 768 Processor: Intel Celeron (7th Gen) Intel Pentium (7th Gen) Intel Celeron (6th Gen) Graphics: Intel Integrated Intel Integrated Memory: 4GB LPDDR3 @ 1,600MHz 4GB LPDDR3 @ 1,600MHz Storage: 128GB SSD 16GB eMMC 32GB eMMC 64GB eMMC Connectivity: Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.2 Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.2 Cameras: 1x Webcam 1x Rear Camera 1x Webcam Battery: 42 Watt hour 42 Watt hour Ports: 2x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Headphone / Microphone jack 2x USB 3.0 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Headphone / Microphone jack Size: 11.96 x 8.18 x 0.82 inches 11.96 x 8.18 x 0.82 inches Weight: Starting at 3.25 pounds Starting at 3.22 pounds Availability: February 7 February 7 Pricing: Starting at $579 Starting at $349 Dell Latitude 11 Education Series Laptop With these units, Dell had mobility in mind as students move the laptops from desk to table for group assignments. They’re similar to the convertible models, only the screens are capable of opening a full 180 degrees so that they lay flat against the desktop surface for situations such as student collaborations around a single unit. They also promise all-day battery life due to the Intel processors combined with the 42-Watt-hour batteries. Dell’s new Latitude 11 Education Series include features like a network activity light so that teachers know when students connect to the network (Chromebooks only), a full-size webcam, and a rubberized base trim to lessen shocks from accidental drops and bumps. As with the convertible models, the Windows 10 laptops rely on 7th-generation Intel processors while the Chromebooks use 6th-generation chips.

With the Dell Latitude 13 Education series, the company offers Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 7, Ubuntu, NeoKylin, and Chrome OS. The larger size enables more processor and connectivity options such as optional 4G LTE and an Ethernet port. The Windows 10, Ubuntu, and NeoKylin units are based on 6th-generation and 7th-generation Intel processors whereas the Chromebooks only use 6th-generation chips. The non-touch units have an anti-glare component and the touch-capable models are protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass. These notebooks have a network light, too, for alerting teachers when students access the network. Latitude 3380 Chromebook 3380 Operating system: Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) Windows 7 (Core i3 CPUs only) Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit NeoKylin 6.0 64-bit Chrome OS Display size: 13.3 inches Non-touch 13.3 inches with Touch, Gorilla Glass 13.3 inches Non-touch 13.3 inches with Touch, Gorilla Glass Resolution: 1,366 x 768 1,366 x 768 Processor: Intel Celeron (6th & 7th Gen) Intel Pentium (6th & 7th Gen)Intel Core i3 (6th & 7th Gen) Intel Core i5 (6th & 7th Gen) Intel Celeron (6th Gen) Intel Core i3 (6th Gen) Graphics: Intel Integrated Intel Integrated Memory: 4GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz 4GB LPDDR3 @ 1,866MHz Storage: 500GB 7,200RPM HDD 128GB SSD 256GB SSD 16GB eMMC 32GB eMMC 64GB eMMC Connectivity: Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.1 4G LTE (optional) Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.2 Cameras: 1x Webcam 1x Webcam Battery: 56 Watt hour 56 Watt hour Ports: 3x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card slot 1x Headphone / Microphone jack 1x Ethernet 3x USB 3.0 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card slot 1x Headphone / Microphone jack 1x Ethernet Size: 13.10 x 9.13 x 0.90 inches 13.10 x 9.13 x 0.90 inches Weight: Starts at 3.60 pounds Starts at 3.54 pounds Availability: February 7 February 7 Pricing: Starting at $519 Starting at $299 Dell Interactive Touch Monitor C8618QT Next, we move to Dell’s two interactive screens. For starters, we have the mammoth 86-inch model based on In-Plane Switching panel technology that’s known for its wide viewing angles and superb color depth. This interactive monitor has a huge brightness of 400 nits and an even larger resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 so that the students caught cutting up at the back of the class can’t blame it on their inability to see the lesson or presentation. Screen size: 86 inches Resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 Aspect ratio: 16:9 Panel type: IPS Response time: 8 milliseconds Max brightness: 400 nits Contrast ratio: 1,000:1 Viewing angles: 178 degrees (H) 178 degrees (V) Color gamut: 72 percent CIE 1931 Color depth: 1.07 billion Touch details: Up to 20 points finger touch Up to 4 points pen touch Audio: 2x 20-watt speakers Ports: 4x HDMI 2.0 1x DisplayPort 1.2 1x VGA 4x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x Audio input 1x Audio output Availability: March 30 Pricing: Below $11,000 Dell Interactive Touch Monitor C5518QT Finally, this interactive touch monitor is a smaller version of the 86-inch unit, sporting a 55-inch screen and a lower brightness of 350 nits. Outside the obvious physical aspect, the big difference with this unit is that it has one less HDMI port and smaller, 10-watt speakers. However, both have anti-glare and anti-smudge coatings to keep all those fingerprints from clouding up the lesson or presentation. Screen size: 55 inches Resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 Aspect ratio: 16:9 Panel type: IPS Response time: 8 milliseconds Max brightness: 350 nits Contrast ratio: 1,000:1 Viewing angles: 178 degrees (H) 178 degrees (V) Color gamut: 72 percent CIE 1931 Color depth: 1.07 billion Touch details: Up to 20 points finger touch Up to 4 points pen touch Audio: 2x 10-watt speakers Ports: 3x HDMI 2.0 1x DisplayPort 1.2 1x VGA 4x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x Audio input 1x Audio output Availability: March 30 Pricing: Below $5,000 Also watch: Share

Mesa 17.0-RC2 Released, Final Coming Next Month Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 25 January 2017 at 08:50 AM EST. 5 Comments The second release candidate is now available for the upcoming Mesa 17.0. Emil Velikov of Collabora announced the Mesa 17.0.0-rc2 release a few minutes ago. With the code having been branched a week ago, it's only bug fixes in this new version. Among the fixes are for Freedreno's Adreno A5xx support, i965 Intel, some RadeonSI fixes, a few Intel ANV Vulkan fixes, DDIV support for R600g, and other small fixes throughout. Overall, nothing too major, which is good at this stage of development. Mesa 17.0 has many performance optimizations, Intel/RADV Vulkan driver improvements, OpenGL 4.5 for Haswell, Nouveau Maxwell OpenGL 4.3 support, RadeonSI OpenGL 4.5, and a wide-range of other improvements.. Full write-up/overview soon. The list of about three dozen fixes/changes for Mesa 17.0-RC2 can be found via this announce message. Mesa 17.0 should be officially released in February as a big update to this open-source 3D stack. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Image: Connor McKenna The long-term collaboration between Intel and Dublin City University has been strengthened, after plans to foster talent and develop advanced technologies have emerged. Now more than two decades old, Intel’s ties with Dublin City University (DCU) are already extensive. There’s a Croke Park Smart Stadium project, plasma diagnostics, materials science and chip manufacturing collaboration all ongoing. Now isn’t the time to ease up, seemingly, as the duo reveals plans to build on its partnership in the coming years. Key areas of research activity will leverage advances in internet of things and data analytics for application in areas such as connected health, water quality management and STEM education innovations. The agreement will also seek to combine the creative arts and design with technology in the next wave of Irish innovation. Claiming to be “proactively developing our advanced manufacturing capability”, Eamonn Sinnott, GM of Intel Ireland, said the news is evidence of his company consolidating and building on its academic relationships. In a move to secure talent for these future developments, Intel will support a new programme offering 16 MA student bursaries each year. As part of the partnership, the duo will collaborate on efforts to shape public policy in relation to sustainability, ageing and education. A STEAM hackathon will be hosted each year, too. “Both organisations are committed to fostering the development of creative talent and our respective research interests intersect and overlap in areas that have the potential to transform lives and societies,” said Prof Brian MacCraith, president of DCU. Interestingly, news of the partnership comes on the same day that outgoing University College of Cork president Michael Murphy claims business has too much influence on the Irish research agenda. In the Irish Examiner, Murphy said industry should have a say in university paths, keeping the latter relevant with the needs of today. “But we also have to be very careful about the extent to which we permit the business sector to influence the overall agenda,” he said. “I have a concern at the extent to which the business community has become the dominant voice in the research agenda.” In-Depth: More on Dublin City University Related: Intel, Dublin City University, Ireland, internet of things, education, research Gordon Hunt is a journalist at Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Innovation DCU researcher applies maths to the human behaviour of investing 2 hours ago1 Share Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Helping the world be well.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Laptops Dell's latest laptops are built to survive the classroom David Nield 7 pictures Dell has three new laptops to show off, with a choice of Windows or Chrome OS on eachView gallery - 7 images Dell has launched three new laptops made with kids (and their parents and teachers) in mind. Capable of running Windows or Chrome OS, the laptops are all built to survive the rigors of the classroom and beyond, with rugged designs and all-day battery life. The Dell Latitude 11 Convertible and Chromebook 11 Convertible are the latest in a long line of 2-in-1 notebooks with reversible screens you can flip over and use in tablet mode. With toughened, scratch-resistant glass they should be able to go anywhere that kids do, and the Latitude (Windows) model includes support for a stylus, too. The Latitude 11 also comes with a front-facing camera for Skype calls and video recording, and is fitted with 7th-gen Kaby Lake Celeron or Pentium processors from Intel. The Chromebook sticks with 6th-gen Skylake Intel Celeron CPUs. The more conventional laptops are the Latitude 11/Chromebook 11 and the Latitude 13/Chromebook 13, fitted with either 11-inch or 13-inch screens. All four models have a 180-degree hinge on the display, so keyboard and screen can be laid flat – perfect for groups of kids huddled around a desk. Again you get the same choice of processors as with the convertible models, while the 13-inch versions up the specs a little, with the Windows model topping out at a 7th-gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 CPU. The 13-inch Chromebooks are fitted with 6th-gen Skylake Intel Core i3 CPUs instead. Most significantly, and in line with education-focused Chromebooks we've seen from Dell in the past, all three models follow the MIL-STD-810g military standard for design, which covers environmental pressures like temperature, shock, humidity and water exposure. Although there are no fixed ratings for the laptops in terms of exactly what they can stand up to, they've been built to be carried and knocked around in the classroom all day. All these models have sealed keyboards and trackpads to guard against spills, for example, plus rubberized, ergonomic keys for hard-hitting little fingers. Dell is claiming an "all-day" battery life on all the new laptops too, and the low-power Intel processors and relatively low-res 1,366 x 768 pixel displays across the board should help in that department. Finally, there are a bunch of built-in connectivity options available, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI and USB. All these models are available from February 7 in the US. The 11-inch Convertible laptops are priced at US$579 for the Windows model and $349 for the Chrome OS version, while the standard versions can be had for even cheaper: $349 for the Latitude 11, $219 for the Chromebook 11, $519 for the Latitude 13 and $299 for the Chromebook 13.

Now that Intel has unleashed its seventh-generation Kaby Lake desktop processors to the masses, the company is gearing up to release processors for the professional workstation market under the Xeon E3-1200 v6 brand in the first quarter of 2017. Like their desktop-class counterparts, these chips will be compatible with single-socket LGA1151 motherboards and support Intel’s older 100 Series motherboard chipsets as well as the new 200 Series launched in early January. That leads us to a leak of specifications provided by support documentation for Micro-Star International motherboards used in workstations. Eight unannounced Xeon processors were discovered sporting four cores, 8MB of L3 cache, and maximum power draws of 72 and 73 watts, depending on the chip. The flagship model in this group supposedly has a base clock speed of 3.9GHz, but no integrated graphics component. Here they are: Cores Threads Base Speed L3 Cache Integrated Graphics GPU Speed TDP Xeon E3-1280 v6 4 8 3.9GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1275 v6 4 8 3.8GHz 8MB Intel HD P630 Up to 1,150MHz 73 watts Xeon E3-1270 v6 4 8 3.8GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1245 v6 4 8 3.7GHz 8MB Intel HD P630 Up to 1,150MHz 73 watts Xeon E3-1240 v6 4 8 3.7GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1230 v6 4 8 3.5GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1225 v6 4 4 3.3GHz 8MB Intel HD P630 Up to 1,150MHz 73 watts Xeon E3-1220 v6 4 4 3.0GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts As the chart shows, the processors with integrated graphics have a maximum power draw of 73 watts (or 78 watts, depending on the source) while the GPU-free chips sip 72 watts of power. The previous v5 generation consumed around 80 watts of power, so users will see a performance boost at a reduced power cost with these upcoming v6 chips. The listed processors packed with integrated graphics are using the “professional” version of the Intel HD Graphics 630 component used in Intel’s new desktop processors for the mass market, hence the ‘P’ in the name. It is based on Intel’s Gen9 graphics architecture supporting a maximum resolution of 4,096 x 2,304 at 60Hz via DisplayPort, H.265 encode and decode, and more. The base graphics speed may be around 350MHz as seen with the Core i7-7700K for desktops. More: Intel’s Project Alloy chases perfect immersion, but comes up short Right now, the CPU turbo speeds of the upcoming E3-1200 v6 series are unknown, but here is a comparison between the v5 and v6 models related to their base speeds and maximum power draw: Base Speed v5 Base Speed v6 TDP v5 TDP v6 Xeon E3-1280 3.7GHz 3.9GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1275 3.6GHz 3.8GHz 80 watts 73 watts Xeon E3-1270 3.6GHz 3.8GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1245 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 80 watts 73 watts Xeon E3-1240 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1230 3.4GHz 3.5GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1225 3.3GHz 3.3GHz 80 watts 73 watts Xeon E3-1220 3.0GHz 3.0GHz 80 watts 72 watts Comparing the two generations together, five of the new v6 models are 200MHz faster than the previous v5 models while reducing the maximum power draw in the process. These new chips are based on Intel’s 14nm Plus process technology, which is an optimized version of 14nm-based manufacturing enabling higher frequencies and a better power efficiency. On a more detailed level, 14nm Plus provides a higher fin height and a larger pitch so the transistors aren’t quite so packed together. Intel has not stated exactly when the new Xeon E3-1200 v6 processors will arrive, or for how much. In the meantime, the list of leaked Xeon processors can be found here until MSI pulls the plug on the info. Also watch: Share

The technology is what many companies in Internet search and artificial intelligence are trying to advance, and includes picture search and matching, as one example. “Perception, such as recognizing a face in an image, is one of the essential goals of the ZTE 5G System,” said Duan Xiangyang, vice president of ZTE Wireless Institute. “Deep learning technology is very important as it can enable such perception in mobile edge computing systems, thus making ZTE’s 5G System smarter.” The test took place in Nanjing City, China, where ZTE’s engineers used Intel’s midrange Arria® 10 FPGA for a cloud inferencing application using a CNN algorithm. ZTE has achieved a new record – beyond a thousand images per second in facial recognition – with what is known as “theoretical high accuracy” achieved for its custom topology. Intel’s Arria 10 FPGA accelerated the raw design performance more than 10 times while maintaining the accuracy. The Arria 10 FPGA provides up to 1.5 teraflops (TFLOPs) single precision floating-point processing performance, 1.15 million logic elements and more than a terabit-per-second high-speed connectivity. Such deep learning designs can be seamlessly migrated from the Arria 10 FPGA family to the high-end Intel Stratix® 10 FPGA family, and users can expect up to nine times performance boost. Besides the impressive increase in performance, the team at ZTE Wireless Institute sped design time with the use of the OpenCL programming language. “With the Intel reference design, and using the Intel SDK for OpenCL to program the FPGA, our development time was greatly shortened,” said Xiong Tiankui, chief engineer at ZTE Wireless Institute. “We are pleased with the benchmark achieved and thank the Intel Programmable Solutions Group for supporting our project.” Resources: Computer and Storage Solutions Intel Arria 10 FPGAs Machine Learning with FPGAs Configuration: The benchmark was achieved on a server holding 4S Intel Xeon E5-2670v3 processors running at 2.30GHz, 128GB DDR4; Intel PSG Arria 10 FPGA Development Kit with one 10AGX115 FPGA, 4GB DDR4 SODIMM, Intel Quartus Prime and OpenCL SDK v16.1.     Contact Altera Corp.

Sarah Tew/CNET Mobile by Shara Tibken January 20, 2017 1:05 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Apple's latest lawsuit target? Qualcomm. The iPhone maker on Friday filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple wants a court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The company said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based off the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Qualcomm, meanwhile, fired back at Apple's allegations, calling them "baseless." Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement: Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [South Korean Fair Trade Commission] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits. Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to other chipmakers. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple pays it a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property included in those chips. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price.

Because Intel's chips use some of Qualcomm's essential technology, Apple pays Qualcomm a licensing fee for those processors, as well, which is based off the total value of the iPhone ($650) versus the value of the Intel chip (closer to $20). Apple says Qualcomm's practices are unfair, as are the clauses in Qualcomm's licensing terms that prevent Apple from seeking out other suppliers or participating in government inquiries into Qualcomm's practices. "This will likely be troublesome for Qualcomm who, by virtue of being so far ahead technologically with so much market share, has a painted target on its back," Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said. Monopoly? Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices.

In its heavily redacted complaint (PDF), the FTC said the patents Qualcomm held are standard-essential patents -- technology that is essential to the industry and must be licensed to competitors under fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms (FRAND). But the complaint alleges that Qualcomm consistently refused to license some standard-essential patents to rival chipmakers, in violation of its FRAND commitments. Qualcomm said in response to the FTC complaint earlier this week that it "has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms." 10 10 tips every iPhone 7 owner should know Apple, meanwhile, has been involved in plenty of litigation of its own. The company faced off against Samsung at the Supreme Court in October over a design patent case. Ironically, at issue in that suit was whether Samsung had to pay damages based on the entire value of its infringing phones or only on the portion that infringed. The Supreme Court ultimately decided that damages don't have to be based on an entire device and sent the case back to the lower court. Apple on Friday said Qualcomm charges it "at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." The company added that Qualcomm recently withheld nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple "as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use," the company said in its statement. "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." Apple filed the lawsuit in federal district court in the Southern District of California, Qualcomm's backyard instead of Apple's home in Northern California. The company has asked for a jury trial.

By John Kimelman Biography Jan. 24, 2017 6:20 p.m. ET Getty Images Unfortunately for financial journalists, the speed of markets vastly exceeds the time it takes for journalists to cover those markets. Anyone needing a reminder of that only had to see how quickly stocks moved once it was clear on election night that Donald Trump would be the next president. Stocks in sectors ranging from financial services to Big Pharma rose on the expectation that Trump, who favors a lower corporate tax and less industry regulation, will help usher policies favorable to corporate bottom lines. In the days and weeks that followed, financial writers had to play catch-up in writing about stocks and other investments that would be both helped and hurt by the GOP controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Some of this catch-up journalism has its place. Still, it can’t be forgotten that stocks absorb all available information fairly quickly in hours, if not minutes. They certainly don’t wait around for writers on a daily, weekly or monthly deadline to weigh in. That fact hasn’t stopped Fortune veteran writer Shawn Tully from writing about the likely investment impact arising from GOP plans to create a tax break on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations that would repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tully attempts to quantify how much capital could potentially infuse the bottom lines of U.S. companies should President Trump and Congress agree to tax foreign profits at a low level – say 10%. The odds of such a tax holiday are quite high since both political parties favor it. “According to data assembled by Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer, S&P 500 companies held $2.2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings, or UFE, at the close of 2015,” adds Tully. “Add non-S&P 500 companies and 2016 profits, and today’s total is most likely closer to $2.6 trillion.” Tully writes that investing pros estimate that about 40% of the untaxed foreign profits – or roughly $1 trillion, will come back to the U.S. – and that companies would net at least $850 billion after they pay their modest tax bills on it. He points out that two stock sectors account for much of that money: technology and health care, chiefly pharmaceuticals. Moreover, neither industry is likely to use much of the money for research and development or new plants. “Instead, they will channel their windfalls toward goals that could be a boon for investors,” Tully adds, namely dividends and share buybacks. “For now there’s no guarantee that a repatriation bonus will help investors in the long run,” concludes Tully. “If the world’s Apples and Pfizers buy back shares at too high a price or overpay for acquisitions, their shareholders could suffer later. Still, in the short term, stocks will do a lot better if $1 trillion in foreign profits flows to U.S. shores.” It’s hard to argue with such a restrained assessment. While Fortune’s Tully focuses on stocks that can benefit from a Trump proposal, MarketWatch columnist Nigam Arora wonders whether the new president’s protectionist ideas could, if enacted, do damage to the overseas earnings of blue-chip companies. Trump has threatened countries like China and Mexico with tariffs, leading free-market advocates including Barron’s to openly worry about a potential trade war that could hurt U.S. exporters and lead to a global recession. Along those lines, Arora has tried to identified U.S. exporters that could be victims of retaliation by trade rivals. He is particularly concerned about U.S. chip makers because the Chinese and Americans compete head-on in this industry. No. 1 on Arora’s list is Nvidia NVDA 1.9334245326037391% NVIDIA Corp.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is known for graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market as well as technology for self-driving cars and machine learning. “As protectionism heats up, Nvidia’s products could be dropped in favor of those of local companies, damaging earnings of this expensive stock,” he writes. In recent weeks, Nvidia’s stock has been under pressure in part because of concerns about a potential semiconductor trade war. Indeed as a piece on Seeking Alpha recently pointed out, “if a semiconductor trade war between the U.S. and China materializes, the onset of Nvidia’s retracement may be markedly sooner, and the low may be significantly lower. The prospect of a semiconductor trade war is not presently reflected in the stock’s price.” Email: editors@barrons.com Follow @johnkimelman Like Barron’s on Facebook Follow Barron’s on Twitter Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Read This, Spike That 1.

By John Kimelman Biography Jan. 24, 2017 6:20 p.m. ET Getty Images Unfortunately for financial journalists, the speed of markets vastly exceeds the time it takes for journalists to cover those markets. Anyone needing a reminder of that only had to see how quickly stocks moved once it was clear on election night that Donald Trump would be the next president. Stocks in sectors ranging from financial services to Big Pharma rose on the expectation that Trump, who favors a lower corporate tax and less industry regulation, will help usher policies favorable to corporate bottom lines. In the days and weeks that followed, financial writers had to play catch-up in writing about stocks and other investments that would be both helped and hurt by the GOP controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Some of this catch-up journalism has its place. Still, it can’t be forgotten that stocks absorb all available information fairly quickly in hours, if not minutes. They certainly don’t wait around for writers on a daily, weekly or monthly deadline to weigh in. That fact hasn’t stopped Fortune veteran writer Shawn Tully from writing about the likely investment impact arising from GOP plans to create a tax break on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations that would repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tully attempts to quantify how much capital could potentially infuse the bottom lines of U.S. companies should President Trump and Congress agree to tax foreign profits at a low level – say 10%. The odds of such a tax holiday are quite high since both political parties favor it. “According to data assembled by Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer, S&P 500 companies held $2.2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings, or UFE, at the close of 2015,” adds Tully. “Add non-S&P 500 companies and 2016 profits, and today’s total is most likely closer to $2.6 trillion.” Tully writes that investing pros estimate that about 40% of the untaxed foreign profits – or roughly $1 trillion, will come back to the U.S. – and that companies would net at least $850 billion after they pay their modest tax bills on it. He points out that two stock sectors account for much of that money: technology and health care, chiefly pharmaceuticals. Moreover, neither industry is likely to use much of the money for research and development or new plants. “Instead, they will channel their windfalls toward goals that could be a boon for investors,” Tully adds, namely dividends and share buybacks. “For now there’s no guarantee that a repatriation bonus will help investors in the long run,” concludes Tully. “If the world’s Apples and Pfizers buy back shares at too high a price or overpay for acquisitions, their shareholders could suffer later. Still, in the short term, stocks will do a lot better if $1 trillion in foreign profits flows to U.S. shores.” It’s hard to argue with such a restrained assessment. While Fortune’s Tully focuses on stocks that can benefit from a Trump proposal, MarketWatch columnist Nigam Arora wonders whether the new president’s protectionist ideas could, if enacted, do damage to the overseas earnings of blue-chip companies. Trump has threatened countries like China and Mexico with tariffs, leading free-market advocates including Barron’s to openly worry about a potential trade war that could hurt U.S. exporters and lead to a global recession. Along those lines, Arora has tried to identified U.S. exporters that could be victims of retaliation by trade rivals. He is particularly concerned about U.S. chip makers because the Chinese and Americans compete head-on in this industry. No. 1 on Arora’s list is Nvidia NVDA 1.9334245326037391% NVIDIA Corp.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." ___ INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," ''dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged." ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) NEW YORK (AP) — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. This March 23, 2010, file photo, shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were Black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. In this Friday, March 15, 2013, file photo, a Facebook employee walks past a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.  (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. In this Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017, photo, Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of Tinsel, poses at the offices of Galvanize in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified Black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were Black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.”   In this Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2015, file photo, Jaysean Erby raises his hands as he solves a coding problem as Apple CEO Tim Cook watches from behind at an Apple Store, in New York, as Apple hosted Hour of Code events around the world as part of Computer Science Education Week. Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity, from outreach at high schools and historically Black colleges to internship and mentoring programs to sponsorships for coding boot camps to bias training and support groups. So far, to little avail. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were Black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were Black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were Black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are White and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

Credit: Raspberry Pi More like this Apple collaborates with rivals to advance A.I. research Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Intel chases A.I. with new chips, but still lacks a potent GPU Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Google wants to bring smarts to cool gadgets and devices made using Raspberry Pi 3 or Intel's Edison. The company is chasing makers with open-source tools needed to add artificial intelligence to consumer, industrial, and retail devices made using board computers. The plan may include machine-learning tools, which are central to A.I. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions with the help of A.I., and the technology also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely. "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year," a Google spokesman said in an email. Earlier this week, Google published a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing "smart tools" to makers. In a blog entry, Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Devices could incorporate Google A.I. technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets. Google's voice recognition is the company's most visible A.I. technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3. Providing a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs. The spread of Google's A.I. tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets. Companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud. Samsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and A.I. technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers. It's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends. But boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful A.I. and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle. Some companies like Movidius -- which is part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones. Google is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS. The company hasn't talked about A.I. technologies available in Android Things.

MATIAS J. OCNER For the Miami Herald 1 of 4 i By Fred Grimm fgrimm@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Silicon Valley, with its insatiable need for highly skilled foreign labor, especially from India, has nothing on us. South Florida is downright desperate for the imported expertise of Masi Sadaiyan and Vadivel Gopal. Google, Apple, Oracle, Intel — all have begged the feds to relax limits on how many software engineers with advanced degrees and “specialty skills” they can import from the Europe and Asia, especially the Indian subcontinent. American techies, of course, rail against the contention that Asian engineers outperform homegrown workers. They argue that tech firms are just employing a clever variation of outsourcing. That these foreigners are stealing American jobs. Forget that stuff. That argument hardly applies to the special kind of Indian expertise imported by the University of Florida and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Sadaiyan and Gopal can do what we can’t. Which is maybe save South Florida from an economic catastrophe. The two visiting emissaries from southeast India’s famed Irula Snake-Catchers’ Cooperative can track pythons. Understand, I’m not referring to the hunting techniques employed by our homegrown snake wranglers, who occasionally surprise a python sunning itself on an Everglades hammock. Sadaiyan and Gopal track snakes through the underbrush. These guys, like generations of Irula tribesmen before them, can figure out the whereabouts of cobras, vipers and kraits in their homeland. In South Florida, they can search out Burmese pythons, the discarded castaways of the pet trade that are propagating like crazy in the Everglades, annihilating native mammals and wading birds. Who knows what’s next on their menu? Pets? Small children? County commissioners? The two Irula tribesmen can track pythons to their very lair, using skills developed generations ago. The Irula became snake catchers in the reptile-infested Tamil Nadu state (known as Madras during the British colonial days). They were so damn efficient, capturing snakes and selling the snakeskins, that the region’s serpents were nearly wiped out (allowing the rat population to surge). In 1972, the Indian government outlawed the snakeskin trade. The Irula adjusted, catching cobras, vipers and the wildly dangerous kraits and milking them for poison to sell to drug companies for use in anti-venom medicine, then setting the snakes free. It’s a crucial industry in a country where venomous snakes kill 46,000 people a year, according to the Daily Mail India edition. Two snake hunters for $68,888 sounds like a better deal than paying Pitbull a million bucks. The Herald’s Jenny Staletovich (who usually stalks snakes of the political kind) reported that the FWC has allocated $68,888 for the two-month project, covering the costs for two snake hunters along with a pair of Tamil-language translators. Which sounds like a better deal compared to the million bucks Visit Florida paid Pitbull to promote Florida tourism with a music video and on social media. Let Pitbull wrestle a 16-foot python out of an abandoned vine-choked missile silo, then we’ll be getting a bang for the taxpayer’s buck. (And the makings of a hell of a music video.) Indian writer and filmmaker Janaki Lenin was with a party of wildlife biologists accompanying Sadaiyan and Gopal last week when the snake catchers descended into an old Nike missile silo in the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Key Largo. “With a machete, Masi cut the strangler fig roots that blocked the entrance,” she wrote for FirstPost.com, an Indian online publication. Lenin wrote that pythons were rarely seen in the refuge. None had been captured in the traps set around the area. No one but the Irula hunters had any notion that they’d find a snake that afternoon. Then, she wrote, Masi shouted, “Malappambu,” Tamil for python, from inside the bunker. Make that pythons. They found two males and a 16-foot female. University of Florida biologist Frank J. Mazzotti told me via email Thursday that the snake hunters had snagged 15 pythons in their first two weeks. Most of those, he judged, would have gone undetected without the tracking skills of the Irula. Staletovich noted that last year 1,000 local hunters, participating in the state-sponsored monthlong Python Challenge, found only 106 snakes. Mazzotti said “our best hope” in the struggle to contain the python outbreak would be to set up an “early detection and rapid response” system. Maybe we ought to import a few more Irula rapid responders. The python infestation has seemed hopeless. But maybe not. The International Union for Conservation of Nature now lists the Burmese python as “critically endangered” through large swaths of its natural habitat in southeast Asia, mostly due to the skin trade. And python leather is currently fetching premium prices. The Guardian reported Wednesday that Paris-based Kering — owner of high-fashion brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen — was building its own python farm in Thailand. No wonder. Gucci python boots are going for $3,500. A Fendi python jacket costs $11,500. So: Parisian fashions and Irula snake catchers. Maybe we’ve found the magic combination that can save the Everglades.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo By Aishwarya Venugopal Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

With a $30 billion factory How does China respond to US chip threats? With a $30 billion factory Tsinghua Unigroup is investing $30 billion in a factory that will make DRAM and flash storage, striking at the heart of a chip battle between the US and China Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 21 January, 2017 07:30 - - - - print email Comments For China, actions speak louder than words, especially in the escalating chip battle with the U.S., which has been hurling out verbal threats in recent months. The Chinese chip infrastructure is getting a serious boost from Tsinghua Unigroup, which is investing US$30 billion in a new foundry to make chips. The state-owned Tsinghua Holdings is a majority shareholder in Tsinghua Unigroup. This news comes just two weeks after U.S. accused China of rigging the chip market and artificially reducing the prices of semiconductors. The tough talk came from the administration of former President Barack Obama but will continue under Donald Trump, who was sworn in as president Friday. The factory in Nanjing will primarily make 3D NAND flash and DRAM chips to bulk up the country's semiconductor and storage markets. The first stage of investment will be $10 billion and produce 100,000 chips per month. The manufacturing facilities will stretch over 1,500 acres, or 2.34 square miles. Beyond the investment in the chip factory, Tsinghua Unigroup will also invest about $4.3 billion to build a complimentary IC (integrated circuit) international city that will include a science technology park, a school, commercial facilities, and apartments. China has a poor chip-manufacturing infrastructure, and this investment should fill a hole in the country's long-term effort to be self-reliant with technology products. Companies like Intel, Samsung, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) and GlobalFoundries, which invest billions in fabs, will feel the pinch. Intel and GlobalFoundries operate factories in the U.S., and those companies also spend billions to upgrade manufacturing facilities. But the U.S. will certainly take notice. Earlier this month, a White House working group said China was not playing fair in the semiconductor market, by artificially reducing the prices of chips through government assistance. The working group, called the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology or PCAST, recommended the U.S. respond to the Chinese chip threat by investing more in innovation and education and creating new types of quantum and neuromorphic computers. The U.S. and China have conflicting technology agendas. China has made it difficult for U.S. technology companies to do business in the country. Most hardware companies have turned to partnerships or joint ventures to operate, with the Chinese government having some level of ownership. Security and intellectual property theft have also been major U.S. concerns. The U.S. has been placing more emphasis on China's semiconductor market in recent months. China today hosts the world's fastest supercomputer called TaihuLight. Fast supercomputers are used in weapons development, economic forecasts, and scientific research, making them central to a country's security and economic strategies. The U.S. in the past has banned the export of supercomputing chips to China, citing concerns that it could be against U.S. national interests. In 2014, China said it would invest $150 billion to subsidize chip development over a 10-year period. That's partly because China wants 70 percent of devices in the country to use homegrown chips by 2025. That investment helped spur the development of low-cost semiconductors, which are also shipping outside China. But the U.S. charges that Chinese semiconductors are inferior and have affected the quality of devices. The flood of Chinese chips has slowed down demand for chips and hurt the bottom line of U.S. companies, giving them less money to spend on the research and development of new chip technologies. Products like the iPhone and iPad are assembled in Chinese factories, helping to keep down the price of those devices. The cheap Chinese chips have also reduced the cost related to building electronics, appliances, and cars. U.S. companies are also moving factories to China, which offers a cheaper way to make chips. Intel is making its memory chips at a factory in Dalian, China.

First, came its Compute Sticks and then its credit-card-shaped Compute Cards. But nothing's quite like the mysterious Euclid, which is a self-contained computer the size of a thumb designed to be the brains and eyes of a robot. More details have emerged about the computer, which was announced in August and has yet to be released. The Euclid is so small and light that's possible to hold like a pen. It has a built-in 3D RealSense camera, making it like a PC fused into a Microsoft Kinect. [Related: The best Japan Robot, gadget and car expo gallery] The design makes it possible to install the Euclid where the eyes of a human-like robot would be typically placed. The 3D RealSense camera will act as the eyes of a robot, capturing images in real-time and helping with movement. Euclid has motion and position sensors that can help the robot move around both indoors and outdoors. Intel announced and demonstrated the Euclid computer in a robot moving on stage during CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote at the Intel Developer Forum in August. The Euclid Developer Kit launch page is up on the website of Mouser Electronics. Intel didn't provide a specific launch date or pricing. Once the Euclid is placed in a robot, it can be operated remotely through a mobile device or PC. The Euclid has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity to communicate with the PC. The Euclid can also "serve as a full, autonomous brain with sensing capabilities, or as a smart sensor controlled by a more powerful computer," Mouser states on its website. The computer has GPS capabilities for navigation. The Euclid presentation about RealSense technologies last year at the Roscon robotics conference. The Atom CPU provides the horsepower to process and analyze the images collected by the 3D camera. The CPU will drive a robot's movement and help it complete tasks. The ZR300 is a 1080p camera bundled with an infrared camera and an infrared laser projector. The combined features will help robots get a better sense of depth and motion, which will aid in movement. The device operates on a battery and has environmental sensors on the back. One sensor is a barometric pressure sensor. Additionally, it has a microphone and speakers, and HDMI and USB 3.0 slots. Euclid supports Linux-based Ubuntu OS and Robotics Operating System (ROS), which typically sits on top of an OS. It will also support Arduino, a software package commonly used by developers to create basic electronics.

But which one is better? In the recent past, we have seen a new breed of laptops dominating the market. Known as convertible or hybrid laptops, they give us the convenience of a tablet with rotating touchscreen and performance of a classic laptop.   Asus and Dell are one of those few manufacturers that are trying hard to capture this market with their own alliteration of convertibles. Asus has come up with a new hybrid laptop known as ZenBook Flip UX360CA which is now priced at Rs 57,479 and Dell has Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 for Rs 52,990. Both the laptops have a lot to offers and come with some interesting specs sheet. But which one is better? Let's try and analysis it.   Design   Starting with the Asus ZenBook Flip, the laptop comes with a sleek design. The company has added a ‘spun-metal finish’ with the “Zen-inspired pattern of concentric circles” design on the cover. The laptop measures 32.3 (width) x 22.0 (depth) x 1.39 ~1.39mm (height) and is lightweight with 1.3 kg.   On the other hand, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 comes in a hue that Dell calls "theoretical grey." The laptop is a bit thicker as compared to the ZenBook Flip with 325 x 224 x 20.4mm measurement and heavier with weighing 1.62kg. Both the laptops come with a 360-degree rotatable screen, but if you ask us, we will opt for Asus ZenBook Flip as it comes with better design language, is sleek and lighter than Dell’s 2-in-1 making it easier to carry around.   Display   On the display front, the Asus ZenBook Flip sports a 13.3 LED-backlit FHD display with a screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels coupled with 72 percent NTSC colour. On the other hand, Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 comes with 13.3-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Truelife LED-Backlit display. As both the laptops come with an almost similar display, we call this round a tie.   Hardware and Software   The heart of any laptop lies in its hardware.

The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} January 26, 2017 11:57am   Comments Share: Earnings from three blue-chip stocks covering the technology and oil services sectors may offer another snapshot of a global economy that appears to be mostly in recovery mode. Tech giants Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday, while the oil patch’s Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) opens the books Friday ahead of the bell. The common thread among the three is “a look to the future.” INTC and MSFT, which have been a mainstay inside personal computers for decades, now seem to be eyeing life beyond microprocessors, operating systems and software, though these core products still make up a significant portion of the firms’ revenue. CVX, meanwhile, survived last year’s dive in oil prices and, like the rest of the oil sector, picked itself up, brushed itself off, and looked ahead.     Microsoft, AI and Azure Widely-held MSFT is slated to report its fiscal year Q2 results after the close Thursday. Its Q1 results blew past Wall Street’s expectations and prompted some analysts to call MSFT the “comeback kid,” as it transitions from a PC software mainstay into a commercial cloud-based services business and further develops its artificial intelligence technology. “As computing becomes more ubiquitous, converting data into ambient intelligence that can fuel digital transformation is at the very core of our innovation agenda,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the company’s annual meeting in November. “In fact, AI is already working on your behalf to predict and automate tasks in many of the products you use today,” he added, pointing to handwriting recognition in Windows 10, the Windows Hello facial-recognition feature, voice recognition of Cortana, language translation in Skype, and the input recognition and the Swiftkey keyboard on iOS or Android devices. Its fastest-growing product is reported to be Azure, what MSFT calls a “growing collection of integrated cloud services—analytics, computing, database, mobile, networking, storage, and web.” Azure revenue has grown in triple digits over the last seven quarters, Nadella said, to help the commercial cloud division’s annualized revenue rate exceed $13 billion. “We remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal ’18,” he added. MSFT also completed its purchase of LinkedIn in December and named Kevin Scott to the newly created role of chief technology officer. This expands what his role was at LinkedIn, and it is aimed at driving strategic initiatives across the company. The Q4 consensus earnings estimate from third-party Wall Street analysts is $0.79 a share, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. Revenue is projected to dip slightly to $25.21 billion from $25.69 billion last year. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 3.8% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Calls have been active at the weekly 64 and 65 strikes while puts have seen activity at the 62.5 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 40th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. INTC and the Internet of Things INTC, the world’s largest maker of computer chips, posted record revenue and strong year-over-year growth in Q3, thanks in part to personal-best revenues out of its data center and Internet of Things (IofT) groups. Might that happen again? Last quarter’s rise in revenue in the data center group appeared to be helped by stronger numbers in its cloud-computing solutions group, according to INTC, while some analysts noted that the IofT revenue was boosted by sales of embedded video, retail and transportation products. Some analysts expect more of the same in Q4. Also, INTC announced last summer that it was coming out with a headset called Project Alloy to offer a “merged reality” experience without the fussy cords and hardware. Some analysts admit they don’t know what that term means, and will be looking for more information on it. Third-party Wall Street analysts have a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $0.76, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim® platform. Wall Street analysts have revenues pegged at $15.76 billion, on par with what the company forecast during its Q3 release. Last year, INTC posted Q4 revenue of $14.46 billion. INTC has outpaced Wall Street’s expectations in nine of the last 10 quarters. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of just over 3% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Options trading has been concentrated around its current share price, with call activity at the 38 strike and puts active at the 37 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 29th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) CVX and Wading Through the Oil Patch It’s been a rough road for oil producers and refineries as they’ve juggled the mostly low crude oil prices amid a global surplus. But the recent pact by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 11 non-OPEC countries, including Russia, which recently agreed to curtail oil production, might have pumped new life into the oil patch worldwide. CVX solidly outpaced Wall Street’s earnings expectations in Q3 as its domestic and international downstream divisions, coupled with its international upstream unit, helped offset a loss in domestic upstream operations. (Downstream operations are those closest to the end user of crude oil products; upstream operations drill wells and locate raw materials.) The results also were a welcome relief from the prior two quarters, according to the company. “Third quarter results, though down from a year ago, reflect an improvement from the first two quarters of this year,” Chief Executive John Watson said in the earnings release. “Our operational performance in the third quarter was strong. Our refineries continued to run well.” Some analysts expect to see more of that, as well as improvement in exploration and production, when results are reported ahead of the bell Friday. The consensus earnings estimate from third-party Wall Street analysts is $0.63, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim platform. Revenue is projected at $32.8 billion, up from $29.25 billion last year. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 1.7% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Call activity has been higher at the 118 strike, while put activity has been focused at the 114 strike. The implied volatility is at the 14th percentile.

James Hamilton, an AWS VP and Distinguished Engineer, revs up for his talk at re:Invent 2016 in Las Vegas. (GeekWire Photo / Dan Richman) It’s not unusual for internet and software giants to design and even make their own hardware, to increase efficiency and build a competitive advantage. Google custom-designs its own servers, filling them with millions of chips from Intel, and announced in May that it has designed its own application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for use on neural networks. Facebook uses its own switches in its data centers. But market-leading public-cloud company Amazon Web Services may have gone farthest down this path — designing not only its own routers, chips, storage servers and compute servers but also its own high-speed network. “We’ve got, in the same company . . . digital designers working on (chipsets), hardware designers working on NICs (network interface cards), and software developers,” said James Hamilton, an AWS VP and Distinguished Engineer, during a keynote at the AWS re:Invent conference in November. “When you own the horizontal and vertical, we get to move at the pace we’re used to, we get the make changes at the pace we’re used to, we get to respond to customer requirements at the pace we’re used to. We think this is a really big deal.” During a 1.5-hour geekfest, replete with close-up photos of servers, racks and cables, Hamilton posited that the networking world is going the way of the mainframe, getting “chopped up into vertical stacks” with different companies innovating and competing on those stacks. That’s helping make networking gear a commodity, he said — one that AWS can save money on by building its own. (Via Amazon video) “We run our own custom-made routers, made to our specifications, and we have our own protocol-development team,” Hamilton said. “It was cost that caused us to head down our own path, and though there’s a big cost (improvement) . . .  the biggest gain is in reliability.” This custom-made gear “has one requirement, from us, and we show judgment and keep it simple. As fun as it would be to have a lot of tricky features, we just don’t do it, because we want it to be reliable.” If AWS were using standard commercial routers and a problem arose, “the most committed, most serious company would take six months” to resolve the issues, he said. “It’s a terrible place to be. So we love where we are right now.” AWS has standardized on 25-gigabit Ethernet (25 GbE) as a fiber networking transfer speed, even though “that looks like a crazy decision,” Hamilton said. “I was heavily involved in this decision, so I’ll defend it.” The industry standards, he noted, are 10 GbE and 40 GbE, with 10 GbE representing a single optical wave and 40 GbE representing four waves but at almost four times the optics cost, he said. “Well, 25 gigs is almost the same price as 10 gigs, which means we can run 50 gigs at much less cost (than 40 gigs). From an optics standpoint, it’s absolutely the right answer. . . . I believe this is where the industry will end up.” Hamilton displays a custom-made ASIC. (Via Amazon video) AWS routers run a customized Broadcom Tomahawk ASIC with 7 billion transistors and 128 ports of 25 GbE, for a total flow-through of 3.2 terabits (Tbit). “These are absolute monsters,” Hamilton said, holding one aloft. Similar chips with 6 Tbit and 13 Tbit capacity are coming, at around the same price, he said. Another key piece of AWS’s networking strategy is software-defined networking — the ability of network administrators to change and managed network behavior through interfaces. Part of that is moving processes from software into hardware to the extent possible. “Sometime about 2011 we made an obvious but important observation: whenever you have a workload that’s very repetitive . . .  you’re better of taking some of that down into hardware,” he said. “People say, ‘Hey, the reason (AWS) had to go to customer networking gear is you could never have the bandwidth we have in our data centers if you didn’t,’ Hamilton related. “That’s not true. I could give you any bandwidth you want . . . with anyone’s equipment. It’s absolutely not hard to do. . . . You know what is hard to do? Latency. That is physics. . . . I tell software people, the things you’re measuring are milliseconds (one thousandth of a second). In hardware, they measure nanoseconds (one billionth of a second) and microseconds (one millionth of a second). So this is the right place for us to go.” (Via Amazon video.) AWS also produces its own customized chipsets, emblazoned with the name “Annapurnalabs,” for use in “every server we deploy,” Hamilton said. Amazon bought Israeli chipmaker Annapnurna last January for a reported $350 million. This was the first time AWS has made clear it’s using chips from the company. “Do you believe we’re in the semiconductor business?” Hamilton exclaimed. “Not only are we building hardware, but we built this,” he said, showing off the chipset. “This is a very big deal. If I’m right on those trends I told you about in hardware implementation (and) latency — and I’m fairly confident on that one — that means we get to implement it in silicon.” AWS uses power-switching gear with custom firmware for its data centers, ensuring that if faults occur outside the center, the facility continues to operate, and if they occur inside, the load is not dropped. That, Hamilton said, avoids problems like the airline that lost $100 million when switching gear locked out reserve generators, and a 34-minute gap in 2013 Super Bowl coverage that occurred for the same reason. AWS’s more recent custom storage servers hold 11 petabytes (one million GB) of data on 1,100 disks contained in a single standard-size 42U rack, up from the 8.8 PB in the 880-disk model that Hamilton showed. He said company policy prohibited showing the latest model. A custom AWS compute server. (Via AWS) The company’s custom compute servers, each occupying one slot on a rack, are sparsely populated, Hamilton conceded. “Turns out this is implemented for thermal and power efficiency. . . . What the OEMs are selling to customers are probably three, four, five times more dense than this, and they’re less efficient. But they make up for it in cost.” The AWS compute servers’ power supplies and voltage regulators operate at greater than 90 percent efficiency. And because AWS spends hundreds of millions of dollars on electricity, “if this power supply is 1 percent better, that gets to be a pretty interesting number.” AWS’s data centers, in 16 regions worldwide, are linked by a 100-Gb private network controlled exclusively by AWS, with no interconnection sites administered by other companies. “It’s many, many parallel 100-Gb links. There’s no way a single link will ever have any on impact on anyone in this room, because we have the capacity to survive a link failure. We engineer it that way. We’d be crazy not to.” (Via AWS) “Every link is 100 gigs, absolutely everywhere,” Hamilton said. “This is a pretty important asset. When we started this, I was a little concerned, because it’s really, really, really expensive. The networking team is 100 percent committed that this is the right thing to do.” AWS uses short- and long-term leases, dark fiber lit under contract, and “in several cases we’re laying our own cable,” he said. “We’ll do whatever’s most cost-effective to get the resources we need.” Amazon is an investor in the Hawaiki Submarine Cable, a 14,000-kilometer cable linking Australia, Hawaii, New Zealand and Oregon. (Via AWS) Hamilton provided details, too, on Amazon’s data centers, which are usually surrounded by secrecy. It’s already known that each “availability zone” within a region contains at least one data center, but Hamilton added that most new data centers consume between 25 and 32 megawatts (MW) of power. That’s a fairly modest size: the most power-hungry data center in the world, China Telecom’s Inner Mongolia Information Park, consumes more than 150 MW on an ongoing basis. “You get really big gains in cost advantage as you get bigger, and we could easily build 250-MW facilities, but if it goes down, it’s not a good place to be,” he said. “So our take right now is that (25-32 MW) is about the right size facility. It costs us a tiny bit more to go down this path, but we think it’s the right thing for customers.” Watch the full video of Hamilton’s talk below. Sponsor Post Salesforce is ready for you.

Page 1 of 5. 10 Comments For those that may be thinking about picking up an Intel Kabylake processor and trying to justify if DDR4-2400 memory is worthwhile for your budget, or even faster DDR4 memory via XMP profiles / overclocking, here are some tests using a Kabylake CPU and testing DDR4 memory at frequencies from 1600MHz up to 3333MHz. This article is intended for providing some reference DDR4 memory Linux benchmarks at different frequencies in conjunction with an Intel Core i5 7600K running on an ASUS PRIME Z270-P motherboard. The memory I used throughout all of this testing was the Corsair Vengeance 2 x 8GB DDR4-3200MHz memory 16 Memory Kit. This Corsair memory used has an XMP profile for running the memory at DDR4-3200MHz with 16-18-18-36 latencies at 1.35V. Plopping these DIMMs into the PRIME Z270-P motherboard with i5-7600K, as soon as activating the XMP profile, the system had no troubles running at 3200MHz. I was able to increase it to 3333MHz too without any issues, but trying to push the memory further than that resulted in problems with the HD Graphics 630 not working due to timing issues. So for these Linux tests today I ran this memory at frequencies from 1600MHz to 3333MHz while running various real-world and synthetic Linux benchmarks. During testing only the frequency was changing without any tweaking of the latency or other tunables. All of this benchmarking was done in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 was running on the system with the Linux 4.10 kernel.

There's Now A KDE-Branded Laptop Running Neon With Plasma 5 Written by Michael Larabel in KDE on 26 January 2017 at 06:32 AM EST. 37 Comments For KDE fans not interested in setting up a KDE-based Linux distribution on your own laptop and worrying about potential graphics driver bugs with Plasma or other possible headaches, there is now a "KDE laptop" backed by the KDE community. KDE has teamed up with Spanish computer hardware retailer Slimbook to offer the KDE Slimbook. It's an Intel laptop preloaded with KDE Neon and thus running the latest KDE Frameworks 5 + Plasma 5 experience. This isn't a laptop running Coreboot or the like or any other real innovations besides just being pre-loaded with KDE Neon and tested by KDE Developers to ensure you don't run into any hardware troubles, etc. The KDE Slimbook currently comes in two varieties with either a Core i5 6200U or Core i7 6500U processor, 4 / 8 / 16GB RAM options, Intel Graphics HD 520, SSD storage, 13.3-inch 1080p screen, and a two-year warranty. Pricing on the Core i5 laptop starts out at 729,00 € (~$780 USD) while the Core i7 model starts out at 849,00 € (~$911 USD). That's for the base models with 4GB of RAM and 120GB SSD storage. So as with most Linux laptops not from a tier-one vendor, the pricing is higher than you'd normally pay for a Windows laptop from one of the major vendors, but at least you know it will work with KDE just fine. More details on the KDE Slimbook via today's dot.kde.org announcement or by visiting Slimbook.es. 37 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Sends In Final Batch Of DRM Features For Linux 4.11: DP MST Audio, HuC Firmware Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 26 January 2017 at 06:18 AM EST. 4 Comments Daniel Vetter, the i915 DRM kernel maintainer from Intel's Open-Source Technology Center, has announced their final set of feature changes to be queued in DRM-Next for the Linux 4.11 kernel. Going back to the end of 2016 they had already been staging their DRM / graphics changes for Linux 4.11. They've sent in several series of updates and the code sent out today is believed to be their last feature work they are looking to merge for this next kernel cycle. The updates today aren't too exciting for end-users. Among the changes are some code clean-ups, Panel Self Refresh (PSR) fixes, and various other fixes throughout. Two noticable items though include DP MST audio (DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport) support as well as HuC loading support. DP MST was already supported by the Intel DRM driver while with Linux 4.11 is now DP MST audio capability. The HuC is another binary-only firmware blob. HuC follows in the GuC firmware blobs for the Intel DRM driver. HuC is related to video decoding support. Earlier feature work already in DRM-Next for the Intel driver on Linux 4.11 is frame-buffer compression by default for Skylake and newer hardware. Great to see FBC finally getting flipped on by default there! Linux 4.11 also has initial support for Intel Geminilake. The changes for this latest DRM-Next i915 pull request can be found via intel-gfx. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(IBM) Options activity provides a look at expectations on AAPL, RAD and IBM By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 23, 2017, 9:14 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earnings Bank of America Corp’s (BAC) Irrational Exuberance Will End Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Going to Record Highs! Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings View All Posts U.S. stock futures are pointed lower this morning over concerns that President Donald Trump will pursue a protectionist agenda. Traders are beginning to shift away from the U.S. dollar, with the Japanese yen drawing a safe-haven bid, and oil is also moving lower. In earnings, Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) will be in focus later today. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were both lower by 0.19%. On the options front, Friday’s Jan. 2017 expiration drove massive volume with more than 21.3 million calls and 18.6 million puts crossing the tape. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed from a one-month low of 0.59 on Thursday to a two-week high of 0.70. The 10-day moving average, however, held steady at 0.65. Turning to Friday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw accelerated bullish bids following report the company is planning new iPad launches in the first half of 2017. Elsewhere, Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) puts gained popularity after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) balked at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (NASDAQ:WBA) buyout plan. Finally, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) hit a fresh all-time high following strong fourth-quarter earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL) AAPL stock finished Friday pinned at $120, as heavy call and put accumulations at the expiring Jan. 2017 $120 strike proved too much for the stock to overcome. The shares had plenty of bullish drivers on the session, including a report that Apple was preparing to launch a slate of revamped iPads in the first half of 2017. Specifically, a pre-publication note in DigiTimes said that Apple is building a “9.7-inch iPad with a friendly price range” for the first quarter, with an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a 10.5-inch iPad for the second quarter. However, the note doesn’t call the 12.9-inch iPad a “Pro” model. Volume was brisk on AAPL stock Friday, with nearly 1.1 million contracts traded on the shares. What’s more, calls accounted for a well above average 71% of the day’s take. Overall, traders remain heavily focused on the $120 strike in both the 27 Jan. and 3 Feb. series, with the latter bearing the brunt of speculation heading into next week’s quarterly earnings report.

White @rjwhite1 12h ago • 4 min read For football fans, the Super Bowl is appointment viewing each year, pitting the final two teams standing against each other to determine that season's NFL champion. For non-football fans, the Super Bowl is also a must-watch experience, to find out which commercials everyone is going to be talking about on Monday. More Super Bowl How to watch it TV schedule Team uniforms National anthem Halftime show How do you know that everyone will be watching? Just look at what advertisers are willing to pay to get their 30-second spot in front of a Super Bowl audience: Buying a 30-second spot will cost over $5 million on average, according to Variety. While some advertisers wait to make their big reveal during the game and others come up with a unique plan on how to make every penny spent count (more on that in a minute), others make their ads available to watch before kickoff. Below is more on what you can expect to see on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the best and worst Super Bowl commercials of all-time. Commercials for Super Bowl LI Snickers This isn't the actual Snickers ad, but there's a very good reason for that: the company will be shooting their commercial, which features "Star Wars" star Adam Driver, live. Here's their teaser for the spot: Advertising Age reports that it's the first time a commercial will be shown live during the Super Bowl since 1981, when Schiltz ran a live taste test during Super Bowl XV. Intel The tech company enlisted Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for their commercial: Intel also managed a little bit of luck, as they debuted their commercial well before Brady and his team earned their spot in the big game. Buffalo Wild Wings B-Dubs is teaming up with Packers great Brett Favre on a series of spots leading up to their commercial during Super Bowl LI. Here's the first: You can follow the man himself on Twitter to keep up with the campaign. Squarespace The website builder/domain hosting company follows John Malkovich's quest to sign up for a URL: Squarespace's Super Bowl spots have previously featured Jeff Bridges, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Lexus The car manufacturer is going with a dance-themed ad to promote the 2018 LC 500 performance coupe. Here's an extended version of the spot: If the performer looks familiar, it's because Lil' Buck is also in the Apple AirPods commercial that debuted this January. Skittles The candy company may wind up with the biggest buzz of all Super Bowl commercials by the time the game is over. Here's a look: It's already appeared on YouTube's list of trending videos and had amassed more than 500,000 by Wednesday afternoon after going live the previous day. GoDaddy After years of being known for their risque ads, the Internet service provider has gone lighter in recent years. They appear to be continuing in that vein with this year's spot. Here are several teasers for their Super Bowl ad: The actual Super Bowl ad will turn "The Internet" into a person. Don't anticipate a famous celebrity playing the role, per Advertising Age. TurboTax The tax preparation company dropped their first teaser during Sunday's AFC Championship Game, featuring none other than Humpty Dumpty: Two additional teasers are scheduled leading up to the company's 45-second Super Bowl spot, per Advertising Age. Wix.com The website builder's ad answers a very important question: What happens when Wonder Woman meets The Transporter? The ad above debuted on YouTube Live and Facebook Live amassed more than 2 million views on YouTube in the eight days since its release. Kia The auto company will be advertising its 2017 Kia Niro during the game, but they dropped a 15-second teaser this week: Melissa McCarthy, star of the long-running CBS sitcom "Mike & Molly," features in the spot. Mr. Clean The official cleaner of Super Bowl LI, Mr. Clean released their official Super Bowl commercial on YouTube: It's Procter & Gamble's first Super Bowl ad ever for the iconic character, USA Today reports. Avocados from Mexico The avocado awareness organization features Jon Lovitz in their hypnotic teaser for this year's offering: The organization earned plenty of buzz for its first Super Bowl ad in 2015 featuring the "First Draft Ever." Mercedes-Benz The car company debuted a 1-minute version of their Coen Brothers-directed Super Bowl ad on YouTube on Friday: Peter Fonda stars in the ad for the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. Top five Super Bowl ads ever 5. Volkswagen (2011) Of all the more recent ad spots, this one sticks out: Can you get any more adorable than a mini-Darth Vader trying to use The Force? 4. Budweiser (1989) The first Bud Bowl was held during Super Bowl XXIII: The spot would have seven sequels throughout the '90s in arguably the most memorable long-running ad campaign in Super Bowl history. 3. Apple (1984) While not as sports-centric as most of the top ads on this list, there's no denying the debut of the Apple Macintosh its spot: The Super Bowl spot was the only time Apple ran this ad, which is arguably among the top commercials of all time. 2. McDonald's (1993) The fast-food company landed a pair of iconic NBA stars to battle over their burgers and fries: I'd watch these two go at it in a head-to-head shooting contest today. Get on it, McDonald's. 1. Coca-Cola (1980) Could it be anything else? Often imitated but never duplicated, Mean Joe Greene's Coke commercial launched 37 years of must-see Super Bowl commercial viewing. Worst Super Bowl ad ever Fortune.com has a great list of terrible Super Bowl ads worth checking out. While many didn't work due to insensitive takes on race, death and other topics and deserve consideration, one was proud to declare itself the worst commercial ever.

Owens Published: Jan 26, 2017 2:51 p.m. ET Share Amid restructuring and ahead of new server platform, chip maker could use a boost from traditional business Bloomberg News Intel Corp. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich speaks at CES 2017 in Las Vegas on Jan. 4, 2017. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor When Intel Corp. reports earnings Thursday afternoon, it may be saved by a business it is trying to get away from, again. Analysts expect that a stronger than expected holiday season for sales of personal computers could boost the world’s largest chip maker in its fourth-quarter earnings report. While the PC business still accounts for the majority of Intel’s revenue, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich has been restructuring the company with a focus on newer technologies like cloud data centers and the Internet of Things. See also: Holiday PC sales rebound slightly, but still far from growth Intel INTC, +1.12%   has struggled in that effort, however, with growth in cloud-server sales disappointing investors and restructuring charges and changes continuing to grow, and surprise growth in the PC group already rescued the company more than once in 2016. While the company tries to get past the changes and find gold in newer technologies, it could use a surprise windfall from its once-trusty PC division yet again. What to expect: Earnings: Analysts on average expect Intel to report standard earnings of 67 cents a share, which would rise to 75 cents a share after adjustments, according to FactSet. Contributors at Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, expect adjusted profit to be a bit higher, at 79 cents a share. Last year in the same quarter, Intel reported earnings of 74 cents a share. Revenue: Analysts polled by FactSet expect on average for Intel to report revenue of $15.75 billion for the quarter, up from $14.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Estimize contributors on average predict revenue of $15.84 billion, while Intel has predicted revenue would fall into a range of $15.2 billion to $16.2 billion. Read also: Intel buys stake in German digital-mapping company PC sales, which Intel calls the Client Computing Group, are expected to bring in more than half the total again in the fourth quarter, with FactSet analysts’ average estimate landing on $8.55 billion. The Data Center Group, which sells server parts, is forecast to bring in $4.79 billion, with Internet of Things adding $704 million and memory sales contributing $674 million. Intel Security, which is in the middle of its own renovations, is predicted by analysts to report $544 million in revenue. Stock reaction: Intel stock has fallen in the trading session following its earnings report in three of the past four quarters, including a 9.1% decline after its fourth-quarter report a year ago. Overall, Intel has slightly outperformed the market, with gains of 8.3% in the past three months and 26.3% in the past year, through Wednesday’s session; the S&P 500 index has gained 7.4% and 20.5% in the same time periods, respectively. Of the 39 analysts tracked by FactSet, 25 rate Intel the equivalent of a buy, while three rate the stock as a sell and 11 as a hold. The average price target on the stock is $40.09, implying a potential return of 6.1% from Wednesday’s closing price of $37.80. What to look for: Optimism for Intel’s PC business stems from estimates that say the holiday shopping season was a bounceback for the industry, which has struggled as consumers have waited longer to replace laptops or desktop computers and pushed their electronics budgets toward smartphones and other gadgets. Gartner and IDC, which track sales of PCs, noted that sales declined from last year, but the decline was much smaller than in years past and better than they originally expected. “Supply-chain conversations continue to indicate that upside was likely driven by strength in North America, the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, and improving corporate PC demand,” Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell wrote in a preview of Intel’s earnings this week. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multibillion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. Analysts don’t expect PCs to be a big winner for Intel moving forward, though, and will be looking for stronger performance or projections for other groups. “While an improving PC market is a positive for Intel, we remain conservative on the sustainability of this dynamic and reiterate that our positive view is based on strength in its core areas” of data centers, Internet of Things and memory chips, wrote Deutsch Bank analyst Ross Seymore, who has a buy rating and $42 price target on the stock. Intel server chips for data centers, which power the cloud-computing environments increasingly used by companies, will likely be the biggest focus. Sales in the fourth quarter may not move the needle, but Intel’s forecast for the year could give a hint at expectations for a new server platform called Purley, that the chip maker is expected to launch in the second quarter. “We expect the Purley upgrade cycle to reinvigorate [Data Center Group] growth starting mid-2017,” wrote McConnell, who has a buy rating and $43 price target for Intel stock.

The investigation will also cover leaks of classified information held by the intelligence community, according to a joint statement from Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif. President Donald Trump said he planned to ask congressional intelligence committees to investigate those leaks in a tweet prior to his inauguration. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., previously pledged to investigate possible links between Russian officials and the Trump campaign, which were alleged in an unverified report created by a former British spy. Nunes had not previously made that commitment. House investigators also want to review documentation from intelligence agencies’ investigations at the committee’s Capitol Hill offices rather than at the agencies, according to the joint statement from Schiff and Nunes, a demand that could cause friction with intelligence leaders. “This issue is not about party, but about country,” the statement reads. “The committee will continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead.” Schiff renewed a call earlier Wednesday for a 9/11 Commission-style independent review into Russian government-backed election meddling at an event sponsored by the Center for American Progress. Congressional Republicans, who have declined to endorse such a commission so far, will come around eventually, Schiff argued. “My GOP colleagues are not at the point, apart from [Sens. John] McCain and [Lindsey] Graham, of willingness to confront the president,” Schiff said. “That will only last so long … I think, after a suitable honeymoon period, there will be some Republicans who will find their voice and express alarm at our playing any kind of a supporting role to the Russian propagation of autocracy around the world.” Schiff and other Democrats, including Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., have been ramping up pressure on Republican colleagues to break with Trump on the election hacking since he took office. Trump denied for many months that Russia was responsible for breaches at the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign that later leaked at WikiLeaks and elsewhere. Trump acknowledged the Russian attribution in a press conference after his election but conflated the breach with other nation-state-backed hacks, especially the allegedly China-linked breach of sensitive security clearance documents about more than 20 million current and former federal employees and their families at the Office of Personnel Management. Schiff criticized that conflation Wednesday, saying it plays into the hands of adversary nations that wish to conflate different types of malicious cyber activity. U.S. intelligence officials have long argued traditional spying for national security reasons such as the OPM breach—and which the U.S. also engages in—should be separated from influence operations such as the DNC email releases or commercial espionage such as Chinese theft of companies’ intellectual property and trade secrets. Schiff also criticized Trump for making numerous allegations without evidence since his election, including unverified allegations that millions voted illegally during the 2016 election. Such allegations will severely damage the president’s credibility if and when he needs to make a case to the American people and allies based on classified intelligence, he said. “Our new president is doing deep damage to himself and to our country,” Schiff said. “He’s doing it in his willingness to make up facts as he goes along.” Also on Wednesday, Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Chris Coons, D-Del., introduced legislation establishing a Senate Select Committee on Cybersecurity whose jurisdiction would extend far beyond the Russian election hacking investigation. The committee would oversee all cybersecurity and cyberspace issues, which are currently split among numerous committees and subcommittees, especially the Senate Intelligence, Homeland Security, Armed Services and Commerce committees. The committee would be composed of the chairs and ranking members of those committees plus the Senate Appropriations, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees along with five additional members chosen by Senate leadership, Gardner and Coons said. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Software vulnerability A Single Message Can Make Some Samsung Galaxy Phones Reboot Forever See threatwatch report ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 25, 2017 at 3:41PM Image source: Apple. "Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands. And your plan is to blackmail this person?" -- Lucius Fox, The Dark Knight In Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), an accountant discovers Batman's true identity by uncovering some accounting irregularities at Wayne Enterprises, but imaginary CEO Lucius Fox quickly puts an end to the blackmailer's plan by pointing out how absurd it is. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) may not have been blackmailing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all these years, but Apple thinks Qualcomm is guilty of a similar crime: extortion. In its U.S. lawsuit filed last week, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "attempted to extort Apple" into changing how it responded to a regulatory antitrust investigation in South Korea. The iPhone maker also argues that it has been paying "extortion-level royalties" for years, due to Qualcomm's "no license, no chips" policy where Qualcomm would only sell chips to customers that agreed to onerous licensing terms. It seems as if Qualcomm has been getting away with this for years, which is why its market power has grown so dramatically as rivals fell by the wayside and exited the baseband processor market. Most customers lack the operating scale, legal resources, and financial incentive to effectively stand up to Qualcomm through protracted litigation. Apple doesn't. Apple bites back So let me get this straight, Qualcomm: You think that your biggest customer, one of the wealthiest, most powerful corporations in the world that also has a reputation for squeezing its suppliers would quietly accept your oppressive contract terms and never fight back. And your plan is to extort this company? In no uncertain terms, it worked for many years, and Qualcomm's revenue skyrocketed over the past decade. QCOM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Broader smartphone adoption was the main factor, but the iPhone pulled an awful lot of that weight, too -- both directly and indirectly (Android was created largely in response to the iPhone). More specifically, from 2011 to late 2016, Qualcomm had extracted both exclusivity in supplying Apple with cellular baseband modems as well as its silence. You may note in the chart above how much sales increased during this time period. Apple was restricted from actively complaining to law enforcement and regulators, although it was allowed to respond if asked. So long as Qualcomm maintained its lock on baseband chipsets, it had incredible leverage and there wasn't a whole lot Apple could do. Enter Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel had been trying to crack the baseband market for years with little to no success. Even today, Intel's modems are technologically inferior to Qualcomm's, but they're good enough and much cheaper, and Intel expects to catch up within a few generations. The combination of Qualcomm's exclusivity ending combined with Intel's ability to supply a sufficiently competitive modem is the perfect storm for Apple to unleash its pent-up discontent in court. The $1 billion that Qualcomm is withholding was just the final straw. Now that Apple has a path to an alternative supplier (even though the majority of its basebands still come from Qualcomm) and is no longer contractually obligated to keep quiet, Apple is bringing a brutal suit against Qualcomm that threatens Qualcomm's very business model. You know it's serious when Apple is litigating, given CEO Tim Cook's hatred of litigation. Did Qualcomm really think that Apple would never retaliate? The moral of the story: Don't extort Apple, and don't blackmail Batman. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

"The United States is the shining light of freedom, liberty, and prosperity to the world. We welcome all who are willing to work hard to achieve their American dream,” Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “A wall is the exact opposite of what America stands for." ADVERTISEMENT Trump signed two executive orders on immigration Wednesday, one calling for immediate construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and increased immigration enforcement, and the other for cooperation between local law enforcement officials and immigration authorities. "Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders, gets back its borders," Trump said at the Department of Homeland Security. The second order also called for withholding federal funds from "sanctuary" cities, municipalities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Thomas Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund warned that Trump’s orders would "undermine public safety" by alienating local law enforcement from immigrant communities. He also warned that the increased threat of deportation could force immigrants into hiding, disrupting the labor market. "Economic disruption to industries such as agriculture render these orders a threat to U.S. national security," Saenz said. “Stripping funding from cities like Las Vegas endangers the health and safety of all Nevadans and is a wrong-headed approach to a nuanced issue. Not all undocumented immigrants are ‘rapists’ and ‘criminals.’ I was once undocumented – now, I’m a member of Congress,” said freshman Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.). House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said cutting funding for sanctuary cities could damage local law enforcement, and he questioned how the Trump administration would choose which cities to target. "There is no legal definition of a sanctuary city," Hoyer pointed out. Democrats and activists lamented the appropriation of funds for the wall. The border wall would cost an estimated $8 billion to $25 billion. The executive order asked for the Department of Homeland Security to use any available funds to start construction, although Trump vowed that Mexico would reimburse the cost per his campaign promise. Mexican officials could not be reached for comment. “There's no indication whatsoever that the moderate Republicans would go along with the cost of the wall," said Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.). Democrats also railed against the effectiveness of a border wall, saying it would do little to limit immigration and would be prohibitively expensive to build. "As far as the wall is concerned, I suspect that a lot of Trump supporters would be just as happy with a big statue of a middle finger pointed south, because both are about equally effective as national security strategies," said Rep. Luis GutierrezLuis GutierrezDems: Wall is 'opposite of what America stands for' Dem boycotts of inauguration grow Puerto Rico's representative makes renewed push for statehood MORE (D-Ill.). The feasibility of the orders was also questioned, as Trump will need congressional approval to fully fund the announced actions. "It’s clear that many elements of what was announced today overreach the limits of executive authority and will require acquiescence from Congress," said Saenz. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said in an interview on MSNBC Wednesday that Republican leaders in Congress should be prepared to challenge Trump on construction of the wall, though he was not optimistic they would.

And that should give many people in this country, both Republicans and Democrats, and all Americans of good conscience, real pause," Castro added. On a call with reporters, Castro also warned that the wall could drive top trading partner Mexico away from the American sphere of influence. "President Trump's actions represent a hostility towards Mexico, one of our best friends and trading partners," he said. "He is driving Mexico into China’s hands." Hispanic leaders vowed to confront the policies through litigation and political action. "Remember, this is a bully and he will continue to bully us if we just continue to put down our heads and walk home," said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.). "The executive actions on immigration announced by President Trump today are simply un-American,” said César J. Blanco, political director of the Latino Victory Project. “President Trump’s executive actions go against the principles and values that our country was founded on and will only tear families apart."

Chris Foresman - Jul 3, 2012 9:10 pm UTC Sumitomo's distinctive black Thunderbolt cables aren't being sold directly in the US. Chris Foresman reader comments Share this story Intel's Thunderbolt high-speed interconnect has been shipping for over a year now, and new vendors have been announcing products compatible with the standard ever since. One sticking point, however, has been that Thunderbolt devices require an expensive $50 cable—only available from Apple until recently. And unfortunately, prices aren't coming down any time soon. While other vendors are now offering their own Thunderbolt cables, prices have mostly stayed the same—in fact, some have gone up. We found this surprising; typically more vendors offering competing products leads to lower prices. And as the high cable price represents a fairly high barrier to entry for Thunderbolt devices, it relegates the standard to niche, early-adopter territory. This isn't likely to change in the near future. Our research shows that for the rest of 2012, Thunderbolt cables are going to remain in the $45-60 price range. Prices aren't likely to drop noticeably until early 2013, when second-generation silicon for Thunderbolt's active cabling becomes available in production quantities. The current landscape Belkin, Elgato, and Kanex are some of the latest vendors offering Thunderbolt cables to work with a growing number of drives, docks, and other devices coming to market. But in many cases, the cables are more expensive than Apple's $50 cable. Kanex offers its own 2m cable for $60. Elgato, which recently released a portable Thunderbolt SSD, sells a 0.5m cable to go along with it, also $60. The only "cheaper" cable out there is a 1m branded one Belkin offers to go along with its upcoming Thunderbolt Express Dock for $45. Besides Apple, the only volume supplier of Thunderbolt cables currently seems to be Japanese electrical cable manufacturer Sumitomo. Intel has been using the distinctive black version of the cables in demonstrations throughout the year, including at CES and Computex. We found Sumitomo's cables available from Amazon Japan in sizes from 0.3m to 3m, for the equivalent of $48-$62. Its 2m cable, available in white or black, costs $56 (plus shipping from Japan). A Sumitomo representative told Ars that the company has no plans to retail its cables in the US; instead, it is partnering with local vendors to brand and distribute the cables. The Elgato and Belkin cables appear to be made by Sumitomo, though neither company would confirm that to us. Kanex's cable appears to be manufactured by another OEM. Change in motion All these cables have one thing in common, according to John Mitchell, marketing manager for signal processing chip maker Intersil. "All of them are based on the Gennum transceiver, what we call first-gen cable," Mitchell explained. That transceiver—now manufactured by Semtech, which acquired Gennum in March—is the same one used in Apple's cable. The Semtech (née Gennum) Thunderbolt transceiver used in Apple's Thunderbolt cable iFixit The chip is built using silicon germanium, "an expensive semiconductor process typically used for telecom applications," Mitchell told Ars. It's likely that Intel and Apple chose the Semtech part because it was either an already existing part that fit the requirements for Thunderbolt's high 10Gbps bi-directional data rate, or Semtech had something similar that was easily adaptable. In addition to the transceiver, the current reference design also requires a separate microcontroller, as well as power management and voltage regulation chips to deliver the 3V data signals and 15V optional power supply for bus-powered devices. Essentially, there are four integrated circuits (IC) at either end of a Thunderbolt cable. "Active cables need clock and data recovery chips on either end, even for optical cables," Mitchell said. "This makes Thunderbolt very robust—signal is cleaned up by the cable, even if a device is 'noisy.'" Combined with relatively high-quality copper cable, Thunderbolt quickly becomes rather expensive equipment. For comparison, passive cables (such as those used for HDMI or USB) cost under $10 for a 2m cable. But Mitchell said that his company has a solution to the problem currently in the pipeline and set to ship in volume in the latter part of this year. What Intersil calls an "Active Cable IC Solution for Thunderbolt Technology" appears to be the only complete turnkey solution we could find among manufacturers selling ICs for Thunderbolt. It combines the microcontroller and transceiver into a single signal processing chip, and combines power management and voltage regulators into a single power management chip. This cuts the number of required ICs from four to two. Enlarge / Intersil's active Thunderbolt cable solution reduces the number of necessary ICs from four to two. Intersil The chips are manufactured on a lower cost, 40nm CMOS process, improving yields and lowering costs significantly. The 40nm process also dissipates less heat, reducing the need for bulky heat sinking within the cable plug. The chipset also uses Intersil's patented "cable compensation" techniques, which account for signal skew and dispersion within the copper conductors. "We've been designing around these problems for data center applications, by using advanced equalization and cable impairment correction," Mitchell said. Bringing the technology to Thunderbolt will allow cable manufacturers to use a lower-grade cable while still maintaining 10Gbps throughput. In addition to these improvements, Intersil's chipset includes features like integrated error-rate testers and switching loopbacks, all designed to aid in automated testing. "These features help cable assemblers test the cables during the manufacturing process, streamlining the workflow," Mitchell said. "Our solution is half the chips, half the size, uses half the power, and cheaper conductors can be used. By the end of the year, cables will be less expensive." That news bodes well for the Thunderbolt ecosystem, which will begin expanding this year as a new wave of Thunderbolt-equipped Macs and PCs work their way into consumers' hands. "It's pretty much been an Apple thing with a few drives," Mitchell told Ars of the current landscape. "But with Ivy Bridge and Intel's new Thunderbolt controllers, the rest of this year is going be very interesting."

(I mostly blame Apple for this, as they released their first TB Macs around the same time everybody else introduced USB 3.) Thunderbolt is basically an external PCIe bus, it's needlessly overkill for many uses that USB 3 will do just fine (and with plain inexpensive cables!), but very useful for others, like external docks or GPUs, where USB 3 is not low-level enough. 547 posts | registered Nov 17, 2009 dlux | Ars Tribunus Angusticlavius jump to post For anyone wondering why these higher-speed interfaces seem needlessly complex, look through this pictorial and read the captions (also zoom the images for a higher-res version): http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestor ... 10gbe.html Now that's for 10G Ethernet, not Thunderbolt, but a lot of the electrical challenges still apply when transmitting data outside of the device in a sometimes-hostile environment. (Also, that article also addresses some of the work needed to refine successive generations of a given interconnect. The original single-port 10G card consumed 25 watts, and that was just at one end of the cable. A single 10G Ethernet channel meant 50W of power end-to-end, and if you have multiple hundreds of those in a data center you can do the math...)

Digital Realty Signals the Gloves are Coming Off in 2017 Previous Article Microsoft Backs Away from Manager’s Comment on Post-Brexit Data Center Plans Next Article Encryption Key to Compliance Requirements as Companies Move to Cloud SPONSORED Sponsored: Overcoming Key Data Center Challenges with Converged Infrastructure by Bill Kleyman  on January 25, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Sponsored by: Dell and Intel   Converged systems are powerful platforms with their built-in automation, high-density architecture, and high-performance chassis. They enable organizations to architect a very robust cloud and storage environment with the goal of creating unparalleled density and allowing for resources to be delivered as effectively as possible. The big benefits behind converged infrastructure (CI) are huge driving factors around the adoption boom that we’re already experiencing. According to the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker, the global revenue in this category grew 8.5% year over year to $3.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q15). The market generated 1,547 petabytes of new storage capacity shipments during the quarter, an increase of 26.9% from the same time last year. For the full year 2015, the revenue jumped 8.3% to $10.6 billion when compared to 2014. “We are seeing some of the market demand move into deals with lower average selling prices (ASPs), which is driving a shift from traditional converged systems to hyperconverged systems,” said Kevin M. Permenter, IDC’s senior research analyst, in a press statement. “Right now, most of the growth is coming from the mid-market, which is heavily skewed toward hyperconverged systems. We are expecting to see this trend continue into the near term.” To get the complete picture, add the findings of a recent Data Center Trends Survey sponsored by Dell EMC and Intel, which indicates some of the biggest challenges facing organizations as they into 2017. They include: Security: 67% Centralizing Resources and Improved Efficiency: 43% Supporting Cloud: 40% To overcome these challenges and concerns, converged infrastructure solutions aim to revolutionize the way organizations deploy data center solutions. In working with converged infrastructure (CI), it’s important to see exactly where this type of platform can help your business. Consider the following: Ease of Deployment. Modern converged infrastructure systems are pre-validated environments deployed as building blocks into a data center. This means no more guessing or spending more than required on data center solutions. Furthermore, there is a direct reduction of risk in deployed validated designs. Today’s CI architectures allow organizations to size their workloads around specific validated converged infrastructure deployments. For example, you can size around big data, virtualization, VDI, databases, and even disaster recovery. Disaster Recovery Strategies. A big challenge in creating a good DR strategy was the architecture of secondary systems. In working with converged infrastructure, you can size the right type of data center based on your specific SLA requirements. You can design a platform capable of handling 100% of the primary, or, as much as the business requires. The good part here is that direct integration with the management and virtualization layer allows for even easier failover capabilities. This allows organizations to plan their disaster recovery strategies and size them out appropriately. Furthermore, this will help organizations control costs when deploying DR strategy. Improved Management. Traditionally, data center admins would rely on third party systems or other kinds of controls to manage a heterogenous infrastructure. Now, with CI, you have all core resources under one engine; and management is simplified dramatically. This means administrators have better ways to control how resources are allocated to virtual machines, how specific user groups can be optimized, and even where compliance and regulation-bound workloads are being housed. Furthermore, there is better integration with the underlying hypervisor via management plugins for even further control capabilities. Using Converged Infrastructure to Improve Security. Your ability to segment traffic, virtual workloads, and entire network using CI is pretty powerful. The centralization of core resources creates fewer management points and simplifies the control of data. You can create powerful resource silos around pieces of data that can’t leave specific servers or even storage repositories. Or, you can enforce access policies around very specific network segments all living on the CI architecture.  Converged infrastructure aims to simplify the way you manage critical resources, deliver key applications, and support an evolving user. To create powerful business benefits and strategic IT economics, it’s absolutely important to ensure that your deployment technology has a strong use-case. In the case of converged infrastructure – there are numerous ways that this platform can support growing business demands. This revolves around supporting new kinds of users, greater levels of virtualization, and even new technologies like containers. Most of all – a good CI deployment will give the business an easy way to scale and evolve with new market demands.

(AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Options activity provides a look at expectations on AAPL, FB and FCX By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 25, 2017, 9:09 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earnings Bank of America Corp’s (BAC) Irrational Exuberance Will End Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Going to Record Highs! Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings View All Posts U.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, as corporate earnings continue to bolster sentiment on Wall Street. What’s more, the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be poised to challenge the 20,000 level today, especially if earnings from blue-chip members United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) and Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) come in strong this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.33%, with S&P 500 futures up 0.32% and Nasdaq-100 futures rallying 0.43%. On the options front, Tuesday’s volume came back strong from Monday’s lackluster performance. Overall, the roughly 17.5 million calls and 14.8 million puts traded put a bullish spin on the day’s activity. Bullish activity wasn’t quite as pronounced on the CBOE, however, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped slightly to 0.65. The 10-day moving average banked its fifth session in a row at 0.65. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remained pinned to the $120 region after Barclays downgraded the shares on excessive hype surrounding the iPhone 8 “supercycle.” Meanwhile, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) continues to see call volume come in light heading into next week’s earnings report, and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) and other miners attracted a sizable bullish bid after President Trump signed several executive orders to help increase infrastructure spending. Apple Inc. (AAPL) In a note to clients on Tuesday, Barclays said that it does not see any “meaningful upside potential” for AAPL stock. The brokerage firm also downgraded Apple to “overweight” from “equal weight” and cut its price target to $117 from $119. Barclays noted that the so-called “supercycle” — where iPhone 6 and 7 users upgrade to the supposedly much improved iPhone 8 — has been overplayed and will not deliver the results many investors are hoping for as customers increasingly mix down to the iPhone 6S and 7S models. AAPL options activity took a noticeable hit on Tuesday following the downgrade. Call option volume had been trending in the 66th to 67th percentile of daily total volume, but managed to only garner 60% of the more than 498,000 contracts traded yesterday. Still, this one blip hasn’t been enough to shake overall sentiment on AAPL, with the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio falling over the past couple of weeks to rest at 0.76. The current upside earnings target in the 3 Feb series remains $120 with 19,000 contracts, though the $125 has amassed more than 10,000 contracts, and OI is rising.

Enclustra’s SODIMM-style Mars XU3 and larger Mercury+ XU1 computer-on-modules run Linux on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. They follow Enclustra’s announcement earlier this month of a Linux-friendly Mercury+ AA1 COM running on an Intel/Altera Arria 10 ARM/FPGA hybrid. Enclustra offers several SODIMM-style Mars and larger Mercury COMs equipped with Altera and Xilinx FPGAs or FPGA/ARM hybrid SoCs, including the Altera Cyclone V based Mercury SA1. Mars XU3 (left) and Mercury+ XU1 (click images to enlarge) Xilinx announced the quad-core Cortex-A53 Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC EG hybrid ARM/FPGA SoC in early 2015 as a follow-on to its popular Zynq-7000 line of Cortex-A9/FPGA SoCs. The UltraScale+ EG reached production shortly before the company’s June announcement of a dual-core CG version. The Mars XU3 and Mercury+ XU1 modules follow two other recently released Zynq UltraScale+ EG COMs. In 2016, Trenz launched a 76 x 52mm TE0808 UltraSOM+ COM, and Iveia launched an 85.7 x 54.0mm Atlas-II-Z8, both of which support Linux. Iveia is also prepping an Atlas-III-Z8 model, which offers two additional banks of I/O. Trenz TE0808 UltraSOM+ (left) and Iveia Atlas-II-Z8 (click images to enlarge) Like the Arria 10-based Mercury+ AA1, the new Mars XU3 and Mercury+ XU1 are available in commercial and industrial (-40 to 85°C) temperature versions, and can be purchased with baseboards. They are similarly available with Linux BSPs from Ant Micro, while the Mars XU3 also offers Android and eCos BSPs from the same source. VxWorks is also supported. Like the Mercury+ AA1, the UltraScale+ modules are aimed at embedded computing, data acquisition, high-speed communications, digital signal processing, image processing, and drive/motion control. They are similarly available with an optional Universal Drive Controller IP Core that avoids the “need for an extra drive controller chip that would consume precious PCB space and unnecessarily extend the project BOM,” says Enclustra. The Swiss manufacturer is also working on a 56 × 54mm Mercury XU5 module equipped with the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, but it appears to be farther away from production. The feature set is fairly similar to that of the other two modules. Xilinx’s 16nm FinFET fabricated Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC competes directly with the Intel/Altera Stratix 10. It features a faster, 1.5GHz quad-core CPU, and more powerful Mali-400 MP2 GPU and FPGA compared to the Zynq-7000. Depending on the FPGA level chosen, the UltraScale+ EG ranges from 103K to 1,143K logic cells, 94 to 1,045 flip-flops, and 47 to 523 LUTs. There are also non-MPSoC versions without the ARM block. Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC block diagram (click image to enlarge) The UltraScale+ adds two 600MHz Cortex-R5 MCUs with vector FPUs and memory protection units for improved real-time processing. Options include an H.265/264 video codec and a DSP.   Mars XU3 Enclustra’s SODIMM-style, 67.6 × 30.0mm Mars XU3 module is available in four SKUS that mix and match 1GB and 2GB DDR4 RAM with 0 to 70°C and -40 to 85°C support. Users can load up to 4GB of DDR4 on their own, and 64MB QSPI and 4GB eMMC flash are standard. The 3.3V module has an onboard GbE controller. Mars XU3 block diagram (click image to enlarge) The block diagram shows dual USB 2.0 PHYs, but the product page also mentions USB 3.0 support. Interfaces include 108x user I/Os, including 52x 1.8V system, 18x 3.3V system, and 24x FPGA interfaces. Other features include a PCIe Gen x4 (4 MGTs) interface, JTAG, I2C, 4x LEDs, and an RTC.   Mercury+ XU1 The Mercury+ XU1 is available with more extensive documentation than the Mars XU3. The 74 × 54mm module backs up its Zynq Ultrascale+ with up to 8GB DDR4 with 19.2 GByte/sec memory bandwidth. SKUs include two -40 to 85°C versions with 2GB RAM, and a 0 to 85°C model with 4GB RAM. The modules also offer set allotments of 64MB QSPI flash and 8GB eMMC flash. Mercury+ XU1, front and back (click images to enlarge) The Mercury+ XU1 embeds 2x GbE controllers and an RTC, and offers a variety of ARM- and FPGA-linked I/O via 3x 168-pin Hirose FX10 connectors. The module supports 2x USB 3.0, as well as USB 2.0 host and OTG ports. Mercury+ XU1 block diagram (click image to enlarge) A PCIe Gen2 x4 interface is onboard, along with 16x 6/8/12.5Gbps MGTs. A total of 294x user I/Os include 14x ARM peripherals, 80x MGTs, and 200x FPGA interfaces. The Mercury+ XU1 runs on 5-15V power, and is touted for low power consumption due to its high-efficiency DC/DC converters.   Enclustra carrier boards Each of the Enclustra COMs supports different carrier boards. The Mars XU3 offers a choice of two 120 × 80mm Pico-ITX boards: a basic Mars EB1 and a more FPGA-oriented Mars PM3. Both boards are available in commercial or extended (-25 to 85°C) models, and start at $268 in single units. Mars EB1 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Mars EB1 baseboard is equipped with a microSD slot, Ethernet port, a USB 2.0 port, and 4x micro-USB 2.0 device ports. There’s also an HDMI 1.3 port and dual “mini camera links,” says Enclustra. Other features include a 40-pin expansion header, and other headers, buttons, and LEDs. You can power up via a 5-15V input or micro-USB. Mars PM3 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Mars PM3 Pico-ITX carrier advances to a GbE port and a USB 3.0 Cypress EZ-USB FX3 device controller with Slave-FIFO interface. There are also USB 2.0 host. micro-USB 2.0, mini-HDMI, and SD connections. The board offers more connectors for FPGA interfaces, including 72-pin FMC low pin count connector and optional 40-pin I/O header. Mercury+ PE1 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Mercury+ XU1 module is available with a larger, 160 × 111.2mm Mercury+ PE1-300/400 carrier board. The board is equipped with dual GbE ports, USB 3.0 device, micro-USB 2.0 device, and 4x USB 2.0 host ports. A microSD slot and an option for additional eMMC flash are also available. The Mercury+ PE1 board features a PCIe Gen2 x4 interface with miniPCIe and mSATA slots and an optional SIM card holder. The PEI-400 model has 2× FMC LPC connectors while the PEI-300 instead has a single FMC HPC connector. Dual 40-pin and dual 12-pin Pmod headers are also available. The board has a 5-12V supply.   Further information The Mars XU3 module will be available starting at $157, tiering down to $112 in 10K+ volume for the 1GB commercial range SKU. The Mercury+ XU3 will start at $800 with 2GB RAM, dropping down to $520 at 10K. No availability dates were listed. More information may be found on Enclustra’s Mars XU3 and Mercury+ XU1 product pages.   Related posts: Linux ready COM taps FPGA/ARM Arria 10 SoC Xilinx adds dual core Cortex-A53/FPGA Zynq SoC model 16nm Zynq SoC mixes Cortex-A53, FPGA, Cortex-R5 ARM/FPGA module runs Linux on Arria 10 SoC Intel's ARM/FPGA Stratix 10 SoC is first 14nm FPGA Zynq-based SBC runs Linux, offers FPGA-based I/O Stackable SBC sandwich runs Linux on ARM/FPGA Zynq SoC OpenAMP heterogeneous multicore standard targets Linux Linux-driven COM/carrier offers mid-range Zynq Linux-ready modules support range of Xilinx FPGAs (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

(ROK) Zacks Investment Research Lowers Symantec Corporation (SYMC) to Sell January 25th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Tyrone Williams Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) from a buy rating to a sell rating in a report released on Friday. According to Zacks, “Cybersecurity firm Symantec faces increased competition from the likes of Intel and Microsoft. Also, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with uncertainty over PC sales remain headwinds. Moreover, changing customer spending behavior makes us pretty skeptical about Symantec’s near-term performance. However, the sale of the Veritas business provided Symantec with the financial flexibility to take the acquisition route to transform its struggling business. We believe that the acquisitions will enable Symantec to strengthen its position in the enterprise security market. Notably, the company has outperformed the broader market over a period of one year.” SYMC has been the subject of several other reports. Bank of America Corporation set a $18.00 price objective on shares of Symantec Corporation and gave the company a sell rating in a report on Sunday, November 6th.

BTIG Research reissued a buy rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of Symantec Corporation in a report on Monday, October 31st. Finally, Oppenheimer Holdings, Inc. reissued an outperform rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of Symantec Corporation in a report on Friday, December 16th. Two investment analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, ten have assigned a hold rating and twelve have assigned a buy rating to the stock.

Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, though it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of experts and employees say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making early progress, Intel admits there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place elsewhere, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top jobs. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, which makes tech jewelry for women, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," "dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged."

Can RBC change that? Jan 25, 2017 Adrian Lee   0 (Eduardo Lima/ Canadian Press) This story originally appeared at Maclean’s. These days, deep learning is all the rage. Tech’s biggest players, from Intel to Amazon, are betting big on the artificial intelligence technique modelled after the instincts of the human brain, with its ability to read patterns, sense rules, and make the best decision accordingly. Not long ago, Google spent more than $400 million to buy industry-leading startup DeepMind, and scored a major tech and marketing coup when the computer AlphaGo defeated grandmaster Lee Sedol at the possibility-lush game of Go—an achievement hundreds of times more complex than when Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess. Deep learning is being touted as a way forward for climate science, medicine and genomics; it’s already embedded in the way you search for something online, when you Google image search for, say, “cat,” and feline photos come up as a result of AI learning of what “cat” means. But it wasn’t always the popular kid in the block. In its early days in the 1980s, deep learning’s mostly Canadian pioneers—in particular, the trio of Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun, who worked largely out of an institute in Toronto—were dismissed as foolish apostates. “At the time, it didn’t solve big practical AI problems, it didn’t replace the existing technology,” said Hinton, considered the godfather of deep learning, in a 2016 interview with Maclean’s. But when computing power started to advance at an incredible rate, deep learning’s potential for AI was unlocked, turning huge piles of data into artificial intelligence that could, effectively, learn like our brain. Five Canadian tech leaders on what they're most excited for in 2017 Canada, though, hasn’t enjoyed much benefit for being an early adopter on the forefront of this technology. American companies have mostly picked the cupboard clean: Hinton now works with Google, LeCun leads Facebook’s AI research lab, and Bengio is an adviser with IBM, whose work out of the University of Montreal has earned significant funding from Google and beyond. Even Hinton has acknowledged this is cause for concern, in a recent Globe and Mail commentary written with other leading deep-learning experts: “There is one solution that will help keep the best minds in Canada, solve the current and future talent gap for domestic businesses, lure investment from foreign data-rich companies, and ensure Canada leads future AI breakthroughs: We must build a world-leading AI Institute in Toronto.” So it’s not insignificant that the Royal Bank of Canada’s Research in Deep Learning division—still shiny from its launch just seven months ago—has acquired the services of a big name in the field, adding Richard Sutton to its roster. Sutton wrote the book on the field of reinforcement learning, a technique which allows AI to teach itself what the best actions are using a reward-punishment system of its own, an area of deep learning that played a role in the success of DeepMind’s AlphaGo project. He will advise the group, currently based out of the University of Toronto, and also collaborate with RBC’s second AI research lab, which will be in Edmonton. “A lot of the development in deep learning came out of Canadian universities, yet the industry wasn’t positioned well enough to capitalize on that innovation, so we’ve lost a lot of people to south of the border,” said Foteini Agrafioti, who leads RBC’s deep-learning division. “That’s something we feel, as the biggest company in the country, we have the responsibility to invest in.” Venture capital funding is rushing into machine learning startups While Sutton is certainly not a household name, he is a major figure in deep learning, and a significant addition for a Canadian company nonetheless. Without a central hub for academics to branch out on their work in Canada, deep learning’s southbound pioneers served as pied pipers, bringing their students with them, creating a brain drain. Banking, too, seems to have plenty to offer deep-learning experts—in particular, rich historical data sets from decades of business. “The backbone of machine learning is data sets, and without that you’re really handcuffed. The bank has really interesting data sets from decades of market data that can be used to solve open problems right now,” says Agrafioti. Banking also offers some tantalizing practical applications for deep-learning innovators, too; of the three possibilities listed by Agrafioti—personalized AI-driven customer service, real-time fraud prevention and risk management—it’s the last one that might appeal most to those interested in industry disruption. Deep learning’s use of patterns to predict future activity appears to have tremendous potential for stock brokers, investment bankers, and asset managers—to assist them, at least for now. (For the record, Agrafioti demurs about the potential automation of those positions, rightly noting that there is no industry consensus on whether AI can ever truly become as or more powerful than the human brain.) It is, however, unclear if Canada’s banks—collectively the country’s largest companies—could reverse the tide of expertise migrating southward on their own. While the price tag of RBC’s investment in this lab is unclear, beyond Agrafioti’s cited cost of “tens of millions of dollars over the coming years,” Canada’s banks are unlikely to be able to match the dollar figures splashed around by companies like Tesla, which invested US$1 billion into Open AI in 2015. Canada’s Big Six banks themselves are less likely to feel the need to innovate, insulated as they are against the competitive agitation of fintech companies by their market position and regulatory balustrade, and cognizant that Canada’s venture capitalism industry—usually the fuel for fintech—is far less fulsome than America’s. For these comfortable behemoth banks, the innovation stakes aren’t as high, a fact that Agrafioti acknowledges: “Our rate of adoption is, of course, not as fast as some tech companies.” Robots will mostly take over the jobs humans hate doing anyway Still, RBC deserves credit for at least pushing to develop more homegrown research. Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Bank of Montreal were not able to respond at press time to requests for details about their own research into deep learning. (Scotiabank did, however, start a “digital factory” in 2015, which professed to partner with fintech startups to develop new technologies, and gifted the University of Toronto with $1.75 million to study “disruptive technologies,” while several big-bank CEOs acknowledged that AI needed to be harnessed within the industry at a recent conference.) But will it be enough to reverse the AI brain drain on its own? Surely not. The lure of money, vast data sets, and powerful computing in Silicon Valley remains a powerful pull for those at the peak of their profession. But if Canadian companies can learn anything from deep learning, it’s to take lessons from the patterns of the past—struggles to innovate, and an inability to keep our best talent here—and project the right way forward in the future. And where better to start, than with the large data sets at the fingertips of our powerful banks?

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. The industry is trying Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. Why it matters Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” Into the pipeline Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. When the culture doesn’t fit Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. Making change happen Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” The Associated Press Story Archive LEAVE A COMMENT Leave a Reply Cancel reply Discussion | 1 comment The Daily Republic does not necessarily condone the comments here, nor does it review every post.

In addition to major external design changes on the phone, there are rumors that internal features of the phone will also get overhauled. Now, a new report seems to suggest that the iPhone 8 will be sporting 5G wireless modules as well. According to Digitimes, wireless module vendors are set to start production of 5G wireless modules before the second half of 2017. At the moment, Intel and Qualcomm are one of the biggest producers of wireless modems for mobile applications. The two companies are also the ones responsible for supplying Apple with the wireless modules found on the iPhone. There is a chance that these 5G wireless modules will coincide with the release of the new flagship from Apple. According to the same report, Intel and Qualcomm will start releasing 5G wireless chips by the second half of 2017. If this happens, Apple might consider using the said chips on the iPhone 8 as tests on the system are already in place. Current iPhone 7 Plus line up (via apple.com) Although the business side of 5G networks will not start until 2018, AT&T has already started conducting 5G tests in its Austin offices. Last month, the telecom company announced that it has commenced the installation and testing of 5G wireless networks in Texas. At the moment, the test location is limited to its Austin offices. The new 5G wireless network boasts data transfer speeds of up to 14 Gbps. At this rate, 4K video streaming will be possible on mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad. In fact, this is the main selling point the of G5 wireless technology. It may be that the practical applications of the 5G chips will not be realized until early 2018. However, knowing Apple, there is a very strong chance that a 5G option will be available on the iPhone 8. Apple is quite known in implementing up and coming technologies like it did for the MacBook Pro. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Eurocom Tornado F5 SE mobile server can eat desktops for lunch by Wayne Manion  11:30 AM on January 20, 2017 Eurocom's Tornado F5 SE looks like a standard desktop replacement-style laptop that you might find on a shelf in a big box electronics store. However, its unassuming all-black chassis hides hardware that's fairly unique in portable systems, and the company believes these bits give it the leeway to call the F5 a "mobile server." The eye of the Tornado is a choice among three Intel Xeon E3 v5 four-core, eight-thread Skylake-based CPUs. The processor communicates with the system's parts through an Intel C236 server chipset, which is certainly uncommon in laptops. Eurocom offers nine different Nvidia GeForce and Quadro graphics options, from the base Quadro M1000M up to a Pascal-based M5000M with 8GB of VRAM. The machine has four SODIMM slots for taking in up to 64GB of DDR4. While Xeon E3 CPUs offer support for ECC memory, Eurocom doesn't appear to show it as on option for the Tornado. Storage configurations include a host of devices for populating the machine's pair of M.2 slots and single 2.5" drive bay. The Tornado may appear compact when compared to a 1U server chasis, but the 15.6" x 10.7" x 1.6" (39 cm x 27 cm x 4 cm) dimensions and 6.5 lb (2.92 kg) weight are fairly substantial compared to many other laptops. That bulk is necessary to pack all the desktop-class parts and the 15.6" screen, which is available in 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 flavors. The F5 is not left wanting for connectivity options. The machine can drive up to four displays including the integrated panel. Gigabit Ethernet comes by way of a Qualcomm solution, and buyers get to choose between five different Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules. The laptop has a single Thunderbolt 3 port and three USB 3.0 Type-A connectors. While the CPU, chipset, and graphics options certainly make the Tornado sound like a server-class system, the lack of ECC support in the memory options chips away at Eurocom's "mobile server" claim a bit—as does the company's description of the laptop's battery as an "integrated UPS." The Eurocom Tornado F5 SE can be custom-configured right away. Prices start at $2,000 without an operating system. Virtually every aspect of the machine can be customized to the buyer's performance requirements, so the upper bound on pricing is sky-high.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing Servers Workstations User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

(Jeff Scheid/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @jeffscheid By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Innovation has been and will continue to be the Governor’s Office of Economic Development’s top priority, Steve Hill told a crowd in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “Building an economy based on innovation is now critical,” Hill said to a crowd of about 1,900 at Cox Pavilion. Hill, who spearheads the governor’s economic development efforts, said it seems the speed of innovation is getting faster and faster. Hill moderated a panel devoted to innovation at Preview Las Vegas, the Metro Chamber of Commerce’s annual networking and forecasting event, with Brian Gaumer, director of test and development engineering at Hyperloop One, and Marcelina Ford, general manager of global programs and alliances at Intel Corp.’s Worldwide Corporate Affairs Group.   Gaumer said Hyperloop One is still on track to run a full test within the next few months at Apex in North Las Vegas, but he did not give a firm date. The test will be the first time the company will prove its technology and combine an autonomous vehicle with a linear motor, passive magnetic levitation and somewhat of an air vacuum using a tube. “Some of the technologies that we’re building into the DevLoop (development hyperloop) have been used in one way or another, but we are re-engineering them,” he said. “I wouldn’t be sitting here today if I didn’t believe it’s going to work.” Gaumer said speed is the name of the game, not just for the promise of the Hyperloop — which is slated to have cargo and passengers travel over 700 mph — but for running as a startup. Luckily, he joked that he is in the right city to get things done. “Contractors here are used to building unusual things very quickly,” he said. The exterior of the 500-kilometer tube that will be used in the full test is three-quarters completed, he said. “We’re starting to put hardware into the tube itself.” Ford spoke of the Internet of Things and how Intel is working to be a solutions provider for Smart Cities — cities that digitize things, like street lamps, in order to improve day-to-day operations like access to services or efficiency of transportation. Hill said the concept of smart cities is a “growing conversation here in Southern Nevada.” Ford said innovation of any kind is always deeply intertwined with workforce development and workforce participation. He said Intel is working to forge relationships with organizations and cities to further workforce training programs. “We’ll look forward to some of those partnerships here in Southern Nevada,” Ford also said. Hill emphasized that Southern Nevada needs to continue to advance and promote Nevada’s business and innovation-friendly environment to ensure that the state doesn’t fall behind. “Ccertainly if companies and industries don’t continue to innovate … they risk decline,” Hill said. “That is also true for regions and communities. We have been working over the past five or six years in order to drive the innovation in Southern Nevada.” Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

Over one third (35 per cent) of the 13,000 parents that took part in the “New Family Dynamics in a Connected World” study now take physical steps to control and monitor how their children use tablets, smartphone and computers. This usually entails taking overall charge of a device and only giving their child access to it at set times during the day. Nearly one in four parents (23 per cent) said that they use software to help monitor how their children are using devices. However, the majority of parents are also ensuring that digital devices don’t become the only entertainment or distraction in the children’s lives. Some 48 per cent of respondents across the 14 countries and four continents included in the study say that they limit screen time to one-to-two hours a day, and a further 20 per cent cap exposure at less than one hour a day. However, even with attempting to put rules in place, devices are already changing household habits and 76 per cent of parents now allow their children to take an internet-connected device to bed. And because the smartphone and the tablet have become so ingrained in daily life, parents admit that they’re struggling to lead by example. Over one third (36 per cent) said that their children have “called them out” because they’re using a device when they should be engaged with the family. And while parents are for the most part getting proactive when it comes to when devices are used, respondents are still very much concerned about how children use them. Four in five parents (80 per cent) are understandably concerned about their kids unintentionally interacting with digital predators or cybercriminals, and 85 per cent say that they have already had a structured discussion with their children about online risks and sensible digital behaviour. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Battle of the digital butlers: Alexa takes on Siri (VIDEO) Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice In move to Facebook, Barra leaves unfinished expansion at Xiaomi How fat do cameras make you look?

(AAPL) Will Hike App Store Prices … Because Brexit? Facebook Inc (FB), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Shouldn’t Fear European Ruling View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has been around for a very long time and it has been a mainstay in the technology industry, as well as one of the most recognized household names in consumer electronics since the late 1970s. INTC didn’t invent the computer, but it did develop a superior processor that was designed to be functional in almost any computer, regardless of who manufactured it. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr With that, over nearly four decades, Intel has grown into a $173 billion company, giving early INTC stock investors returns in excess of 30,000%. The company went on to manufacture a growing number of microprocessors and other types of computer chips, which today are found in countless pieces of electronic hardware. It would seem that Intel stock has dusted off the old playbook, unveiling the Compute Card two weeks ago at CES 2017. The Compute Card, according to an INTC Newsroom press release, is intended to “transform the way compute and connectivity can be integrated and used in future devices.” If things turn out as planned for Intel, the Compute Card has the potential to become another virtually universal component that can be integrated into a gigantic — and constantly expanding — selection of consumer electronics. The Next Web believes that the Compute Card may have the potential to “revolutionize consumer technology by making your old — but still functional — tech feel ‘new’ again.” The 10 Biggest Companies You’ve Never Heard Of INTC describes the Compute Card as “a full computer, including Intel SOC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity.” It is being designed as a modular component to be a universal fit for all future smart tech containing a standard slot. The concept is surprisingly simple, yet extremely powerful. Manufacturers of smart devices will be able to stave off obsolescence and extend the lifespan of devices by making key components (i.e., processors, RAM and storage) upgradable via a new Compute Card from Intel. So, rather than compete in the Internet of Things race by attempting to design competitive end-user consumer products, INTC management is maintaining its B2B approach with the Compute Card, leveraging Intel’s formidable silicon development resources and facilities. What Does This Mean for Intel Stock Investors? Even before the unveiling of the Intel Compute Card, INTC stock has always been a relatively safe bet for the technology portion of your investment portfolio. Over the last year, Intel stock is up more than 15%, and over the past five years, it’s up more than 40%. The fact that INTC stock pays a dividend that currently yields more than 2.8%, and has a 20-year CAGR of nearly 22%, makes it a logical choice. For years, we’ve been hearing about the Internet of Things, and how today’s technology behemoths have been preparing for a worldwide battle for digital dominance and “smart” devices. However, the battle has already begun, whether you realize it or not; it has just been more of a slow evolution than a catastrophic explosion in the tech industry. Intel’s major advantage over possible competitors in the machine-to-machine arena is it long list of global partners such as Dell, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), and Sharp Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SHCAY). In addition, Intel is working with a range of regional partners like Seneca Data, InFocus Corporation, Contec DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.

The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI (Frankfurt: 3HM.F - news) 's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index was boosted by strength in Asian and European shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. Early fourth-quarter earnings have boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news) data. "It is going to be so important to see these earnings come in at or above expectations," said Tim Dreiling, senior Portfolio Manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Kansas City. Tech giants Intel (Euronext: INCO.NX - news) , Alphabet (Xetra: ABEA.DE - news) , Microsoft (Euronext: MSF.NX - news) and coffee chain Starbucks (Hanover: SRB.HA - news) are scheduled to report results after market close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to 20,111.79, the S&P 500 lost 0.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,298.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.27 points, or 0.06 percent, to 5,659.61. Qualcomm (Swiss: QCOM-USD.SW - news) weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq (Frankfurt: 813516 - news) . The chipmaker fell 5.7 percent after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism. Johnson & Johnson's $30-billion deal to buy Actelion lifted shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 percent at 1,451.12. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks. "The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track," said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.47 percent at 100.5. The Mexican peso weakened after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet Trump next week after the U.S. president tweeted Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. The firmer U.S. dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback's climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold was down 0.95 percent to $1,188.8 an ounce. U.S. Treasury yields turned lower as solid investor demand at a $28 billion auction of seven-year government debt rekindled demand for the sector. Benchmark 10-year notes were up 4/32 in price to yield 2.510 percent, down from 2.523 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices jumped 2 percent, boosted by the ongoing rally in the U.S. stock market, although gains in crude futures were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories despite efforts by producers to cut output. Brent crude settled up $1.16, or 2.1 percent, at $56.24 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up $1.03, or 2 percent, at $53.78.

Among the panelists in this early morning session are (l-r) Eric Davis of LifeLock, Denelle Dixon-Thayer of Mozilla, Tony Aquila of Solera Holdings, Michelle Dennedy of Cisco, and Jules Polonetsky of the Future of Privacy Forum. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) By Queenie Wong | qwong@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 26, 2017 at 3:43 pm | UPDATED: January 27, 2017 at 3:12 am Troves of valuable data are flowing to your cars, virtual assistants, fitness trackers, social media accounts and even that robotic dog you might have picked up for your child at the toy store. It isn’t just your phone you have to worry about anymore, but are consumers, tech firms and governments doing enough to safeguard that information? On Thursday, tech executives and data privacy experts gathered at Twitter’s headquarters to share tips and discuss some of the challenges still facing companies as people’s lives become more digital. Like a smartphone, consumers should also wipe their personal data from their cars before they sell them, experts said. “Information has this big part in bringing us a safer, better world. But you, in using it, have to be responsible to care for your fingerprints,” said Tony Aquila, founder, chairman and CEO of Solera Holdings, a software company in Texas for automotive, home ownership and digital identity management. “We can define everything we want, but at the end of the day you’ve got to know how to wipe your fingerprints.” Organized by the National Cyber Security Alliance, the event was held days before Data Privacy Day, which occurs annually on Jan. 28 to celebrate the signing of the first legally binding international treaty for privacy and data protection. Executives from Cisco, Intel, Twitter and other tech companies provided their expertise in panel discussions throughout the day. Privacy is a consumer’s ability to control access to his or her personal information. It goes hand in hand with security. And both data and cybersecurity are increasingly on the minds of the public. About two-thirds of Americans are concerned about not knowing how their online personal information is used, according to the 2016 TRUSTe/National Cyber Security Alliance Privacy Index.

A Pew Research Center survey released on Thursday also revealed that 64 percent of adults in the United States have experienced a data breach or fraud. Nearly half of Americans also think their personal data have become less secure in recent years. Tech executives and experts say businesses have made progress in letting consumers know what is being done with their data, and they consider privacy when designing a new product. When you ask Amazon Echo’s Alexa if she’s spying on you, the virtual assistant tells you it only collects information locally and points consumers to the company’s privacy policy, said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington, D.C. think tank. Today, more companies are standing up to the government to protect their users. “That’s an incredible sea change that I think you didn’t see years ago,” he said. Still, there’s more work to do. “We need to make it easy for people. We need to create things based on principles and make sure we can actually put information before them so they can simply do these things or make sure that they know that they should ask the questions,” said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla’s chief business and legal officer. “I don’t believe we’ve done our part in that.” From a demo on connected toys to what startups should know about privacy, the event covered a wide range of issues in data privacy. Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum, speaks about privacy issues surrounding connected toys at a National Cyber Security Alliance gathering on Data Privacy Day in San Francisco, Calif., Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  But some of these questions don’t have straight or simple answers. For example, who owns the data that tech companies collect on student athletes who wear fitness trackers? “It’s contract specific … the companies have an incentive to own the data for many reasons, but everyone I talk to who is in the field and in the companies feel like the players should own their own data,” said Katrina Karkazis, senior research scholar for Stanford University’s Center for Biomedical Ethics. Karkazis said that she would like to see a wearables committee at every university. And tech companies recognize how valuable the data can be for hackers looking to exploit the information consumers share, or how dangerous it can be when an electronic device is compromised. In 2015, two security researchers hacked into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely disabling the car’s brakes and sending it into a ditch. Criminals can use information about driving patterns to figure out when a person is at home or away, Aquila said. “The car is still in the infotainment phase. Technology is being used to entertain you, to stimulate you,” he said. “But in reality, there is a whole bunch of information in there about you, where you go, where you’ve been, how you drive.” Tags:  Data Privacy Technology Twitter Queenie Wong Queenie Wong covers social media businesses, including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, for The Mercury News.

Among the panelists in this early morning session are (l-r) Eric Davis of LifeLock, Denelle Dixon-Thayer of Mozilla, Tony Aquila of Solera Holdings, Michelle Dennedy of Cisco, and Jules Polonetsky of the Future of Privacy Forum. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) By Queenie Wong | qwong@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 26, 2017 at 3:43 pm | UPDATED: January 27, 2017 at 3:12 am Troves of valuable data are flowing to your cars, virtual assistants, fitness trackers, social media accounts and even that robotic dog you might have picked up for your child at the toy store. It isn’t just your phone you have to worry about anymore, but are consumers, tech firms and governments doing enough to safeguard that information? On Thursday, tech executives and data privacy experts gathered at Twitter’s headquarters to share tips and discuss some of the challenges still facing companies as people’s lives become more digital. Like a smartphone, consumers should also wipe their personal data from their cars before they sell them, experts said. “Information has this big part in bringing us a safer, better world. But you, in using it, have to be responsible to care for your fingerprints,” said Tony Aquila, founder, chairman and CEO of Solera Holdings, a software company in Texas for automotive, home ownership and digital identity management. “We can define everything we want, but at the end of the day you’ve got to know how to wipe your fingerprints.” Organized by the National Cyber Security Alliance, the event was held days before Data Privacy Day, which occurs annually on Jan. 28 to celebrate the signing of the first legally binding international treaty for privacy and data protection. Executives from Cisco, Intel, Twitter and other tech companies provided their expertise in panel discussions throughout the day. Privacy is a consumer’s ability to control access to his or her personal information. It goes hand in hand with security. And both data and cybersecurity are increasingly on the minds of the public. About two-thirds of Americans are concerned about not knowing how their online personal information is used, according to the 2016 TRUSTe/National Cyber Security Alliance Privacy Index.

A Pew Research Center survey released on Thursday also revealed that 64 percent of adults in the United States have experienced a data breach or fraud. Nearly half of Americans also think their personal data have become less secure in recent years. Tech executives and experts say businesses have made progress in letting consumers know what is being done with their data, and they consider privacy when designing a new product. When you ask Amazon Echo’s Alexa if she’s spying on you, the virtual assistant tells you it only collects information locally and points consumers to the company’s privacy policy, said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington, D.C. think tank. Today, more companies are standing up to the government to protect their users. “That’s an incredible sea change that I think you didn’t see years ago,” he said. Still, there’s more work to do. “We need to make it easy for people. We need to create things based on principles and make sure we can actually put information before them so they can simply do these things or make sure that they know that they should ask the questions,” said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla’s chief business and legal officer. “I don’t believe we’ve done our part in that.” From a demo on connected toys to what startups should know about privacy, the event covered a wide range of issues in data privacy. Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum, speaks about privacy issues surrounding connected toys at a National Cyber Security Alliance gathering on Data Privacy Day in San Francisco, Calif., Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  But some of these questions don’t have straight or simple answers. For example, who owns the data that tech companies collect on student athletes who wear fitness trackers? “It’s contract specific … the companies have an incentive to own the data for many reasons, but everyone I talk to who is in the field and in the companies feel like the players should own their own data,” said Katrina Karkazis, senior research scholar for Stanford University’s Center for Biomedical Ethics. Karkazis said that she would like to see a wearables committee at every university. And tech companies recognize how valuable the data can be for hackers looking to exploit the information consumers share, or how dangerous it can be when an electronic device is compromised. In 2015, two security researchers hacked into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely disabling the car’s brakes and sending it into a ditch. Criminals can use information about driving patterns to figure out when a person is at home or away, Aquila said. “The car is still in the infotainment phase. Technology is being used to entertain you, to stimulate you,” he said. “But in reality, there is a whole bunch of information in there about you, where you go, where you’ve been, how you drive.” Tags:  Data Privacy Technology Twitter Queenie Wong Queenie Wong covers social media businesses, including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, for The Mercury News.

You get the Maingear R1 Razer Edition, a gorgeous desktop that combines the drool-worthy LED lighting of a Razer product with the powerful guts of a Maingear PC. With support for the latest Core i7 processors and dual Nvidia graphics cards, the R1 can be configured into the VR and 4K machine of your dreams. We just wish its lighting were as dynamic as that of Razer's own rainbow-emitting Chroma gadgets. Design Razer doesn't make its own desktop PCs, but the Maingear R1 Razer Edition would have you think otherwise. This all-black tower is dripping with the same sleek, subdued style as you'll find on Razer's laptops, with the company's signature snake logo stamped on the front and a steady neon-green glow oozing out of the bottom. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideWhile the outside of the PC screams Razer, the machine's insides are signature Maingear. The R1's fully transparent side panel gives way to the desktop's masterfully neat component layout, multiple graphics cards and an eye-catching liquid-cooling tube, all of which are set against slick, green LED lighting. I prefer the R1's look and feel to that of Lenovo's Razer Edition Y900 desktop, though Lenovo's PC has one big advantage: dynamic Chroma lighting. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideWhile our R1 glows a steady green, the Y900 RE's front lights can cycle through every color of the rainbow. This looks especially awesome when synced up to a Razer mouse and keyboard. Maingear says it will update the R1 to a Chroma-friendly chassis as soon as Razer provides one, but in the meantime, the Y900 has the advantage in the lighting department. As nice as the R1 is to look at, its 20.2 x 18.9 x 8.7-inch, 45-pound chassis will eat up a good chunk of your gaming area. The machine is roughly the same size as the Y900 RE and notably chunkier than Maingear's own, living-room-friendly Drift, though not nearly as colossal as high-end competitors such as the Origin PC Millennium. MORE: The Best Gaming Desktops Available Now Specs Starting Configuration Configuration Price $999 $3,307 Processor Intel Core i5-7500 Intel Core i7-7700K Graphics Card Nvidia GTX 1060 Nvidia GTX 1070 (X2) RAM 8GB 16GB Storage 1TB hard drive 512 GB SSD (X2), 2TB hard drive Ports and Upgradability The R1's key ports are within arms' reach on the top panel, where you'll find two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and headphone and mic jacks. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideIn the back, you'll find five USB 3.1 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a PS/2 port for older accessories, dual Ethernet jacks and a standard selection of audio inputs. As with many modern desktops, the R1 also packs a USB Type-C port for use with newer gadgets that support the standard. Getting inside the R1 is a breeze; you just need to remove a pair of hand screws in the back and slide the side panel off. From there, you can easily swap out RAM, and there are only a few screws keeping you from replacing the system's graphics cards and storage. Gaming and VR Performance Loaded with dual Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics cards, our R1 handled just about every big AAA game we threw at it without breaking a sweat. The desktop ran the gorgeous open-world racing of Forza Horizon 3 at 2560 x 1440 at upwards of 80 frames per second, sharp enough that I could admire the individual bushes in the distance and smooth enough that I could perform daring near-misses and stylish drifts. The game hovered near a still-playable 45 fps at 4K, though there were enough stutters to convince me to keep playing at 1440p. The PC ran our Rise of the Tomb Raider test (1080p at max settings) at a strong 80 fps, topping the Y900 (60 fps, single GTX 1080) as well as our 63-fps desktop average. Maingear's desktop did stumble to 30 fps at 4K with graphics maxed out, though we see similar numbers from a lot of powerful PCs at these settings. The R1 made quick work of the crowded open-world action of Grand Theft Auto V, netting a supersmooth 130 fps on our 1080p max-settings benchmark. That crushes the Y900's score (30 fps), as well as our 63-fps desktop average. Maingear's PC showed strong 4K performance, netting a 7,881 on the 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra test. That score is far ahead of showings by the Y900 (3,833) and Aurora (4,903), both of which pack a single GTX 1080, and crushes our 3,451 average. MORE: Our Favorite Gaming Keyboards The R1 is well-equipped for virtual reality, scoring a 10.9 on the SteamVR Performance Test. That's more than high enough for demanding VR experiences, Valve said, and is just barely behind our high score of 11, obtained from GTX 1080 machines such as the Aurora and Y900 RE. Overall Performance Packing an Intel Core i7-7700K processor with 16GB of RAM, our R1 breezed through my usual multitasking routine of bouncing among five Twitch streams while running a system scan and downloading a game on Steam. The R1 scored a 20,244 on the Geekbench 4 overall performance test, topping showings by our Y900 RE (13,986; Core i7-6700K) and Alienware Aurora (16,398; Core i7-6700K), and our 13,346 desktop average. Thanks to its zippy 512GB SSD, our R1 transferred about 5GB of files at a blistering 6 seconds, for a transfer rate of 848.2 MBps. That runs circles around the Y900's 256GB SSD (195.7 MBps), the Aurora's 512GB SSD (198 MBps) and our 203 MBps category average. Configurations The standard "Stock" R1 Razer Edition starts at a fairly attainable $999, which gets you an ASUS H110M-A motherboard, an Intel Core i5-7500 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card and options for closed loop liquid cooling. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideHigher-end "Superstock" models start at $3,599 and include an Asus Strix Z270H motherboard, an Intel Core i5-7500 processor, 8GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, a GTX 1070 GPU and Maingear's handcrafted hard-line cooling tubes. While the R1 doesn't have the same wild paint options as other Maingear PCs, you can customize its specs to your heart's content. The desktop supports up to a Core i7-7700K processor, 32GB of RAM, tons of speedy storage options and up to two Nvidia Titan X graphics cards. You can add a Razer BlackWidow X keyboard ($160) and Razer DeathAdder Elite ($70) or Mamba Tournament Edition mouse ($90) to any configuration. We reviewed a fairly tricked-out $3,307 configuration, which packs a Z270 motherboard, a Core i7-7700K processor, 16GB of RAM, dual 512GB SSDs, a 2TB hard drive and two Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics cards. MORE: Our Favorite Gaming Mice for Every Genre Bottom Line The Maingear R1 Razer Edition is an impressive showcase of both brands, offering the sleekness of a Razer machine with the powerhouse performance and customization of a Maingear desktop. This PC can be configured to handle VR and 4K gaming at a decent price, and offers plenty of options for folks who want to build the liquid-cooled, dual-GPU monster of their dreams. That it'll look nice next to your Razer mouse and keyboard certainly doesn't hurt. If you were to configure the R1 with similar specs to Lenovo's $2,499 Razer Edition desktop, you'd actually save about $100. But the Y900 RE has the advantage of dynamic Chroma lighting (until the R1 gets it) and comes in a single configuration, making that machine a bit more appealing for hardcore Razer junkies or those who simply don't want to pick every single part of their PCs. Still, if you're seeking a stylish, subtle PC that you can configure to your needs, the R1 Razer Edition is a worthy buy. 8/10 Quick Take Get the R1 Razer Edition if you want a sleek, customizable gaming PC that'll look nice next to your Razer gadgets. If you want a similar desktop, but one with built-in Chroma lighting, consider the Lenovo Y900 RE. $1999.99 Newegg About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

Among the companies reporting Thursday were Ford and Dow component Caterpillar. Ford matched earnings estimates while topping sales expectations. Caterpillar beat earnings estimates but fell short of revenue expectations. Alphabet, Intel, Microsoft, Paypal and Starbucks are among companies due to report after the bell. "Companies are still able to beat on the bottom line, but are having a tougher time doing that on the top" line, said Jack Ablin, a chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "That could be a trend in cost cutting." Thirty percent of S&P 500 companies had reported quarterly earnings as of Thursday morning, with 70 percent exceeding analyst expectations on the bottom line and 56 percent beating sales estimates, according to data from The Earnings Scout. "We have reached the heart of the Q4 earnings season. The deluge of releases from the next two weeks will confirm whether the final three months of 2016 marked a disappointment for companies on a relative basis," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. "To be sure, the bar for this period was a bit higher than in previous quarters. The hurdle only gets more difficult for corporate executives to clear over the next year as extremely sanguine bottom line forecasts have hardly budged," Klein said. The Dow gained 32 points, with UnitedHealth Group and Home Depot contributing the most gains, hitting a record high. The S&P 500 broke above 2,300 for the first time before falling 0.07 percent, with health care falling 0.6 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq ended 0.02 percent lower, having hit an all-time high earlier in the session. The S&P 500 "confirmed a breakout from its consolidation phase yesterday, supporting short-term upside follow-through and minimizing the likelihood of a significant pullback in the near term," said Katie Stockton, chief technical analyst at BTIG. "We believe the breakout overrules the bearish takeaways we can derive from the low level of the VIX and weak seasonal influences in February, for now at least," Stockton said. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, hit its lowest levels in more than two years on Wednesday. It held around 10.9 on Thursday. The three major U.S. indexes closed at all-time highs on Wednesday, with the Dow breaking above 20,000 for the first time, an important psychological barrier. "If you look at it from a technical perspective, [stocks] finally broke from that six-week range," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "The market is giving the Trump administration more than the benefit of the doubt." Dow since US electionSource: FactSet One of the principal catalysts in sending stocks to record levels were a series of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump, including two that facilitate the construction of the Keystone XL and North Dakota Access pipelines. "Until we get to the Fed meeting in March, I don't see anything that could push us lower," Schwab's Frederick said. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its first meeting of the year Jan. 30 through Feb. 1, though Frederick does not expect the central bank to move monetary policy then. In economic news, initial jobless claims jumped 22,000 to 259,000, but have remained below 300,000 for 99 weeks straight, their longest stretch since 1970. The U.S. IHS Markit services PMI showed the sector expanded at its fastest pace since 2015, hitting 55.1 from 53.9. "Anecdotal evidence suggested that stronger domestic demand and improving business confidence had led to a robust rise in service sector activity at the start of 2017," IHS Markit said. New home sales fell 10.4 percent in December. U.S. Treasury yields fell slightly, with the benchmark 10-year note yield hovering around 2.50 percent, while the short-term two-year note yield traded at 1.22 percent. The dollar regained some ground against a basket of currencies, having broken below 100 earlier this week. It traded 0.5 percent higher in afternoon ET, with the euro around $1.069 percent and the yen near 114.4. Overseas, European and Asian equities rose broadly, following Wednesday's bullish run on Wall Street. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index advanced 0.25 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225 gained 1.81 percent. The iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW) fell more than 2 percent after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said he would not attend a previously scheduled meeting with Trump. The Mexican peso hit a session low following the announcement. Gold futures for February delivery settled $8 lower at $1,191 per ounce. U.S. oil futures for March delivery advanced 1.95 percent to settle at $53.78 per barrel. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Home Market Global markets: Stocks near record highs, dollar up on optimism, earnings Global markets: Stocks near record highs, dollar up on optimism, earnings A key index of global equity markets held near a record high on Thursday, supported by mergers and acquisitions, strong corporate earnings and investor optimism spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for new public spending. T By: Reuters | New York | Published: January 27, 2017 4:51 AM The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. (Reuters representative image) A key index of global equity markets held near a record high on Thursday, supported by mergers and acquisitions, strong corporate earnings and investor optimism spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for new public spending. The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI’s world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index was boosted by strength in Asian and European shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. Early fourth-quarter earnings have boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It is going to be so important to see these earnings come in at or above expectations,” said Tim Dreiling, senior Portfolio Manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Kansas City. Tech giants Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to 20,111.79, the S&P 500 lost 0.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,298.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.27 points, or 0.06 percent, to 5,659.61. Qualcomm weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The chipmaker fell 5.7 percent after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism. Johnson & Johnson’s $30-billion deal to buy Actelion lifted shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 percent at 1,451.12. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks. “The impression … is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.47 percent at 100.5. The Mexican peso weakened after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet Trump next week after the U.S. president tweeted Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. The firmer U.S. dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback’s climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold was down 0.95 percent to $1,188.8 an ounce. U.S. Treasury yields turned lower as solid investor demand at a $28 billion auction of seven-year government debt rekindled demand for the sector.

The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index was boosted by strength in Asian and European shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. Early fourth-quarter earnings have boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. "It is going to be so important to see these earnings come in at or above expectations," said Tim Dreiling, senior Portfolio Manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Kansas City. Tech giants Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to 20,111.79, the S&P 500 lost 0.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,298.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.27 points, or 0.06 percent, to 5,659.61. Qualcomm weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The chipmaker fell 5.7 percent after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism. Johnson & Johnson's $30-billion deal to buy Actelion lifted shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 percent at 1,451.12. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks. "The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track," said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.47 percent at 100.5.

Virtually all of our business and political leaders decry our decaying transportation, water, grid, and social infrastructure. They implore one another to act. Public safety, public health, and economic growth all depend on modernizing our aging national infrastructure. Yet we remain at an impasse. ADVERTISEMENT Studies have suggested that $1 trillion or more could be added to our gross domestic product (GDP) with properly funded and maintained infrastructure. A recent report published by the U.S. Treasury Department estimated net economic benefits of $500 million to $1.1 trillion for completion of just 40 stalled transportation and water projects.   With the arrival of a new administration with the same party control of Congress, a golden opportunity has arisen. Now is the time for “huge” leadership and problem solving from a masterful dealmaker in the White House, a fiscally responsible Speaker of the House, the congressional majority leaders, and the maestro of the Senate. Nonpartisan solutions Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerApple's Tim Cook meets with lawmakers in DC Intel Committee Dems to Trump: Read torture report Let's look beyond taxpayer dollars to fund American infrastructure MORE (D-Va.) and Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), each with stellar business backgrounds, have proffered intriguing ideas, including an independent federal Infrastructure Finance Authority and short term but robust funding from repatriation of offshore corporate earnings. Locking in long term, low interest financing for federal support of infrastructure is critical. That window may close during this congressional term. Republicans with expertise Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has studied this national infrastructure challenge as closely as anyone. He knows greater federal, state and local infrastructure spending is critical to national competitiveness. He knows that we must create greater incentives to secure private sector financial support to meet our infrastructure needs. We must have adequate long-term funding for an enormous and effectively never-ending need for infrastructure creation and maintenance. This is a multitrillion-dollar challenge. The quality of our lives truly depends on our collective meeting of that challenge. New ideas Among the strategies that should be considered is “asset recycling.” Use the genius of our federal, state, and local systems to stimulate decentralized decision making and infrastructure investment. An asset recycling program can leverage federal dollars many fold, create strong incentives for public–private partnerships, put more decision making in the hands of state and local leaders. How does it work? The federal government rewards any city, county, or state that sells or leases an infrastructure asset to the private sector, provided the sale or lease proceeds are timely reinvested in another local infrastructure project. Sell a port, and build a road. Grant a private concession to operate a municipal water system, and rebuild a bridge. Enable the private sector to upgrade a hydroelectric facility, and build new schools and modernize existing educational facilities. A federal match of 20 percent to 25 percent of proceeds could unleash a wave of partial privatization and progress across the country. No infrastructure asset should be or will be completely divested. Oversight by public authorities through reporting, regulation and legislation, as well as oversight by a free press, will and must protect the public interest. Moreover, as we just elected a business person to “fix it,” perhaps there is more public trust in the private sector than conventional wisdom suggests. We must also recognize that our nation has massive federal deficits and debt. We must attract private dollars—not just taxpayer dollars—to meet our infrastructure needs. We have overcrowded roadways, vulnerable power supplies, dangerous bridges, overflowing combined stormwater and sewer systems, otherwise deficient water and wastewater facilities, especially in rural America, decaying dams and levees, substandard public transit, and untenable and unrelenting cybersecurity risks. Much of our civic infrastructure like public schools, parks, stadiums, and hospitals need remodeling if not replacement. To our national leaders, please seize this opportunity. Do not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Be open to new ideas. Compromise where possible to achieve the public interest. You were elected or appointed to do just that. Please act wisely, but please, finally, act. Jay M.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Everyone has heard about the Internet of Things (IoT). But what is it, exactly? One useful definition puts it this way: “It’s not so much about the emergence of new technology, it’s the convergence—the ability to use sensors for everything in the world to basically be a computer, whether it’s your contact lens, your hospital bed, or a railway track.” The math is mind-numbing: Depending on whom you believe, the number of connected devices in 2020 will be either 50 billion (Cisco’s prediction) or 200 billion (Intel’s). Sensors in just about everything, from refrigerators and thermostats to automobiles and roadways, will merrily churn out petabytes of data every second—data that somebody, somewhere, somehow, must manage and—ideally—interpret and use. Seen from that perspective, CIOs and chief data officers (CDOs) can expect their enterprises soon to be swimming in a sea of data of almost unimaginable proportions. Companies that extract value from their data will have a substantial competitive edge over those who don’t. But how can they accomplish this task? For starters, CIOs must reinvent their data-processing infrastructure. Simply adding more computing power to existing computational paradigms won’t do the trick. Entirely new technologies such as cognitive computing and even quantum computing will be required. CDOs will turn to the emerging field of IoT analytics to catalog, manage, secure, and interpret information. Technologies such as blockchain and adaptive security will find their places in an IoT world. To be successful in this rapidly evolving IoT space, CIOs and CDOs must adopt a strategic approach. A good strategy is to use sensors and intelligent things to streamline existing workflows and processes.

MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home Animals Current Page Super Bowl Ad Roundup: This New Mr. Clean Is Very Disturbing Tweet Rick Chandler 3:38 pm, January 26th, 2017 The Super Bowl commercials to start rolling in, and Sportsgrid is there — giving you the lowdown on the latest ads. At approximately $5 million per 30 seconds, companies are going all out to sell you their wares — one might call this the Super Bowl of TV advertising. Wait, what? As the new spots come out, we’ll be keeping you up to date right here, and when we get enough full ads we’ll rank ’em. Check back every day until Feb. 5. UPDATES: * Febreeze The Halftime Bathroom Break is threatening to pollute America, and only Febreeze can save us. * Mr. Clean The full ad is out today, and baby it’s hot … for the ladies. The Full Ads Believe it or not, Mr. Clean is coming up on his 60th anniversary next year. Making his debut in 1958, the Procter & Gamble cleaning product was invented by the owner of a shipping line who needed a non-toxic cleaning product that wouldn’t make his workers sick. Mr. Clean immediately became the top-selling household cleaner on the market. Its mascot, the smiling genie-in-a-cleaning-bottle, has changed little in 59 years — in appearance, anyway. This year Procter & Gamble has introduced a new, sexy Mr. Clean, a detergent gigolo who just may seduce your wife if you’re not vigilant. In its Super Bowl debut, Procter & Gamble gives us the new Mr. Clean. I feel a little ill: Skittles checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducer. “Katy! …” TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. Wix would like to remind you that it’s easy to make your own stunning web site. Although what that has to do with busting up a restaurant is unclear. Intel apparently thinks that people will watch Tom Brady do anything — even brush his teeth before eating a pancake off of the floor. After taking it away from a dog. I would have re-thought this one. Teaser Trailers Febreeze is another Procter & Gamble product, this one which probes the phenomenon of the Halftime Bathroom break. Includes stock footage of a buffalo stampede so you know its good. We don’t know exactly how this is going to work, but Snickers‘ 30-second spot will be live to lead off the third quarter of the game. It will feature Adam Driver (Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and be preceded by a 36-hour livestream, at SnickersLive.com (noon ET on Thursday, Feb. 2, until midnight Friday night. Here are four teasers, combined for your convenience. None of it makes any sense so far. GoDaddy is under new management (a new ad agency), and is back after skipping Super Bowl 50. According to AdAge, the ad will go like this: “In GoDaddy’s commercial, we will be introduced to the ‘Internet,’ who is covered in tattoos of web references, like Wi-Fi symbols, memes and floppy discs. The 30-second game day spot will include a look inside the house of the ‘Internet’ and will feature a song made popular by the internet. While most of the references included in the commercial will be recognizable to a broad audience, there will be some more obscure references hidden throughout.” Avocados From Mexico is back, and the ad — to be shown during the first commercial break of the game — will focus on the avocado being a health food. Since more avocados are consumed during the Super Bowl than during any other time of the year, it’s surprising that AFM have only been in the past three big games. Here’s the teaser trailer, featuring Jon Lovitz: Kia is going to make you wait awhile to see what’s chasing Melissa McCarthy. PepsiCo will be touting its line of bottled water products, Lifewtr, with its Inspiration Drops spot. Featured will be a song by John Legend. Not participating this year Butterfinger, Doritos, Mini USA, SunTrust, Taco Bell, Toyota, Visa. Heinz, which gave us the entertaining Weiner Stampede during last year’s game, is also not returning to the Super Bowl. But they saved a few mil by running an ad right after the game, and releasing an extended version online (which may be the wave of the future). Heinz has started a petition to make the day after the Super Bowl and national holiday.

The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index was boosted by strength in Asian and European shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. Early fourth-quarter earnings have boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. "It is going to be so important to see these earnings come in at or above expectations," said Tim Dreiling, senior Portfolio Manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Kansas City. Tech giants Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to 20,111.79, the S&P 500 lost 0.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,298.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.27 points, or 0.06 percent, to 5,659.61. Qualcomm weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The chipmaker fell 5.7 percent after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism. Johnson & Johnson's $30-billion deal to buy Actelion lifted shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 percent at 1,451.12. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks. "The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track," said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.47 percent at 100.5. The Mexican peso weakened after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet Trump next week after the U.S. president tweeted Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. The firmer U.S. dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback's climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold was down 0.95 percent to $1,188.8 an ounce. U.S. Treasury yields turned lower as solid investor demand at a $28 billion auction of seven-year government debt rekindled demand for the sector. Benchmark 10-year notes were up 4/32 in price to yield 2.510 percent, down from 2.523 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices jumped 2 percent, boosted by the ongoing rally in the U.S. stock market, although gains in crude futures were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories despite efforts by producers to cut output. Brent crude settled up $1.16, or 2.1 percent, at $56.24 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up $1.03, or 2 percent, at $53.78.

Cisco's investment through its funding arm is an extension of the $23 million Series B funds raised by Helpshift in June, from investors such as Intel Capital, Microsoft Ventures and Salesforce Ventures. The firm did not disclose Cisco's investment numbers nor how it would monetise Cisco using the solution on its platform. Helpshift allows customers such as Zynga, Microsoft and Western Union to use its content management system designed for the smartphone app to have pre-filled answers for queries from customers. The underlying software throws up responses for queries like in a chat conversation in the smartphone, which the company says allows better engagement with customers for its clients. "Apps have become the primary way in which consumers and employees in the enterprise are accessing products and services," said Abinash Tripathy, chief executive officer and co-founder, Helpshift in a statement. "Just like customer service moved away from phone (voice) to email in the era of the web, we are now seeing a transition where customer service is moving inside apps to eliminate all the friction in the process of supporting users. With the additional funding from Cisco Investments, we are looking to help the entire contact center industry transition from being reactive to proactive while driving higher customer satisfaction and lowering cost." Helpshift counts companies such as Zynga, Virgin Media, Microsoft, Western Union, Flipboard, Shyp, WordPress, and thousands of other industry-leading brands, startups, and developers use the Helpshift platform to provide in-app support. The company has raised more than $38.2 million and is backed by Cisco Investments, Intel Capital, Microsoft Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, True Ventures, and Visionnaire Ventures. "Through our investment, we look forward to supporting Helpshift to enable companies to provide best in-class mobile customer care through their data-centric messaging platform," said Rob Salvagno, head of Cisco Investments and vice-president of Cisco Corporate Development.

LEAD Lessons From a Dog Park: What Your Dog Can Teach You About Public Speaking Man's best friend will walk you through presentation advice, and it's more than how to sit, shake paws, or roll over. By Fia Fasbinder Fia Fasbinder, CEO of The MOXiE Institute, arms speakers with the tools to deliver killer presentations. With over 15 years of experience in public speaking, classroom instruction, and presentation skill development, Fia teaches speakers to communicate with confidence, clarity and credibility.

Her unique approach to keynoting utilizes theatrical techniques and performing arts skills in addition to practical, real world knowledge culled from coaching clients at TEDX, UCSD, Qualcomm, Intel and numerous Fortune 500 companies. @moxiespeaker CEO, The MOXiE Institute@moxiespeaker WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Our four-legged friends have a great deal of wisdom to offer. It seems offices and businesses are realizing the merits of our canine family members and even welcoming them into the workplace. If you're tired of public speaking coaches and TED Talks bombarding you with ideas about how to communicate better, you can get a leg up on the competition by consulting someone who knows you best: your dog. Man's best friend is chock full of public speaking lessons, from networking to voice control. Watching dogs and their owners play will arm you with a fresh perspective and a new outlook on your communication skills. Here are the top four public speaking lessons gleaned from your neighborhood dog park. 1. Confidence Breeds Confidence When a dog enters a dog park, his excitement is palpable. He jumps, he runs, he approaches other dogs. And those other dogs adopt his behavior. His enthusiasm is contagious. Just like your furry friend, your audience will mirror your behaviors--from facial movements to general excitement. The positive feedback your audience's brain gets from mirroring your positive emotions will make an emotional connection between audience members and your message. After all, friendly dogs get more pets and a confident speaker invokes confidence in her audience. 2. Be Unapologetically Authentic When a dog enjoys his favorite chew toy in the company of people or other dogs--he cannot contain his pleasure. He drools, runs in circles and digs fruitlessly at the same spot in the carpet. Dogs are unapologetically authentic. They just don't know how to be anything other than themselves. A public speaker can develop an authentic speaker personality that he or she embodies while on-stage. The key to finding the fine balance between your speaker persona and the real-you is to be your authentic self but add in a level of professionalism and confidence required of a respectable speaker. Think of it as turning the energy dial up on the day-to-day you from a 5 to an 8. Don't be afraid to channel your inner wacky dog and be yourself--just make sure you're communicating effectively. 3. Use Your Canine Intuition Dogs seem to have the uncanny ability to read each other. They know when it's okay to approach another dog. They also know when it's okay to take it a step further and sniff that dog's butt without being bitten. This awareness of self and others benefits all public speakers. Knowing when your body language comes across as overly aggressive or too passive can save a speaker from alienating the audience. Just as a dog knows exactly the message his butt-sniff or wagging tail sends, speakers must be aware of the message their body language sends. 4. Close Neatly and Cleanly What is just as important as taking your dog out for their daily walk? Being respectful of and cleaning up after your dog does his business. Close your speech neatly and cleanly. Just like vacating the dog park, this crucial last step will ensure you leave a good impression. Tie up loose ends and leave those other park attendees wanting more--from both you and your dog. Let a dog's life teach you how to captivate your audience and spread your message. And they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Jan 23, 2017 Advertisement

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Google-Google+ After suggesting the next Pixel device will be waterproof, 9to5 Google is back with a big batch of information from a "source that has been reliable in the past." While you shouldn't go on believing everything you are about to read, the revelations and suggestions about upcoming Pixel devices are interesting. The source claims that waterproofing is "still on the table," rather than being a definite addition to future devices. Google is said to be focusing on the camera, working on improving low light photography and making the most of a camera sensor that isn't large in megapixels and adding extra features. Google is allegedly testing multiple Pixel 2 models with Qualcomm and Intel chips. Apparently, Taiwanese chip maker MediaTek was also part of the project for a time, but isn't an longer. Additionally, Google is prototyping a lower-priced "Pixel 2B" with a more modest spec sheet. The phone is scheduled for release "alongside or shortly after the Pixel 2" and is aimed at emerging markets, with the goal of bringing the "Google experience and Google Phone" outside mature markets. While the Pixel 2B will be "significantly cheaper" than its big brother, the Pixel 2 is said to command "at least" a $50 price premium over the current Pixel phones. The Pixel starts at $650, so a $50 price increase is still reasonable for a high-end smartphone. While there's no time frame for their release, the new Pixel phones should be ready for an October announcement. Google traditionally announces new smartphones then, and it's not likely to skip a beat. We'll be learning more details about the Pixel sequels in the months prior to their release.

So when the Pixels are in a VR headset, the front firing speakers (ffs) get muffled, and blocked inside a VR headset. Unlike the low resolution iPhone 7 that you own, the Pixels have higher resolutions, and greater density displays compared to any iPhone. Something that is needed for VR, but since Apple themselves doesn't support VR on any of its iPhones. Then I guess you don't care about that stuff. Also the Pixels have a 3.5mm audio jack built in. posted on 2 days ago, 23:05 0 in response to #13 in response to #13 Hide Reply 27. Mxyzptlk (Posts: 15154; Member since: 21 Apr 2012) You are wrong. I don't care about VR, so get over it. There's no reason to not have ffs with the amount of bezel space available, but I see that you would rather deflect from the truth than make a convincing argument. posted on 2 days ago, 14:09 1 Reply 16. marorun (Posts: 4100; Member since: 30 Mar 2015) Adding OIS to camera mean bigger camera module mean a bump in the back so its wont be sexier... waterproof no thanks i dont want an overheating oven.... for the rest i am with you. posted on 2 days ago, 14:39 0 in response to #16 in response to #16 Hide Reply 18. fiji.siv (Posts: 73; Member since: 25 Nov 2015) LOL "sexier" when referring to a Pixel.

Scott93274 (Posts: 5140; Member since: 06 Aug 2013) While I was impressed with the image stabilisation software, it simply looked too robotic when you turned your camera while recording, I think I would rather have OIS as well. I'm also excited to see what they do with their camera as they're still putting a lot of work into improving it. I still think the Pixel's camera is the best smartphone camera on the market. posted on 2 days ago, 20:11 1 Reply 23. ibend (Posts: 5515; Member since: 30 Sep 2014) EIS inside pixel work much better at stabilizing video compared to OIS on S7 (PA already make article about that camera comparison) but OIS also great since it can help in low light condition (combine it with huge pixel sensor size :D) why not both? it's possible :D (zenfone 3 use 3-axis EIS and 4-axis OIS.. but no one care, lol..) posted on yesterday, 05:29 0 Reply 28.

Qualcomm would have to somehow come out with a much superior SoC before 2018 and Sony/Samsung/Omnivision come out with a fancy new sensor to warrant a proper upgrade. posted on 2 days ago, 22:36 0 Reply 25. vincelongman (Posts: 4708; Member since: 10 Feb 2013) People said that about the Pixel yet its backordered in most countries The new Qualcomm SoC won't come until at least 2018, likely March 2018, 5 months after the Pixel 2 release Also major jumps in camera sensors don't happen every 6 months (or even every 12 months) The Pixel 2 will be at least competive with the 2017 iPhone and Note8 posted on 2 days ago, 13:19 2 Reply 14. jellmoo (Posts: 1759; Member since: 31 Oct 2011) I'd definitely be interested in a mid-range style Pixel.

Panzer (Posts: 7; Member since: 13 May 2016) Well no waterproofing, a FHD panel on 5" model, huge bezels. The camera is the same as the Nexus 6p and 5X though it is a very good camera. WIth the exception of the 821 Snapdragon please explain to me the premium hardware. Then the updates. As a former Nexus owner Google was nice enough to give us the latest bastardized version of Android months later. So don't say software support if they will screw over the Nexus owners when a new line comes out they will screw over the Pixel owners also. posted on yesterday, 07:35 0 Reply 30. tokuzumi (Posts: 1026; Member since: 27 Aug 2009) $50 additional for an already overpriced phone? No thanks.

The iDevices room was a prototype of a smart home; the company makes a wall switch that coördinates the various appliances in the home. At C.E.S., we were deep into the Internet of Things, the fully connected house run by, say, a smart refrigerator, which in the near future will tell you when to shop, how to cook, and when to pick up the children. I was grateful for iDevices’ modest little room—it was a relatively quiet and enclosed space. It may not come entirely as a surprise to you to hear that C.E.S.—in fact, Las Vegas itself—is not a place for people who like to control and simplify the amount of noise and information hitting their bodies, brains, and souls at any given moment. As a first-time visitor to C.E.S., I was properly impressed, which is to say wiped out—overwhelmed by the show itself, which housed more than thirty-eight hundred exhibits in four vast convention spaces and several hotels. For whatever it’s worth, I was also overwhelmed by Las Vegas, which offers life at its most massified (at least during C.E.S.): a fretful throng passing through the mall-sized, bar-always-open hotel lobbies, or wandering up and down the vibrating Strip, or filing through the exhibits themselves, which are often hyper-aggressive. They buttonhole you with visual presentations on enormous screens, or celebrity pitchmen, or, more modestly, young spokespeople, some company employees, some Las Vegas types hired for the occasion, who look you in the eye and sell you the future. Back in iDevices’ smart home, about fifteen of us conventioneers crowded into the room, which was tastefully furnished in beige and gray. In the dark, we listened to recorded sound of a young married couple. We were cast into the near future. Was it a future, I wondered, that would provide happiness? “G’morning, hon,” the recorded man in the smart home, whom we shall call Robert, said. “G’morning,” the woman—let’s call her Sylvia—said. “Hey, Siri, good morning,” Robert said, which was followed by the sound of a coffee machine turning on. Sylvia: “Alexa, set my home to seventy-two.” After a pause, Robert, said, “Siri, we’re heading to work now” (sound of doors closing). As the couple left the house, those of us who had sought refuge in the smart home couldn’t be blamed for imagining the day spent by Robert and Sylvia—a day in which these two eagerly used some of the actual products on display in the vast halls of Las Vegas’s convention centers. In my imagining, Sylvia and Robert rode to work in their Intel-assisted, 5G-connected, autonomous BMW, both of them lounging in the back. Sylvia strapped the QardioArm to her upper arm; took her blood pressure, as she did every morning; and sent the results by smartphone to her husband, who was sitting next to her, and to her doctor. Robert watched the Knicks-Lakers game from the previous night on his HTC Vive virtual-reality headset. The BMW, in touch with the cloud, which collated information from other vehicles, advised them that there was black ice ahead on the road—the car slowed from thirty miles an hour (traffic was heavy) to twenty for the slick patch. At her office, Sylvia, who works as a decorator, spent some time selecting Chinese fabrics and coffee tables for a client. She looked at the products in Singapore and in Guilin via the Internet and felt them by putting on Ericsson’s V.R. helmet and attaching to her right forefinger Tactai’s Dynamic Tactile Wave device, a black sheath that’s lined with electric sensors. As she extended her hand forward, watching an image of her finger in the frame, she “touched” the various objects in China, and felt, through electric sensations, the texture of linen, marble, and brass. They felt very much like the linen, marble, and brass objects in her office. Sylvia loved her work and often thought that, if she had children and couldn’t afford full-time day care, she could monitor the baby from her office, at least for short periods of time. She could use a tiny iBaby robot, which looks friendly (like a round white rabbit with one eye protruding upward). iBaby would provide, on Sylvia’s smartphone, a continuous H.D. view of the child. She could also use the Snoo, made by Happiest Baby. The Snoo is a white bassinet that straps babies on their back so that they don’t turn on their stomach. The Snoo’s frame also has embedded sensors that pick up the sound of the baby crying, causing the bassinet to rock the baby back to sleep while emitting white noise, mimicking the womb. The baby would wear the TempTraq Wearable Wireless Thermometer, so that Sylvia could follow the baby’s temperature from a phone app. Sylvia wondered why women of her mother’s generation still made a fuss over child-raising when all these devices were now available to keep in touch with babies from a distance. Robert, an industrial designer, didn’t much feel like working when he arrived at the office, so he spent more than two hours playing The Gallery: Call of the Starseed on his HTC Vive, before pulling himself together and switching to a DAQRI Augmented Reality smart helmet and walking through a half-constructed building that he was working on, checking the duct work and water pipes about to be installed above, to make sure nothing collided. Robert also thought of having children and, before leaving home, stepped into his Spartan boxer briefs, made in Paris, in which silver fibers, embedded in the fabric, protected his genitals from radiation that might be emanating from the cell phone that he keeps in his front pocket. He imagined himself playing with a baby, and the baby being entertained by a Avatarmind’s iPal, a social robot, about three and a half feet tall, which waved its arms, told stories (at the moment, only in Chinese), and sang “Old MacDonald.” The robot would record his child’s growth pattern, taking pictures at various stages of the child’s development and recording his or her voice. Robert reflected on the fact that there would be no need for the messy space inside a garage or a closet in which his children’s growth would be recorded, as his was, by marking their height on a wall (“three feet, six inches!”). “Hey, Siri, I’m home,” Robert, back from the office, said, and the lights went on for those of us left in the dark. Sylvia returned soon after. Robert: “Hey, Siri, it’s happy hour.” (Pink lights go on.) Sylvia: “Alexa, turn on the kitchen.” Sylvia and Robert made dinner together, in their conventional oven. But they imagined things, too. They hoped to soon buy a Samsung Family Hub 2.0, a four-door refrigerator with a 21.5-inch screen on the upper-right door. On this screen, they could coördinate their lives, making to-do lists for everyone. They could link up the entire house’s appliances. By posting photographs and messages to the screen, they could eliminate the clutter of handwritten notes on odd bits of paper. (No more “I love you, Dad” in a childish scrawl.) They would enter the perishable groceries on the screen, and the Hub would advise them when the milk and vegetables were approaching expiration; three cameras on the inside of the door would continuously photograph everything in the refrigerator, and they could examine the contents by cell phone and tap on any item for instant reorder at FreshDirect. “Hi, Samsung,” they would say. “Open the recipe app,” and the refrigerator would tell them how to make, say, Black Magic Cake. “Preheat the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees,” the refrigerator would begin. The only trouble, Sylvia thought, was that their smart home could be invaded by dreaded “Mirai” (or malware), and turned into a bot in someone’s botnet, in which case the family members would cede control of their lives to advanced technology. Sylvia dreaded this. But she was relieved when she heard about Securifi’s Almond 3, which monitors their smart-home monitors and repels invaders. She wondered who would monitor the monitor that monitors her smart home, but she let that thought slide as a problem that technology would solve in the future. After dinner, Robert said, “Hey, Siri, party time.” (Flashing lights, as in a sixties club, appear on the walls.) But Sylvia, who sounded tired, said, “I want to go to bed.” So Robert said, “Siri, party’s over,” and the room was returned to darkness. Slowly, we filed out into the brilliant white lights of endless exhibition space. David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

The assumption that many of them are making is that by investing in higher levels of IT security, those risks not only become manageable, but the level of security they can provide becomes a selling point. F5 Networks, as part of a strategy to meet demand for more advanced approaches to IT security driven by digital business initiatives, this week made several additions to its IT security portfolio. The first is a Herculon SSL Orchestrator that provides a method of encrypting and decrypting network traffic using a dedicated appliance that combines field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Intel processors to keep pace with the performance requirements of digital business applications. The second offering is a Herculon DDoS Hybrid Defender, which takes advantage of a similar hardware architecture to help organizations defend themselves against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that increasingly target high-value applications. Finally, F5 Networks also announced a pre-configured web application firewall that is managed by F5 Networks, in addition to providing access to a Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) service that focuses on helping IT organizations mitigate attacks once they are discovered. F5 Networks CTO Ryan Kearny says IT organizations need new approaches to IT security because application workloads are now so distributed that there is no network perimeter to defend. “The network perimeter has dissolved,” says Kearny. In the absence of that perimeter, Kearny says, IT organizations need to focus their IT security efforts on Layer Three of the network on up to the application. At a time when organizations are investing more in digital business initiatives, Kearny notes that in addition to securing those applications, IT organizations need to implement IT security technologies in a way that doesn’t adversely affect their performance. Most of those applications involve business functions where performance has a direct impact on the amount of revenue being generated, notes Kearny. Because of that requirement, F5 Networks makes use of FPGAs to process security functions, says Kearny. It remains to be seen to what degree organizations will adjust their security postures to deal with new digital business realities. Arguably, it’s just a matter of time. But as history has often shown, there’s usually a significant lag between when new types of applications are deployed and when most organizations really comprehend the security risks involved.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index found support from rallying stocks in Asia and Europe.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. "Today is about earnings and part of the Dow reaching the 20,000 milestone is because of strong earnings," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.Of the 104 S&P 500 companies that had reported results through Wednesday morning, nearly 70 percent beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tech giants Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.78 points, or 0.23 percent, to 20,115.29, the S&P 500 gained 0.09 points, or 0.00 percent, to 2,298.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.42 points, or 0.03 percent, to 5,657.76.European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism, with Johnson & Johnson's $30 billion deal to buy Actelion lifting shares in the Swiss biotech firm.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.17. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks."The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track," said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.67 percent to 100.7.The firmer dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback's climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold was down 1.16 percent to $1,186.27 an ounce. Ahead of a $28-billion auction of seven-year notes, U.S. Treasury debt yields turned higher with European yields and 10-year yields rose to a 4-week high.Benchmark 10-year notes were down 6/32 in price to yield 2.542 percent, up from 2.523 percent late on Wednesday. The recent strength in stock markets boosted oil prices although gains were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories in spite of efforts by producers to cut output.Brent crude was up 2.4 percent at $56.4 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 2.2 percent at $53.91.

Google is expected to place a major focus on the Pixel 2 camera. Sources tell 9to5Google that Google wants to “master low light photography” with the Pixel 2, and that while Google isn’t planning to cram a ton of megapixels into that camera, it does intend to pack some extra features in there. Another detail that’s rumored for the Pixel 2 is waterproofing. While this feature is locked in quite yet, it’s said to be “still on the table,” according to the source of today’s report.  Google is reportedly still deciding on which processor to include in its next flagship smartphone. There are said to be models in testing with Snapdragon 83x chips, some with Intel processors, and some with a custom chipset developed by Google. The Pixel 2 is still quite a ways away from release, so it’s not surprising to hear that Google is testing multiple processors to determine which is best for its next big thing. Finally, it’s said that Google is testing different prototypes of the Pixel 2, including a lower-cost “Pixel 2B.” While the Pixel 2 could be at least $50 pricier than the Pixel (the base model Pixel is priced at $649), the Pixel 2B is expected to be “significantly cheaper” if it does come to market. There’s no mention in today’s report about when the Pixel 2 might make its official debut, but if Google follows the yearly update cycle that most other manufacturers do, then we should see the new device in October. As for its features, the Pixel has caught some flak for not being waterproof like the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7, so it’d be surprising if Google didn’t address that with the Pixel 2. And when it comes to the camera, the Pixel is often lauded as having one of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and I’m sure that Google wants to keep that title with the Pixel 2. Other features are still up in the air, but the Pixel 2 is going to be a flagship device, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if features like a Snapdragon 835, at least 4GB of RAM, USB Type-C, and a fingerprint reader also made the cut. The Pixel 2 may not debut until October, but it’s sure to be one of 2017’s most anticipated devices, so we’ll likely see more leaks and rumors surrounding the phone in the coming months. What features do you want to see in the Pixel 2?

In fact, the phone has proven to be so popular that many consumers are having a hard time getting their hands on one. With that in mind, it might not surprise you to learn that the company is already hard at work on a follow-up. Don't Miss: How the Galaxy S8’s most innovative feature will work 9to5Google has heard from a reliable source that Google is once again focusing on the camera for the Pixel 2. Although the camera is not expected to have “large [megapixel] size,” Google will compensate with additional features that will let the camera function even more effectively in low-light situations. The source also claims that multiple Pixel 2 models are being tested, “some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips.” Google was originally planning to collaborate with MediaTek, but the semiconductor company is reportedly no longer involved with the production of the Pixel 2. Stephen Hall, the author of the report, said on Twitter yesterday that he had heard that the next Pixel would “definitely” be waterproof. Now the waterproofing is being referred to as “still on the table,” although it would be a surprise if Google didn’t try to match its competition on this front. Google is also said to be testing several prototypes of a device known as the “Pixel 2B,” which could be released “alongside or shortly after Pixel 2.” The Pixel 2B would serve as a budget model of the Pixel, allowing Google to bring its flagship product to other markets with less powerful hardware at a lower price point. While a budget model of the Pixel might be in the works, the Pixel 2 will be anything but budget-friendly. According to the source, the Pixel 2 could cost “at least” $50 more than the Pixel did at launch. As long as it features the latest and greatest hardware, this likely won’t be an issue for most consumers.

Follow TechnoBuffalo While the Google Pixel was an excellent phone, the best phone, there’s still a lot to improve upon. One such improvement may be waterproofing, as we heard earlier this week. Now, another report claims Google is planning to make even more exciting changes when the Pixel 2 is released this year. According to 9to5Google, one of Google’s main focuses will be on the Pixel 2’s camera, an area the company’s device already excels at. Google will reportedly emphasize low light performance, something all mobile devices struggle with. The current Pixel produces decent pictures in low light but the Pixel 2 will be even better, the report says. “We’re further told that the phone’s camera will ‘not have a large MP size,’ but will rather ‘compensate in extra features,’” 9to5Google says. The report goes on to say Google is testing multiple chipsets, including “some Snapdragon 83X chips,” along with chips from Intel. Google is also said to be developing a custom chipset for the device but it’s unclear if it’ll be ready in time for the Pixel 2. “Multiple test devices with different chipsets are being used now,” a source told 9to5Google. Unfortunately, a Pixel with more advanced specs could lead to a price increase by “at least” $50. Google’s flagship is already fairly expensive—$649 for the cheapest model—so the base price could be raised to $700 on the low end. Let’s hope Google can at least keep the price competitive when the device eventually launches. There may also be a “budget” Pixel In addition to the Pixel 2, Google is said to be working on a “Pixel 2B,” which 9to5Google’s source said will feature less powerful hardware and “will be significantly cheaper.” However, it sounds like there’s a possibility the budget device may not launch at all, so don’t get your hopes up just yet. The Google Pixel is still relatively new, so it’s a little early to start dreaming about the sequel. However, considering a new cycle of flagships are just on the horizon, it’s no surprise to hear Google is already hard at work on the Pixel 2. Let’s hope that in addition to an improved camera and specs, Google will also introduce a sleeker design.

This research report also lists nine other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. The market research analysts at Technavio predicts the global consumer drones market to grow at an impressive CAGR of almost 16% between 2017 and 2021, owing to the increase in the awareness about the application of drones in aerial photography. Vendors are constantly innovating on product designs and technologies used in their offerings to introduce products at various price points. With the surge in consumer electronics and devices such as smartphones, there has been innovation in sensors, leading to the availability of high-quality sensors at low prices. This has significantly boosted the production of consumer drones. There is an increased focus to improve the speed, maneuverability, durability, and quality of images and videos offered by consumer drones. Competitive vendor landscape The global consumer drones market is characterized by the presence of several established manufacturers who generate revenue through both direct and indirect sales. Indirect sales take place via local representatives and certified distributors or dealers. The competition between these vendors is intense regarding product features, price, customized solutions, and services and software updates offered. “The global consumer drones market is in its introduction phase as the consumer segment has just started adopting drones for aerial photography, drone racing, and games. The increased interest in drones by hobbyists is also a major propellant for the market,” says Bharath Kanniappan, a lead robotics research analyst from Technavio. Most end-users are waiting for more affordable variants and further improvement in technology before investing in them. The major players must strengthen their strategies to hold on to their current market share as the competitive environment in this market is expected to intensify during the forecast period with the increase in R&D innovations and M&A.

The company will also capitalize on the emerging ecosystem of apps, software, and cloud services related to drones.

It sells its products through retailers such as Best Buy, Toys “R” Us, and Apple stores. The company will focus on diversifying its product lines across target segments, ranging from filmmakers to agriculturalists during the forecast period.

The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks."The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track," said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto.The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.67 percent to 100.7.The firmer dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback's climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold XAU= was down 1.16 percent to $1,186.27 an ounce. Ahead of a $28-billion auction of seven-year notes, U.S. Treasury debt yields turned higher with European yields and 10-year yields rose to a 4-week high.Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were down 6/32 in price to yield 2.542 percent, up from 2.523 percent late on Wednesday. The recent strength in stock markets boosted oil prices although gains were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories in spite of efforts by producers to cut output.Brent crude LCOc1 was up 2.4 percent at $56.4 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 was up 2.2 percent at $53.91.

Skip to content J.F. Fortin Tam Technologie, affaires et société Posted on August 21, 2016August 21, 2016 by nekohayo GUADEC 2016, laptops and tablets made to run GNOME, surprise Pitivi meeting I went there for the 2016 edition of GUADEC: I arrived a couple of days early to attend my last GNOME Foundation board meeting, in one of the KIT’s libraries. The building’s uncanny brutalist architecture only added to the nostalgia of a two years adventure coming to an end: Then… A wild Kat strong-armed me into preparing an "unconference" talk for this year's #GUADEC after all… — Jeff (@nekohayo) August 10, 2016 And so I made a new talk proposal at the last minute, which was upvoted fairly quickly by attendees: The conference organizers counter-trolled me by inscribing it exactly like this onto the giant public schedule in the venue’s lobby: The result was this talk: Laptops & Tablets Manufactured to Run a Pure GNOME. Go watch it now if you missed it. Note: during the talk’s Q&A session, I mistakenly thought that Purism‘s tablets were using an ARM architecture; they’re actually planned to be Intel-based. And to make things clear, for laptop keyboard layouts, Purism is currently offering US/UK, which are different physical layouts (different cutting etc.). Also relevant to your interests if you’re into that whole privacy thing: Cosimo’s unconference session about the earmarked privacy funds Federico’s talk about our, ahem, suboptimal key management UX in GNOME. Stef Walters pointed out during this talk’s Q&A (and to me personally when I discussed with him on the previous day) that he’d be glad to review & merge patches, but does not currently have enough time to maintain Seahorse otherwise. Interested in improving security for our PGP, SSH and geeral keys management in GNOME? Check out Seahorse and start polishing that code! Werner Koch’s keynote: We want more centralization, do we? Alexander Larsson’s Flatpak status update and future plans In my luggage, I carried ~20 kilograms of the Foundation’s annual reports. Some folks were skeptical and thought I should “only bring a few of them, people aren’t usually interested in the annual report.” Well, they were dead wrong: within one afternoon, the annual reports “sold out” like hotcakes. See also my tandem lightning talk (at the 29mins mark) to get a glimpse of how much work we put into designing the new annual report this year. Also, if you took one of them at the conference, remember: they’re precious little works of art and a powerful tool to convince people to become contributors or sponsors to support GNOME, so make sure to use them towards that goal! I was very happy to see Mathieu and Alexandru from the Pitivi team deciding to attend at the last minute, even if it was just for one day. We spent time with Jakub Steiner discussing his workflow and wishlist for a “perfect” video editor: Pitivi makes people smile! Left to right: Alexandru Băluț, Jakub “Skywalker” Steiner, Mathieu Duponchelle. I took a handful of photos of the BoFs and uploaded them to my gallery for GUADEC 2016. Licensed under the Creative Commons “by attribution” 4.0 as usual, so that the GNOME Engagement team can use them for GNOME promotional materials if needed. Make sure you do the same and list yours in here. The Flatpak BoF session Overall, this GUADEC was one of the most well-organized ones I’ve seen in years. I was floored by the amount of efforts and planning the local team put into this. They really deserve some kudos! Everything ran smoothly on the surface (I know that in such events there will always be odd situations happening here and there, but they dealt with them so efficiently that they were invisible). The team had a professional-grade two-way radio system to coordinate, a car and trailer to carry stuff around every day, made and reused food (pro-grade cafeteria counter metal containers = genius), a lifetime supply of IKEA mugs that got washed and reused frequently, tons of snacks, managed to pull in great sponsors even at the last minute, put signage in various parts of the city to guide people to the venue, had huge quantities of tasty dead animals (and plants) to eat at a very successful barbecue event, got an icecream vendor to come to the venue, and even filled up a pool and beanbags, for pete’s sake!

Very rarely did we have GUADEC videos published in a timely fashion in the past, let alone streamed live and with proper laptop video output capture as well as proper sound mixing. This is fantastic. I should mention the closing night’s event in the biergarten, with sponsored drinks and food by our friendly GStreamer experts Centricular, a very nice gesture that was well appreciated by everyone.

A strong rally in the tech sector largely pushed many of these companies to new highs, as the Dow and S&P are both trading near all-time highs. The January 13 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest moves were mixed in these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest decrease to 76.05 million shares. The previous level was 79.38 million. Shares were last seen at $37.80, in a 52-week trading range of $27.68 to $38.36. The number of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares short remained flat at 88.62 million shares. Shares recently traded at $10.48, in a 52-week range of $1.81 to $12.42. Note that like Intel and Micron, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short fall to 13.76 million, compared to the 14.34 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $53.87, in a 52-week range of $42.24 to $71.62. Short interest in Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) dropped to 13.54 million shares. The previous reading was 13.94 million. Shares were trading at $34.16, in a 52-week range of $15.44 to $34.83. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest increase to 59.55 million shares from the previous reading of 55.14 million. Shares were trading at $23.62, in a 52-week range of $9.35 to $23.98. And the short interest in Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) increased to 3.76 million shares in the period, from the previous 3.22 million. Shares were last seen at $202.91, in a 52-week range of $114.25 to $204.61.

Trump lashes out about the fake news that a British spy had tried to make national headlines and some news agencies had bought into the story. Hillary (“what difference does it make?”) says that the Intel agencies released false information that cost her the election. It is obvious that there is fake news going around in our community. Someone told me that James Walter Allen (if you can’t beat them join them) was walking around LaFayette True Value Hardware wearing a Clemson jacket. Now I know that has to be fake news as he says thanks to Bear Bryant in his prayers. So carrying out my duties as a major league journalist, I went out to verify the fake news story. When I got out to the store I noticed a pickup parked there with South Carolina tag on it but I dismissed it as an out of town visitor. But there was James Walter behind the counter grinning like he had just got out of jail and was wearing a Clemson Tiger jacket. The attached picture verifies the fact! There is a story making its way around in the Valley that Fredonia had initiated Uber service for the community. Now I know in spite of their efforts to become more upscale in our locale, they do not have that many of their citizens requiring transportation to visit the jail in LaFayette. I am not sure whether Judy Collins or Monroe Smith initiated the story, but as a journalist I needed to confirm that this story was fake. I checked it out and found out the rumors were tree. I took a picture (see attached) of the Uber bus designed by Rabbit Adams and driven by Larry Crozier. Another friend told me that I should go down to Ponders Nursery and check the sign posted out front. He mentioned that the staff down there might have problems with bladder control. Now I knew that was fake news as Frankie’s crowd were still part of the younger generation. Anyway to check out it, I visited Ponders Nursery and took a picture of the sign out front. It was not fake news as it appears if they may have become too excited over their new plants for the local market. (See attached picture) I ran into Adam Hurst the other day at the ball game out at Chambers Academy. Adam brought me up to date on what he was doing. He mentioned that he had assembled an old hot rod out in his garage. He said that he had entered it in the dirt track up at Penton and it was a winner. I was suspicious of his mechanical ability as the Adam I knew thought a screwdriver was a mixed drink. Now, his cousins over in the West Point are known be pretty straight so I thought that I should check this out. Now what I believed to be fake news was proven to true when one views the picture of his hot rod that I snapped in his garage. As a proven journalist you have to check these things out. The fake news out in the community may be some hacking data put out by Tiders to embarrass us WarEagles. You never know what the facts are. “THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING”.

Sanjib Sinha January 20, 2017, Issue 2 Volume 14 Print & Email Comment Posting this message — “Want to buy some profile dumps. Are there any? I’m ready to pay in Bitcoins” — in three ‘TOR NETWORK’ message boards, hidden in the dark web, my wait was over after nearly 20 hours when an Anonymous asked in a ‘TORCHAN’ board (http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/): “How do we know you are not an FBI scum?” A real scummy question indeed. I wish I had a gentle reply! It’ll attract more slang designed only for the world wide web if you can’t prove that you’re not really an “FBI scum”. Other boards bore no fruit, not in the 20-hour deadline I had set for myself knowing that it was too short. I again entered the web this time to get some tips about the ‘biggest data heist’ that had shaken the world a few months ago where one billion Yahoo! user profiles were stolen and sold to three parties for a hefty price and as per security farms, the hoaxers were still hanging around. Is anyone still lurking behind the darkness to sell some more staff? I just tried my luck to trace. I wish I had some luck and some leads. Waiting for 20 hours is not enough, you need to wait for long to take every precaution possible to hide your IP before moving towards any illegitimate transaction. Considering such transactions, the year 2016 saw a record rate of increasing cyber attacks and data theft; the Yahoo data breach was the biggest among them. It is not only the biggest data heist in web history, but it has some more serious implications for future generations. The disaster has just begun; it is personal and financial. Forget about the rest of the world, in India, cyber crimes registered under IPC went up to nearly 50 per cent last year. When a giant organisation loses the user profile database because of hacking, worst hit are those individuals who don’t know the ‘ABCD’ of cyber security. They instantly become soft targets for Phishing attacks and social engineering and the news of individual financial losses are rarely published. Actually anyone could buy anything in the web through the ‘TOR NETWORK’ and the insatiable appetite could titillate from ‘anything to anybody’. And that was the reason why after three years the stolen Yahoo! data was put in the web marketplace by a black hat hacker who goes with the pseudo name, ‘Tressa88’. It all started the same way on one fine morning in March last year. The date was March 25, 2016 and the time (as shown on the forum board) was 05.28 hours. It must have been early morning in Russia when the black hat hacker, Tressa88, logged in and hinted about the Yahoo! data ‘dumps’ for the first time. The language appeared to be Russian indeed and it was a Russian message board running undercover. Who is Tressa88? The black hat hacker claimed, “I am a very old inhabitant of the network:) and that was true.” Why the name Tressa88? The hacker announced in a chat that it is not his real name, but the name of “a whore from Australia”. The director of Eastern European research and analysis for the security firm, Flashpoint Intel Andrei Barysevich, claimed that behind the alias Tessa88 there are actually two people, perhaps a female and a male. It is quite likely that behind this alias an underground group lurks in shadows. Tressa88 posted the first message in Russian and the first few lines in English translation were like this: [Only registered and activated users can see links] For a review 10% discount Important:! All goods in EMEIL format; PASS or a HASH Only fresh and 100% private boxes Shell for mailing. With the criteria of sending and delivery pisma._3 $ _1 1) VK.COM_137.000.000 email accounts; pass_pfone; pass 2) MOBANGO_6.000.000 entries id: email; pass 3) MYSPACE_380.000.000 id records: mail: hash… Since we’re not registered, we could not see the links that user Tressa88 had posted and boasted about the ‘dumps’. But as usual they were either ‘onion’ links for Bitcoin wallet or belonged to any private network and they were meant for the dark web transactions only. If you go through the whole message, you would not probably find any mention of Yahoo! data at first glance. Instead Tress88 said that he was ready to sell user profile data from other sites such as MYSPACE, MOBANGO and the like. This part of the message was important as on the last line of the list he hinted about many other sites. 1) VK.COM 137.000.000 email accounts; pass_pfone; pass 2) MOBANGO_6.000.000 entries id: email; pass 3) MYSPACE_380.000.000 id records: mail: hash 4) QIP-133.000.000 records …. 10) And many other sites. Specify in Message. He was ready to sell from MYSPACE and other sites, including Russian social media. And the largest data belongs to MYSAPCE — it has almost 400 million user profile database. But there was a hint that he has something special to announce at the end of the page.After his first post, within eight hours Tressa88 got an answer from another user called Mr Mongo. And then afterwards users such as ‘Fifty’, ‘Edgar’ and ‘ionline’ joined the conversation asking questions about the data and in no time it became  international news and because of that Yahoo! had to admit on September 22: “We believe that at least 500 million user accounts were stolen, which would make it the biggest breach of all time, bigger than the MySpace breach of 427 million user accounts.”Remember the list, Tressa88 posted in that message board. MYSPACE was among them and the number matched with the Yahoo! statement. As their conversation moved forward, Tressa88 kept writing like this on March 28 last: Tressa88 03/28/2016, 06:12 Reviews have to exploit. kardklub Fak and others. Dame forward to nick a turnip. Garant welcome. There are many other dumps, full format, and a lot of different dating mail; pass Look at the date on which Tressa88 wrote his second message. It was in 2016 on March 28 and on September 22, after nearly six months, Yahoo! again published a long statement on their website: “It is confirmed, based on a recent probe, a copy of certain user account data was stolen from our network in late 2014 by what we believe is a state-sponsored actor. The account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers…..”. In the same breath, Yahoo! assured its users that the stolen data did not contain credit card and debit card details. Was this assurance enough to have the peace of mind? No! Any computer literate person knows that any type of profile information may invite Phishing attacks much later once black hat hackers get that profile data in their possession. The hackers will definitely use it for social engineering. Both these hacking tricks involve disguise as the hacker may appear as a friend or the user’s known bank source. An innocent user will never suspect and once he/she clicks a link sending by the known ‘bank’ source, the link leads to a fake login page that collects the user’s login credentials and delivers them to the hackers. By the time when the whole world came to know about the biggest data heist in the history of web, the cyber security people were in tizzy. The question that tormented the cyber security personnel was — when the Yahoo! data breach occurred in 2013, why did Tessa88 take so many years to announce about the ‘dumps’? What happened in between? Had they social engineered millions of people in between? Had they exhausted all potentials of Phishing attacks in between? By the time the entire world came to know about the Yahoo! data heist, the cyber security personnel  were in a tizzy Later it came out that the stolen profile database included plenty of American military and security personnel who used to keep their official emails as recovering emails in their Yahoo! accounts. Was there really any state actor functioning behind when that attack took place as Yahoo! claimed? Did Tressa88 act as a front for any foreign spy master? Or the black hat hackers simply sold the stolen data to any state actor? And so the mystery deepens. On December 14, 2016, Yahoo! again issued a statement: “Yahoo! has identified the data security issues concerning certain user accounts. Yahoo! has taken steps to secure user accounts and is working closely with law enforcement.” But it was too late. The damage has already been done. You will never get the exact figure of individual victims. Unsuspecting users, who normally use the same username and password combinations in various sites, fall prey easily to the cyber criminals and these gullible people have a tendency to click every link sent by the fraudsters disguised as ‘friends’ and ‘banks’ without hesitation or suspecting any fraud. In the last year’s RSA Conference, ‘Tripwire’ conducted a survey. It asked 200 security professionals to express their concern about the state of Phishing attacks and it came out that more than half (58 per cent) of respondents stated their organisations had seen an increase in Phishing attacks in the past year. ‘Verizon’, in its 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report, noted that the growth of Phishing attacks in both frequency and sophistication poses a significant threat to all organisations. Now, think about those who don’t even know that clicking a link may spell disaster for them, at least financially. Let us again forget about India. Consider the case of British supermarket giant, Tesco Bank. Earlier November last year, the consumer finance wing of Tesco Bank had to freeze its online operations after as many as 20,000 customers had their money stolen from their accounts. They admitted in their website that nearly 40,000 accounts had been compromised and half of those had lost their money. It’s really difficult to diagnose the Phishing attacks in isolation when someone steals money from a British account sitting many thousands of  miles away in a different country. ‘All-in-One-Checker,’ is a hacking tool — it is available in the market — which can check if the hacked username and password combinations from one website work on another website or not. So, there are plenty of depressing possibilities that these black hat hackers stole the data much before and exhausted all the ways of making money and after that they decided to make some final dollars and appeared after three years. Now think about those who don’t know that by clicking a link you are leading yourself into losing a lot of money ‘Yahoo!’ claimed in its statement that they found some state actors behind the whole breach. By the middle of 2016, we came to know about one more hacker — ‘Peace of Mind’. A few months later, Tressa88 started selling through Russian underground forums, the same data resurfaced in The Real Deal Market (TRDM) — a dark web marketplace. This time the seller’s name was ‘Peace of Mind’ and the hacker was identified as male. A clear rivalry started between them as Tressa88 later told a security farm, ‘Peace_of_mind [is] a faggot who takes undue credit’. According to Tressa88, ‘Peace of Mind’ was his accomplice with  whom “I shared a dump for analysis! And he started selling it.” ‘Peace of Mind’ made same allegations about ‘Tressa88, “He stole [the hacked databases] from an old buddy long ago and started selling them.” Tressa88 accused Peace of Mind had been cheating him since he gave the latter a few database dumps to decrypt. Calling Tressa88 a thief,  Peace of Mind said one of his old friend had had the dumps originally, but Tressa88 stole from him and started selling it. As soon as the sabre-rattling died down, other hackers started pelting the TRDM with Denial of Service’ attacks. The black hat hacker community got angry because the ‘dumps’ were not up to the mark. The buyers were disgusted with poor  quality of ‘dumps’. The reason was simple. They had hoped they could gain financially from those ‘dumps’ by duping innocent people. One is not in a position to decide whether this was pure drama and they had made this story simply to show the investigators a different line of attack. All we know know is that in the past two to three years countless people had their money stolen without knowing the source of the fraudulent activities. All the time through the TOR NETWORK forums people want information about other people in exchange of money. What type of information? Let’s have a look at the ‘INTEL EXCHANGE’ forum (HTTP:// rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion). A user asks, ‘im trying to get some info on a person. her name is ‘….. Shes from sarasota florida, got 2 kids — ‘….’ and ‘…..’ she did me wrong so im looking for all the info I can get on her.’ (I have kept the spelling unchanged and the names withheld). Another user asks about an ‘Onion’ site and the forum administrator warns that the site might be a FBI honey spot. But these types of people who are asking for trivial help in the underground forum are not concerns of the civilised world. What happened after Tressa88 and Peace of Mind had started selling the ‘dumps’ was the perfect storm. The black hat hackers went for a ‘Denial of Service’ attacks on TRDM and tried to shut it down because there had been a feeling among them that they were cheated by users, Tressa88 and Peace of Mind. This is proof enough to show how common people become the main target of these fraudsters.For the time being, we may conclude that the financial disaster has just begun. It has not completed the full circle yet. We have to wait for another five or 10 years to know its full outcome. From the Digital India perspective, one may also hope that the government would organise more awareness campaigns on how to spot a Phishing attack. Otherwise innocent people may involuntarily give these new-age cyber criminals free rein to exploit the digital dream. letters@tehelka.com (Published in Tehelka Magazine, Volume 14 Issue 2, Dated January 20, 2017) Sanjib Sinha     More by the author > Tags: bigest data heist, bitcoins, cyber attack, cyber crime, DEGITAL INDIA, digital dream, EDGAR, FBI, hacker, TESSA 88, Tesso Bank, torchan, Yahoo, ‘INTEL EXCHANGE’ Comments are closed Advertisement LATEST ON TEHELKA Shiv Sena breaks ties with BJP, to go solo in Mumbai civic polls China and Pakistan indispensable, eye India suspiciously Blackbuck case: Salman Khan pleads not guilty in Jodhpur court Cannot order the states to ban cow slaughter: SC Border wall: Miffed Mexican President cancels trip to US Advertisement Read More Only transparency can solve cyber nightmare ‘At 16 I was in love with a famous hacker, and the FBI was after us’ Advertisement Twitter Tweets by @Tehelka Advertisement Advertisement Awards and Achievements Jobs Tehelka Hindi Copyright © 2017 — Tehelka – Investigations, Latest News, Politics, Analysis, Blogs, Culture, Photos, Videos, Podcasts.

You’re Wrong… It’s This Published Thu, Jul 21, 2016  |  Louis Basenese, Investment Director If you needed any further proof that patents are invaluable, we got it on Monday. In one of the biggest tech mergers of the year, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. (SFTBY), announced that it’s acquiring British chip designer, ARM Holdings Plc (ARMH). As my colleague Greg Miller detailed yesterday, the $32 billion tie-up makes eminent sense and is notable for the validation it brings to the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) mega-trend. But stop and think for a moment: What is SoftBank actually buying here? After all, ARM doesn’t make a single product. It doesn’t even market a single product. Heck, ask any man on the street if he’s ever heard of the company and you’ll likely get a blank stare in response. And yet, without ARM’s technology, that man’s mobile device (or two) wouldn’t work. How can that be? It’s simple, really. ARM doesn’t make products. It specializes in product know-how and information. The company designs chips and then licenses its blueprints to all the bigs – including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Samsung, and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM). Its technical expertise is undisputed, given its treasure trove of over 4,500 granted or pending worldwide patents. And the fact that ARM’s designs can now be found in almost 15 billion mobile devices testifies to the relevance and desperate commercial need for that expertise. This chart illustrates the most important takeaway for investors… The Next Paradigm Shift A shift is underway in the technology sector. Mobile devices – namely smartphones – are peaking. Case in point: IDC estimates that smartphone shipments will only grow by 3% this year. That’s way down from the 10.5% growth rate last year. And as market saturation sets in, all attention is focused on identifying “the next big thing.” The consensus bet? The IoT, whereby all manner of physical devices, systems, networks, and appliances become connected to the internet. I’ve outlined the astronomical projections for the IoT here before. But to recap: Gartner says the number of connected “things” will surge by 30% year over year to 6.4 billion in 2016. And by 2020, the research firm estimates there will be 20.8 billion connected devices. Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) cranks its projection way higher. It expects 50 billion connected devices by 2020. And Intel Corp. (INTC) is uber-bullish, forecasting the number to balloon to 200 billion devices over the same period. In total dollar amounts, we’re talking about a market that will be worth more than $1.7 trillion by 2020, according to IDC’s latest estimates. Against that backdrop, SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son’s statement at a company conference in 2014 doesn’t seem so far-fetched anymore. Back then, he declared, “Each individual, on average, will have more than 1,000 devices that are connected to the internet by 2040.” ARM Leads the Arms Race ARM’s intellectual property promises to play a large role in this emerging reality, as its chip designs are increasingly applicable to smart cars, TVs, servers, wearables, drones, and smart homes. Hence, SoftBank’s acquisition. As Greg Miller mentioned yesterday, the company is positioning itself to profit handsomely from the next wave of “mobile” devices. Make no mistake, though… there are other formidable patent holders in the IoT space. For example, in May, I revealed that QUALCOMM reigned supreme in terms of IoT patent filing activity. “Not only does the company hold the most patent grants and applications in the space – 724 compared to nearest competitors Intel (688) and ZTE (351) – it also holds the most valuable patents, based on LexInnova’s analysis.” Back then, I also singled out InterDigital Inc. (IDCC) as a major contender in the IoT industry, given that the company ranks in the top 10 in terms of total IoT patents, in the top five for patent strength, and, like QUALCOMM, it’s also trading at a discount to the market and its long-term averages. On the heels of the huge premium that SoftBank paid for ARM’s patents, both QUALCOMM and InterDigital represent even more compelling investments. Or as The Verge’s Vlad Savov wrote, “The information age is defined by companies like ARM, whose assets are intangible.” Indeed. Simply put, I’ll reiterate what I said last week: “Patents matter more than ever in our global economy – both for businesses and investors alike.” So invest accordingly.
