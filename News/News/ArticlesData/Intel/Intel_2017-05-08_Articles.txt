MSI's upcoming X299 motherboard has a bunch of beautiful RGB LEDs running under the hood, with three M.2 slots on the motherboard and plenty of x16 ports for 4-way SLI/CF systems.     It will be using the upcoming LGA 2066 socket, and MSI's own Audio Boost VI technology - and MSI will reportedly be using a 6-pin PCIe power connector above the first PCIe x16 slot, something that you'll need when running multi-GPU configurations. MSI will be making this X299 board their showcase motherboard for high-end/enthusiast systems, and I can't wait to build a new PC around it. Oh yeah.   Intel will reportedly be launching 12C/24T processors based on the upcoming Kaby Lake X architecture, a knee jerk reaction to the multi-threaded war that AMD is waging with Intel and its Ryzen processors. These new high-end CPUs are being dropped two months early, with Intel seemingly scared out of their pants over Ryzen.   I touched on this in a previous article on April 19: "I think Intel is definitely acting differently since the launch of Ryzen, and that a big show at Computex 2017 next month will be an interesting time, if the once almost too confident Intel is pushed in to a corner. It'll only see them drop prices and compete in a way we have probably never seen before from the company, and now that AMD has shown us some massive IPC improvements from Ryzen, AMD are only going to fight back with 12C/24T, 16C/32T at a rumored $999, and even 32C/64T variants of its next-gen processors".

By Jennifer Booton Published: May 8, 2017 3:29 p.m. ET Share Analysts expect Nvidia’s biggest business to take hit from AMD and Intel competition Ethan Miller/Getty Images Nvidia may be losing some of its gaming edge By JenniferBooton Reporter Nvidia Corp. is expected to report Tuesday that its first-quarter earnings nearly doubled, but sales may show signs of deceleration as its videogame graphics division suffers competition from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. While Nvidia NVDA, -1.05%  graced the Consumer Electronics Show keynote stage in January with fresh promises of innovation in the fast-growing industries of driverless cars, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, graphics processing units for videogames continue to be the company’s bread-and-butter and largest source of revenue. While its newer businesses grew fast and attracted a lot of attention as Nvidia became the hottest stock of 2016, the 44% gain for the videogame business is what provided most of the revenue growth for the company last year. Read: Nvidia pushes for artificial intelligence in more than just self-driving cars A recent slowdown and fears of tough year-over-year comparisons for the chips that power videogame graphics, however, have analysts warning that Nvidia’s first-quarter and current-quarter outlooks may fall short of expectations. “It appears that investors are fixated on the Gaming side of the business (most lean negative) and think it will be difficult to see sequential revenue growth from April to July,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Nvidia to report GAAP earnings per share of 66 cents, compared with 33 cents in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items that occurred during the quarter, Nvidia analysts are calling for non-GAAP earnings of 81 cents, versus 46 cents. Estimize, a software platform that pools together estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expects Nvidia to report non-GAAP earnings of 75 cents a share. See also: Mobileye deal gives Intel the lead in self-driving car race Nvidia has topped both the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates by a wide margin in recent quarters. It has surpassed earnings expectations for six-straight quarters, beating the FactSet consensus estimate by nearly 18% last quarter and 48% in the in the quarter before that. Revenue: Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $1.9 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the FactSet consensus estimate. Estimize is also forecasting Nvidia sales of $1.9 billion. Nvidia has surpassed both expectations in each of the past seven quarters. Stock reaction: Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, though its growth has decelerated this calendar year. While shares of Nvidia remain up 192% from 12 months ago, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00%  , up 16.5%, they’ve underperformed more recently. Shares of Nvidia have declined by 13% in the past three months, while the index is up 4.5%. Also Read: Beastly Nvidia earnings beaten by burden of high expectations The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $114.65, implying further upside. Shares of Nvidia traded around $103.29 on Tuesday. What to watch for: Intel INTC, -0.76%  and AMD AMD, -1.47%  have both made inroads with their professional graphics chips, which Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell said is causing Nvidia to lose share in a market it has long dominated. McConnell is one of the most bearish analysts covering Nvidia stock, with a rating the equivalent to sell and a 12-month price target of $90. He downgraded the stock last month. Instinet analyst Romit Shah and BMO Capital analyst Ambrish Srivastava both also downgraded Nvidia last quarter. Other analysts—even more bullish ones such as SIG Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a $110 target on the stock—have expressed similar sentiment about gaming. The difference between the various points of views is whether or not they think Nvidia can offset those declines in the near-term with faster-growing parts of its business, such as data center chips. See also: AMD’s stock plunges to biggest loss in more than 12 years Nvidia’s gaming revenue soared 66% to $1.3 billion last quarter, while data-center sales tripled to $296 million. RBC’s Mitch Steves is among the more bullish analysts on Nvidia’s stock with an outperform rating and 12-month price target of $130, and believes muted expectations for gaming may be offset by ongoing strength in the company’s data center business. McConnell, on-the-other-hand, said he’s concerned about signs of desktop GPU market saturation, lower margins from Nintendo Switch revenue and a “possible sales pause in the company’s datacenter business this summer.” Rolland cited widespread adoption of Nvidia’s ADAS platform for driverless cars and demand from original equipment manufacturers for virtual reality systems as positives.

By Jennifer Booton Published: May 8, 2017 3:29 p.m. ET Share Analysts expect Nvidia’s biggest business to take hit from AMD and Intel competition Ethan Miller/Getty Images Nvidia may be losing some of its gaming edge By JenniferBooton Reporter Nvidia Corp. is expected to report Tuesday that its first-quarter earnings nearly doubled, but sales may show signs of deceleration as its videogame graphics division suffers competition from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. While Nvidia NVDA, -1.05%  graced the Consumer Electronics Show keynote stage in January with fresh promises of innovation in the fast-growing industries of driverless cars, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, graphics processing units for videogames continue to be the company’s bread-and-butter and largest source of revenue. While its newer businesses grew fast and attracted a lot of attention as Nvidia became the hottest stock of 2016, the 44% gain for the videogame business is what provided most of the revenue growth for the company last year. Read: Nvidia pushes for artificial intelligence in more than just self-driving cars A recent slowdown and fears of tough year-over-year comparisons for the chips that power videogame graphics, however, have analysts warning that Nvidia’s first-quarter and current-quarter outlooks may fall short of expectations. “It appears that investors are fixated on the Gaming side of the business (most lean negative) and think it will be difficult to see sequential revenue growth from April to July,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Nvidia to report GAAP earnings per share of 66 cents, compared with 33 cents in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items that occurred during the quarter, Nvidia analysts are calling for non-GAAP earnings of 81 cents, versus 46 cents. Estimize, a software platform that pools together estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expects Nvidia to report non-GAAP earnings of 75 cents a share. See also: Mobileye deal gives Intel the lead in self-driving car race Nvidia has topped both the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates by a wide margin in recent quarters. It has surpassed earnings expectations for six-straight quarters, beating the FactSet consensus estimate by nearly 18% last quarter and 48% in the in the quarter before that. Revenue: Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $1.9 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the FactSet consensus estimate. Estimize is also forecasting Nvidia sales of $1.9 billion. Nvidia has surpassed both expectations in each of the past seven quarters. Stock reaction: Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, though its growth has decelerated this calendar year. While shares of Nvidia remain up 192% from 12 months ago, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00%  , up 16.5%, they’ve underperformed more recently. Shares of Nvidia have declined by 13% in the past three months, while the index is up 4.5%. Also Read: Beastly Nvidia earnings beaten by burden of high expectations The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $114.65, implying further upside. Shares of Nvidia traded around $103.29 on Tuesday. What to watch for: Intel INTC, -0.76%  and AMD AMD, -1.47%  have both made inroads with their professional graphics chips, which Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell said is causing Nvidia to lose share in a market it has long dominated. McConnell is one of the most bearish analysts covering Nvidia stock, with a rating the equivalent to sell and a 12-month price target of $90. He downgraded the stock last month. Instinet analyst Romit Shah and BMO Capital analyst Ambrish Srivastava both also downgraded Nvidia last quarter. Other analysts—even more bullish ones such as SIG Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a $110 target on the stock—have expressed similar sentiment about gaming. The difference between the various points of views is whether or not they think Nvidia can offset those declines in the near-term with faster-growing parts of its business, such as data center chips. See also: AMD’s stock plunges to biggest loss in more than 12 years Nvidia’s gaming revenue soared 66% to $1.3 billion last quarter, while data-center sales tripled to $296 million. RBC’s Mitch Steves is among the more bullish analysts on Nvidia’s stock with an outperform rating and 12-month price target of $130, and believes muted expectations for gaming may be offset by ongoing strength in the company’s data center business. McConnell, on-the-other-hand, said he’s concerned about signs of desktop GPU market saturation, lower margins from Nintendo Switch revenue and a “possible sales pause in the company’s datacenter business this summer.” Rolland cited widespread adoption of Nvidia’s ADAS platform for driverless cars and demand from original equipment manufacturers for virtual reality systems as positives.

Not signed up? Create an Account • May 8, 2017 Tweet Oregon's tech sector goes from hot to lukewarm By MIKE ROGOWAY The Oregonian/OregonLive PORTLAND — The Silicon Forest is in a slump. Tech was Oregon's hottest sector coming out of the Great Recession, handily outpacing other industries in job and wage growth. By 2013 tech accounted for nearly 12 percent of all Oregon wages, as big a share as wood products in its heyday. Something's changed. The industry didn't add any jobs the last 10 months of 2016 amid a sell-off of the state's biggest technology companies and a sharp decline in startup funding. In recent years, tech wage growth has fallen behind the Oregon average. It's a puzzling development, given that tech remains a robust field nationally and the rest of Oregon's economy is sizzling. Statewide unemployment is at its lowest point on record, at 3.8 percent. So what's going on? There's no clear answer, but Oregon tech may be suffering an innovation deficit, contributing to a broader malaise. “People move to Oregon to settle down and get out of it,” lamented Josh Hartung, chief executive of Portland autonomous driving startup PolySync. “The net effect is we don't shoot as high as some of the other cities on the West Coast, and also frown on those that do.” That's not a new complaint — Portland has been fighting its tag as a “lifestyle” city, devoid of ambition, for decades. A half-dozen tech startups that emerged from the 2007-09 recession — among them data center manager Puppet and online banker Simple — appeared to have the city on its way to changing its image. With job growth slowing, though, and a dearth of bright prospects, that old narrative seems to be back. Stagnation has hit both Oregon's aging hardware ecosystem and its emerging software sector, according to Josh Lehner, with the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. “Within the broader tech sector it seems to have slowed down in the last six to nine to 12 months,” Lehner said. His calculations show that Oregon tech employment leveled off even as the sector continued its rapid ascent nationally: at the end of March, the four most valuable companies in the world (Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon) were all U.S. technology businesses. Tech jobs pay an average of $106,000 annually, according to government data, more than double the state's median wage. That underscores just how vital the industry is to Oregon. Yet the falloff in job growth is being reflected in the sector's wages: Over the past two years, pay across Oregon industries has outpaced gains in tech. Oregon's slowdown coincided with massive job cuts at Intel that began last spring. The company is the state's largest private employer, and last year's restructuring was the biggest in its history. Though those cuts took a wrenching personal toll on 15,000 individual employees across the company - Intel hasn't said how many of those were in Oregon — the net effect was relatively muted at its Washington County campuses. Intel said recently it employs 19,300 in Oregon, just 200 below its all-time high in 2015. That indicates Intel hired almost as many new workers as it shed with the cutbacks. More than Intel, then, Oregon's high-tech slowdown may reflect some longstanding issues: —Oregon's Silicon Forest sprouted around a single hardware company, Tektronix, which became a freewheeling idea factory that attracted engineers from around the country. Tek helped lure Intel to Oregon, and spun off dozens of companies that seeded an entire ecosystem. After Tektronix began a long-term decline in the 1980s, though, no other company emerged to fill the same role, not even Intel. — The state's largest technology companies were growing slowly, if at all, even before a multibillion-dollar selloff that began in 2014. They hadn't expanded beyond their niches in years, so when the tech industry began consolidating they were prey for larger businesses. Mentor Graphics, for example, was the only billion-dollar company to emerge from Tektronix - but under investor pressure last year, it agreed to become a small part of the portfolio of German engineering giant Siemens. — The spate of takeovers only exacerbated Oregon's dubious status as a tech outpost, far from the corporate innovation hubs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, for example, have had outposts in the Portland area for years - but none has grown into a major research site for those companies. — Intel continues doing cutting-edge work in Hillsboro, but few other Oregon outposts are leading their companies’ research or adding jobs. Take the data centers popping up across central and eastern Oregon — they carry such brand names as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, but nearly all the work is done by faceless computers, not by inventive engineers. — Those outposts do pay well, and are major contributors to Oregon's economy. But comfortable, six-figure salaries reduce the incentive for entrepreneurs to set out on their own — the way they did a decade ago, when the tech economy was in the tank. — And while some members of the latest class of Oregon startups have developed promising businesses, they're in narrow sectors such as social media marketing. Portland is still a bargain compared with Seattle or Silicon Valley, but it's still not a compelling draw for ambitious young companies that want to do more than save money. In the past two years, nearly all of the state's large tech companies - including TriQuint Semiconductor, FEI Co., Cascade Microtech, Planar Systems and Mentor - found out-of-state buyers. Those companies date to another era, aging businesses that hadn't expanded beyond their core markets. And though the change in ownership hasn't produced large-scale job cuts, the new owners have given no indication they intend to expand their Oregon outposts. And as the old guard leaves the scene, Oregon has yet to produce a new generation of high-tech stalwart to take their place. Oregon upstarts have delivered uneven returns for investors. There have been a handful of prominent deals — such as Elemental Technologies’ $296 million sale to Amazon in 2015 — but also plenty of disappointments. It took Webtrends’ owners 12 years to find a way out of that company, and Jive Software sold this past week for less than half its 2011 IPO price. “What I would like to see more from Oregon entrepreneurs generally is shooting higher and talking louder,” said PolySync's Hartung. PolySync moved to Southeast Portland last year from northern Idaho, in search of a broader talent pool to help the company grow. It now employs 30, and Hartung said he's been very satisfied with the skills he's found in the city. Yet he also said the city's culture favors those who choose to be practical and sensible over those who would risk falling on their face for the chance of accomplishing something profound. “That's reflected in our tech sector, as well, which tends to be enablement technology. We build the solid back-end which enables other people's hype,” Hartung said. “The question we have to ask is, ‘How do we get a little bit of that hype?’” Rick Turoczy, an evangelist for Portland startups and general manager of the Portland Incubator Experiment, agrees that Oregon has traditionally played a supporting role in building up new technologies. And that may be part of why the local tech scene is in a lull. “Oregon does a really good job once the market has been established,” Turoczy said. “We don't ever seem to be the ones establishing the market.” At the moment, technologies such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and a class of connected devices called the Internet of Things all seem to have the potential to dramatically remake our relationship with the world. But none of those technologies has found mainstream acceptance - and so aren't yet ready for the kind of complementary role Oregon tech has historically played. As those new technologies ripen, though, Turoczy said he expects to see a rebound among Portland startups. He said technologists working at larger businesses have been nurturing new ideas on the side, quietly harboring some entrepreneurial instincts as well. “There is an ebb and flow to it,” Turoczy said. “People who have been at those companies four to five years are starting to get the itch to want to do something new.” Though Oregon tech hasn't been growing lately, it hasn't contracted, either. That's something of an accomplishment, given the scale of disruption at Intel and all the big companies that have been sold. And while Portland lacks some assets other tech hubs enjoy, namely a major research university and an established investment community to help new companies grow, the city remains an attractive destination for educated professionals and continues to draw from other parts of the country. So maybe a pause isn't such a bad thing, especially considering the economic burdens rapid tech growth has created in Seattle and San Francisco. Turoczy said Portland's tech culture has always been different, and if it isn't producing headline-grabbing startups, the city may be achieving something meaningful in its own way. “People here, they've always been more motivated by curiosity and craft than financial reward,” he said. “We're not so focused on the business being the be-all and end-all of our existence. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.” ___ Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com   Related Articles AN F.A.Q.

Weiss EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 The firmware vulnerability can be found in systems running versions of Intel's active, standard or small business management features. Related Media Intel Ends its Annual Intel Developer Forum Event After 20 Years Security Sense: Australia Just Showed the World the Problem with Mandatory Metadata Retention Security Sense: Security is Becoming Too Hard for the Layperson Advertisement Intel is releasing a “critical” firmware update to systems makers to battle a recently reported security vulnerability in its chips which can allow an attacker to remotely gain access to PCs built for business users and other devices that incorporate special Intel business management features. The “escalation of privilege vulnerability “ affects systems built for business use that include special Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM) or Intel Small Business Technology firmware, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6, the company reported in a May 1 security advisory. The vulnerability can “allow an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features” in the products, giving them access to the machines and data, according to Intel. Firmware versions before Version 6 or after Version 11.6 are not included in the security advisory. If the systems do not include Intel AMT, SBA or ISM capabilities, then they are also not affected. Consumer PCs built with Intel processors are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not use the business-targeted management firmware that is vulnerable to the attacks, the company stated. Also not affected by the vulnerabilities are Intel servers using Intel Server Platform Services (Intel SPS) features, as well as Intel Xeon Processor E3 and Intel Xeon Processor E5 workstations utilizing Intel SPS firmware. The vulnerabilities can be accesses in two ways by network attackers, including by provisioning manageability features that can gain unprivileged network or local system privileges of Intel AMT, ISM or SBT firmware, or by gaining system privileges for AMT or ISM firmware. The SBT firmware is not affected by the second attack scenario, according to the company. Intel advises business customers to check their systems to determine if they have any machines affected by the vulnerability by using a free, downloadable discovery tool that will analyze systems to look for the security problem. “IT professionals who are familiar with the configuration of their systems and networks can use this tool, or can see our security advisory for full details on vulnerability detection and mitigation,” the company said in a statement. “We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem and we are collaborating with computer-makers to facilitate a rapid and smooth integration with their software,” Intel stated. “We expect computer-makers to make updates available beginning the week of May 8 and continuing thereafter.” If the vulnerabilities are found or if the discovery tool can’t determine if the systems are affected, customers are being advised to take mitigation steps using Intel’s mitigation guide to secure their systems as quickly as possible, the post continued. As part of the mitigations on affected machines, all capabilities and features provided by AMT, ISM and SBT will be made unavailable until corrected firmware is installed later to re-enable the features after fixes are established, according to Intel. Business computer makers, including HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dell, have been issuing their own advisories to customers to share their plans for updates incorporating the new Intel firmware code for affected machines. Reached via email by ITPro, a spokesperson for Intel had no additional comments on the vulnerabilities. “The security and confidence of the people and businesses who use Intel products and technologies are paramount to us, and we are doing everything we can to address the situation as quickly as possible,” the company said in its May 5 post on the topic.

The Silicon Forest is in a slump. Tech was Oregon's hottest sector coming out of the Great Recession, handily outpacing other industries in job and wage growth. By 2013 tech accounted for nearly 12 percent of all Oregon wages, as big a share as wood products in its heyday. Something's changed. The industry didn't add any jobs the last 10 months of 2016 amid a sell-off of the state's biggest technology companies and a sharp decline in startup funding. In recent years, tech wage growth has fallen behind the Oregon average. It's a puzzling development, given that tech remains a robust field nationally and the rest of Oregon's economy is sizzling. Statewide unemployment is at its lowest point on record, at 3.8 percent. So what's going on? There's no clear answer, but Oregon tech may be suffering an innovation deficit, contributing to a broader malaise. "People move to Oregon to settle down and get out of it," lamented Josh Hartung, chief executive of Portland autonomous driving startup PolySync. "The net effect is we don't shoot as high as some of the other cities on the West Coast, and also frown on those that do." That's not a new complaint — Portland has been fighting its tag as a "lifestyle" city, devoid of ambition, for decades. A half-dozen tech startups that emerged from the 2007-09 recession — among them data center manager Puppet and online banker Simple — appeared to have the city on its way to changing its image. With job growth slowing, though, and a dearth of bright prospects, that old narrative seems to be back. Stagnation has hit both Oregon's aging hardware ecosystem and its emerging software sector, according to Josh Lehner, with the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. "Within the broader tech sector it seems to have slowed down in the last six to nine to 12 months," Lehner said. His calculations show that Oregon tech employment leveled off even as the sector continued its rapid ascent nationally: at the end of March, the four most valuable companies in the world (Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon) were all U.S. technology businesses. Tech jobs pay an average of $106,000 annually, according to government data, more than double the state's median wage. That underscores just how vital the industry is to Oregon. Yet the falloff in job growth is being reflected in the sector's wages: Over the past two years, pay across Oregon industries has outpaced gains in tech. Oregon's slowdown coincided with massive job cuts at Intel that began last spring. The company is the state's largest private employer, and last year's restructuring was the biggest in its history. Though those cuts took a wrenching personal toll on 15,000 individual employees across the company - Intel hasn't said how many of those were in Oregon — the net effect was relatively muted at its Washington County campuses. Intel said recently it employs 19,300 in Oregon, just 200 below its all-time high in 2015. That indicates Intel hired almost as many new workers as it shed with the cutbacks. More than Intel, then, Oregon's high-tech slowdown may reflect some longstanding issues: —Oregon's Silicon Forest sprouted around a single hardware company, Tektronix, which became a freewheeling idea factory that attracted engineers from around the country. Tek helped lure Intel to Oregon, and spun off dozens of companies that seeded an entire ecosystem. After Tektronix began a long-term decline in the 1980s, though, no other company emerged to fill the same role, not even Intel. — The state's largest technology companies were growing slowly, if at all, even before a multibillion-dollar selloff that began in 2014. They hadn't expanded beyond their niches in years, so when the tech industry began consolidating they were prey for larger businesses. Mentor Graphics, for example, was the only billion-dollar company to emerge from Tektronix - but under investor pressure last year, it agreed to become a small part of the portfolio of German engineering giant Siemens. — The spate of takeovers only exacerbated Oregon's dubious status as a tech outpost, far from the corporate innovation hubs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, for example, have had outposts in the Portland area for years - but none has grown into a major research site for those companies. — Intel continues doing cutting-edge work in Hillsboro, but few other Oregon outposts are leading their companies' research or adding jobs. Take the data centers popping up across central and eastern Oregon — they carry such brand names as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, but nearly all the work is done by faceless computers, not by inventive engineers. — Those outposts do pay well, and are major contributors to Oregon's economy. But comfortable, six-figure salaries reduce the incentive for entrepreneurs to set out on their own — the way they did a decade ago, when the tech economy was in the tank. — And while some members of the latest class of Oregon startups have developed promising businesses, they're in narrow sectors such as social media marketing. Portland is still a bargain compared with Seattle or Silicon Valley, but it's still not a compelling draw for ambitious young companies that want to do more than save money. In the past two years, nearly all of the state's large tech companies - including TriQuint Semiconductor, FEI Co., Cascade Microtech, Planar Systems and Mentor - found out-of-state buyers. Those companies date to another era, aging businesses that hadn't expanded beyond their core markets. And though the change in ownership hasn't produced large-scale job cuts, the new owners have given no indication they intend to expand their Oregon outposts. And as the old guard leaves the scene, Oregon has yet to produce a new generation of high-tech stalwart to take their place. Oregon upstarts have delivered uneven returns for investors. There have been a handful of prominent deals — such as Elemental Technologies' $296 million sale to Amazon in 2015 — but also plenty of disappointments. It took Webtrends' owners 12 years to find a way out of that company, and Jive Software sold this past week for less than half its 2011 IPO price. "What I would like to see more from Oregon entrepreneurs generally is shooting higher and talking louder," said PolySync's Hartung. PolySync moved to Southeast Portland last year from northern Idaho, in search of a broader talent pool to help the company grow. It now employs 30, and Hartung said he's been very satisfied with the skills he's found in the city. Yet he also said the city's culture favors those who choose to be practical and sensible over those who would risk falling on their face for the chance of accomplishing something profound. "That's reflected in our tech sector, as well, which tends to be enablement technology. We build the solid back-end which enables other people's hype," Hartung said. "The question we have to ask is, 'How do we get a little bit of that hype?'" Rick Turoczy, an evangelist for Portland startups and general manager of the Portland Incubator Experiment, agrees that Oregon has traditionally played a supporting role in building up new technologies. And that may be part of why the local tech scene is in a lull. "Oregon does a really good job once the market has been established," Turoczy said. "We don't ever seem to be the ones establishing the market." At the moment, technologies such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and a class of connected devices called the Internet of Things all seem to have the potential to dramatically remake our relationship with the world. But none of those technologies has found mainstream acceptance - and so aren't yet ready for the kind of complementary role Oregon tech has historically played. As those new technologies ripen, though, Turoczy said he expects to see a rebound among Portland startups. He said technologists working at larger businesses have been nurturing new ideas on the side, quietly harboring some entrepreneurial instincts as well. "There is an ebb and flow to it," Turoczy said. "People who have been at those companies four to five years are starting to get the itch to want to do something new." Though Oregon tech hasn't been growing lately, it hasn't contracted, either. That's something of an accomplishment, given the scale of disruption at Intel and all the big companies that have been sold. And while Portland lacks some assets other tech hubs enjoy, namely a major research university and an established investment community to help new companies grow, the city remains an attractive destination for educated professionals and continues to draw from other parts of the country. So maybe a pause isn't such a bad thing, especially considering the economic burdens rapid tech growth has created in Seattle and San Francisco. Turoczy said Portland's tech culture has always been different, and if it isn't producing headline-grabbing startups, the city may be achieving something meaningful in its own way. "People here, they've always been more motivated by curiosity and craft than financial reward," he said. "We're not so focused on the business being the be-all and end-all of our existence. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing."

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo What All of Your Computer's Specs Really Mean David NieldSunday 2:31pm Filed to: PC computers specs CPU RAM graphics 57 15 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Computer specs can be a baffling mix of acronyms and numbers at the best of times, but it’s worth learning something about them: It’ll help you choose a new computer, troubleshoot your old computer, and generally understand more about the relationship between the specs on the page and the experience you’re getting. Advertisement Such is the complexity of the modern-day computer, we could’ve written an article twice this size on any one of the categories listed below (look at any graphics card forum for proof)—but the main aim here is to help you understand the specs you see listed with desktops and laptops, and give you an idea of the difference they make to performance. CPU Image: Peter Miller/Flickr The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, or processor, is the brains of the operation: it handles all those calculations that keep your computer actually working. The CPU inside your machine is the main (but not the only) contributor to its overall speed and performance. Advertisement CPUs have a certain number of cores, mini computing units that are effectively CPUs in their own right—they let your computer work on multiple tasks at the same time, so the more cores the better. On top of this, each core has a clock speed, a measurement of how fast it can do its number crunching, usually measured in gigahertz (GHz). Comparing the performance of CPUs based on core number and clock speeds is notoriously difficult (sorry shoppers). That’s because multiple factors are involved, most related to the microarchitecture of the CPUs. The microarchitecture is basically the way that the cores and the other bits of a CPU are packed together. The two big computer CPU makers, Intel and AMD, have their own microarchitecture designs. When you see references to Intel Skylake, Intel Kaby Lake, or AMD Zen (on Ryzen chips), this is what’s being referred to, and newer is always better as successive microarchitectures allow the CPU to work faster and more efficiently (and use less power). Image: AMD Intel and AMD also apply their own labels—i3, i5, and i7 in Intel’s case—to indicate relative performance within a microarchitecture family. It’s a useful shorthand reference to the power you can expect, with i7 CPUs the best of the bunch from Intel. In AMD’s case, you’re talking about Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5 and the top-end Ryzen 7. Advertisement Sponsored If you want the very best processors around, you should also look out for what Intel calls hyper-threading and what AMD calls simultaneous multi-threading. These technologies effectively double the number of cores (virtually, not physically) so you’ve got significantly improved performance for demanding applications like video editing or CAD software. Unless you’re building your own PC from scratch, that’s probably all you need to know when looking at system listings, but CPUs have numerous other specs, including the amount of high-speed memory cache and the extra graphics processing capabilities that are on board. If your CPU has enough integrated graphics oomph, you don’t need a separate card or chipset, of which more below. Graphics Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo The other big factor in computer performance, particularly if you’re gaming or working with a lot of video and images, is graphics. We only gave it a brief mention in the processor section, but many Intel CPUs now come with a decent amount of graphics processing power built in, enough for most users to get by with a bit of web browsing, Twittering, essay writing and even light image editing and gaming. You can also get integrated graphics chipsets built into the motherboard as well as the CPU. Integrated graphics share memory with the CPU and aren’t as powerful as having a dedicated (or discrete) card, but it’s a cheaper option that also draws less power, which is why it’s often deployed on laptops where battery life is important. Wherever it’s installed on your system, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) churns through calculations just like the CPU does, but only the number-crunching related to rendering pictures, animations, and videos on screen. GPUs are much better at performing many operations in parallel, as you can see here, which is why they’re now being used in other areas like science and encryption. Image: Nvidia In terms of specs, it’s not particularly easy to weigh one graphics card or GPU against another. You’ll see reference to number of compute units (like cores in a CPU) and raw clock speed. As with a CPU, these are two key factors to consider, but also keep an eye out for FLOPS, or Floating Point Operations Per Second—a type of maths operation particularly important in graphics. Advertisement Advertisement Video card GPUs come with their own RAM or video RAM (vRAM). This works in a similar way to the computer’s main RAM, but deals solely with graphics (with the same specs references to speed and bandwidth). The more RAM your graphics card has, the more pixels it can render in memory at once, which leads to games running at higher resolutions with faster frame rates. Essentially video cards are like separate miniature computers, with processors, RAM and architecture all of their own, and the same performance factors apply. For the non-expert, there are a couple of useful shortcuts to working out how powerful a graphics setup is without having to pour over the specs in too much detail: how much it costs and the benchmarks reported on the web. RAM Image: Glenn Batuyong/Flickr Random Access Memory or RAM gives your computer room to think, and the more of it the better, as long as you can afford it. When you’ve got 3,000 browser tabs open, the RAM is the first to suffer, because your computer’s trying to remember what’s in all of those 3,000 tabs at once. Advertisement More RAM helps your computer deal with bigger images and files, or more images and files at once, or more open tabs, or more applications running simultaneously—it’s not a direct measure of the raw speed of your machine but it certainly helps performance, especially when you’re trying to do a lot. If the RAM gets overloaded, your computer sometimes stores data it needs on the (slower) hard drive instead, which is one reason more RAM equals a speedier experience. Advertisement For the majority of users shopping for a desktop or laptop, all that really matters is how much RAM is installed, but dig deeper and there are plenty of additional specs to consider—especially if you’re trying to build the fastest computer you can. Image: The Beard/Flickr Clock speeds appear again, usually in terms of a frequency rate, which help to determine how fast the RAM can read and write data as well as how much data the RAM can handle at once (its overall transfer rate). Latency, or how fast the RAM responds to instructions, is an important specification as well. Advertisement One other prominent specification is DDR or Double Data Rate, with DDR4 being the best yet for consumer computers (and an upgrade over DDR3)—it has faster clock speeds, lower power draw, and lower latency. Yet more RAM specifications relate to stability and how well your RAM sticks can handle errors, but again, this isn’t something that most of us will have to worry about: the performance differences only become apparent in very specialist tasks. Other computer specs Image: Marlon J. Manrique/Flickr The CPU, RAM, and graphics are the main specs to consider when assessing your own computer or looking out for a new one, but there are of course other components to bear in mind as well, which you’ll see in system listings. Advertisement The hard drive is very simply the amount of room you’ve got to store stuff permanently (it remembers its data, unlike the RAM). Need more storage? Get a bigger hard drive. Solid-state drives used in Apple’s MacBooks and most high-end laptops have no moving parts and are faster than the older mechanical hard disk drives, but they’re also more expensive and don’t offer as much capacity. Newer technologies like hybrid drives and Intel’s Optane technology are looking to find a better compromise between the two. You probably won’t give any thought to your motherboard unless you have to build a PC yourself, but it acts as the nervous system for the whole machine and connects all the various bits together. Motherboard specs, such as they are, don’t make a huge difference to overall performance but they can help the key components work together more efficiently and faster. The motherboard also dictates how many input and output ports you’ve got on your system. Advertisement Other specs you see should be self-explanatory, like the size of your monitor or the number of memory card slots you’re getting. And if you’re in the market for a new phone, a lot of the specs—processor, RAM, storage—do the same job on these miniature computers as they do on the full-sized versions.

Pixabay Super Bowl LI was full of a lot of things: an unprecedented overtime win, a full 30 single-game records set, and a spectral canine selling beer. But above and beyond all of these achievements — quite literally, in fact — was Lady Gaga, jumping from the stadium roof as hundreds of blinking lights formed an American flag across the sky. Sure, the stunt was prerecorded, and Gaga’s actual halftime jump was from a somewhat more reasonable distance. But the lights behind her? They represented an incredible feat all their own. Three hundred flying drones from Intel’s Shooting Star drone system ascended skyward, carrying out a shifting display that both broke the traditional vertical limits of such events (jet flyovers are disconnected from the stage due to their height) and showcased the synchrony and precision that such systems can bring to performances. And that’s just the beginning for these devices: Future versions may leverage a proprietary mesh network developed by Intel, through which each drone communicates spatial awareness peer to peer instead of solely through central command, allowing for even more control and automation. If you ask the average person what names come to mind when he considers technology, chances are he’ll respond with answers like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and others. These are successful artifacts of the age of connection. Never before have we felt so connected to other people and locations in our world. Despite that connection, however, it’s still mediated through simple 2D user interfaces — flat webpages that, in some ways, haven’t budged much for decades. All that has started to change. We’re on the precipice of the age of immersion. Whereas connection fulfills our social selves through text, sound, and images, it fails to truly embed us in a rich 3D topography of sights and sounds — one we can explore just as we do in the real world. And this distinction matters, because as breathtaking as the cinematography of films like the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy can be, there’s nothing quite like feeling present in a real space, with sensory inputs breaking through the traditional flat wall of a screen that for a century has been the mainstay for immersive media. Computer, sensor, and controller technology is growing clever enough to allow companies to find ways to break down that barrier — from devices in the real world to virtual images inches from our eyes. Intel’s drones served as just a drop in the ocean of possibilities. Full concerts, too, are already taking on new dimensions due to technology that’s not only immersive, but also connective. In December, the band Thievery Corporation, in collaboration with Live Nation and NextVR, made a live concert available as a VR experience. Using VR for concerts will give millions of fans at home a way to see the show from various angles, have “backstage” experiences, and feel far more participatory than a video could ever allow. For some, though, there may be a downside. Remember, “fan” is short for “fanatic,” and by amping up the sense of presence, obsession with performers may be heightened, and concert experiences might be so compelling that it could be problematic. Of course, it’s not just pop divas and rock bands benefiting: Virtual technology is already enhancing stagecraft in the most classical playhouse in the English-speaking world. Last fall, Gregory Doran, the artistic director for the Royal Shakespeare Company, was so enchanted by an immersive theater experience — a whale that appears to exit the screen and glide over the audience — that he contacted the engineer, Intel, to bring that magic to a November production of “The Tempest.” In it, Ariel appears to morph from human to sprite form and then fly throughout the theater. Even traditional 2D art like painting is benefiting from this new enhanced immersion. In March at The Armory Show in New York, virtual and augmented reality allowed for new impressions of traditional art. Online art destination Artsy and Microsoft collaborated to allow curators and potential buyers to “preview” the art in their own homes or other environments (or view the art in a virtual reality scene from another time) to understand more about its context, history, and creator. Museums continued through the spring to incorporate immersive experiences, such as Ian Cheng’s Oculus Rift-based exhibit at MoMA PS1 or Jordan Wolfson’s VR work featured at the Whitney Biennial. Immersive technology is a natural for home exploration of traditional arts. One can globe-trot from the comfort of the living room, sampling artists from Bangladesh, Chile, and Russia on a leisurely Sunday afternoon on the couch. So, what’s next for the advancement of technology and the arts? Immersive technology is still taking its first steps. As with other waves of tech, when costs come down, VR events for large audiences will become more common. Right now, multinationals like Citigroup have the resources to underwrite it, but that will change. Drone shows like Gaga’s will become much more commonplace and commercialized within the next year. The moment you can put a logo in the sky, the demand will be intense. In fact, in February, Miami Beach tried — and failed — to ban floating billboards because beachgoers could not relax on vacation without seeing a logo floating by. Drones, hyper-mobile by nature, can take this kind of intrusive distraction to new heights. Expect some pushback from communities and sensible regulation for drones to enhance our life, not clutter it. In the next 10 years to 15 years, immersive technology will become affordable enough for all kinds of artists or other communicators to reach their audiences — even church congregations or K-12 classrooms. VR and AR will allow enhancement of the religious experience, not just by increasing observation and access, but also by increasing participation. Congregants could take sacraments from afar, yet feel connected in a highly captivating milieu that reinforces the sense of the sacred. Teachers, too, will use it for everything from anatomy labs to touring the wonders of the world. For now, probably the quickest, most accessible route to the age of immersion is through small devices: smartphones and VR headsets. Smartphones such as the future iPhone 8 may include more camera-based AR capabilities. AR would allow a person to move her camera around her home to see how new art would look or bring existing art to life with overlays and contextual information. Full-featured VR headsets will become wireless very soon and eventually be able to operate on their own or with smartphones further down the road, no longer requiring the processing power of a PC. This will enable larger audiences to experience VR, as having to plug into a PC nearly prevents that. Pseudo-VR solutions don’t require a PC currently, but they don’t allow the immersive experience of full-featured VR like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Further, an exciting twist is developing in the world of small device immersion: VR will not just be about viewing, but also creating. Google’s Tilt Brush is a great example, allowing painters to create in 3D. To complete the circle, the age of immersion must loop back around to include connection. That is where the real synergy will occur. So VR will ultimately have a powerful social aspect. To start, think of VR-based chat rooms like the newly released Rec Room. Some are calling it the killer app of VR. Imagine being able to conduct a Q&A with your favorite artist after a show using VR avatars. The age of immersion will continue what began with the internet — a revolution in connection and experience in real time — bringing fundamental changes to how we interact with the products of our creative imagination. For now, whether dancing in sync with a flotilla of drones or exploring the paintings of Guatemala, VR and AR will elevate our communal experiences and artistic energies to new levels.

Does AMD’s post-earnings dip represent a buying opportunity for this high-flying stock? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 8, 2017 at 11:00AM Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) dropped 11% after hours on May 1 after the chipmaker posted first quarter numbers which merely met analyst expectations. Revenue rose 18% annually to $984 million, and non-GAAP net loss narrowed from $0.12 a year ago to $0.04 per share. Those were solid numbers, but merely matching estimates didn't seem enough to justify a further rally for the stock, which already rallied about 280% over the past 12 months. But does AMD's post-earnings dip represent a buying opportunity for investors who had been waiting for a pullback? Let's examine AMD's key growth opportunities to find out. Image source: AMD. All eyes on Ryzen AMD's most exciting new product line is Ryzen, a new series of x86 chips which are squarely aimed at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) current-gen Kaby Lake processors. AMD's initial benchmarks show that AMD's top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches the 8-core Intel Core i7-6900K in single-threaded performance, and beats it by 9% in multi-threaded performance -- for just half the price. Since recent reports from top PC makers indicate that PC sales are finally warming up after a multi-year slump, AMD's launch of the Ryzen in early March could coincide with a lot of desktop upgrades. This could give AMD a huge advantage over Intel over the next few months, since Intel's comparable Coffee Lake and next-gen Cannonlake chips aren't expected to arrive until the end of the year. AMD even plans to challenge Intel in the data center market with Naples, a high-end Zen processor which has more cores and memory channels than Intel's comparable Purley CPU. Great annual growth, weak sequential growth AMD's first quarter included less than a month of Ryzen sales, but CEO Lisa Su noted that those initial numbers contributed to the Computing and Graphics segment's 29% year-over-year sales growth to $593 million. AMD's RX 480. Image source: AMD. That business was also boosted by robust sales of its new Radeon desktop GPUs, which are intended to counter NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new lineup of GeForce cards. AMD's market share of the add-in board market rose from 21.6% to 29.5% between the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2016, according to JPR. During that period, NVIDIA's share dropped from 78.3% to 70.5%. However, weaker sales of mobile CPUs and GPUs caused AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue to dip 1% sequentially. On the bright side, AMD's client average selling price (ASP) rose both sequentially and annually, fueled by higher ASPs for its newer desktop processors and GPUs. That price growth, along with lower expenses, narrowed the unit's operating loss from $70 million a year ago to $15 million. AMD's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) revenue rose 5% annually to $391 million, thanks to consistent sales of semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles. Sales still dropped 23% sequentially due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs, but the recent refreshes of the PS4 and Xbox One could help sales rebound later this year. However, the EESC unit's operating income declined 81% annually to $9 million -- due to higher server related R&D investments being partly offset by licensing revenues from its THATIC joint venture in China. The upcoming catalysts and wild cards The next big catalyst for AMD will be its next-gen GPU Vega, which will launch this quarter in an attempt to pull ahead of NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards. NVIDIA is expected to counter Vega with its next-gen Volta chipset next year, but there's a strong chance that the Vega can win over upgrading desktop users before Volta arrives. However, AMD also faces two wild cards which could help or harm its business. First, persistent rumors indicate that Intel could sign a graphics licensing deal with AMD, since its previous deal with NVIDIA recently expired. If Intel agrees to pay AMD an amount comparable to the $66 million in licensing revenues it paid NVIDIA every quarter, it could give AMD's top line a nice long-term boost. Meanwhile, NVIDIA recently reentered the gaming console market by supplying its Tegra SoC for Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) new Switch console. This unexpected development indicates that AMD's long-term dominance of the console market might not be guaranteed. Is it time to buy the dip? AMD expects its second quarter revenue to rise 12% annually and about 17% sequentially at the midpoint, as sales of Ryzen and Vega chips take off. By the end of the year, higher console sales during the holiday season could significantly lift its EESC revenues. Wall Street expects these catalysts to boost AMD's revenue by 11% this year and 10% next year. AMD's price-to-sales ratio of 2.6 is still lower than its industry average of 3.9, so the stock still doesn't look overpriced after its year-long rally. AMD is expected to return to non-GAAP profitability with earnings of $0.08 per share this year and $0.30 per share next year. Based on these facts, investors who believe that Ryzen and Vega can respectively counter competition from Intel and NVIDIA should view the pullback as a buying opportunity -- as long as they realize that their success still remains highly speculative.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

RHT, -0.46% the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11, the latest version of Red Hat’s massively-scalable and agile cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Based on the OpenStack “Ocata” release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers enhanced support for upgrades with composable roles, new networking capabilities, and improved integration with Red Hat CloudForms for cloud management. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers a reliable cloud platform built on the proven, enterprise-grade backbone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Based on OpenStack community code, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is a tested, certified and fully-supported version of OpenStack that provides the agility to scale and more quickly meet customer demand without compromising availability, performance or IT security requirements. Red Hat OpenStack Platform also includes Red Hat CloudForms to ease day-to-day management operations. It serves as a hybrid cloud management and monitoring platform to oversee not only OpenStack infrastructure components but also the workloads running on a given Red Hat OpenStack Platform cloud. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 maintains its tight integration with Red Hat Ceph Storage and introduces the co-location of Red Hat Ceph Storage with OpenStack compute nodes. Previously in tech-preview, this release also enables storage mirroring to help simplify data replication between sites, improving disaster recovery for customers. Improved Upgradability Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduced composable roles, which allow operators to create customized profiles for individual services and processes to suit their unique needs. This helps to improve operation and efficiency by allowing operators to scale and manage the individual services they need at any moment, rather than scaling the entire cloud. While this makes it easier for enterprises to customize OpenStack deployments to fit their specific needs at scale, it also introduces challenges in upgrading to new versions of the platform. To address this, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 now supports upgrades for composable roles, making the deployment and upgradability of Red Hat OpenStack Platform more adaptable and consistent while retaining the important aspects of lifecycle management. In addition, OpenStack services can now be composed individually and assigned, enabling operators to place components such as databases, proxies, or messaging services on specific nodes based on their unique requirements. This includes adding customized roles post-deployment to a running cloud, providing more flexibility to customers or partners as they become more successful with their cloud services. Expanded networking and network function virtualization support Networking and network function virtualization (NFV) support remains a key function of OpenStack deployments, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers several new capabilities, designed for standard networking use cases as well as extreme workloads such as those required by information and communication technology services providers. New features include: Full support for VLAN-aware virtual machines (VMs), OpenStack-based VMs can now send and receive VLAN encapsulated traffic while being deployed over Open vSwitch (OVS) or OVS Data Plane Development Kit (OVS-DPDK). Additional telecommunications provider enhancements with upgrades to OVS and DPDK to provide latest features and functions, resulting in increased performance optimizations. Enhanced management with Red Hat CloudForms Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 improves its integration with Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud management solution, to better support management requirements for day-to-day operations of a Red Hat OpenStack Platform-based cloud. Included with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11, Red Hat CloudForms can now access and control OpenStack regions, multiple domains, and host aggregates for a more unified controller view of cloud health and efficiency. Storage management has also been enhanced, as Red Hat CloudForms can now perform volume snapshot management functions like creation, listing and deletion, further streamlining the overall management of the cloud platform. Partner and customer success Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a proven, enterprise-grade solution for building, deploying and scaling cloud deployments across geographic and industry boundaries. Hundreds of customers rely on Red Hat OpenStack Platform to power their hybrid and private clouds for a variety of mission-critical deployments, including BBVA; Cambridge University; FICO; Massachusetts Open Cloud; NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Paddy Power Betfair; Produban; Swisscom; UKCloud; and Verizon. And, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is backed by a robust ecosystem of partners, including Cisco, Dell, Intel, Lenovo, NetApp, Rackspace, Ericsson, HPE, IBM, and many more. Innovation paired with support Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 is the second release covered by Red Hat’s varying support life cycle model. Under this model, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 will be supported for one year with customers being able to leverage Red Hat’s award-winning global support team for help with migrations and upgrades to future versions. Availability Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 will be available in the coming weeks via the Red Hat Customer Portal and as a component of the Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure and Red Hat Cloud Suite solutions.

Mark Walton (UK) - May 8, 2017 1:35 pm UTC Enlarge Mark Walton reader comments 131 Share this story "It can't just be that we're the cheaper solution," said AMD in 2015, back when Ryzen was little more than a handful of hopeful slides in a press deck. But as AMD and the wider tech press knew, competing with Intel on performance as well as price was always going to be an uphill battle. The Bulldozer architecture was a bust, and Intel had cornered the market on high-end desktop and server CPUs. If you were at all interested in media creation, or gaming with a discrete GPU, Intel was the best option. Then came a trickle of tech specs. Ryzen would be an eight-core, 16-thread chip. It would be a dramatic rethinking of AMD's CPU architecture. It would boost instructions-per-clock by an unthinkable 40 percent over Bulldozer (ultimately, as the Ryzen reviews rolled in, the actual IPC gains were as high as 52 percent). There was a hope, perhaps a naive one, that after months of riding the hype train, AMD would do the extraordinary and not only catch up with Intel, it might even beat it. The reality proved more complex. Ryzen 7, the range which comprises AMD's top-end 8C/16T chips, was an absolute number-crunching monster in multithreaded tasks—much to the delight of content creators stuck paying Intel's absurd prices for Extreme Edition and highly clocked Xeon chips. But raw IPC remained just shy of Broadwell-E, and some way behind the mainstream Kaby Lake architecture. More importantly, gaming performance was oddly mixed. Ramped up to 4K, Ryzen largely holds its own against Intel. Dropped down to 1440p or 1080p, frame rates—including those all-important 99th percentile minimums—lag behind. Further ReadingWhy does AMD Ryzen fall short of Intel in games, and will it improve? Two months later—after a handful of OS tweaks, BIOS revisions, and patches that show just what can and can't be done to boost Ryzen's performance via software—little has changed. Ryzen, which now spans the range from high-end eight-core chips through to mid-range six- and quad-core chips in Ryzen 5, remains a remarkably powerful CPU in some tasks, and a curiously humdrum one in others. It's an architecture that, like Intel's Broadwell-E, doesn't command outright recommendation, but instead a more measured endorsement. That's especially true of Ryzen 5, here tested in its 6C/12T 1600X (~£240) and 4C/8T 1500X (£175) forms, which directly compete with Intel's mainstream Core i5 chips. For roughly the same price as a 4C/4T Core i5 7600K (~£230) or 7400 (£170), Ryzen 5 offers two extra cores or double the threads and full overclocking support. Ryzen still isn't for everyone—the sheer gaming grunt of Intel's chips makes sure of that. But, for the first time in a long time, AMD has a compelling alternative. Six cores or four? The Ryzen 5 range is made up of four chips. At the top is the £240/$250 Ryzen 5 1600X, a 95W six-core chip that boasts simultaneous multithreading (SMT, the equivalent of hyper-threading), 16MB of L3 cache, and a 3.6GHz base clock. By default, the 1600X will boost to 3.7GHz across all cores, 4.0GHz across two cores, and—with a suitably robust cooling setup—up to 4.1GHz on a single core via AMD's XFR (extended frequency range) functionality. Intel's i5-7600K with its four cores, lack of hyper-threading, and meagre 6MB of shared cache, looks feeble by comparison.

Where the 1500X boasts 16MB of L3 cache, hyper-threading, and full overclocking support alongside its 3.5GHz base clock and maximum 3.9GHz boost clock, the i5-7400 features just four cores, 6MB of cache, and no overclocking support. The other two Ryzen 5 chips—the £200/$219 6C/12T Ryzen 5 1600, and £160/$169 4C/8T Ryzen 5 1400—also boast impressive specs compared to the similarly priced Intel equivalent, although sadly neither were available for this review. The Ryzen platform is suitably robust too. Unlike the now defunct AM3 platform, the AM4 platform has all the modern features you'd expect, including support for DDR4 memory, PCIe X4 storage, and USB 3.1 Gen 2. The high-end X370 chipset features support for overclocking (all Ryzen chips are unlocked) as well as SLI and Crossfire. The cheaper B350 chipset sheds a few PCIe lanes and SLI and Crossfire support, but still allows for overclocking. There's even a full-spec line of overclocking-friendly micro-ATX and mini-ITX motherboards in the form of the X300 series. Those haven't yet been released, but are expected soon.

Mark Walton Further ReadingAMD’s moment of Zen: Finally, an architecture that can compete with IntelRyzen brings AMD up to parity with Intel, which is a remarkable achievement given just how far it had fallen with Bulldozer. The under-the-hood architectural improvements—which you can read all about here—are smart, favouring efficiency over unchecked performance. And while AMD's slightly hopeful TDP measurements mean that its 95W chip still pulls as much power under load as Intel's 140W chip, it's a vast improvement. Like with Ryzen 7, though, Ryzen 5's headline specs aren't always indicative of real-world performance. Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, and to a lesser extent Broadwell-E, maintain a sizeable lead in raw IPC. For the applications that prefer raw singlethreaded performance, Ryzen loses out. There are other issues too. Ryzen has proven more sensitive to memory bandwidth than Kaby Lake, but at launch many motherboards in the enthusiast X370 range wouldn't boot at higher memory speeds. Subsequent BIOS updates have largely fixed this issue, but benchmarks show the memory controller itself remains a weak point. Just as irksome is overclocking, which is an all-or-nothing deal: you either run Ryzen at the maximum clock speed you can reach at all times, or you opt for Ryzen's ability to automatically adjust the clock speed by small 25MHz increments and save power. There's no in-between. Even if you do opt to overclock, the ceiling using typical air coolers or all-in-one liquid coolers is much lower than with Kaby Lake and Broadwell-E. Where an 8-core Broadwell-E chip can reach 4.5GHz without issue, Ryzen tops out at around 4.1GHz across the board, even in its six- and quad-core forms. That's disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Ryzen 5 is the same chip as Ryzen 7, but with disabled cores. Ryzen is designed around a pair of four-core core complexes (CCX) linked together via AMD's "Infinity Fabric" interconnect. In the 1600X and 1600, one core from each of those CCX is disabled. In the 1500X and 1400, two cores from each CCX is disabled. Many were hoping that the quad-core chip would forgo Infinity Fabric, and instead run four physical cores from a single CCX. That would, in theory, negate any possible performance issues that arise from Infinity Fabric, which is dependent on memory speed and clock speed.

AMD was also forced to issue a Ryzen-optimised power-profile to prevent Windows from prematurely parking individual cores to save power (the new profile offloads power management directly to the CPU), while also dealing with performance issues related to SMT, similar to how Intel's hyper-threading suffered problems at launch. These are classic early adopter issues—and more may emerge as others are fixed. But while Ryzen clearly needed more development time before being rushed to market—a sentiment shared by at least one motherboard manufacturer—it's now stable enough to recommend as a daily driver.

The flaw, which doesn’t affect consumer hardware, concerned products with Intel’s Active Management Technology, Intel’s Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability. Intel’s description of the flaw is as follows: There is an escalation of privilege vulnerability in Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology versions firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 that can allow an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products. This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs with consumer firmware, Intel servers utilizing Intel® Server Platform Services (Intel® SPS), or Intel® Xeon® Processor E3 and Intel® Xeon® Processor E5 workstations utilizing Intel® SPS firmware. Here’s why that’s such a problem. These services are collectively known as the Intel Management Engine and are used by IT administrators to load or configure remote systems, even if said computers don’t even have an operating system loaded. That’s part of why the vulnerability is so serious — a system that’s been compromised remotely can be accessed without the operating system ever being aware that any changes have occurred. Attackers could theoretically install new applications or change system configuration options. Neither the end-user or the IT administrator would know that any such operations had occurred. That alone made this threat a serious risk, even before additional information surfaced about how the attack is carried out. Intel notes that there are two ways this vulnerability can be triggered. The first issue does not affect Intel Small Business Technology. An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM). CVSSv3 9.8 Critical /AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology (SBT). All of this was known last week, and it’s certainly bad enough. Experts have been somewhat divided over just how bad it is, but there’s no arguing that a remote attacker could use this exploit to load data directly on to systems that use these features or to copy information off such systems without anyone knowing it had happened. Here’s how it’s worse The initial problem was first discussed by Embedi, who noted its existence back on May 1 and offered a whitepaper on the topic late last week. Recent information provided by Tenable shed additional light on the problem, and how serious it actually is. It turns out that there’s a fundamental flaw in how AMT was implemented for the past seven years that allows an attacker to authenticate as an administrator without entering any password information whatsoever. The traditional browser session one is supposed to use to access AMT sends a computed MD5 hash to the remote system, which then checks that hash against the expected value. If you try testing AMT from a traditional browser window, it will appear to function normally. What the research teams discovered is that it’s possible to use a proxy or manually generated request to order the AMT to compare the first zero characters of the MD5 hash when checking it for accuracy. As you might imagine, telling as password authentication system to allow end-user access if the first zero characters of an MD5 hash are identical is equivalent to having no security system at all. This really isn’t supposed to work. Tenable also investigated this problem and found similar results. They were able to access systems with AMT enabled without providing any password whatsoever. As of this writing, at least 8,500 business systems are vulnerable to this attack, and tens of thousands more may be vulnerable but sitting on corporate networks where tools like Shodan can’t detect them. Here’s where things get really fun. While Intel is working on a patch, said to be released this week, it’s going to require a firmware update to solve the problem. Until those updates are applied, any business system with these services is vulnerable, to one degree or another, and IT administrators will have no way of determining which systems may have been accessed by black hats. Nearly a year ago, we reported on rumors that the IME could be fundamentally compromised. At the time, there was no evidence that the engine was flawed in such a fashion, which made it extremely difficult to determine whether such fears were grounded in reality. It’s now clear that they were. We still hold to what we said back in 2016 — prominent security flaws in GnuTLS, Heartbleed, Shellshock, and Stagefright are all proof that simply being open source does not magically insulate code from containing huge security vulnerabilities — but Intel clearly wasn’t auditing its own code, either. It is extremely unlikely that every system that uses the Intel Management Engine can be found and patched, which means this is one critical vulnerability that will persist for years to come.

-- Chengdu, the mega central city in southwest China, is now bold in striding to an innovation and entrepreneurial center with international influence. Aiming to realize its target, Chengdu will scramble to scale the heights of technological advances, attach more importance to the new momentum fostered by innovation, enhance the market's capability of gathering and distributing the elements of innovation, focus on the high-end of industry, embrace green GDP, striving to be the Silicon Valley in western China and taking the innovation and entrepreneurial as a powerful driving forces for the sustainable development of Chengdu. Intel and Dell are among the first group of global renowned companies to take root in this city. Intel now has introduced its world-top "high-end testing technology" into the plant in Chengdu and Dell Chengdu Global Operation Centre has now become the operation centre with highest operating efficiency around the world, they are witnesses to the rise of Chengdu. Over 278 Fortune Global 500 companies have made their dwellings in Chengdu with many more on the way due to the state-backed strategies to further develop the Silk Road Economic Belt, the Yangtze River Economic Zone and Tianfu New Area. To further attract and converge batches of world-top scientists, engineers and leading personnel in innovation and entrepreneurship and create a world-class talents pool and the land for business development and realization of value for the sake of rapid growth of scientific and technical corporation and newly-established firm, Chengdu prioritizes the "human resources development" as its ensuring five-year development goal, pointing out the construction of a talents-oriented city with international competitiveness. Chengdu has clearly put forward that Chengdu will provide more public resources and policy supports for young talents, create more opportunities for success and make "Chengdu drifters" become the fashion! According to IBtimes.com, "Chengdu is a hub of sorts for a lot of tech manufacturing. Somewhere between one-third and one-half of all iPads sold around the world are assembled in Chengdu, while about half of Intel's microchips are also made in this city. But the city is striving to be more than just a manufacturer, but a Silicon Valley of sorts. 'Software Park' is intended to focus more on innovation rather than immediate money-making schemes." The new round "Western Development" Program for helping to spark the recent entrepreneurial surge because it enabled, "Startups one-year interest-free loans, giving them incentive to put down roots in Chengdu." To fuel the city's entrepreneur goal driven endeavor and convenience, in 2016 during the 22nd World Route Development Forum, the Chengdu city government alongside Sichuan Province Airport Group, signed agreements with six airlines to pave the way for nine non-stop air routes. Tewolde GebreMariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, called Chengdu a perfect destination due to its large population and good geographical location. "The new route will open a gateway to western China. I hope it will further boost the bilateral development between Asia and Africa in tourism, trade and investment," he said. Adrian Newton, an executive at UBM EMEA - organizer of the forum, said, "The opening of the nine new international routes will further improve its status as an international aviation hub," he said. Chengdu has set up 95 international routes, covering the first tiers cities like London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, San Francisco and Melbourne.  In 2016, the passenger throughput of Chengdu Shuangliu Airport hit 46.04 million person-time, which made the airport the largest air transportation hub in China's central and western region. Experts expect annual passenger volume in Chengdu to reach well over 60 million travelers by 2020 and the city plan's in building a new airport are well on their way and are optimistic on completing the airport by 2019. to further bolster the innovation flame. The 3rd China (Chengdu) Global Innovation Entrepreneurship Fair will be held on May 10th - May 12th, 2017 at Chengdu Century City International Convention and Exhibition Center Chengdu, China. The entire fair will include 3 different activities that will make up the whole session: exhibition, project roadshow and the 2017 China Western Financial Center Forum. 2016 GIEF brought over 70,000 participants and a tremendous vitality to the city's innovation and entrepreneurship. Last year, 3,000 projects were completed bringing in an estimated value of RMB 16 billion. This tripled 2015 fair results and 2017 aims even higher. Aiming to be always bigger and greater, 2017 China (Chengdu) Global Innovation Entrepreneurship Fair will seek to target industries that include: Intelligent Manufacturing, Visual Reality, UAV, Medical instruments, Intelligent Traffic, Robots and New Materials. The generative fair is back to creating an important platform for innovation and entrepreneur international communication, that is making Chengdu the standard for cities in pursuit of tech start-up marvels. Chengdu, a super lager central city of West China with 16 million people, pushes the innovation as the driving forces for the city development, accelerates the establishment of an innovation and entrepreneur center for the modern world, seeks to be the new global "Silicon Valley".

By Michael Kan U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 8, 2017 4:31 AM PT Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this Vulnerability hits Intel enterprise PCs going back 10 years Easy-to-exploit authentication bypass flaw puts Netgear routers at risk Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now PC vendors this week will start rolling out patches that fix a severe vulnerability found in certain Intel-based business systems, including laptops, making them easier to hack.    Intel on Friday released a new notice urging clients to take steps to secure their systems. The chipmaker has also released a downloadable tool that can help IT administrators and users discover whether a machine they own has the vulnerability. In addition, vendors including Fujitsu, HP and Lenovo have released lists showing which products are affected and when the patches will roll out.  The products include laptops from Lenovo's ThinkPad line and HP's EliteBook series, along with servers, and desktops. Some of the patches are slated to come in June. Computers running enterprise management features found in Intel-based firmware from the past eight years will have the bug. Specifically, the vulnerability resides in past versions of Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability.  [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Fortunately, the vulnerability can only be exploited if these features have been enabled, according to security firm Embedi, which uncovered the bug.  These enterprise features were designed to help businesses remotely manage, track and repair huge fleets of connected computers, including retail checkout systems, digital signs, and PCs. However, Intel’s firmware bug could allow a hacker to take over the PCs and devices that use these remote management technologies, the chipmaker said.  In March, Intel learned about the vulnerability from a researcher at Embedi, a security product provider. On Friday, Embedi released more technical details about the Intel firmware bug, saying it could be exploited to remotely control a machine’s mouse and keyboard and even turn the computer on or off. “Which means, you can remotely load, execute any program to the target system,” Embedi said. The vulnerability also bypasses the machine’s authentication processes, so no knowledge of the password is needed, Embedi said. Until the patch becomes available, Intel is recommending users manually apply temporary fixes to address the threat. Users can also contact Intel’s customer support.

(Youtube via PBS)    Carter Page Says He’s Still Cooperating With Senate Intel Committee — But There’s A Catch Chuck Ross Reporter 8:01 AM 05/08/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page insists that he is still cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Trump-Russia ties, but there appears to be a catch. In a letter sent out Sunday night to the committee and to reporters, Page says he would still like to testify at an open hearing. But the energy consultant is not committing to turning over records that the committee has requested of him and several other former Trump campaign advisers as part of its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump team and Russian government. “I would like to reconfirm for you that I am still cooperating with the Committee’s investigation in the form of a future open testimony,” Page wrote in the letter, the latest in a public back-and-forth he has had with the Senate panel. Despite reiterating his offer to testify before the committee, Page asserts that its request for documents about his meetings with Russians and Trump campaign officials is “illogical,” “groundless,” and “distasteful.” “I am increasingly coming to understand that these proceedings have thus far followed the precedent of prior show trials, which have historically been used as a means of intimidation,” Page writes. Page offered to cooperate with the committee in early March. On April 28, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter asking Page to provide his communications records as well as records of any financial or real estate investments he might have in Russia. The committee also asked Page to appear on Capitol Hill for a closed meeting. (RELATED: Here’s What The Senate Intel Committee Wants From Carter Page) Page’s initial response to the request was noncommittal. In a letter sent to the committee on Thursday, he railed against the Obama administration for obtaining a foreign surveillance warrant against him in September. The FBI obtained the warrant in September, just after Page left his unpaid outside advisory role on the Trump campaign. Page was brought onto the Trump team in March, though White House officials say that he never met Trump and did not contribute much to the campaign. Asked last week by The Daily Caller whether he plans to comply with the committee’s document request, Page responded: “Let’s see what happens.” Burr and Warner raised the stakes in a press release on Friday, suggesting that the committee would seek a subpoena to obtain Page’s records. “Should Mr. Page choose to not provide the material requested by those dates, the Committee will consider its next steps at that time,” wrote Burr and Warner, the chairman and ranking member of the committee, respectively. (RELATED: Senate Intel Might Subpoena Carter Page) Though Page appears defiant in his latest letter, he did provide a few new pieces of information, some of which is partially responsive to the committee’s request. Responding to a question about Page’s financial investments or real estate holdings in Russia, Page claims to have had no financial stake in the country since divesting shares of Russian oil giant Gazprom in August. Page notes that he took a large loss on the transaction. “In response to your question, please note that I purchased 200 American Depository Receipts of PJSC Gazprom in June 2008 for $5,909.00. In response to these gangster-style witch hunt tactics led in the U.S. Senate by Reid, I divested my stake in August 2016 for $798.98 – a net loss of $5,110.02,” Page writes. Gazprom’s stock price fell from around $29 in June 2008 to $4 in Aug. 2016, stock market records show. Not one to pass up an opportunity to slam President Obama and Hillary Clinton, Page blamed the Gazprom share price slide on the two Democrats. “Given the complete disaster that the Clinton/Obama regime made of U.S.-Russia relations and the related problems they inflicted on private industry across the Russian economy, I held no other financial or real estate holdings related to Russia between June 16, 2015 and January 20, 2016,” says Page. He also provided a new detail about a previous encounter he had with the FBI during an investigation into a Russian spy ring operating in New York City. A Kremlin operative working undercover as a trade representative attempted to recruit Page in 2013. That recruitment attempt was reportedly cited by the FBI in its application for a surveillance warrant on Page. The bureau also reportedly cited in its warrant application an uncorroborated dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. The dossier alleges that Page met secretly with Kremlin officials and the president of oil giant Rosneft to hammer out a deal to help Trump in the election. In exchange, Page was to receive a massive brokerage fee for the placement of a 19 percent stake in Rosneft.

Page has denied the claim and refers to Steele’s report as the “Dodgy Dossier.” Critics of the dossier have noted that it would be unlikely that the Trump team would task Page with negotiating with the Kremlin on behalf of the campaign. In his letter, Page discloses that he met with the FBI in June 2013 to discuss the spy recruitment attempt. “During my meeting with U.S. agents at New York’s Plaza Hotel in June 2013 in support of their ongoing investigation, I spoke with them at length about my research on international political economy which I had been completing as a Fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington,” Page writes. Page says he was not recruited by the Russian spies and that he was unaware that they were working for the Kremlin. The spies were indicted in 2015. One was sentenced to prison in the U.S. while the other two were ordered removed from the U.S. Carter Page letter to Senate Intel Committee, May 7, 2017. by Chuck Ross on Scribd Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Carter Page, Donald Trump, FBI Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Reportedly, the vulnerability had actually remained in the chips for nearly a decade and didn't get detected until now. As per the security experts, this bug allows hackers to control a PC's keyboard and mouse, even when the system is turned off, reported IBTimes UK. As per the report, the bug came in a feature of Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), which is designed to allow administrators to remotely conduct maintenance work and other tasks such as software updates. Cris Thomas (AKA SpaceRogue), Strategist for Tenable Network Security told the publication that this vulnerability has the potential to become a big threat. "The vulnerability has been part of the Intel chipsets for years, specifically the Management Engine (ME). The ME runs things like DRM (Digital Rights Management) and does TPM (Trusted Platform Modules) checks as well as AMT. AMT enables systems administrators to re-image bare metal machines over a remote connection," he added. Thomas also said that AMT requires some privileges and it works separately from any OS installed in a system. "Obviously, with this much power there is some protection: in this case, access to AMT is protected by a password. The vulnerability in AMT is that the password can be bypassed." According to security researchers at Embedi, the bug allowed anyone to log in without having to input any credentials. The flaw was also confirmed by the security experts at Tenable, who said that it could be exploited very easily, reported the publication. ZDNet reported that a Shodan search has revealed that over 8,500 devices are currently vulnerable to the flaw, among which, 3,000 belong to the US, said IBTimes UK. However, experts believe that there could be thousands of other devices that can be vulnerable at this moment. "We expect computer-makers to make updates available beginning the week of May 8 and continuing thereafter," said Intel in a statement.

First the good news: the vulnerability does not affect (most) consumer PCs with Intel consumer firmware. These technologies have been created by Intel for remote management of computer systems. Functionality may include monitoring, upgrading, repairing and maintaining compatible devices. While you may use Intel's own advisory to find out if a computer system is vulnerable, it is easier to use the detection tool the company created and published for that instead. You can download the tool from Intel's website, and may run it on all Windows versions starting with Windows 7. The program is portable, and it will tell you right away whether your system is vulnerable or not. Note: Intel has published a guide to manually find out whether a system is vulnerable or not. If the computer is not vulnerable, then you are done as there is nothing else to do. If the system is vulnerable however, you have one or two options depending on whether the manufacturer of the device has published an updated firmware already. First option is to check whether updated firmware has been released. If that is the case, update the firmware to plug the security vulnerability. You find the list of firmware updates on Intel's advisory page. If no firmware is available, you may use the third-party tool Disable Intel AMT, or one of Intel's suggested options described in the mitigation guide. Disable Intel AMT is a basic batch file for Windows that renames the LMS.exe (Intel Local Management Service) binary so that it won't run anymore. Intel's own solution requires multiple steps to complete. First, the unprovisioning of any provisioned system, then the disabling or deleting of the LMS service, and optionally configuring local manageability configuration restrictions. Unconfiguring a system in CCM: ACUConfig.exe UnConfigure Unconfiguring a system in ACM without RCS integration: ACUConfig.exe UnConfigure /AdminPassword <password> /Full Unconfiguring a system with RCS integration: ACUConfig.exe UnConfigure /RCSaddress <RCSaddress> /Full Intel published an unprovisioning tool which administrators may used if the above commands cannot be executed. System administrators may also disable or remove LMS in the following way: Tap on the Windows-key, type cmd.exe, hold down the Shift-key and the Ctrl-key, and hit the Enter-key. This opens an elevated command prompt. To disable LMS: sc config LMS start= disabled To delete LMS: sc delete LMS The vulnerability If AMT is enabled, users may sign in locally or remotely.  Intel uses HTTP Digest authentication for that, and anything that a user enters is computed to a hash and then authenticated by the interface. The researchers discovered that the verification process that Intel implemented is flawed, as it accepts partial hashes or even an empty string. All an attacker requires therefore is knowledge of a working user account to sign in without knowing the correct password.

The tool showed "Not Vulnerable". So... maybe I don't have this vulnerability. Great info as always Martin, thanks. Reply Mike O May 8, 2017 at 1:47 pm # I ran the command "sc config LMS start=disabled" on my Thinkpad and it did not work. A warning indicated there must be a space between the equal sign and the value. The command should be "sc config LMS start= disabled". After reentering the command with that space; success.

The bug, which exists in Intel processors dating back almost a decade, allows cyber criminals to access a computer’s mouse and keyboard, granting them full access to the PC’s files and letting them install computer viruses even if the computer is turned off. The flaw allows hackers to easily bypass the security on the “AMT” port used by IT departments to remotely access computers in order to provide support and install software. The five worst ever cyber hacks 02:06 Intel revealed last week that a security flaw could allow hackers to hijack the computers, but it has now emerged that gaining access is as simple as ignoring the password requirement when logging in. Researchers at security group Embedi, which discovered the flaw, have published further details revealing that by leaving the password field blank, the AMT system simply allows the hacker to log in. "We’re able to manage the AMT via the regular web browser as if we’ve known the admin password," the researchers said. "Keep silence when challenged and you’re in." Keep your silence when challenged and you're inEmbedi researchers Hackers access the system through networking ports - an address on an internal computer network easily accessed via a web browser. Intel has not disclosed how many computers are affected, but a search on Shodan, a website that scans ports on the public web, revealed more than 8,000. Many more will exist on private company intranets. The technology only exists on corporate PCs rather than consumer desktops and laptops, but could allow hackers access to sensitive information. Computer makers are expected to issue updates that fix the bug this week. Intel has published information on the flaw including a tool that lets users check if they are vulnerable and to disable the ATM technology.

A vulnerability in Intel chips that went undiscovered for almost a decade allows hackers to remotely gain full control over affected Windows PCs without needing a password. The "critical"-rated bug, disclosed by Intel last week, lies in a feature of Intel's Active Management Technology (more commonly known as just AMT), which allows IT administrators to remotely carry out maintenance and other tasks on entire fleets of computers as if they were there in person, like software updates and wiping hard drives. AMT also allows the administrator to remotely control the computer's keyboard and mouse, even if the PC is powered off. To make life easier, AMT was also made available through the web browser -- accessible even when the remote PC is asleep -- that's protected by a password set by the admin. The problem is that a hacker can enter a blank password and still get into the web console, according to independent technical rundowns of the flaw by two security research labs. Embedi researchers, credited with finding the bug, explained in a whitepaper posted Friday that a flaw in how the default "admin" account for the web interface processes the user's passwords effectively lets anyone log in by entering nothing at the log-on prompt. "No doubt it's just a programmer's mistake, but here it is: keep silence when challenged and you're in," said the researchers. Tenable researchers confirmed the findings in a detailed analysis of the flaw, also posted Friday, saying it was relatively easy to remotely exploit. Intel's advisory said that systems -- including desktops, laptops, and servers -- dating back as early as 2010 and 2011 and running firmware 6.0 and later are affected by the flaw. But Embedi warned that any affected internet-facing device with open ports 16992 and 16993 are at risk. "Access to ports 16992/16993 are the only requirement to perform a successful attack," said the Embedi researchers. Since the disclosure, monitors have seen a spike in port probing activity on the two affected ports. Intel so far hasn't said how many devices are affected. However, a search on Shodan, the search engine for open ports and databases, shows more than 8,500 devices are vulnerable at the time of writing, with almost 3,000 in the US alone -- but there could be thousands more devices at risk on internal networks. In a statement, Intel said that it's working with its hardware partners to address the problem, and "expect computer-makers to make updates available beginning the week of May 8 and continuing thereafter." So far, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo have all issued security advisories and have issued guidance on when they will roll out fixes to their customers. Consumer devices aren't affected by the bug. The chipmaker has also published a discovery tool to determine if machines are affected.         LATEST STORIES (8) Yemeni Forces Devastate Saudi Military Outpost in Jizan Syrian Army Continues Battle Against Militants East of Homs Syrian Army Makes Significant Gain against Terrorists in Eastern Damascus Rainstorms Cause Floods, Trap Cars in South China's Guangzhou Iraqi Forces Push down into Handful of Remaining Districts in Northern Mosul Police Use Tear Gas in Paris Protest Rally After Election Results Are Declared Iraqi Forces Push Further into Western Mosul Sanaa Reels from 'More Than 200 Cholera Cases' Top Commander: Iran to Give Swift, Crushing Response to Enemy Aggression Iran Hosts Int'l Oil, Gas, Refining & Petrochemical Exhibition Al-Baghdadi Asks for Help in Raqqa Terrorists Demand Rapid Evacuation from Eastern Damascus after Syrian Army Advances Iran, China to Develop Technology Cooperation Minister: Iran Ready to Launch 2 New Home-Made Satellites Syrian Army Reinvigorates Security to Key Airbase in Northern Damascus Yemeni Forces Devastate Saudi Military Outpost in Jizan TEHRAN (FNA)- Ansarullah popular forces alongside the Yemeni Army units scored direct hits on a Saudi military outpost in Jizan province near the border.

Tuesday's front pages Taoyuan Airport MRT Home > Economics Back to list TSMC's market cap edges closer to Intel's as share price rises 2017/05/08 12:46:40 Taipei, May 8 (CNA) The share price of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電) continued to rise Monday, pushing the contract chip maker's market capitalization closer to that of U.S.-based integrated circuit giant Intel Corp., dealers said. TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local equity market, was driving the movement of the main board amid high hopes of stronger sales in June, when the Taiwanese company is expected to start shipping the A11 processor for the next generation iPhone, dealers said. As of 11:42 a.m., shares of TSMC had climbed 1.27 percent to NT$200.00 (US$6.63), after an early high of NT$200.50, with 18.20 million shares changing hands on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The weighted index was up 3.42 points or 0.03 percent at 9903.36, off an early high of 9,964.86. Based on the NT$200 share price, TSMC's market cap was estimated at a record NT$5.18 trillion, the highest among all the listed firms on the main board and the over-the-counter market. That puts the Taiwan company close to Intel, which had a market cap of about NT$5.22 trillion as of Friday. Currently, TSMC is ranked as the world's third largest semiconductor company in terms of sales, while Intel is No. 1. "Buying in TSMC remained solid soon after the local main board opened today, pushing its share price to a new high," KGI Securities analyst Phil Chu said. "Many investors are anticipating that the Taiwanese firm will climb out of the current slow sales season when it starts shipping the A11 processor to Apple Inc. in June." Apple is expected to start building inventories of key components for its new iPhones by the end of June in preparation for the launch of the devices in the second half of the year. In Monday trade in Taiwan, the broader market saw some profit taking after the early high but TSMC's share price held above NT$200 on optimism of further strengthening when it starts shipping the processor, Chu said. TSMC, a leader in production technology, has said that chips made on its advanced 10 nanometer process are expected to contribute about 10 percent to its total sales this year after production began in the fourth quarter of last year. The company has also been working to develop chips on the 7nm and 5nm processes and is hoping to start mass production in 2018 and 2020, respectively. "The current gains posted by TSMC's shares probably resulted mainly from buying by foreign institutional investors as they tend to favor the stock because of its sound fundamentals," Chu said. Foreign institutional investors have bought a net 100 million TSMC shares in the past 10 trading sessions, he said.

This Intel chip bug can still allow hackers to remotely hijack it Experts said a vulnerability in Intel chips allows hackers to remotely hijack computers, control keyboards and more. By India Ashok May 8, 2017 06:13 BST A Shodan search revealed that over 8,500 devices are vulnerable, with nearly 3,000 of those in the USiStock A major vulnerability in Intel chips can allow hackers to remotely gain complete control of PCs. The bug, which was first disclosed last week, had remained undetected for nearly a decade. According to security experts, the vulnerability can allow hackers to remotely control a computer's keyboard and mouse, even when the PC is switched off. The bug came in a feature of Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), which is designed to allow administrators to remotely conduct maintenance work and other tasks such as software updates. "This vulnerability has the potential of being a proverbial big one. The vulnerability has been part of the Intel chipsets for years, specifically the Management Engine (ME). The ME runs things like DRM (Digital Rights Management) and does TPM (Trusted Platform Modules) checks as well as AMT. AMT enables systems administrators to re-image bare metal machines over a remote connection," Cris Thomas (AKA SpaceRogue), Strategist for Tenable Network Security, told IBTimes UK. "To accomplish that, the AMT requires many privileges, from network access to writing to memory and disk," he added. "The AMT is hardware and operates separately from any operating system installed on a system. Obviously, with this much power there is some protection: in this case, access to AMT is protected by a password. The vulnerability in AMT is that the password can be bypassed." According to security researchers at Embedi, who published a whitepaper about the AMT vulnerability, the flaw was detected in how the default "admin" account processes passwords. Researchers said the flaw ensured that the bug allowed anyone to log in, without even having to input anything at the login prompt. The findings were also confirmed by security experts at Tenable, who said the flaw could be exploited remotely fairly easily. It remains unclear as to how many devices may be affected. However, ZDNet reported that a Shodan search revealed that over 8,500 devices are vulnerable, with nearly 3,000 of those in the US. However, reports speculate that there could be thousands of other devices vulnerable as well. Intel said it was working with computer makers to roll out security updates to fix the issue. "We expect computer-makers to make updates available beginning the week of May 8 and continuing thereafter," Intel said in a statement. IBTimes UK has reached out to Intel for further clarity on the matter and will update this article in the event of a response.

For Reeves, who's read a number of books about Warren Buffett, the event marked the end of a two-week, 12-city road trip visiting Gusto's small business customers. Gusto's software is designed to simplify back office functions like human resources and payroll. He took the cross-country trek in an RV, before flying to Omaha from Jacksonville, Florida, on Friday. "Books are great, but nothing can replace some face-to-face interactions," Reeves said in an interview on Monday, before hopping on a flight back to San Francisco. "I sat there for seven hours writing pages and pages of notes." Reeves spent Saturday at the CenturyLink Center in Downtown Omaha, listening to the entire presentation and question-and-answer session. On Friday, he strolled through the exhibit hall for what Berkshire calls "shareholder shopping day," viewing demos from Dairy Queen and See's Candies as well as jet engine maker Precision Castparts and homebuilder Clayton Homes. Reeves said he listened intently both to Buffett's views on technology and tech companies as well as his broader advice on leadership and building businesses.

He acknowledged missing out on internet companies Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (FB), because their models of capital efficiency didn't make sense in their early days. Buffett's specialty has been more in industrial and traditional retail names, where there's a clear capital structure -- a product and a cost to make that product. Load Error "These software and media companies don't need equity financing because they can self-fund indefinitely given how profitable they are," Reeves said, reading off his notes. "He was describing that as a newer trend they missed out on." The way Reeves interprets Buffett's investments in technology is that it's now a fundamental part of every industry. Software is pervasive in his jet engine, railroad and machinery investments, and even in how companies like insurer Geico run online ad campaigns. Buffett on tech "Tech is not just one category anymore," Reeves said. "It's a huge part of the economy." Reeves said he was most impressed with Buffett's humility and the importance he places on ethics. Buffett called the recent Wells Fargo (WFC) fake accounts scandal that led to the ouster of its CEO a "huge, huge, huge error," and said the employee incentive system was partly to blame. Berkshire is the bank's biggest investor. Buffett talked about the Berkshire hotline that allows anyone across his portfolio of companies to submit questions and problems. Reeves said he was encouraged enough by the idea to consider putting in a similar hotline for Gusto, especially considering the troubles now facing Bay Area companies like Uber. "We're of sufficient size now that it's important for folks to know they have an additional way to share feedback," Reeves said. Reeves said he's presenting stories from his road trip to employees on Wednesday. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Since 2008, most of Intel’s CPUs have contained a tiny homunculus computer called the “Management Engine” (ME). The ME is a largely undocumented master controller for your CPU: it works with system firmware during boot and has direct access to system memory, the screen, keyboard, and network. All of the code inside the ME is secret, signed, and tightly controlled by Intel. Last week, vulnerabilities in the Active Management (AMT) module in some Management Engines have caused lots of machines with Intel CPUs to be disastrously vulnerable to remote and local attackers. While AMT can be disabled, there is presently no way to disable or limit the Management Engine in general. Intel urgently needs to provide one. This post will describe the nature of the vulnerabilities (thanks to Matthew Garrett for documenting them well), and the potential for similar bugs in the future. EFF believes that Intel needs to provide a minimum level of transparency and user control of the Management Engines inside our CPUs, in order to prevent this cybersecurity disaster from recurring. Unless that happens, we are concerned that it may not be appropriate to use Intel CPUs in many kinds of critical infrastructure systems. What is AMT? How is it vulnerable? On many Intel chips, the Management Engine is shipped with the AMT module installed. It is intended to allow system administrators to remotely control the machines used by an organization and its employees. A vulnerability announced on May 1 allows an attacker to bypass password authentication for this remote management module, meaning that in many situations remote attackers can acquire the same capabilities as an organization’s IT team, if active management was enabled and provisioned.1 Once they have AMT access, attackers can interact with the screen or console as if the user were doing so themselves. Attackers can also boot arbitrary OSes, install a new OS, and (with some work) steal disk encryption passwords.2 Not every machine is susceptible to the attack. For it to work, AMT has to have been both enabled and provisioned (commonly AMT is enabled but not provisioned by default). Once provisioned, AMT has a password set, and is listening for network packets and will control the system in response to those.3 It can be provisioned by default if vendors used a feature called “Remote Configuration” with OEM Setup, by a user with administrative access, interactively or with a USB stick during system boot, or (via the second vulnerability) by unprivileged users on Windows systems with LMS. Macs have MEs, but don’t ship with AMT at all. The password protection is crucial for machines with AMT provisioned, but this week’s vulnerability allowed it to be bypassed. How can users protect themselves? Many organizations will need to take steps to protect themselves by ensuring that AMT is disabled in their BIOS and LMS is not installed, or by updating Intel firmware. Unfortunately, even if AMT is currently disabled, that doesn’t mean an attack was never possible—an attacker might have disabled AMT after concluding the attack, to close the door on their way out. But troublingly, AMT is only one of many services/modules that come preinstalled on Management Engines. The best recommendation we can make for addressing this vulnerability today is to disable that specific AMT module, because Intel doesn’t provide any way to generally limit the power of the ME. But vulnerabilities in any of the other modules could be as bad, if not worse, for security. Some of the other modules include hardware-based authentication code and a system for location tracking and remote wiping of laptops for anti-theft purposes. While these may be useful to some people, it should be up to hardware owners to decide if this code will be installed in their CPUs or not. Perhaps most alarmingly, there is also reportedly a DRM module that is actively working against the user’s interests, and should never be installed in an ME by default. For expert users on machines without Verified Boot, a Github project called ME cleaner exists and can be used to disable a Management Engine. But be warned: using this tool has the potential to brick hardware, and interested parties should exercise caution before attempting to protect their systems. A real solution is going to require assistance from Intel. What Intel needs to do fix this mess Users need the freedom to choose what they want running on their system, and the ability to remove code that might contain vulnerabilities. Because the Management Engine only runs code modules signed by Intel, this means having a way to disable the ME or reflash it with minimal, auditable firmware. While Intel may put a lot of effort into hunting for security bugs, vulnerabilities will inevitably exist, and having them lurking in a highly privileged, low level component with no OS visibility or reliable logging is a nightmare for defensive cybersecurity. The design choice of putting a secretive, unmodifiable management chip in every CPU was terrible, and leaving their customers exposed to these risks without an opt-out is an act of extreme irresponsibility. What would be best for users and for the public’s ability to control machines that they have purchased would be for Intel to provide official support for reducing the attack surface to limit the potential harm of the ME. So we call upon Intel to: Provide clear documentation for the software modules that are preinstalled on various Management Engines. What HECI commands provide a full list of the installed modules/services? What are the interfaces to those services? Provide a way for their customers to audit ME code for vulnerabilities. That is presently impossible because the code is kept secret. Offer a supported way to disable the ME. If that’s literally impossible, users should be able to flash an absolutely minimal, community-auditable ME firmware image. On systems where the ME is an essential requirement for other security features that are important to some users (like Boot Guard), offer an additional option of a near-minimal, community-auditable ME firmware image that performs these security functions, and nothing else. Or alternatively, a supported way to build and flash firmware images where the user can inspect and control which services/modules are present, in order to manage security risks from those modules. Until Intel takes these steps, we have reason to fear that the undocumented master controller inside our Intel chips could continue to be a source of serious vulnerabilities in personal computers, servers, and critical cybersecurity and physical infrastructure. Intel needs to act quickly to provide the community with an auditable solution to these threats. 1. A second vulnerability allowed local, non-administrator users of Windows systems to provision AMT, if a Windows component called Local Manageability Service (LMS) is installed (whether LMS is installed is typically up to the hardware manufacturer — for instance Lenovo would decide whether or not to include LMS on a Thinkpad by default). The second vulnerability allows non-admin users or compromised accounts to take complete control of those machines by provisioning AMT with settings of their choice. 2. AMT access is not the same as running arbitrary ME code, so attackers can’t access system memory directly; they have to use the console, VNC, or boot OS images to accomplish their goals. 3. If provisioned, AMT listens on ports 16992 and 16993. Often this would only be on a physical Ethernet connection, but provisioning can also enable AMT over WiFi (once an OS is running, AMT over WiFi requires OS support).

One of the most interesting parts is that the garage in the lab was built for a past CEO of the firm Intel acquired in order to challenge for technology leadership in this space. The chief clearly didn't want his four-wheeled baby left out it the sun. However, car residual prices are collapsing, based on an alert that crossed my desk last week, and it struck me that we haven't considered much the secondary impacts of having self-driving cars, and the changes that will result from turning automobiles into four-wheeled elevators. I'll address that this week and close with my product of the week: an amazingly fun Windows 10 math teaching application that I wish I'd had when I was a kid. Self-Driving Cars Many industry players are treating self-driving cars much like you would a feature such as cruise control: a nice-to-have option that will make driving much easier and safer. There are a lot of industries that will be impacted by this, though, both positively and negatively -- not the least of which is the car industry itself, which could find the majority of car companies either vastly changed or out of the market entirely. Replacement Parts for Humans This is perhaps the least obvious change, but with 35K deaths attributed to them each year in the U.S., car accidents have been a huge source of organs for those who need them. Self-driving cars will massively reduce those deaths to near zero, and that could result in a huge imbalance between those who need organs and the available supply. It could lead to a sharp price increase for organs and likely a huge increase in illegal harvesting, particularly in regions where this is already a problem. Efforts to create a cloned alternative in the U.S. have been hampered by the religious right. That could result in a distinct and massive spike in illegal organ harvesting in the U.S., and a huge push for people who need them to go to countries that don't have these restrictions in order to save their lives. This is big enough that it could have a massive impact on which party is in power. Used Cars There recently have been reports that the used car market is beginning to collapse, which is having an adverse impact on car lease and car payment rates because residuals on cars appear to be dropping rapidly. The cause is thought to be Uber (though part of it could be a hot stock market which may be pushing some typical used car buyers to new cars). Uber plans to massively increase its service coverage once it can use autonomous cars. This massive increase should reduce the demand for cars massively, on top of the massive reduction in demand for cars that can't do self-driving (which are expected to be banned in a few years on many roads). That means not only that there will be an increasing inability to resell cars that don't have self-driving capabilities, but also that large numbers of people will feel they don't need cars at all. New Cars If you think about it, fully self-driving cars are like rolling elevators, and in areas covered by services like Uber the cost will be very low and the availability very high. They come without insurance, without parking or fuel charges, and without the need to garage or pay for parking. The cost reduction for going to a service like Uber, which may provide subscription services -- a monthly fee for all you can ride -- should be massive. What that suggests is that the market for new cars should collapse in favor of Cars as a Service. Only the very rich will own cars, as a sign of status. I am surprised that the car companies aren't all joining Toyota in an IBM-like strategy to create cars that use an autonomous car approach called "Guardian Angel," which enhances the driver's capabilities but does not completely eliminate the driver like the Uber and Google approaches do. It's one possible way to preserve their market. Litigation/Insurance The massive reduction in accidents should eliminate much of the need for litigation, both civil and criminal. That change also will impact insurance. I've seen models that suggest car insurance revenues will decrease in the 90 percent range, largely because much of the risk will be mitigated. The need to have car insurance -- outside of firms like Uber, which either will buy in volume or self-insure -- should evaporate. If most folks don't own cars, they won't need to insure them. Media Consumption Media consumption should increase dramatically, because folks who currently are driving to work and unable to consume visual media or read books during their commute will be able to do so. Many will choose to work either coming or going, but most likely will use at least some of the time to watch movies, play video games, or read books and magazines. Law Enforcement With the combination of cars with massive numbers of sensors (including cameras), centralized tracking, and near constant oversight, traffic cops should become redundant. Both on-car and in- street tracking systems will report folks who are misbehaving in real time, and folks who are behaving badly and overriding or not using self-driving will receive tickets in the mail or have law enforcement waiting for them at their next stop or home. The need to put police on the roads should evaporate, except for extreme measures like catching terrorists or robbers. This need likely could be met with weaponized drones designed to eliminate the related threat from the air, and that could respond quickly from centralized depots. Automated On-Site Car Repair Given that many of these cars will be operating 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, the likelihood of an on-road failure will go up, needing a service that can repair the autonomous car where it failed. Much like support for other technology products is outsourced to firms specializing in that service, this too could lend itself to service companies that can span service providers, allowing higher economies of scale, better coverage and lower costs. The easiest system would be an automated service that retrieved the car and delivered it to a regionalized repair depot. You wouldn't be abandoned -- a replacement car likely would pick you up long before the repair vehicle arrived. In fact, given an early warning, it likely would be dispatched before you were stuck. Car Repair/Paint Shops Autonomous cars are basically rolling appliances. With the Uber model, they are also electric. They don't get into accidents, and increasingly, you won't own the vehicle, so why would you need to fix the engine or repaint the body? Granted, there likely will be road damage and repair needs, but they likely will be done by large shops designed to handle Uber-level volumes, or an automated centralized service that probably could do both kinds of repairs in-house. To keep cost down, low-cost replicable body panels and Gorilla Glass likely would reduce dramatically both the need for and cost of repairs. Wrapping Up Autonomous cars represent a massive game change for the car industry. The biggest driver is that this technology could save nearly one and a half million lives worldwide each year. Basically, the long-term plan is to change cars from what they are today into four-wheeled elevators. On the positive side, this will save a massive number of lives and free time up for folks to be more productive or enjoy media. However, it also will lead to massive reductions in industries that make their living off the older model. Self-driving cars are just one aspect of what many are calling "the second industrial revolution," and likely only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the changes robotics and artificial intelligence are likely to bring. I also attended the Microsoft education event last week, and while I did fall in love with the Surface Laptop the company launched, the product that just set me back on my heels was from Fluidity Software's webFluidMath. Like many guys, I'm pretty good with math, but this offering targeting K-12 students provided one of the most fun and capable methods for teaching kids math I've ever seen. Using touch and a low-level AI, the result is a whiteboard space where you can draw figures like triangles and have the system immediately not only render them accurately but also generate the angles and tables that define them. You even can draw cars and the calculations that define the old "if a train traveling at, etc." problems, and not only see how the result was generated but also create animated simulations of the trip -- both individually and across models. In short, you easily can create train drag races and see the math. webFluidMath Software A younger me would have played this like a video game and likely ended up far more capable with algebra and geometry in a relatively short time. Making math fun is a critical part of improving STEM skills, and webFluidMath does that. Granted, it requires a touchscreen computer to work, but it really is the first product I've seen that combines artistic skills, math and a touchscreen into something that truly moves the math skill ball forward. It also would be a useful tool for adults who struggle with math. Making math fun is critical to our future, I think, and thus webFluidMath is my product of the week.

By Tiernan Ray May 8, 2017 12:22 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Graphics chip maker Nvidia’s (NVDA) CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, will be keynoting the GPU Technology Conference this Wednesday, and Rosenblatt Securities’ Hans Mosesmann takes that as his cue to reiterate his Buy rating and his $140 price target. Later in the day, Nvidia will host a meeting with analysts, so Mosesmann offers his thoughts on what to expect. If history is any guide, "As is Jen-Hsun’s wont, look for GTC to be characterized by Nvidia pushing the envelope of GPU compute silicon, performance, and efficiency,” writes Mosesmann. "If history is to repeat itself this means competitors will have to re-evaluate roadmaps as Nvidia raises the bar. Specifically, get set for details on a new GPU, “Volta,” which he expects will give greater competition to Intel’s (INTC) “Xeon Phi” chip (he has a Sell rating on Intel stock): It is difficult to keep pace with Nvidia’s GPU innovation cadence given GPU scale, the fact that CUDA software/compiler has become a defacto standard in GPGPU deployment, and secular trend of GPUs being used in more and more applications (green field for Nvidia). Unlike competitors, Nvidia doesn’t need to make big acquisitions to play the game and it now common for new customers call on Nvidia for help. We expect the new Volta GPU to be play an important part of GTC with per- haps early silicon being demo’d. Most industry observers peg Volta as an early 2018 product (perhaps late 2017) in a Tesla incarnation first to place pressure on the various ASIC approaches out there going after AI workloads, and of course Intel’s new Xeon Phi. A consumer GPU based on Volta could also be possible this year given that GDDR6 DRAM availability would not be an issue and a 12nm TSMC-based Volta would be a relatively low risk proposition (12nm a tweaked 16nm basically). Nvidia shares are down 50 cents, or half a percent, at $103.36.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Red Hat Drives Cloud Infrastructure Upgrades with Latest Version of Production-Ready OpenStack Platform BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, today announced Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11, the latest version of Red Hat’s massively-scalable and agile cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Based on the OpenStack “Ocata” release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers enhanced support for upgrades with composable roles, new networking capabilities, and improved integration with Red Hat CloudForms for cloud management. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers a reliable cloud platform built on the proven, enterprise-grade backbone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Based on OpenStack community code, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is a tested, certified and fully-supported version of OpenStack that provides the agility to scale and more quickly meet customer demand without compromising availability, performance or IT security requirements. Red Hat OpenStack Platform also includes Red Hat CloudForms to ease day-to-day management operations. It serves as a hybrid cloud management and monitoring platform to oversee not only OpenStack infrastructure components but also the workloads running on a given Red Hat OpenStack Platform cloud. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 maintains its tight integration with Red Hat Ceph Storage and introduces the co-location of Red Hat Ceph Storage with OpenStack compute nodes. Previously in tech-preview, this release also enables storage mirroring to help simplify data replication between sites, improving disaster recovery for customers. Improved Upgradability Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduced composable roles, which allow operators to create customized profiles for individual services and processes to suit their unique needs. This helps to improve operation and efficiency by allowing operators to scale and manage the individual services they need at any moment, rather than scaling the entire cloud. While this makes it easier for enterprises to customize OpenStack deployments to fit their specific needs at scale, it also introduces challenges in upgrading to new versions of the platform. To address this, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 now supports upgrades for composable roles, making the deployment and upgradability of Red Hat OpenStack Platform more adaptable and consistent while retaining the important aspects of lifecycle management. In addition, OpenStack services can now be composed individually and assigned, enabling operators to place components such as databases, proxies, or messaging services on specific nodes based on their unique requirements. This includes adding customized roles post-deployment to a running cloud, providing more flexibility to customers or partners as they become more successful with their cloud services. Expanded networking and network function virtualization support Networking and network function virtualization (NFV) support remains a key function of OpenStack deployments, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers several new capabilities, designed for standard networking use cases as well as extreme workloads such as those required by information and communication technology services providers. New features include: Full support for VLAN-aware virtual machines (VMs), OpenStack-based VMs can now send and receive VLAN encapsulated traffic while being deployed over Open vSwitch (OVS) or OVS Data Plane Development Kit (OVS-DPDK). Additional telecommunications provider enhancements with upgrades to OVS and DPDK to provide latest features and functions, resulting in increased performance optimizations. Enhanced management with Red Hat CloudForms Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 improves its integration with Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud management solution, to better support management requirements for day-to-day operations of a Red Hat OpenStack Platform-based cloud. Included with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11, Red Hat CloudForms can now access and control OpenStack regions, multiple domains, and host aggregates for a more unified controller view of cloud health and efficiency. Storage management has also been enhanced, as Red Hat CloudForms can now perform volume snapshot management functions like creation, listing and deletion, further streamlining the overall management of the cloud platform. Partner and customer success Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a proven, enterprise-grade solution for building, deploying and scaling cloud deployments across geographic and industry boundaries. Hundreds of customers rely on Red Hat OpenStack Platform to power their hybrid and private clouds for a variety of mission-critical deployments, including BBVA; Cambridge University; FICO; Massachusetts Open Cloud; NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Paddy Power Betfair; Produban; Swisscom; UKCloud; and Verizon. And, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is backed by a robust ecosystem of partners, including Cisco, Dell, Intel, Lenovo, NetApp, Rackspace, Ericsson, HPE, IBM, and many more. Innovation paired with support Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 is the second release covered by Red Hat’s varying support life cycle model. Under this model, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 will be supported for one year with customers being able to leverage Red Hat’s award-winning global support team for help with migrations and upgrades to future versions. Availability Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 will be available in the coming weeks via the Red Hat Customer Portal and as a component of the Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure and Red Hat Cloud Suite solutions.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Tuesday May 9, 2017 About Us App Advertise Contact Us Taiwan > National Foreign Community National Local Foreign Affairs China-Taiwan Relations Business Arts-Leisure TSMC's market cap edges closer to Intel's as share price rises CNA  Monday, May 8, 2017, 2:51 pm TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 The share price of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電) continued to rise Monday, pushing the contract chip maker's market capitalization closer to that of U.S.-based integrated circuit giant Intel Corp., dealers said. TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local equity market, was driving the movement of the main board amid high hopes of stronger sales in June, when the Taiwanese company is expected to start shipping the A11 processor for the next generation iPhone, dealers said. As of 11:42 a.m., shares of TSMC had climbed 1.27 percent to NT$200.00 (US$6.63), after an early high of NT$200.50, with 18.20 million shares changing hands on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The weighted index was up 3.42 points or 0.03 percent at 9903.36, off an early high of 9,964.86. Based on the NT$200 share price, TSMC's market cap was estimated at a record NT$5.18 trillion, the highest among all the listed firms on the main board and the over-the-counter market. That puts the Taiwan company close to Intel, which had a market cap of about NT$5.22 trillion as of Friday. Currently, TSMC is ranked as the world's third largest semiconductor company in terms of sales, while Intel is No. 1. "Buying in TSMC remained solid soon after the local main board opened today, pushing its share price to a new high," KGI Securities analyst Phil Chu said. "Many investors are anticipating that the Taiwanese firm will climb out of the current slow sales season when it starts shipping the A11 processor to Apple Inc. in June." Apple is expected to start building inventories of key components for its new iPhones by the end of June in preparation for the launch of the devices in the second half of the year. In Monday trade in Taiwan, the broader market saw some profit taking after the early high but TSMC's share price held above NT$200 on optimism of further strengthening when it starts shipping the processor, Chu said. TSMC, a leader in production technology, has said that chips made on its advanced 10 nanometer process are expected to contribute about 10 percent to its total sales this year after production began in the fourth quarter of last year. The company has also been working to develop chips on the 7nm and 5nm processes and is hoping to start mass production in 2018 and 2020, respectively. "The current gains posted by TSMC's shares probably resulted mainly from buying by foreign institutional investors as they tend to favor the stock because of its sound fundamentals," Chu said. Foreign institutional investors have bought a net 100 million TSMC shares in the past 10 trading sessions, he said.

Flickr: Intel Free Press The Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam (MOIT) has released a draft circular containing guidelines on how to develop solar PV in the country, but failed to address a range of issues that could impact large-scale project bankability, according to analysis from multinational law firm Baker McKenzie. In mid-April, MOIT finally announced its feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme for utility-scale solar projects along with a net metering scheme for rooftop PV systems, but it has now also released a draft power purchase agreement (PPA) template for solar. Baker McKenzie partners Fred Burke and Chi Lieu Dang noted that MOIT has proposed this Draft PPA as a ‘non-negotiable’ template for all grid-connected solar PPAs, despite leaving certain key issues “unresolved”. As previously announced, the FiT for utility-scale solar PV of VND2.086/kWh (US$0.0935) would be subject to fluctuations in the VND/USD exchange rate. The partners said: “Though the price is converted in USD based on a current exchange rate, the Draft PPA does not include any indexation of the FiT by way of escalation in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the exchange rate, or any other provision to address inflation risks.” They noted that under the draft PPA, the monopoly utility Vietnam Electricity Corporation (EVN), which will be the sole off-taker of solar generation, will have the right to curtail solar power in a range of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the seller, without any compensation or payments to the project developer. Moreover, if the developer has the whole plant or a section of the plant ready for injecting power to the grid, EVN still has no obligation to make payments if th utility has not built the grid connections on time. The Baker McKenzie partners also cited limited protection of the project developer’s outstanding debts if the PPA was terminated as a result of EVN defaulting. Meanwhile, in terms of dispute resolution, the partners noted that the draft PPA fails to provide for offshore (international) arbitration, which they claimed is an essential part any of large-scale PPA. Instead the draft only lists a range of domestic actions on disputes, with the possibility of bringing them to Vietnamese courts for litigation. They also listed the absence of various support policies that most investors would expect to be included, such as: no government guarantee or support to enhance the creditworthiness of EVN; no provision addressing the risk of changes in law or tax after the PPA signing; nor provision for payment protection in the case of unexpected events such as war or natural disasters. The Draft PPA even puts liabilities on the developer for grid connection costs and associated risks, without accounting for the balance of cheaper land costs, versus higher costs of transmission in more remote areas. The partners concluded: “Obviously a more pragmatic and flexible approach will be needed for the Draft PPA to accomplish its objective of mobilizing investment into clean solar power.” The MOIT release also contains guidelines listing various requirements for solar projects. EVN plans 350MW of PV plants In related news, EVN announced on its website that its subsidiary Power Generation Corp 3 (Genco 3) is looking to develop two solar plants in the Phuoc Minh Thuan Nam district, Ninh Thuan province, with a combined capacity of 350MW over 554 hectares of land. The projects would require 9.57 trillion (US$421 million) investment and would be implemented from Q2 2018 to Q1 2021. It has been known for some time the power giant has been considering various PV project developments, but it has rarely provided significant detail.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature VGA res and 20 FPS - but it's fine! Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 09/05/2017 at 05:16 Revoran says: Pather Modem – DoW3 isn’t badly optimised though? It runs fine on a wide variety of systems. The graphics options menu is lacklustre, yes. What the devs need to work on is fixing bugs and crashes and providing more detailed gfx options. But performance-wise the game is generally fine. SC2, LoL and WoW run fine on old systems today because they are OLD games. SC2 and LoL are 7 years old. WoW is 13 years old. 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough. I’ve been surviving on nothing but Battle Brothers, Crusader Kings 2 and Spelunky for three months now.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah! When you’re as old as I am and remember having had to tweak config.sys and autoexec.bat files in DOS to free memory at boot, editing a small confil file is no big deal! :)) Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 08:51 Mister eX says: It’s by no means a big deal, but not every game allows that kind of outside tweaking – like an optional “user.cfg” file with the Frostbite engine – where you can change stuff that’s not available in the game’s or config util’s settings, or in the default settings file. You have to do research on what kinds of parameters you can put in there, etc… 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit.

Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 16:45 Enkidum says: I wish someone would remake Myths I and II. The basic gameplay was superb, both in single-player and multiplayer, and I’ve never played anything else with that specific type of pure tactical combat with no resource management at all. And the writing + art assets, both sprites and loading screens, were so much better than… honestly virtually anything I’ve played before or since. Shame those developers disappeared and have never made anything at all since… Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 06:37 jtdiddy says: Whats the best settings i can get away with playing dow3 on a i7 SP4?

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..? Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:18 Kaeoschassis says: On an ancient, physically broken laptop bearing a particularly terrible intel graphics setup (which has all sorts of fun quirks, for example, glitching out like crazy anytime anything tries to do v-synch ever), and yeah, I know the feeling. There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Relics essence engine is awfully out dated these days. Theyre always looking out for potatoes. Thats why all previous games have had a crappy zoom out, but better model detail. Now theyve zoomed out a bit and the model quality has dropped. Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 10:26 BlueTemplar says: The Surface Pro 3 has a native resolution of 2160×1440 (3:2 or 13.5:9), which is _way_ too high in pixel density (216 ppi) for a 12.0 inches (30 cm) screen. You have to run it with scaling, which causes all sorts of issues with older software and additional screens – annoying for what is supposed to be a “Pro” device. So recently I settled on running it directly at 1440×900 (16:10), with no scaling. It’s the native horizontal resolution of 2160 divided by 1.5, so the blurriness is minimized, it has a pixel density of a bit more than 140 ppi, which feels not too dense, and the integrated graphics can better withstand games at that resolution. This also means I can run some games windowed at 1280×720. Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 19:06 Nolenthar says: Fun times. In the case of the author (being, an user having one normal PC and one non gaming PC), it’s good fun I admit. I have good fun as well playing on my laptop, even though I generally stick to old games just because, technically, a game is fun irrelevant if it was made in 2005 or in 2017. New games on a crappy hardware, it’s better to avoid it imo, as a new game on low settings generally look a lot worse than an old game on medium or high settings, for some reasons Log in to Reply 04/05/2017 at 17:53 Kamikaze-X says: What is the point of trying to run modern games on hardware that can’t handle it if it ends up looking like older games anyway? I had an Atom based tablet for a little while, and it was perfectly content running games like Rise of Nations, an absolutely fantastic yet by todays standards ancient game and it ran it great. we just cannot expect devs to cater for every single hardware combo out there, and you would buy hardware for a particular use case. Its like buying photoshop for your ZX Spectrum and complaining to adobe that it won’t work. Log in to Reply 08/05/2017 at 04:14 bill says: “What is the point of trying to run modern games on hardware that can’t handle it if it ends up looking like older games anyway?” Er.. usually the point is to be able to play modern games when you have older/weaker hardware. Playing older games is also an option of course. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply. Comment on this story You must be registered and logged in to post a comment.

We had to order a new array to hold all of this week's Dell EMC announcements A roundup for file geeks, blockhead nerds 9 May 2017 at 05:36, Chris Mellor Dell EMC World Dell EMC is pumping out, among other things this week, updated arrays from five product families: VMAX, XtremIO, Unity, SC and Isilon. This new gear features a heavy dose of flash, new controllers, denser enclosures, higher capacities, and refreshed software. As the main revenue-earning engine of the $74bn run-rate Dell Technologies, Dell EMC is now the storage competitor to beat – and virtually every other supplier has products aimed at besting those delivered by Michael Dell's behemoth. So Micky's mob is shoveling out a raft of announcements to keep the pressure up. Naturally there is a digital transformation marketing wrapper around all this stuff but, shorn of that, this is a set of traditional array hardware and software upgrades. Newly embedded into Dell, the EMC part of the business has adopted the Dell SC array into its product line and introduced new versions of it alongside the EMC heritage arrays to retain its top storage dog status and fend off its myriad competitors. OK, deep breath – there was an awful of lot of stuff announced on Monday, so here's our rapid summary with links to more info if you really need it: VMAX 950F The 950F version of Dell EMC's high-end, mission-critical workload array uses the latest Intel CPUs and has software enhancements to improve performance at scale. Dell EMC says it has a 25 per cent smaller footprint for the same performance than the previous generation. It, naturally, offers VMAX data management services, such as RDF (Symmetrix Remote Data Facility), D@RE (Data at-Rest Encryption), non-disruptive migration and inline compression. With a claimed 6.7 million random read hit IOPS, and 350 microseconds response time, it is said to be 68 per cent faster and have a 30 per cent better response time than the VMAX 850F. Dell EMC claims it is up to 4x faster at OLTP with compression than the nearest, but unnamed, competitor. This VMAX has more than six "nines" availability (99.9999 per cent) and Dell EMC suggests it's good for core banking, credit card processing, electronic billing or hospital record systems that "can never, ever go down." Since seven-nines Infinidat (99.99999 per cent uptime) is claiming it's faster than VMAX, and offering a win-or-lose ten grand evaluation, VMAX customers can get set for some interesting performance comparisons. This Dell EMC blog post says more about the 950F. The system can be ordered this month and will be generally available in June. XtremIO X2 We're told more horsepower has been added to XtremIO's hardware, and the software has been updated. The X2 generation has three times the capacity of the previous XtremIO models, 80 per cent better response time, and an average 25 per cent improved storage efficiency. It can support 2x more copies per cluster for integrated copy data management (iCDM), we're told. Compared to the previous XtremIO product, X2 provides 3x the capacity per X‑Brick and multi-dimensional scalability to scale up from 7TB to 138TB per X‑Brick, scaling out up to eight X‑Bricks. Also X2's rack density has been increased 4x, providing up to 5.5PB effective capacity and a capacity density of over 100TB effective per rack unit. It has a price as low as one-third of its predecessor. In contrast to VMAX, Dell EMC says the X2 "is the ideal platform for workloads that benefit from deduplication and ... iCDM for large-scale snapshots, such as VDI and development/test use cases." The X2 generation is discussed in this official blog post. Check out tech specs here. XtremIO X2 can be ordered this month and will be generally available in the summer. Unity all-flash The four new all-flash Unity 350F, 450F, 550F and 650F models feature, it's claimed, up to 4x larger file system capacity at 256TB, and an 8x increase in density compared to the previous Unity generation. They have up to 500TB of effective storage capacity in an 80‑drive, 3U enclosure. Dell EMC says inline compression for file (not block) provides an additional 2:1 savings, and supplies, overall, 8x more effective file system capacity than its predecessor. These new systems have iCDM with snapshot mobility, simpler mapped RAID protection and support for external encryption key management via KMIP (key management interoperability protocol). With new snap-in rails and better documentation, these Unities feature sub-10-minute deployment, which we're told is 33 per cent faster than before. Good to know. A Unity blog post here should provide more info. But check out a data sheet here. Unity all-flash models can be ordered this month and will be available in July. SC5020 Compared to the previous SC4020, the new and re-engineered hybrid SC entry-to-mid-range block array has twice the capacity at 2PB, up to 45 per cent more IOPS, and 3x the bandwidth, with FC, iSCSI and direct-attach SAS connectivity. There is a new 3U enclosure with 30 drive bays and dual, of course, controllers. Dell EMC claims it has the market's lowest hybrid array $/GB cost compared to other unnamed mid-range storage from major vendors. We assume this means HPE, IBM and NetApp. The comparison was done by Dell EMC using net effective capacity after 5:1 data reduction, and including five years of 7x24x4-hour on-site support as compared to other midrange storage from major vendors when using the same mix of SSD and HDD capacity. Your $/GB cost may vary, of course. The SC5020 can be ordered this month and will be generally available in June. Dell EMC tell us this page will provide more detail. There was no announcement about the PS arrays. Isilon all-flash The latest flash-filled Isilon kit has an "Infinity" architecture and modular design, and is claimed to provide up to 9x the IOPs, 18x the throughput and 21x the capacity of the closest-but-unnamed competitor's all-flash NAS array. Compared to the existing Isilon generation arrays, the Infinity systems deliver up to 6x the IOPS, 11x the throughput, and have twice the capacity. When compared with the existing Isilon HD400, the new Isilon design can, we're told, increase data center efficiency by up to 75 per cent, reducing data center power, cooling and space requirements. There are all-Flash (F800), hybrid and archive configurations. Performance and capacity can be upgraded. The new systems run the OneFS operating system and can be deployed in existing Isilon clusters or in new ones. The all-flash F800 offers up to 250,000 IOPS and 15GB/sec bandwidth per chassis. It has 60 drive bays and provides 96TB to 924TB capacity per chassis, depending on SSD capacity (1.6TB-15.4TB). Isilon F800 not yet fully unwrapped for Dell World exhibition Dell EMC is pointing these Isilon arrays at what it calls demanding file applications across industries including media and entertainment, life sciences and financial services. Check out this webpage to find out more. New Isilon platforms can be ordered this month and will be generally available in June. Nibble An Intelligent Data Mobility 2.0 offering from Dell EMC Services provides a platform- and vendor-agnostic data migration methodology. It features standardized blueprints in three packages, with customers getting an engagement tailored, Dell EMC says, to their business and technology needs. There are few more impressive sights in the industry than the Dell EMC product engine pumping out new kit for its annual show-and-tell customer and partner bonanza. Here's what is basically EMC still doing its thing, with Dell's SC taken on-board and playing its part too. We wait to see how Dell EMC will respond to Infinidat competition at the VMAX level, the pushing from Pure and NVMe in the XtremIO/Unity area and the Unity trademark case loss against Nexsan. But for Dell EMC customers, the first realization is that EMC hasn't changed inside Dell. It's an aggressive product development and marketing machine set on crushing its competition.

If you want to listen, parse, route, transmit, execute, filter, and prioritize, think: edge processing on MiNiFi in a constrained environment, like a car. MiniFi Command and Control! There's also text mining in Spark by Yanbo and Hortonworks. Using Spark and Python, you can do sentiment analysis, do fraud detection on a single machine, and scale to clusters of thousands of servers. You can take the same Python libraries like NLTK, and SKLearn for small data and run them at scale. Examples of data include sensor data, Twitter data, machine-generated data, and logs. The more data you have for Machine Learning, the better your results will be. For text mining on Big Data, you need the combination of Apache Spark running on YARN with Apache Hadoop storing massive data distributed on HDFS and S3. Data scientists and data engineers need to work together with better algorithms and models to make predictions on input from streaming data and to collaborate with tools like Apache Zeppelin.

The outgoing president issued the warning when the two men met in the White House two days after Trump’s election victory, White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed on Monday. Spicer acknowledged that Obama had expressed misgivings about Flynn, a former general, but said they were general criticisms. “It’s true that President Obama made it known that he wasn’t exactly a fan of Gen Flynn’s,” Spicer said, but added that such remarks were unsurprising as Flynn had been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration’s policies. He said Flynn’s security clearance had been renewed in April 2016, and the Obama White House had not stepped in to revoke it. Flynn was appointed head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2012 but was fired two years later, reportedly over dissatisfaction over his management style and temperament. Reports on Monday attributed to Obama officials differed on whether the concerns voiced by Obama were linked to his DIA performance or because of his Russia links. Flynn had received income from RT in 2015, a state-run television channel formerly known as Russia Today, which he did not initially declare. Despite Obama’s warnings, Trump picked Flynn as his national security adviser, but the retired general was forced to resign after little more than three weeks after it emerged he had had extensive contacts with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, and had not given a full account of them to other White House officials. Federal records also showed that his company, the Flynn Intel Group, had been paid more than a half-million dollars to lobby on behalf of projects that benefited the Turkish government in 2016. The news reports that Obama had alerted Trump over concerns about Flynn came hours before the former acting attorney general Sally Yates was due to testify to a Senate committee on her own warnings to the White House days after Trump took office that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position by his failure to make a full disclosure of his Kislyak contacts. Yates was fired a few days after her White House warning, at the end of January, for refusing to defend the travel ban, suspending entry for refugees and travelers from seven Muslim countries, in court. Yates’ testimony is expected to contradict the White House, which has sought to play down the detail and severity of her warnings about Flynn, at a time when the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russian government in general are under scrutiny by the FBI and Congress. But in her written testimony, Yates told the committee she was limited in what she could say in open hearing. “I want to note that I intend my answers today to be as fulsome and comprehensive as possible while respecting my legal and ethical boundaries,” she said. “As the subcommittee understands, many of the topics of interest today concern classified information that I cannot address in this public setting, either directly or indirectly. My duty to protect classified information applies just as much to me as a former official as it did when I led the department.” On the day of her testimony, Trump tweeted: “Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to [White House] counsel.” The tweet referred to a conversation Yates had with the White House legal adviser, Donald McGahn, about Flynn’s position, and appeared to hint that she would know who had leaked the content of the discussion. Asked about the meaning of the message, Spicer said: “The tweet speaks for itself.” Trump also blamed the Obama administration for giving Flynn a security clearance. “General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,” the president tweeted on Monday. Spicer echoed this attack at his briefing, asking: “If President Obama was truly concerned about Flynn, why didn’t he pull his security clearance?” CNN reported that the concerns Obama raised about Flynn when he met Trump at the White House were connected to the Russia investigation. “Flynn’s name kept popping up,” one senior Obama administration source is quoted as saying. However, NBC quoted a former official as saying that Obama had only passed on “a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high-level post”. Retired military officers can retain their security clearance subject to periodic background checks, which cover foreign payments and contacts. Failure to make full disclosure of such contacts in an application for renewal of clearance is punishable by a fine or five years imprisonment. Obama administration officials say that such security clearance renewals after retirement are routine, and that vetting for a top White House post such as national security adviser would require a much higher threshold. They said such vetting was the responsibility of any incoming administration.

It is vital to have a secure, open, scalable and interoperable set of mechanisms to reduce the reliance on passwords while also protecting user privacy. These are important concepts that are enabling secure authentication practices in finance and other key industries; both within and outside the enterprise. “India is ahead of the curve on authentication in many respects - the Reserve Bank of India, for example, mandates that online transactions above a certain threshold use two-factor authentication,” said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. “The launch of the FIDO India Working Group and the partnership with DSCI extends the FIDO Alliance’s global reach and will enable us to educate the Indian market on how FIDO authentication can help service providers meet such mandates, while vastly improving security and usability of strong authentication over solutions like one-time passcodes and digital certificates.” On the creation of the partnership, Rama Vedashree, CEO, DSCI said, “With the proliferation of digital and mobile banking, secure and foolproof authentication is a key to reassuring consumers and building trust. We look forward to working with FIDO and its members in spreading awareness of stronger authentication standards.” The FIDO India Working Group will be led by co-chairs Ramesh Kesanupalli, co-founder of the FIDO Alliance and founder of Nok Nok Labs, and Ashok Chandak, senior director of global sales and marketing at NXP Semiconductors. At launch, 11 leading FIDO Alliance member companies active in the Indian market are participating in the FIDO India Working Group: Digit Secure, Feitian, FingerPrint Cards, Hypersecu, Intel Corporation, Nok Nok Labs, NXP Semiconductors, Persistent Systems, Redpine, Synaptics and Uniken, Inc. FIDO authentication reduces organizations’ and users’ reliance on passwords with interoperable on-device authentication that is stronger and easier to use. FIDO initiates regional working groups to help its members to identify and drive awareness for how FIDO standards can address in-market requirements. To learn more about the FIDO Alliance working groups, visit https://fidoalliance.org/working-groups/. About the FIDO Alliance The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services. The FIDO Alliance Board of Directors includes leading global organizations: Aetna, Inc.

It's not a particular car, or advanced sensor suite, or even the software that controls the hardware. The most important ingredient just might be data. Lots and lots, and then even more data. That's one reason why the deal between Mobileye ­– the autonomous driving system company with which Tesla famously parted ways – and Intel was worth so much. Now, with Tesla's most recent update, it wants to collect more data, in the form of video, from customers' cars to improve its autonomous driving capabilities, as Electrek points out. Tesla's most recent software update improved a number of Autopilot features for cars equipped with second-generation hardware. Autopilot brings back most of the capabilities the company had when it was still powered by Mobileye, with Autosteer working at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour on the highway (up from 80 mph), and up to five mph greater than the speed limit off the highway (up from 35 mph). It also does more to brake or steer to avoid an accident. After the download, though, customers were asked to approve a data sharing policy that includes gathering video from the car's exterior cameras. In the message that appeared in cars, Tesla says that to improve autonomous features, "we need to collect short video clips using the car's external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions. The more fleet learning of road conditions we are able to do, the better your Tesla's self-driving ability will become." Tesla also asks for permission to share this data with its partners. And it's true. While companies do their own self-driving testing to gather as much data as they can, when you use your own customers' cars as test vehicles, the opportunity – and the responsibility – to make them as safe as possible by gathering and applying as much data as possible is huge. Tesla assures customers, though, that it will protect their privacy. "We want to be super clear that these short video clips are not linked to your vehicle identification number. In order to protect your privacy, we have ensured that there is no way to search our system for clips that are associated with a specific car." It also says that customers can change their minds at any time. That doesn't mean, though, that some enterprising hacker like Jason Hughes can't grab video directly from vehicles at the salvage lot. But then again, if the data helps improve Autopilot, it could help keep those cars safely on the road and out of the junkyard.

He'll take over immediately from Australian James Hogan, current president and group CEO who will leave the company on July 1 following a handover period. Mr Gammell was previously Etihad's chief people and performance officer, a job he took up in 2009 having served as RBS's head of HR for Europe and the Middle East. At Etihad he has been responsible for a workforce drawn from 154 nationalities, including driving a so-called Emiratisation strategy to boost the total Emirati workforce of more than 3,000 at Etihad Aviation Group. The former Army officer held executive positions at Intel in the US and Ireland, as well as at RBS before joining the airline. He is a chartered fellow at the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development and holds a Masters Degree from University College Dublin. He joins a growing roster of Irish executives in senior airline posts around the world, including Willie Walsh at IAG and Michael O'Leary at Ryanair, as well as Alan Joyce, who heads up Qantas, and Malaysia Airlines CEO Peter Bellew. Etihad also announced that Ricky Thirion will become interim group financial officer, replacing chief financial officer James Rigney who also leaves in July. The company had previously announced in January that the two Australians were leaving some time in the second half of the year. The temporary replacements come less than a week after Italy's Alitalia, 49pc owned by Etihad, filed for special administration for the second time in less than a decade after workers rejected its latest rescue plan. Alitalia was one of Etihad's key investments as it raced to catch up with fast-growing rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways by buying into several foreign carriers, including the Italian carrier and Air Berlin. However, the Abu Dhabi-owned airline said last week it was not willing to invest further in Alitalia. As interim CEO, Mr Gammell is to continue with a strategic review begun last year though a permanent group CEO is expected to be announced in the "next few weeks", chairman Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel al-Mazrouei said in a statement. Gulf airlines have seen growth slow over the past two years against a more challenging economic backdrop - including lower oil prices squeezing spending in the region - while East to West traffic diminished after a wave of militant attacks in Europe and Turkey.

There are at least four measures being pushed by Republicans who champion the tax incentives as a way to spur new business growth. It's unclear which of the bills will make it to the finish line, and time is short because legislative leaders say adjournment could come as early as Tuesday or Wednesday. The House on Monday delayed debate on one measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. Senate Bill 1416 also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The measure also would extend a research and development credit that was due to be reduced next year. The bill sponsor, Rep. Jeff Weninger of Chandler, is working on a series of amendments to try to garner more support for the measure. The Senate voted 21-7 Monday in favor of proposal that calls for boosting by $10 million an existing program in which so-called "angel investors" can benefit from tax credits for backing small businesses. The measure now goes back to the House for consideration. Sponsor Sen. Karen Fann said the program has already boosted economic activity. "I do believe that this has generated not only additional dollars but it also enhanced any money that would have been invested to begin with," Fann said. A third proposal in House Bill 1292 would increase eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. The most contentious bill, Senate Bill 1212, creates a tax credit for investment in rural communities. The proposal would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell, mainly to insurance companies, to generate cash to repay investors. The proposal from Rep. T.J. Shope has been stalled but could be revived in the final days of the session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes Shope's bill, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. The final days of the session are often marked by fits and starts as lawmakers and Republican leaders try to revive legislation that earlier fell by the wayside, so predicting an ending date is virtually impossible. In early action Monday, the Senate joined the House is approving legislation increasing the mileage rate lawmakers receive for driving to the Capitol. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey for his consideration. Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers signed on in support of the proposal. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard said lawmakers who travel long distances need an increase from the state rate of 44½ cents per mile to the federal rate of 53½ cents a mile. He cites low lawmaker pay of $24,000 a year and the costs for rural members who often must drive hours to Phoenix.

The House's 41-19 vote Monday sends the legislation back to the Senate for final approval before it heads to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk. The Senate unanimously approved the measure in February. Senate Bill 1384 by Republican state Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Yee would safeguard First Amendment protections for student journalists at public schools, community colleges, and universities from being censored by their school's administration. It would limit schools' guidelines to restricting content that is libelous, invades personal privacy, violates federal or state law, or "materially and substantially disrupts the orderly operation" of the school. An amendment to the bill would also prohibit lewd and obscene content. ___ 2:35 p.m. The House has delayed debate on a major tax credit bill that also would give a big break to computer chip-maker Intel. Debate on the bill championed by Republican Rep. Jeff Weninger was delayed Monday. It is one of at least four tax credit bills designed to boost business activity that Republican lawmakers are trying to pass in the final days of the legislative session. A proposal to add $10 million in "angel investor" tax credits for investors who back small businesses received initial approval by the Senate on Monday, teeing it up for a formal vote. A third proposal would increase eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses, while the most contentious bill creates a tax credit program for investment in rural communities. ___ 12:20 p.m. The Arizona Senate has joined the House in voting to increase how much lawmakers are reimbursed for driving to the Capitol. The Senate approved House Bill 2227 by Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard on a 22-8 vote Monday. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey for his signature or veto. The House approved the bill on a 55-3 vote in February. Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers signed on in support of the proposal. Mesnard says lawmakers who travel long distances need an increase from the state rate of 44½ cents per mile to the federal rate of 53½ cents a mile. He cites low lawmaker pay of $24,000 a year and the costs for rural members who often must drive two or three hours to Phoenix. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature is expected to push to adjourn its 2017 session now that it has passed a budget for the coming fiscal year. Lawmakers return to the Capitol on Monday for what is expected to be two to three days of debate and votes on remaining legislation before ending the session. The final days are often marked by fits and starts as lawmakers and Republican leaders try to revive legislation that earlier fell by the wayside. Last week's passage of the $9.8 billion budget leaves a handful of priorities unmet for some majority Republicans, including three tax-credit bills. The last of three bills targeting initiatives also may come into play after stalling in the Senate. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he's expecting adjournment Wednesday, although Tuesday is possible. — This story has been corrected to show the correct spelling of Gov.

Reeves took notes for seven hours at the meeting. Buffett's view on the importance of a hotline is something Reeves is bringing home. Ari Levy | @levynews 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Lacy O'Toole | CNBC Warren Buffett Secret Millionaire's Club dolls on display at the Annual Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder's Meeting in Omaha, NE on May 6, 2017. Joshua Reeves bought a couple hundred dollars worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares in 2004, with some money he made from an internship at Intel. He'd just finished his freshman year Stanford. Thirteen years later, as CEO of a $1.1 billion software start-up called Gusto, Reeves took advantage of his Berkshire ownership and traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, for the company's annual shareholder meeting. For Reeves, who's read a number of books about Warren Buffett, the event marked the end of a two-week, 12-city road trip visiting Gusto's small business customers. Gusto's software is designed to simplify back office functions like human resources and payroll. He took the cross-country trek in an RV, before flying to Omaha from Jacksonville, Florida, on Friday. "Books are great, but nothing can replace some face-to-face interactions," Reeves said in an interview on Monday, before hopping on a flight back to San Francisco. "I sat there for seven hours writing pages and pages of notes." Reeves spent Saturday at the CenturyLink Center in Downtown Omaha, listening to the entire presentation and question-and-answer session. On Friday, he strolled through the exhibit hall for what Berkshire calls "shareholder shopping day," viewing demos from Dairy Queen and See's Candies as well as jet engine maker Precision Castparts and homebuilder Clayton Homes. Reeves said he listened intently both to Buffett's views on technology and tech companies as well as his broader advice on leadership and building businesses. show chapters ZenPayroll's plans for Gusto    Monday, 21 Sep 2015 | 11:51 AM ET | 03:22 Buffett admits when he makes mistakes. He acknowledged missing out on internet companies Google, Facebook and Amazon, because their models of capital efficiency didn't make sense in their early days. Buffett's specialty has been more in industrial and traditional retail names, where there's a clear capital structure -- a product and a cost to make that product. "These software and media companies don't need equity financing because they can self-fund indefinitely given how profitable they are," Reeves said, reading off his notes. "He was describing that as a newer trend they missed out on." The way Reeves interprets Buffett's investments in technology is that it's now a fundamental part of every industry. Software is pervasive in his jet engine, railroad and machinery investments, and even in how companies like insurer Geico run online ad campaigns. Buffett on tech "Tech is not just one category anymore," Reeves said. "It's a huge part of the economy." Reeves said he was most impressed with Buffett's humility and the importance he places on ethics. Buffett called the recent Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal that led to the ouster of its CEO a "huge, huge, huge error," and said the employee incentive system was partly to blame. Berkshire is the bank's biggest investor. Buffett talked about the Berkshire hotline that allows anyone across his portfolio of companies to submit questions and problems. Reeves said he was encouraged enough by the idea to consider putting in a similar hotline for Gusto, especially considering the troubles now facing Bay Area companies like Uber. "We're of sufficient size now that it's important for folks to know they have an additional way to share feedback," Reeves said. Reeves said he's presenting stories from his road trip to employees on Wednesday.

There are at least four measures being pushed by Republicans who champion the tax incentives as a way to spur new business growth. It's unclear which of the bills will make it to the finish line, and time is short because legislative leaders say adjournment could come as early as Tuesday or Wednesday. The House on Monday delayed debate on one measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. Senate Bill 1416 also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The measure also would extend a research and development credit that was due to be reduced next year. The bill sponsor, Rep. Jeff Weninger of Chandler, is working on a series of amendments to try to garner more support for the measure. The Senate voted 21-7 Monday in favor of proposal that calls for boosting by $10 million an existing program in which so-called "angel investors" can benefit from tax credits for backing small businesses. The measure now goes back to the House for consideration. Sponsor Sen. Karen Fann said the program has already boosted economic activity.

WebOS has plenty of features. Vibrant greens. Cons Poor contrast. Uneven, inaccurate colors. Bottom Line LG's UH6100 line of 4K TVs can process HDR content, but budget prices mean lower-quality panels with poor contrast and uneven color. By Will Greenwald The good news about 4K TVs is that just about every manufacturer is now jumping on the high dynamic range (HDR) bandwagon, which means a wider range of colors along with darker darks and brighter brights. The bad news is that even if it supports it, a budget TV can only do so much justice to HDR content. LG's ultra high-definition (UHD, or 4K) UH6100 series is very affordable, with the 49-inch 49UH6100 model we tested available for $549.99. It also is loaded with connected features thanks to LG's top-notch WebOS platform. It's a shame that contrast is poor, and color range is uneven. //Compare Similar Products Compare LeEco Super4 X55   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-49X800D   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio M50-D1   %displayPrice%%seller% LG 55UH8500   %displayPrice%%seller% LG OLED55B6P   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio P50-C1   %displayPrice%%seller% SunBriteTV Pro Series Direct-Sun Outdoor TV SB-4217HD   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio D65u-D2   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-65X930D   %displayPrice%%seller% TCL 50UP130   %displayPrice%%seller% Design Looking like your typical budget TV, the 49UH6100 is plain and unassuming. The screen is surrounded by a 0.6-inch flat, glossy black plastic bezel with no distinguishing features aside from a small LG logo and a power LED in the middle of the bottom edge. The TV sits on two long, curved plastic feet that are almost completely black, with silver-colored strips on their tops. An HDMI port and a USB port face left on the back panel. The other two HDMI ports, along with an Ethernet port, component video input, coaxial audio input, optical audio output, and an antenna/cable connector face directly back. Three HDMI ports are common for budget televisions, though four are preferable. While the 49UH6100 uses WebOS like LG's higher-end TVs, you won't find a motion-sensing Magic Remote in the box. Instead, it comes with a much more conventional 6.7-inch black wand with flat rubber buttons. The remote control has all of the necessary controls for navigating WebOS on the TV, including a direction pad, a number pad, playback controls, and four color buttons. However, the direction pad consists of rectangular buttons that feel indistinguishable from the rest of the remote, making them difficult to find under your thumb without looking. The remote buttons are not backlit. WebOS Even without a Magic Remote and air mouse-like cursor control, the 49UH6100 offers plenty of smart features thanks to LG's WebOS. Many common streaming media apps are available, including Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV, and YouTube, along with support for live TV either over the air or with your cable or satellite box through the built-in TV guide. WebOS also supports screen mirroring with Miracast and Intel Wi-Di, though Miracast support has been phased out in most current Android devices in favor of Google Cast, which isn't available here. There's also a web browser on the TV, though using it with the physical buttons is much more awkward than on other LG TVs with the Magic Remote for smoother cursor control. Performance and HDR Just because a TV can accept a high dynamic range (HDR) signal doesn't necessarily mean it can do it justice, and like many budget televisions, that's the case with the 49UH6100. We test TVs using a DVDO AVLab 4K test pattern generator, a Klein K-10A colorimeter, and Portrait Displays' CalMAN 5 software on a Razer Blade Pro notebook. After a basic dark room calibration using the 49UH6100's ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 displayed a modest peak brightness of 172.13cd/m2 and a poor black level of 0.15cd/m2 for a 1,147:1 contrast ratio. This means that, even if the TV can process HDR10 content, you don't get a very good range of brights and darks. This is typical performance for budget-minded 4K TVs from major manufacturers—the similarly priced Sony XBR-49X800D shows similar contrast. Vizio's M-series is a bit more expensive, but its panel can get much brighter and darker for a far greater 40,670:1 contrast ratio. Color doesn't fare much better. The chart above shows Rec.709 ideal color values as squares and measured color values as dots. While the TV shows an impressive reach for greens, its reds fall slightly short, and cyan and magenta are very skewed. LG provides a full suite of calibration tools to fix these problems, but out of the box the colors simply aren't very good. Curiously, we've seen the best performance in this price range from lesser-known manufacturers, like LeEco's Super 4x series displays remarkably wide and accurate colors out of the box, and it boasts four times the contrast at 4,938:1. Viewing Experience Despite measured issues with picture quality, HDR content still looks fairly vivid and eye-catching on the 49UH6100. The TV's strong range of greens makes the "Jungle" episode of BBC's Planet Earth II on Ultra HD Blu-ray appear natural and colorful. However, darker parts of scenes, like the fur of lemurs, suffer from the TV's poor black levels—though the hairs can be clearly discerned under sunlight, their fine texture becomes a muddy blob of darkness in shady shots. And while the greens are exceptionally rich and detailed, blues and reds don't exhibit quite as much vibrancy. See How We Test TVs The Great Gatsby demonstrates the 49UH6100's weakness in dark scenes much more prominently. In the film's several dark settings, the characters' black suits disappear against the shadows of the backgrounds, showing very little texture or contour of the fabric. The white shirts and garden lights get satisfyingly bright to prevent the picture from looking too washed out, but anything very dark tends to simply vanish from a lack of deep black levels to provide more room for details in the shadows. Input Lag and Power Consumption Input lag is the amount of time between when a TV receives a signal and the display updates. In the ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 shows a poor 75.7ms input lag. However, the Game picture mode displays a far better 16.7ms input lag, at the expense of further skewing the TV's colors cool. This is good performance for any 4K TV. Under normal viewing conditions, the 49UH6100 consumes 76 watts in ISF Expert (Bright) and other modes that push the backlight to full. The ISF Expert (Dark) picture mode cuts that down to 67 watts, slightly under the TV's power-saving APS picture mode. This is a bit lower than the Sony XBR-49X800D, which uses 89 watts. Conclusions The LG 49UH6100 sounds like a fantastic TV on paper, but it makes some major trade-offs in picture quality to hit its low price. While it's packed full of features, including LG's WebOS connected interface and support for HDR content, its poor black levels significantly hold it back, and its wider color gamut seems to only extend to greens. If you want an HDR-capable 4K TV on a budget, the LeEco Super4 X series offers fantastic colors, while the Vizio M-series provides remarkable contrast for its price. If you want strong picture quality with both excellent contrast and a wide range of color, you should prepare to shell out significantly more on a high-end LED TV like LG's UH8500 series.

However, that is changing as vendors become more comfortable with the X370 chipset. ASRock's top of the line Z270 motherboards have featured the new 5Gbit NBase-T technology, and now their top X370 models do too.     ASRock's Fatal1ty X370 Professional Gaming uses an Aquantia 5Gbit NIC and provides other high-end features and hardware to match the quality people come to expect with high-end motherboards. It's one of the top five most expensive X370 motherboards and for a good reason.   Let's take a look at this premium X370 motherboard.     Specifications     The Fatal1ty X370 Professional Gaming features dual M.2 slots, 5Gbit LAN, a hefty VRM, SATA6Gb/s, USB 3.0, and even OC features.     Pricing   The Fatal1ty X370 Professional Gaming costs $249.99.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment The supply chain organization SCM World is founded on the principle that supply chain management can not only improve a company's profits but also help to support the greater good. For the past four years, the organization has been recognizing real-world supply chain initiatives that have accomplished this dual goal with its Power of the Profession Awards. Last week, SCM World, which describes itself as a "cross-industry supply chain community" and is owned by the analyst group Gartner, announced that it is now accepting entries for its 2018 awards through Aug. 11, 2017. The awards are open to all businesses worldwide that own, operate, or manage a supply chain. A panel of judges, which will include C-level executives from companies including Burberry, Dyson, Microsoft, Nike, Intel, and more, will be looking for ground-breaking programs in two categories: Talent Breakthrough and Supply Chain Breakthrough. Entrants for the Talent Breakthrough category will be asked to demonstrate supply chain initiatives that have an impact on three key areas; diversity and engagement, business results, and the overall value chain. Those companies competing in the Supply Chain Breakthrough category must have launched strategic initiatives that delivered value to customers and shareholders while also making a positive impact on critical world issues such as access to health care, distribution of food, and environmental sustainability. Last year's Power of the Profession Award winners include The Hershey Company, Bayer, The Clorox Company, Hilti, Mondel?z International, and General Mills. The 18 finalists will be revealed at SCM World's Live Europe Forum in Barcelona, Spain, on Oct. 30, 2017. The overall winners will then be announced at SCM World's Live Americas Forum on Feb. 5, 2018 in Miami. Fla.

Twitter Facebook Dell takes Intel's cue on PCs, puts enterprise on top of the agenda The company says it will launch a new PC-as-a-service by the end of the year Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 09 May, 2017 06:12 - - - - print email Comments For the umpteenth time, Dell Technologies has reiterated that PCs are important to the company, and it won't quit the market. But PCs occupied only a few minutes of CEO Michael Dell's opening keynote at Dell EMC World in Las Vegas on Monday. PCs are the engine that keep enterprises chugging, he said. Instead, Dell spent time educating attendees about the new Dell Technologies and its products. It's been less than a year since the US$67 billion Dell-EMC merger was finalized, and a lot of focus was on answering burning questions about the company's future. Dell did say the company would offer the PC-as-a-service worldwide by the end of the year, with more details about the program to be shared on Tuesday. HP and Microsoft are offering PC-as-a-service options, allowing customers to buy devices and support and pay on a monthly basis. That option reduces the hardware acquisition and support costs for companies. Michael Dell started Dell as a PC company in 1984 when he was 19 years old. But today, the PC market is limited, and Dell's approach is much like Intel's, which is focusing on enterprise IT infrastructure. Dell is now focused more on server, storage, cloud, networking, and internet-of-things offerings. The possibility of explosive growth in the PC market is remote, especially with mobile devices and tablets also being used for computing. Worldwide PC shipments will remain stuck in the 250 million to 300 million range, and most new purchases will replace existing PCs. The upgrade cycle is slowing down to about five or six years. Research firm Gartner predicts PC shipments to touch 266 million in 2017 and 272 million in 2018, compared to 268 million in 2016. Shipments in that limited market will be shared among Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, Apple, Acer, and other vendors. Dell's PC shipments grew by 6.2 percent in the first quarter of this year to 9.6 million units, according to IDC. Dell was the third largest PC maker behind HP and LenovoÂ and held a 15.9 percent market share. Worldwide PC shipments during the quarter totaled 60.3 million units. Dell has come out with some amazing hardware in recent years like the XPS 13 laptop and the UltraSharp 32 UP3218K 8K monitor. Dell's Alienware is one of the top gaming PC brands, and Dell said the unit will be left alone to chase fast-growing markets like virtual reality and "artificial reality." Further PC announcements from Dell are expected later this year, especially at the Computex trade show at the end of this month. Dell remains the only company standing with a full stack of hardware offerings, from PCs and servers all the way down to networking gear. HP does not offer enterprise hardware like servers or storage. Lenovo ships servers, but its storage and networking offerings are weak. Dell sees growth in the enterprise because data centers are taking on more workloads as computing moves to the cloud. Voice assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa, and Google Assistant are processed in the cloud and delivered to users on mobile devices and PCs. Social networks, email, and video streaming are also processed on servers. New technologies like image recognition and language translation also happen on the cloud. Dell talked about raising the digital IQ in organizations, and speeding up the digital transformation process. The company announced new PowerEdge servers and all-flash EMC storage products. The company's other products include VMware, which provides virtualization technologies to balance server, storage, and networking operations. The Pivotal software environment provides the tools to build cloud services. The company also introduced new networking and storage products for converged infrastructures. The company also talked about putting security technologies from RSA for threat assessment at different levels of data movement. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman BUYINS.NET: DRAM SqueezeTrigger Price is $2.65. There is $2,434,416 That Short Sellers Still Need To Cover. iCrowdNewswire – May 8, 2017 May 8, 2017 / M2 PRESSWIRE / BUYINS.NET / www.buyins.net is monitoring Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ:DRAM) in real time and just received an alert that DRAM is crossing above its primary SqueezeTrigger Price, the price that a short squeeze can start in any stock. There are 494800 shares that have been shorted at the volume weighted average SqueezeTrigger Price of $2.65. To access SqueezeTrigger Prices ahead of potential short squeezes beginning, visit http://www.buyins.net . From August 2009 to April 2017, an aggregate amount of 75202702 shares of DRAM have been shorted for a total dollar value of $150405404. The DRAM SqueezeTrigger price of $2.65 is the volume weighted average price that all shorts are short in shares of DRAM. There is still approximately $2,434,416 of potential short covering in shares of DRAM. Buyins.net has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger Price for each stock that has been shorted. The data has then been integrated into an automated trading platform which can be used to connect to a live online broker and automate your trading of short squeeze events. It is extremely powerful with lightening fast execution at a very low price. Both the trading software and SqueezeTrigger data feed are available at http://www.buyins.net . Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ:DRAM) – Dataram Corporation develops, manufactures, and markets memory products primarily used in enterprise servers and workstations worldwide. It provides customized memory solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEM); and compatible memory for various brands, including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Lenovo, and Oracle, as well as a line of memory products for Intel and AMD motherboard based servers.

Dataram Corporation was founded in 1967 and is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.. The SqueezeTrigger database of billions of short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like Buyins.net to access the data. Total Short Interest is the number of shares shorted but not yet covered, and is different from total short volume.

For the past 18 months, the Surface lineup has rested on its laurels with the Surface Pro 4 — a solid system based on Intel’s Skylake processors, but one that’s showing some age. In a recent interview with CNET, Panos Panay, Microsoft’s VP of Devices, declared there’s “no such thing” as Surface Pro 5, and seemed to dismiss the idea that Microsoft would be launching a new device with that branding in the near-term future. “When it’s meaningful and the change is right, we’ll put it on market,” Panay said. “Meaningful change isn’t necessarily a hardware change, which is what a lot of people look for… You’ll see that same meaningful impact when Pro 5, or Pro Next hits the market.” Panay than clarified that “there’s no such thing as a Pro 5.” This doesn’t jive with previous claims from reputable sources that Microsoft was working on a Pro 5, with Kaby Lake as a drop-in replacement for its Skylake processors. Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic. — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 The simplest explanation is that Microsoft will refresh the Surface Pro 4 with a new set of chips and leave the rest of the platform unchanged, with a Pro 5 coming later, at an as-yet-undetermined date. Panay is setting expectations that Microsoft wants to deliver a new type of device with Surface Pro 5, something that takes more than incremental steps forward. There are potential options for building that kind of device. Microsoft could, for example, be holding off for 10nm CPUs, OLED panels, or other power-saving features baked into a later version of Windows 10. Elsewhere in the interview, Panay states that what he’s looking for is the option to make major changes to the device itself, whether in thickness or battery life, thereby giving people a reason to upgrade that goes beyond just modestly bumping processor performance. The one problem with Panay’s claims about Surface, however, is that he argues you can buy a Surface Pro 4 and have a product that’s competitive for five more years. This is almost certainly bollocks. Lithium-ion batteries always lose significant capacity by then, and there’s no way to solve that issue on Surface, since Microsoft always opts for a sealed-in battery. Panay’s comments on these topics can’t be trusted — he’s the same person who told concerned Surface Pro 3 owners that MS would replace batteries for $200, only to see the company turn around and deny that it had any legal obligation to do so. Microsoft may have been legally in the right, but what it did amounted to a bait-and-switch. Redmond did eventually reverse this policy, after significant public outcry, but it still doesn’t offer a battery replacement service. While Apple also uses sealed-in batteries, it will replace your battery out-of-warranty for between $129 and $199, depending on the product. Panay’s comments about Surface Pro 4 being competitive in five years also stretch the boundary of what ‘competitive’ means. Keeping in mind that the base hardware in a Surface Pro 4 will be 6.5 years old by then, no, I wouldn’t expect it to be particularly competitive, anymore than a laptop built in mid-2010 is still competitive with modern systems. Resolutions, battery life, platform power consumption, and low-power clock speeds may increase more slowly than they used to, but they do increase. But Panay’s remarks have been, in our opinion, somewhat misinterpreted. He’s not claiming that MS is cancelling Surface, just that the company doesn’t have any plans to launch a new Pro 5 SKU in the near future.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dell EMC Introduces New All-Flash Storage Systems to Help Customers Modernize Their Data Centers and Transform IT Dell EMC is announcing major updates across its market-leading storage portfolio designed to provide IT departments with the technology they need to modernize their data center and begin their journey to transform IT. As the business drives new digital initiatives, IT must transform to accommodate massive growth in structured and unstructured data, maintain the performance and reliability of key business applications, deploy a new breed of cloud-native applications and support increasingly complex workflows. To satisfy these diverse demands Dell EMC provides a diverse, best-of-breed portfolio – there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all. Dell EMC announces major platform refreshes to its flagship enterprise storage platform, VMAX, as well as the next generation XtremIO purpose-built All-Flash array. Dell EMC also announces the next generation of Dell EMC Unity, its best-in-class midrange All-Flash array and the new SC5020 best-in-class midrange hybrid array, as well as Isilon scale-out NAS arrays. “With these new offerings in high-end, midrange and unstructured data storage, Dell EMC is bringing best-in-class performance, value and economics to customers’ IT organizations,” said Jeff Boudreau, president, Storage, Dell EMC. “The speeds and feeds are impressive, but more importantly, customers of every size, every budget and every stage of IT Transformation can harness the power of enterprise-class storage to move their business forward.” Introducing the All-New VMAX 950F All Flash Array VMAX 950F is the newest member of Dell EMC’s VMAX All Flash family, the flagship high-end storage offering that has set the industry benchmark for enterprise storage arrays for decades. With performance that is 68% faster and offering 30% better response times (6.7M IOPS for RRH, 350 microseconds response times for OLTP) than the previous generation, VMAX 950F resets the bar for All-Flash storage performance. In fact, the VMAX 950F is up to 4x faster than its nearest competitor in testing of real-world workloads. The VMAX 950F array leverages the latest Intel CPUs with software enhancements designed to deliver best-in-class performance at scale. It also allows customers to consolidate with confidence – including open systems, mainframe, IBM i as well as file workloads – on a single platform with a 25% smaller footprint for the same performance as the previous generation. The new VMAX 950F All Flash array offers all the industry-leading data services of the rest of the VMAX All Flash family – including SRDF (Symmetrix Remote Data Facility), D@RE (Data At-Rest Encryption), non disruptive migration, inline compression and more. This powerful combination of performance, data services and more than “six nines” availability make the VMAX 950F the ideal platform for consolidating mission-critical applications that demand the performance of flash and can never, ever go down – such as core banking, credit card processing, electronic billing or hospital record systems.

The outgoing president issued the warning when the two men met in the White House two days after Trump’s election victory, White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed on Monday. Michael Flynn's Russia payment likely broke disclosure laws, lawmakers say Read more Spicer acknowledged that Obama had expressed misgivings about Flynn, a former general, but said they were general criticisms. “It’s true that President Obama made it known that he wasn’t exactly a fan of Gen Flynn’s,” Spicer said, but added that such remarks were unsurprising as Flynn had been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration’s policies. He said Flynn’s security clearance had been renewed in April 2016, and the Obama White House had not stepped in to revoke it. Flynn was appointed head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2012 but was fired two years later, reportedly over dissatisfaction over his management style and temperament. Reports on Monday attributed to Obama officials differed on whether the concerns voiced by Obama were linked to his DIA performance or because of his Russia links. Flynn had received income from RT in 2015, a state-run television channel formerly known as Russia Today, which he did not initially declare. Despite Obama’s warnings, Trump picked Flynn as his national security adviser, but the retired general was forced to resign after little more than three weeks after it emerged he had had extensive contacts with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, and had not given a full account of them to other White House officials. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump wants Flynn to testify in Russia inquiry, White House says Federal records also showed that his company, the Flynn Intel Group, had been paid more than a half-million dollars to lobby on behalf of projects that benefited the Turkish government in 2016. The news reports that Obama had alerted Trump over concerns about Flynn came hours before the former acting attorney general Sally Yates was due to testify to a Senate committee on her own warnings to the White House days after Trump took office that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position by his failure to make a full disclosure of his Kislyak contacts. Yates was fired a few days after her White House warning, at the end of January, for refusing to defend the travel ban, suspending entry for refugees and travelers from seven Muslim countries, in court. Michael Flynn: new evidence spy chiefs had concerns about Russian ties Read more Yates’ testimony is expected to contradict the White House, which has sought to play down the detail and severity of her warnings about Flynn, at a time when the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russian government in general are under scrutiny by the FBI and Congress. But in her written testimony, Yates told the committee she was limited in what she could say in open hearing. “I want to note that I intend my answers today to be as fulsome and comprehensive as possible while respecting my legal and ethical boundaries,” she said. “As the subcommittee understands, many of the topics of interest today concern classified information that I cannot address in this public setting, either directly or indirectly. My duty to protect classified information applies just as much to me as a former official as it did when I led the department.” On the day of her testimony, Trump tweeted: “Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to [White House] counsel.” The tweet referred to a conversation Yates had with the White House legal adviser, Donald McGahn, about Flynn’s position, and appeared to hint that she would know who had leaked the content of the discussion. Asked about the meaning of the message, Spicer said: “The tweet speaks for itself.” Trump also blamed the Obama administration for giving Flynn a security clearance. “General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,” the president tweeted on Monday. Spicer echoed this attack at his briefing, asking: “If President Obama was truly concerned about Flynn, why didn’t he pull his security clearance?” CNN reported that the concerns Obama raised about Flynn when he met Trump at the White House were connected to the Russia investigation. “Flynn’s name kept popping up,” one senior Obama administration source is quoted as saying. However, NBC quoted a former official as saying that Obama had only passed on “a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high-level post”. Retired military officers can retain their security clearance subject to periodic background checks, which cover foreign payments and contacts. Failure to make full disclosure of such contacts in an application for renewal of clearance is punishable by a fine or five years imprisonment. Obama administration officials say that such security clearance renewals after retirement are routine, and that vetting for a top White House post such as national security adviser would require a much higher threshold. They said such vetting was the responsibility of any incoming administration.

Twitter Facebook Dell strengthens data center stack with shiny new assets Dell's 14th Generation PowerEdge servers should work better with EMC storage Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 09 May, 2017 03:00 - - - - print email Comments Just a few years back, Dell said it didn't want to mimic sloppy behemoths like IBM or HP and, instead, wanted to be lean and focus on the mid-market. But after a US$67 billion merger with EMC in 2016, the new company called Dell Technologies is a full-bodied systems integrator, offering hardware, networking, storage, and services. In the meanwhile, the company's rivals slimmed down. The new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise focuses on data-center hardware, while IBM focuses on software. Dell Technologies is taking a page from Alphabet, a bunch of autonomous companies like Google working together. Dell Technologies includes hardware company Dell and storage provider EMC, with many independent operational units that have combined to strengthen the company's infrastructure stack. The data center offerings feature Dell's PowerEdge servers. At next week's Dell EMC World, the company is introducing the new PowerEdge 14 G -- a moniker for 14th generation -- servers, which have been redesigned to integrate offerings from units that are now part of the Dell behemoth. The servers have been tuned to fit into hyperconverged environments and to be easily deployed in cloud, on-, and off-premise server installations. The servers are designed to work in tandem with EMC storage, VMware virtualization software, and Pivotal open-source tools to create middleware that sits on top of cloud environments. Dell didn't share full specifications or prices for the new family of servers. PowerEdge servers will likely be based on Intel's Skylake chips, which are bringing new interconnects, processors, and networking fabrics to data centers. The servers will make data centers more scalable and connect to all-flash EMC storage arrays much faster. Dell did not say if the servers would support AMD's upcoming 32-core chip called Naples, which is based on the Zen architecture. Conventional servers pack memory, storage, and networking into one box, but the new PowerEdge servers will be flexible enough to decouple those into pooled units. An important component will be NVDIMM, which is DRAM merged with SSD-style storage components on it to retain data. NVDIMM is much faster than SSDs for caching because it runs on the DRAM bus, which is much faster than the conventional storage bus. Faster interconnects will reduce latency between server and storage arrays. It's a matter of time before 25-gigabit ethernet becomes pervasive, and there will be the adoption of new protocols to boost communications inside data centers, said Brian Payne, vice president of product management at Dell. EMC's ScaleIO technology has been adapted to work with PowerEdge 14G and will bring faster storage access to the servers, Payne said. Dell is claiming a significant reduction in latency -- up to 19 times faster -- which should boost storage performance. Dell doesn't boast a strong middleware portfolio yet but has the tools to build applications and cloud services within computing infrastructure. Virtustream is an important management software for cloud services on PowerEdge, while the Pivotal open-source tools provide a framework to write applications. Dell unit RSA provides security tools, while VMWare provides virtualization to make scale-out, hyperconverged, or modular data centers highly efficient. Payne recognized that new applications like machine learning -- which requires GPUs or deep-learning chips -- are changing data center constructs. Dell's PowerEdge servers are ready for those new types of applications and hardware. "We are a one-stop shop that can do all those things," Payne said. There are also improvements in PowerEdge servers. The systems have been redesigned for better cooling, and an NVMe boot component will boot systems faster. A feature called iDRAC 9 will be able to automatically detect errors, and Dell will send replacement parts quickly. That helps keep the system up and running while reducing the workload of system administrators. Every server generation provides an important bump in performance and carries the benefits of new silicon and interconnects, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. Dell has signed up for the high-performance Gen-Z interconnect, but it's not certain if it will be a part of the PowerEdge 14 server. Dell is still in transition, with the operations for Dell and EMC are being run out of separate headquarters. The level of integration between servers and storage that will come with PowerEdge 14 remains a question, King said. But EMC also works with other customers, and Dell likes to supply servers to customers who don't want advanced storage or networking features. The two-socket server market still represents a large volume of the larger server market. Also, Dell has strong partnerships with Oracle, Microsoft, and Red Hat and will want to maintain those partnerships, King said. Dell did not provide availability information for the servers. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Mr. Muchnick joined SimpleReach’s Board of Directors in June 2016. “I’m excited to be leading SimpleReach alongside Edward Kim as we help define the future of content marketing,” said Mr. Muchnick. “I’ve spent my career in this industry and we are clearly in a time of significant disruption. The nature of marketing and advertising is evolving and content is at the forefront of this sea change. The universal problem of any marketer will be having access to the content data and insights necessary to make sense of it all. I joined SimpleReach because there is no company better positioned to address this tremendous need and opportunity.” „Hal has done an incredible job as President over the last seven months helping prepare for our future,” said Edward Kim. “Having him take on the role of CEO is a testament to what he’s done and what I believe he will continue to do.

Specs 17 Pictures Pros Faster than rivals in games tests Discreet design Plenty of customisation options Cons Slow, single-channel memory Poor screen and poorer speakers Disappointing keyboard Key Features 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB graphics 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS screen 16GB 2133MHz DDR4 memory 256GB Samsung SM961 SSD 1TB hard disk Windows 10 64-bit 3yr labour warranty Manufacturer: PC Specialist Review Price: £999.00 What is the PC Specialist Optimus VIII? British companies such as PC Specialist are trying to put a dent in the domination of companies such as Acer and Dell, and the 15.6-inch Optimus VIII has a great chance of stealing some market share: it costs just £999 but packs both Nvidia's and Intel's latest and greatest. But a lack of polish, particularly in terms of design, means it doesn't quite steal a march on the competition. PC Specialist Optimus VIII – Features This machine packs Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, which is one of the Pascal range’s more modest graphics cards. It’s designed for 1080p gaming – handy, given its screen resolution – and is particularly adept at AAA games at Medium settings and all the eSports you can throw at it. It’s the same GPU featured in the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming, a system that costs £100 more than the Optimus. It’s also a step above the standard GTX 1050 inside the Acer Aspire VX 15, which is £100 cheaper than the Optimus. PC Specialist’s machine falls between its two rivals at the checkout, but the rest of its specification is impressively ambitious. The Core i7-7700HQ is a quad-core processor, and it’s the same chip as the Dell. The Samsung SSD is an NVMe drive that should outpace the plainer SATA drives inside both rivals, and there’s a large 1TB hard disk as well. Connectivity is solid, if uninspiring: dual-band 802.11ac wireless sits alongside Gigabit Ethernet and Bluetooth 4.0. The only misstep is the memory. Although there’s 16GB inside this machine, it’s of the single-channel variety, rather than dual-channel DDR4 – and tests show that single-channel systems are slower. In addition, it only runs at 2133MHz, which is pretty sluggish. Thankfully, PC Specialist offers a wealth of customisation options. It’s easy enough to switch out the memory and bump up the storage, and it’s possible to upgrade to a 4K screen or downgrade the processor – handy, if your budget or priorities differ to this spec. Neither rival offers this level of customisation, although Dell offers a cheaper Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming with a GTX 1050. PC Specialist's warranty is more generous than rivals, too. The Optimus is protected by a three-year labour deal with a year of parts coverage – whereas the Dell and Acer offer only one year of coverage. Related: Best PC Games PC Specialist Optimus VIII – Design PC Specialist doesn’t design its own laptops. Instead, this machine’s exterior comes from Taiwanese designer Clevo. Chassis from Clevo and MSI is normally the favoured route for UK-based firms that don’t have the scale to build their own machines from the ground up. There are downsides to this approach. The Optimus is plain, with no lighting beyond the keyboard and no exciting design elements – the Dell has red logos, soft-touch material and smart red air vents, while the Acer has its own gaudy vents and red accents too. On the plus side, the lack of any accents will appeal to those after a more subtle design. The Optimus is no larger or chunkier than its rivals – its 2.5kg weight undercuts the Dell, and its 27mm body falls between the competition. Build quality is middling. The wrist-rest and screen flex a little, and there’s more movement in the base panel. The hinge feels strong, but it can’t be pushed upwards without tipping the laptop, and there are visible seams everywhere. Its rivals don’t only look better – they’re better-built, too. Pleasingly, PC Specialist has no problem with customers cracking open the Optimus to swap and add components. There’s a spare memory slot and an empty 42mm M.2 connector that works with SATA-based storage, and the battery is removable. The storage is accessible, and the cooling gear is basic but easy to clean.

There’s USB 3.1 Type-C, too.

Gammell, who will assume full management responsibilities from Monday (May 8), is the group’s current Chief People and Performance Officer. He has been a member of the business’ executive leadership since joining in 2009. In a statement, Etihad also said it has appointed Ricky Thirion as interim group chief financial officer, replacing James Rigney who will also leave the company on July 1, 2017. Thirion is the current senior vice president, group treasurer. Mohammad Al Mazroui, chairman of the board of Etihad Aviation Group, said in the statement the company is currently in “advanced stages of recruitment” for a new group CEO. He said an announcement will be made in the next few weeks. “Ray will now take full management responsibility for the Etihad Aviation Group, ensure a coordinated group approach, and continue to advance the strategic review that was initiated by the board in 2016 to reposition the business for continued development in what we anticipate being a prolonged period for challenges for global aviation,” Al Mazroui said. Gammell has over 20 years of leadership experience across the technology, financial, and government sectors. He has held executive positions for Intel Corporation in the US and Ireland, Royal Bank of Scotland, and was an officer in the Irish Armed Forces. He has been a chief officer at Etihad Airways for over eight years. Thirion, meanwhile, has overseen the group treasury of Etihad since 2007. His areas of responsibility cover the treasury, finance, tax, insurance, payment solutions, and fraud management, among others. Before joining Etihad, he held roles as group treasurer at South African Airways, and managing director at Standard Bank Group. The two new appointments follow Etihad’s announcement in late January about its CEO and CFO both stepping down in the second half of 2017. The move came as the Abu Dhabi-based airline continued to record losses from its investments in Air Berlin and Alitalia. Last week, Etihad’s Hogan said it was clear Alitalia requires “fundamental and far-reaching restructuring to survive and grow in the future.” He added, “Without the support of all stakeholders for that restructuring, we are not prepared to continue to invest. We therefore support the necessary decision of the Alitalia board to apply for extraordinary administration.”  Etihad pledged to cover Alitalia’s part of EA Partners bonds — sources Etihad Airways agreed at the end of last year to repay a portion of two bonds maturing in 2020 and 2021 on behalf of Alitalia if the Italian airline ends up defaulting, two sources familiar with the situation said yesterday. Etihad and a number of airlines in which it has equity stakes issued the bonds worth a combined $1.2 billion (Dh4.41 billion) in 2015 and 2016 via a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as EA Partners. Alitalia’s exposure to EA Partners corresponds to roughly 19 per cent of the $700 million 2020 bond and about 20 per cent of the 2021 bond, or about $235 million of the overall principal. The sources were confirming an agreement first reported by ratings agency Fitch on May 3, the day after Alitalia asked the Italian government to put it under administration. The airline had debts of about 3 billion euros (Dh12.12 billion; $3.3 billion) at the end of February.

World Environment Day 2016 Civic Reception of Neiphiu Rio Loading...You are here:  Home  >  Digi-buzz  >  Current Article Microsoft Surface Laptop By EMN  /  May 8, 2017  /  Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Laptop     Print       Email By Liyo Kikon Gone are the days when we used to look at Microsoft products and think “boring!”. These days, all the products which are produced by Microsoft seems to focus a lot on design and the latest product by Microsoft, the Surface Laptop is no different. The Surface Laptop is a beautiful device and measuring at only 14.48 mm thickness, it is extremely slim, not to mention that it weights just 1.252 kg, it is remarkably light for such a powerful device. The Surface Laptop comes with a 13.5 inch display, powered by PixelSense technology which gives out stunning visuals and since it is coated with Corning Gorilla Glass 3, it won’t get scratches easily. The display has an aspect ratio of 3:2 and this is a bit of an issue since most laptops are set at 16:9 so the Surface Laptop may seem a bit more squared than your average laptop. It also supports 10 point multi touch along with the Microsoft Surface Pen and drawing on this device will be a bit awkward sine it doesn’t fold into a tablet form, but the display does support a resolution of 2256×1504 and is powered by the latest intel Core i5 or i7, depending on the model, along with a memory of either 4, 8 or 16GB. Unlike the Surface Pro series which has received tremendous praise from fans, the Surface Laptop is getting mixed reviews so far, since it is primarily a Laptop without a detachable screen like the Surface Book, but no one can deny just how beautiful this device is. The big issue which everyone has is its lack of ports, you will only get one USB 3.0, a Headset jack, a Mini Display port and the Surface Connect for charging the device. I mean there is no USB-C and this really is a bummer for everyone who is interested in purchasing this device and has plans to use it for the next few years since in the coming years, USB-C will become standard for all devices. Another issue which everyone seems to have is the fact that the Surface Laptop will come with the new Windows 10S. And I can guarantee that anyone who buys the Surface Laptop will install the standard Windows 10Pro since Windows 10S is basically a re-boot of the old Windows RT which failed miserably. Incase you are wondering, the big difference between the 10S and the 10Pro is that in Windows 10S, you will not be able to run any executable files, meaning you will not be able to install Photoshop or run your favourite games, it will only support apps which are available on the Windows Store. The main idea behind this is to streamline the applications in your computer so that it runs faster and will be free from virus and bugs along with longer battery life and overall stable computing. But everyone who has used the Windows Store will agree that most of the “good” apps aren’t there to begin with. One thing to keep in mind is that anyone who buys this laptop and wishes to upgrade to Windows 10Pro will have to do it before December 31, 2017 if they want to upgrade it for free, or else they will have to pay extra to purchase the pro version. Aside from the drawbacks of the Surface Laptop, one cool thing about this laptop would be the fact that the keyboard area is covered with Microsoft’s Signature Alcantara material. It is a type of synthetic fabric which was originally used in the Surface Pro type cover and it feels very luxurious and extremely comfortable, moreover, it is resistant to spills, stains and absorption so you can clean it easily. The laptop can be easily opened with one hand and this is no surprise since Microsoft is known to provide great hinges in all their devices. The speakers on the Surface Laptop are hidden away under the keyboard and you won’t find any “holes” anywhere on the device for sound output. The Laptop comes in four beautiful colours – Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue and Graphite Gold. All these colours look beautiful and elegant, even the Burgundy and Cobalt Blue will not look out of place in a professional setting. The best bit is that Microsoft promises the battery to last around 14 hours! That is truly amazing in such a slim and powerful device. During the release event, Microsoft kept on pointing out that this laptop was designed for students and educators, but even the base model costs around Rs. 64,000 and goes all the way to around Rs 1,40,000. That costs a bit too much for the device since you can easily get a much powerful laptop at the same price range. But if you don’t intend to do any heavy work on the laptop and you want the most beautiful laptop money can buy, then there is none better than the Surface Laptop.     Print       Email Published: 15 hours ago on May 8, 2017 By: EMN Last Modified: May 8, 2017 @ 9:25 pm Filed Under: Digi-buzz NEXT ARTICLE → Learn Nagamese About the author EMN View all articles by EMN » LATEST NEWS State observes World Red Cross Day DC inaugurates SM Colony in Dimapur New music school in Diphupar ‘B’ Students seminar held at DPS Molungkimong gets new GHS building APPOINTMENTS News in Brief NBSE declares HSLC and HSSLC results SEARCH Custom Search Sign up for our newsletter!

Peter Bright - May 8, 2017 3:46 pm UTC Enlarge / The Surface Pro 4 with its kickstand out. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 86 Share this story "There's no such thing as a [Surface] Pro 5," Panos Panay, corporate vice president for Surface at Microsoft, told CNET last week. Microsoft won't update the Surface Pro 4 until it can make a change that's "meaningful," said Panay. The company is looking for "an experiential change that makes a huge difference in product line." This statement comes in spite of Surface sales tanking hard in the first quarter of this calendar year, with the hardware's staleness a growing problem. Microsoft hasn't updated Surface Pro 4 for 18 months now; the systems still use Intel's Skylake processors rather than the latest Kaby Lake chips. A switch to Kaby Lake wouldn't be huge, though it would help battery life across the board, give the bottom-priced Pro 4 a decent performance boost, and provide support for hardware-accelerated 4K video. But it would also go a long way toward showing that Microsoft still regards the system as a going concern. Panay's words (probably) don't mean that there is literally no Pro 5; as with most public statements of this kind, what he means is "there is no Pro 5 that we're willing to talk about or acknowledge at this time." Right now, the company wants the focus to be exclusively on its new Surface Laptop, and talking about Surface Pro 5 would both distract from this and risk further reducing Pro 4 sales. But the statement does look peculiar in the light of anticipation surrounding a mysterious new event that Microsoft is holding in Shanghai later this month. On May 23rd, the company says that it will "Show the world what's next" at the China event. We have been told to "Save the date" but have not thus far been invited, with space apparently being "limited." Panay has tweeted that he's going to be at the Shanghai event, and his tweet is hashtagged "Surface." The current belief is that Microsoft will be going to China to launch the Surface Pro 5—but those rumors also indicate that the Pro 5 update will be anything but meaningful: it will be a system virtually identical to Pro 4 but with a Kaby Lake processor. Enlarge / Microsoft sent out this shot of the Shanghai skyline when announcing its next event. The picture doesn't really give a whole lot away, but signs point to a hardware focus. Microsoft This would be an upgrade that the Pro 4 needs, but the timing is strange—a minor update like this could have been made six months ago, and if it had been, sales wouldn't have fallen off so sharply. A potential upgrade is also hard to reconcile with Panay's claims about meaningful updates. In his CNET interview, he explicitly said that a mere processor change is not what he means when it comes to being meaningful. Then again, the company has made relatively incremental updates before; Surface Pro 3 to Pro 4 bumped the processors (from Haswell to Skylake), made the screen slightly larger and bumped the resolution, and added Windows Hello facial recognition. These were all welcome changes, but calling them "experiential" is a stretch. Rather, the Pro 4 offered a honed, refined version of the Pro 3 experience. If the Pro 5 shows a similar iterative improvement, it won't be the experiential change that Panay says he wants, but it will be a solid and desirable update all the same. One other way of squaring the circle does come to mind: Surface Pro 4 will be updated to use Kaby Lake, but it won't be called Surface Pro 5. Surface Pro 4 R2, anyone?

At the AUVSI XPONENTIAL 2017 Unmanned Systems show running from May 8-11 in Dallas, attendees can visit Booth #306 and view an integrated demonstration between partner companies LCR Embedded Systems and ADLINK Technologies. The demos will showcase lightweight, rugged UAV systems preprocessing live video data, while communicating with ground or vehicle based systems, for data distribution to any number of decision makers in real time, enabling split-second decision making in evolving situations that require unmanned systems support. The demonstration will consist of two connected SWaP/C-friendly rugged systems suitable for deployment on UAV/UGV, one from ADLINK and one from LCR Embedded Systems. A drone-mountable camera will be connected to the ADLINK HPERC™ system utilizing PrismTech’s Vortex DDS, enabling the camera to capture, track, and transmit several targets simultaneously. This information will then be transmitted in real time to LCR Embedded Systems’ recently announced Featherweight VPX System, powered by Intel® Xeon® D processor, illustrating communication to a receiving system where it can be further processed and distributed. “One of the most important things to keep in mind about any unmanned vehicle system is that the system doesn’t stop at the vehicle,” said LCR Embedded Systems President David Pearson. “The vehicle is only the most peripheral part of a much larger distributed system that might be composed of other air, land, and marine vehicles, portable and fixed ground stations, and more. LCR Embedded Systems is thrilled to exhibit at XPONENTIAL 2017 with valued partner ADLINK Technologies to show how, together, we can offer complete solutions that slot in at any point within unmanned vehicle systems, no matter how extensive they may be.” “Unmanned systems provide a quantum leap in the way battlefield information is gathered. As these systems accelerate and evolve, sensor and data processing requirements challenge the performance envelope of small form factor, ruggedized, high performance computing solutions,” said Elizabeth Campbell, General Manager at ADLINK Americas. “We are excited to showcase LCR Embedded’s chassis designs and system platforms based on ADLINK’s rugged small form factor boards, computer-on-modules, and slot card architectures such as AdvancedTCA®, CompactPCI®, and VPX boards.” About ADLINK • www.adlinktech.com ADLINK Technology is leading edge computing with solutions that drive data-to-decision applications across industries.

By Ian Paul Contributor, PCWorld | May 8, 2017 7:24 AM PT More like this Microsoft teases a Surface event to 'show the world what's next.' Is it mixed... Hands-on with Acer's Swift 5, a liquid-cooled Surface rival that runs silent The best laptops of 2017: Ultrabooks, budget PCs, 2-in-1s, and more Video Windows Defender: What changes in Windows 10 Creators Update The latest rumors about the so-called Surface Pro 5 appear to be just that, based on recent statements from Microsoft’s hardware chief. Despite the Surface Pro 4 launching well over 18 months ago, if Microsoft’s working on a new tablet as expected, it seems likely to be a simple refresh of the current model. Mentioned in this article Microsoft Surface Pro 4  PCWorld rating $709.99MSRP $1,300.00View on Amazon The combination of an Intel Skylake chip, a new Type Cover keyboard and faster SSD speed help push the Surface Pro 4 into a higher echelon of performance. Speaking with CNET, Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay said the company doesn’t plan to produce the expected Surface Pro 5 until there’s a way to make “meaningful change” in the product. Panay warns that doesn’t necessarily mean Microsoft’s waiting for some amazing new processor—which Intel’s current Kaby Lake is not, compared to the Skylake chip already in the Surface Pro 4. Meaningful change could also come from a significant boost in battery life or a lighter device, according to Panay. “I’m looking for an experiential change that makes a huge difference in product line,” Panay said. But for now “there’s no such thing as a [Surface] Pro 5,” he says. The story behind the story: Microsoft’s upcoming event scheduling makes more sense in light of Panay’s statements. A Surface Pro refresh is widely expected, but there’s no major event scheduled in New York, the site of the Surface Pro 2, 3 and 4 reveals. The original Surface Pro debuted in 2012 in Los Angeles, but there’s nothing on the books there either.  Instead, Microsoft has a smaller Surface event planned “to show the world what’s next” in Shanghai, China on May 23. This event is a bit of a mystery, but if a Surface Pro 5 isn’t coming, then it appears Microsoft could reveal a second-generation Surface Pro 4 updated with a Kaby Lake processor. Perhaps a price drop is also in order. Microsoft wouldn’t create an event just to show off a minor Surface Pro upgrade, though, so there’s probably something bigger planned as well—maybe more mixed reality hardware?  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Artificial Intelligence Advancements Playing a Big Role For Identifying Sports Media and Social Media Consumer Behavior Palm Beach, FL – May 8, 2017 (Investorideas.com Newswire) MarketNewsUpdates.com News Commentary – More and more companies are implementing certain levels of artificial intelligence with the purpose of tracking a wide range of data keeping track of consumer behavior across many industries. For instance, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is committed to advancing the field of machine intelligence and creating new technologies to give people better ways to communicate. Other Companies in the artificial intelligence space include: Breaking Data Corp. (TSX-V: BKD.V) (OTC:BKDCD), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Breaking Data Corp. (TSX-V: BKD)(OTC:BKDCD) recently announced that its recent acquisition GIVEMESPORT has seen its Facebook video plays go from 239 million in its first quarter working with Facebook video, (2016 – Apr/May/Jun) rising to over 734 million Facebook video plays last quarter, (2017 – Jan/Feb/Mar) with no material increase in associated costs. GiveMeSport, Breaking Data’s recent acquisition, is a leading next generation sports media company with the largest single publisher Facebook page in the world, with over 25.9 million fans. The next largest single sports publisher Facebook page is ESPN with 15.2 fans. GiveMeSport’s content generates over 3.6 billion impressions (Feb-17), reaching over 138 million unique users (Feb-17) per month on Facebook alone. Read this and more news for Breaking News Data Corp at: http://www.marketnewsupdates.com/news/bkd.html Nick Thain CEO of Breaking Data said „Facebook Video is a core part of our social media strategy, not only with video in the newsfeed by also Facebook Live, as Facebook continue to test and roll out the midroll video we are excited to work with them and see the results it brings to our revenue lines on a global scale.” „The growth in our Facebook video plays is one that we see continuing to grow quarter by quarter as we refine our approach and look to increase the quantity and quality of our video content output” added Mr. Thain. Breaking Data Corp. also announced recently that is has finalized its new independent Director appointees with key industry veteran leadership and experience for providing strong industry background and experience set to support the Company’s corporate strategy. Most notably – Greg D’Alba: Mr. D’Alba who is currently the Co- founder & CEO of VIDL NEWS LLC, a start-up artificial intelligence news venture focused on real-time personalized news intelligence and reporting. Previously Mr. D’Alba was the President and Chief Operating Officer of CNN, overseeing all ad sales, marketing, and business operations for the CNN portfolio of networks worldwide. In other artificial intelligence coverage: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) might traditionally be considered a hybrid between a retail and tech stock, but in time, „AI company” may be the most honest descriptor. Amazon’s Echo home speaker comes equipped with Alexa, an AI-powered virtual assistant that can recognize and answer questions, read news stories, read audiobooks, report the weather forecast, play music from Amazon Prime Music, Spotify, and Pandora (P), and of course order a lot of Amazon products. In many ways, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most pure-play artificial intelligence company on this list. The chipmaker decided early in the game to invest heavily in advancing the AI field by building chips tailor-made for deep learning. One of its prominent AI-centric chips, the Tesla P100 GPU, cost $2 billion to develop and can work 12 times faster than Nvidia’s previous top-of-the-line model. That’s a major investment for a company with $6.9 billion in revenue over the last year, but if it continues building out its lead and forces larger rivals like Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) to play catch-up, it may reap huge rewards for shareholders. In other Sports Media happenings: When Walt Disney’s (NYSE:DIS) sports media juggernaut – ESPN pink-slipped 100 anchors, writers and analysts recently, it made available some of the medium’s most durable names: „SportsCenter” stalwarts, veteran baseball and hockey beat writers and masters of long-form sports storytelling. ESPN has positioned the move as one made to focus on personnel who fit a lineup devoted to personality-driven „SportsCenter” broadcasts and digital-video projects built around them.

Announcing the selection May 8, Etihad said Gammell will assume “full management responsibilities” with immediate effect. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier said Hogan’s permanent successor will be announced “in the next few weeks.” Gammell joined Etihad in 2009 and has led the airline’s people strategy. Before this he accrued more than 20 years’ leadership experience, spanning roles with technology firm Intel Corporation in the US and Ireland and in the finance sector with Royal Bank of Scotland. He also spent time as an officer in the Irish armed forces.  Etihad also announced that SVP-group treasurer Ricky Thirion will become group CFO, replacing James Rigney, who will also leave the company July 1. Thirion has overseen Etihad Group’s treasury since he joined the company in 2007, following roles as South African Airways (SAA) group treasurer and managing director in the Standard Bank Group. “Ray and Ricky are experienced leaders and have the complete confidence of the Board. Ray will now take full management responsibility for the Etihad Aviation Group, ensure a coordinated group approach, and continue to advance the strategic review that was initiated by the board in 2016 to reposition the business for continued development in what we anticipate being a prolonged period of challenges for global aviation,” Etihad Aviation Group chairman Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Al Mazrouei said. “We have strengthened our group leadership with recent appointments and are now in the advanced stages of recruitment for a new group CEO. The board has been very pleased with the caliber of candidates, and we expect to make an announcement in the next few weeks.” Hogan has served as Etihad Airways president and CEO since September 2006 and was appointed as group CEO in 2016. Hogan’s name is synonymous with Etihad; under his leadership he has expanded Etihad from a single airline to a group of allied service organizations and airlines in which Etihad has equity stakes. Etihad Aviation Group comprises five business divisions: Abu Dhabi flag carrier Etihad Airways, Etihad Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners. The group has minority investments in seven airlines: airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia, and Swiss-based Darwin Airline, trading as Etihad Regional. Inset: chief people & performance officer Ray Gammell named Etihad Aviation Group CEO from July 1.

Image Credit: SiFive SiFive is pioneering a new model in the semiconductor business and to do so has raised $8.5 million in a second round of funding, led by Spark Capital. San Francisco-based SiFive is on a mission to democratize access to custom silicon chip designs. The company’s founders invented RISC-V, a free and open instruction set architecture for modern microprocessors. It consists of all of the software instructions needed to program a microprocessor based on the RISC-V architecture. And SiFive is taking that architecture and making it easy to design the custom variants that companies need. So far, the RISC-V foundation has 60 member companies, including Google, HP Enterprise, Microsoft, IBM, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Samsung, Microsemi, and others. SiFive has developed its Coreplex IP (intellectual property) that others can license as they design their own processors and computing systems based on RISC-V. Osage University Partners and existing investor Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the funding round. The new funds bring the total investment in SiFive to $13.5 million. SiFive founders Krste Asanovic, Yunsup Lee, and Andrew Waterman created RISC-V as a new instruction set architecture (ISA), just as Intel and ARM have their own ISA. But rather than having just one company own the ISA, the RISC-V creators made their ISA open and free to use. They monetize it through customization and support, much like Linux companies do with their open source operating systems. Above: SiFive founders Yunsup Lee (left), Krste Asanovic (middle), Andrew Waterman (right). Image Credit: SiFive In the first six months of availability, more than 1,000 HiFive1 software development boards have been purchased and delivered to developers in over 40 countries. Additionally, the company has engaged with multiple customers across its IP and system-on-a-chip (SoC) products, and it started shipping the industry’s first RISC-V SoC in November 2016. “At Spark Capital, we believe technology is the great equalizer. SiFive’s singular goal of putting custom chips into the hands of everyone from startups to exploratory design teams to inventors with a healthy crowdfunding campaign resonates with our core values,” said Todd Dagres, general partner at Spark Capital, in a statement. “We are excited at the potential for SiFive to enable new and emerging sectors to bring innovative solutions to market that might otherwise never see the light of day.” Members of the RISC-V foundation and third-party open source contributors are actively contributing to a maturing stable of software and tools. SiFive maintains an easy to install tool chain, software development kit, and other support necessary for customers to design and make their own RISC-V chips. In July 2016, SiFive launched its Freedom Everywhere platform — designed for microcontroller, embedded, Internet of Things, and wearable applications — and its Freedom Unleashed platform, for machine learning, storage, and networking applications. SiFive was recognized as the Startup of the Year by the 2016 ACE Awards and was recognized by the Linley Group’s Analyst Choice Awards. The team has also created a textbook to teach students about computer architecture. Above: HiFive1 development board sells for $59. Image Credit: SiFive Earlier this month, SiFive launched its Coreplex IP and announced a growing ecosystem of partners, including Faraday, Microsemi, and United Design Systems, who are making SiFive Coreplex IP available to their customers. The company nearly tripled its employee base in the past year, adding leaders from Altera, ARM, Atmel, Cadence Design Systems, Cisco, Intel, Juniper, Marvell, Nvidia Qualcomm, Synopsys, and Xilinx. “We are energized by the partnerships we have forged with our investors and their strong belief in SiFive’s mission,” said Jack Kang, the company’s vice president of product and business development, in a statement. “This investment will enable our continued growth for years to come and will allow SiFive to further establish that alternatives really matter in an era where traditional silicon vendors no longer are the most innovative in the industry.” Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman HP, Graham Windham and the Hamilton Connection: Changing Students’ Lives With Technology SOURCE: HP, Inc. DESCRIPTION: Educators and policy-makers know that personal technology and broadband access are game-changers when it comes to improving outcomes for students – but far too many of the schools they attend lack the resources to provide them.  But for students who face significant challenges in their home lives, access to technology inside the classroom can help bridge the digital divide. It’s one of the reasons why HP, a longtime-player in education technology, announced today it will launch a long-term HP Chromebook x360 Education Editiontechnology partnership with the Graham School, a program of the nonprofit Graham Windham. HP is gifting each of the students and their teachers with top-of-the-line HP Chromebook x360 Education Edition convertible laptops and outfitting the school’s basement into a 21st Century “maker” lab with an HP Learning Studio that features a Dremel 3D printer and the innovative Sprout Pro by HP immersive workstation. These technologies will not only help teachers improve their skills, gain time back in the classroom and draw from a wider variety of teaching tools, it’s also set to benefit the students who need the most support: the 300 at-risk students from socio-economically challenged neighborhoods the New York City metropolitan area and often have huge gaps in their education due to poverty, addiction, foster care and other hardships.   “By empowering every student and teacher with personal technology, it opens up a new possibilities for collaboration and skill-building for the future,” said Gus Schmedlen, head of HP’s education vertical. “They will be entering a workforce where to be successful, they’ll need to work collaboratively and be able to transition from the analog to the digital worlds seamlessly. This gift aims to shrink the achievement gap and offer opportunities to come out of school with these skills in hand.” Moving the project forward The donation from HP isn’t just a corporate “feel-good” moment for the company and the brand – HP is in it for the long haul. It has partnered with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Intel and Digital Promise to ensure the success of the tech overhaul, including offering change management consulting, professional development and training, and ongoing support. “They are going from a technology drought to a very rich, collaborative environment,” Schmedlen said. “This is a long-term relationship for HP.” HP, in turn, will study the effects of the technology interventions with a rigorous longitudinal study that aims to track and report how student performance changes over time, and also determine if there are school-wide lifts in standardized test scores, graduation rates, college acceptances and other measurable improvements. “Because each student will have a digital footprint, we can collect evidence and learn where they are strong and where they might need more help,” Schmedlen said. “By going from analog learning to digital, we can use data to create predictive intelligence to improve student outcomes.” The Hamilton connection HP’s technology donation was the result of outreach by Graham Windham Leadership Council Honorary Chair Luis Miranda Jr. to HP Chief Marketing Officer Antonio Lucio. “I have seen a lot of corporate donations, but this is different,” Miranda said. “The HP team has created an implementation plan that will upgrade the school’s infrastructure to support the new technology, train teachers in the software, and develop metrics that will be measured over time, in addition to the donation of the most up-to-date tech. What I see from these efforts is that HP feels that Graham Windham has as much to teach them as they have to teach the school.” Miranda became an active supporter of Graham Windham following the strong partnership developed with the organization by his son, composer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of his Broadway mega-hit, Hamilton: An American Musical.  “My hope is that one day the Graham Windham programs will not be in such need as they are now, but until then, I look forward to seeing children thrive in the program through the loving care and guidance of the teachers there, and supported by efforts of corporations like HP,” Miranda said. In 1805, Eliza Hamilton established Graham Windham as the first private orphanage in New York City in honor of her husband, Alexander Hamilton. “We are extremely pleased to partner with the Graham Windham Foundation to help reinvent the classroom and keep Eliza Hamilton’s legacy alive,” said Lucio. “Education is a strategic and special market for HP.  By studying the unique needs of students, teachers and administrators, we design education technology solutions to help schools enable the next generation of inventors, leaders, and artists. We are so grateful for this partnership with the Miranda family.” Tweet me: @HP @GrahamWindham + the #Hamilton Connection: Changing Students’ Lives w #Technology http://bit.ly/2q8fxmM #STEM #education KEYWORDS: Education, Digital Literacy, The Graham School, HP Inc, Hamilton, HP Sprout, Luis Miranda Jr., Eliza Hamilton    CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Radiofrequency Ablation Devices Market 2017 – Medtronic, AngioDynamics, Covidien, Ethicon, ZenoMed, AtriCure, Inc, Baren-Boym Next PostNext Mime et Moi lanza nueva campaña Kickstarter basada en tacones intercambiables Search Recent Posts Global Harbor and Marina Management Software Industry Growth Rate and Market Segment by Regions/Countries Global Triadimenol Market to witness Impressive Growth: by Market Size and Revenue by 2022 Global Thiram Market 2022: Segmentation by Manufacturers, application, type & regions Global Thiophanate-methyl Market Regional Analysis with Key Strategies, Application & Forecast to 2022 Thiabendazole Market Report 2022: Present Scenario for Business Opportunities, Drivers and Trends RSS RSS Feed Proudly powered by WordPress

We have a full schedule this week, so that means 9 more giveaways between now and Friday. Kicking things off for the week is one of our long-time motherboard partners, ASRock. With AMD’s Ryzen CPUs selling so well – a welcome change for the battered AMD – Ryzen-compatible Socket AM4 motherboards are now in demand. So ASRock has sent over one of their X370 Taichi motherboards for us to give away to someone looking to complete their Ryzen system. The AnandTech 20th Anniversary Celebration – ASRock Giveaway ASRock X370 Taichi Motherboard ASRock’s X370 Taichi is a full ATX board, giving it room for 3 PCIe x16 slots, and another 2 PCIe x1 slots. Along with the traditional form factor, the board also sports a duo of M.2 slots – one sporting SATA and PCIe 3, the other sporting purely PCIe 2. ASRock has also added several third-party controllers to the board, including an unnamed (but likely ASMedia) controller for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) support, an Intel I211AT controller for GigE networking, an Intel 802.11ac dual-band WiFi controller (on an includes M.2 stick), and a Realtek ALC 1220 for audio. Rounding out the package, ASRock has equipped their board with their “steel slots” PCIe braces for two of the PCIe x16 slots to better support heavy video cards, along with a 16-phase power delivery system for the CPU. And while the board itself doesn’t sport RGB LEDs, it does include a pair of controlled headers for adding RGB lighting strips. Meanwhile on the software side of matters, the board uses ASRock’s latest-generation UEFI firmware, supporting features such as Instant Flash and Crashless BIOS. Finally, as with our other giveaways, today’s giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so be sure to enter soon. However please note that for legal reasons, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. Good luck to everyone! And be sure to check in this afternoon for our next giveaway. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Dubbed the Surface Laptop, this would mark the first completely traditional product in their extremely popular Surface line-up. Every other Surface product up to now has been some form of a 2-in-1. The Surface Book and Surface Pro are laptop/tablet hybrids, and the Surface Studio is part living room All-in-One PC and part digital art canvas. The 13.5-inch Surface Laptop is a true clamshell laptop that most of us are completely familiar with. But with traditional hardware, Microsoft introduced a reworked version of their latest Windows 10 operating system which they are calling Windows 10 S. Microsoft are clearly targeting college students and small businesses with Windows 10 S as it directly competes with Google’s ChromeOS, which are found in Chromebooks. Both of these operating systems are closed and designed to be light and quick but they do sacrifice some functionality. New Surface Laptops on stands at Microsoft Event. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] The Microsoft Surface Laptop had many tech bloggers and journalists awe-struck as the looks and the apparent build quality of the device rivals even that of Apple products. The laptop will also feature a material known as Alcantara in its construction. Oh, and it comes in 4 colors. Alcantara is a slightly brushy fabric-like material which is basically made of a 70/30 mix of polyester and polyurethane. It first had its use popularized in many high-end sports cars as it is premium-feeling and ages far better than most other materials except for maybe leather, which is significantly heavier. The Surface Laptop features Alcantara prominently on its keyboard deck; the only thing on it that isn’t Alcantara is the glass trackpad. This is not the first time Microsoft has dabbled with the material, however, the Surface Pro 4 can be bought with a “Signature Type Cover,” which is made of Alcantara as well. That does raise some concerns, however. Some Surface Pro 4 users with the Alcantara Type Cover report a disgusting build-up of grime on the keyboard after six months and despite trying everything from a vacuum to baby wipes, some have not been able to successfully clean it. This could be a larger issue if present on the Surface Laptop, however. As unlike a Surface Pro device, you would not be able to just buy a new keyboard deck for it. Despite this, many reports also say that these cases are not as endemic as it may appear. Panos Panay, VP of Microsoft Surface Computing presents their latest product. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] As for what’s inside the Surface Laptop, it’s very typical mid-2017 specs. We’ll be seeing an option for seventh generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors (most likely dual-core CPUs), up to 16GB of RAM and a maximum of 512GB of solid state memory. The $999 base model comes with the Core i5, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. Many have felt this configuration to be sub-par and have opted to recommend the $1,299 Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD to be a minimum if you expect to use the device for more than three years before upgrading. The very high resolution screen looks to be just as impressive as the other Surface products and continues its slightly odd trend of using a 3:2 aspect ratio (most displays are 16:9), which is preferred as its displays more information which improves productivity, although videos will load with thick black bars that some people can’t stand. Also, it is important to note that the Core i7 models come equipped with the significantly faster Intel Iris Plus graphics chip as opposed to the integrated Intel HD 620 chip on the Core i5 models, so if your planned workload is very GPU or CPU dependant (i.e. gaming/rendering/video editing), it’ll probably be best to pony up for the Core i7. However, if you are a minimal user who only uses their laptop for productivity and maybe some Netflix, the base model should suit you fine due to the lightweight nature of Windows 10 S, though some may suggest waiting for the device to be sent out for independent testing by tech journalists before putting down an order. Burgandy colour option shown. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] Now for Windows 10 S, which has many people split. It has its pros and cons, and how it affects you really depends on what you plan to use your device for. So without further ado, lets get into this, shall we? The good thing about Windows 10 S is that it runs significantly faster than regular Windows (boots up in just 15 seconds), uses less battery than regular Windows with Microsoft quoting up to 14.5 hours of use,and we’ll also likely see more manufacturers make affordable, Chromebook-esque products running Windows 10 S. The bad things about it are the fact that you will only be able to run apps from the Microsoft Store, which may not have certain programs, and that you can’t select your prefered default search engine (read: Google). Microsoft is allowing users to switch to Windows 10 Pro free of charge until the end of the year, so you will have a safety net. Overall, the Surface Laptop is definitely designed for college-bound students and small businesses alike, but that does not mean it is for everyone. Do your research and consider what is your planned workload to ensure you don’t get burned.

The House narrowly passed legislation, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), fulfilling a long-held campaign pledge after months of public back-and-forth, and kicking the issue to the upper chamber. But Senate Republicans are expected to make significant changes to the House legislation as they try to cobble together a proposal that could pass the upper chamber. “The Senate will write its own bill. That’s clear. Mitch McConnellMitch McConnellTrump to nominate two energy regulators More than one-third of Americans oppose GOP healthcare bill What moderate GOP senators want in ObamaCare repeal MORE’s made that clear and others in leadership have made that clear,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told CNN on Friday. Sen. Chuck GrassleyChuck GrassleyOvernight Cybersecurity: Flynn drama intensifies after Yates testimony | Five key players for Trump on cyber | Macron wins despite email hack | Concerns over data reporting law McConnell: ObamaCare replacement bill 'will not be quick' This week: Senate Republicans search for deal on ObamaCare repeal MORE (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, added separately during a conference call that “we are going to be writing a Senate bill ourselves.” ADVERTISEMENT Senate leadership has a narrow path to clearing legislation through the upper chamber, with no Democrats expected to support the repeal effort. Republicans have 52 seats and can afford only two defections, allowing Vice President Pence to break a 50-50 tie. Sen. John CornynJohn CornynFive takeaways from Yates’s dramatic Senate testimony What moderate GOP senators want in ObamaCare repeal Yates account builds Flynn-Russia drama MORE (R-Texas) signaled the caucus would move slowly as they try to figure out what could pass the Senate. “There is no timeline. When we get 51 senators, we’ll vote,” Cornyn added, when asked if the Senate could take up legislation by the end of the month. Grassley added that he had been asked if lawmakers would be able to meet a June 19 deadline for insurance companies but told them he couldn’t commit to the timeline. “I said there’s no assurance I can give you from a substance standpoint or a process standpoint for when that’s going to happen because there’s been such little discussion,” he said. Senate Republicans are concerned that the House bill would negatively impact Medicaid recipients in states that expanded the program under ObamaCare, and increase premiums on older, poorer Americans. The Senate proposal will also need to meet budgetary rules that allow it to block a Democratic filibuster. That could mean a provision included in the House bill that allows states to apply for waivers for community rating, one of ObamaCare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions that won support from conservatives, could be dropped. With little room for error, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will need to get both the moderate and conservative factions of his caucus on board if he wants to get legislation through the upper chamber. He’s convened a working group of roughly a dozen senators from across the Senate GOP conference. Asked during a weekly leadership conference if Republicans would be able to pass healthcare legislation, he acknowledged that “it'll be a real big challenge on the Senate side as well.” GOP Sens.

"The Freedom Caucus were given some good things but will any of them stay?" he asked reporters late last week. "If all the good stuff is lost and we're left with just a subsidy bill...I'm not real excited about that. So, I guess we'll have to see what happens."  Nominations The Senate will continue processing Trump’s nominees with three votes expected this week. The Senate will first take up Heather Wilson’s nomination to lead the Air Force on Monday night. She easily cleared through the Senate Armed Services Committee in a 22-5 vote last month after senators questioned her on ethics issues related to her time as a defense industry consultant with a Lockheed Martin subsidiary. The Senate will also take an initial vote on Scott Gottlieb to lead the Food and Drug Administration on Monday night, teeing up a final vote for as late as Wednesday morning if lawmakers drag out the Senate’s procedural clock. Gottlieb is a former FDA director of medical policy development and deputy commissioner, and was cleared by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committee in a 14-9 vote. McConnell also said late last week that they would take up Robert Lighthizer’s nomination to be the next U.S. trade representative. The Senate Finance Committee approved Lighthizer’s nomination as part of a bipartisan agreement to consider coal miners' benefits legislation. Methane Rule The Senate could take up legislation repealing an Obama administration oil and natural gas drilling rule. Cornyn told reporters last week that he expected the Senate to take a vote on nixing the Obama-era rule ahead of Thursday’s cutoff for using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to void regulations with only a simple majority. “I think we’re going to do that next week,” he said adding that he was “optimistic” Republicans would have the votes.

The group wanted legislation to overturn federal policy that effectively prevents sales of gasoline with 15 percent ethanol — known as E15 — during the summer months due to volatility concerns. They tried to get the policy included in a government funding bill approved last week but were unsuccessful.  Even if GOP senators back down from a fight over the ethanol proposal, GOP leadership could face a narrow path getting the methane legislation through the upper chamber. Two Republican senators — Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Susan Collins (Maine) — have indicated they will vote to keep the Obama rule in place. Meanwhile four senators, including GOP Sens.

Announcing the selection May 8, Etihad said Gammell will assume “full management responsibilities” with immediate effect. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier said Hogan’s permanent successor will be announced “in the next few weeks.” Gammell joined Etihad in 2009 and has led the airline’s people strategy. Before this he accrued more than 20 years’ leadership experience, spanning roles with technology firm Intel Corporation in the US and Ireland and in the finance sector with Royal Bank of Scotland. He also spent time as an officer in the Irish armed forces.  Etihad also announced that SVP-group treasurer Ricky Thirion will become group CFO, replacing James Rigney, who will also leave the company July 1. Thirion has overseen Etihad Group’s treasury since he joined the company in 2007, following roles as South African Airways (SAA) group treasurer and managing director in the Standard Bank Group. “Ray and Ricky are experienced leaders and have the complete confidence of the Board. Ray will now take full management responsibility for the Etihad Aviation Group, ensure a coordinated group approach, and continue to advance the strategic review that was initiated by the board in 2016 to reposition the business for continued development in what we anticipate being a prolonged period of challenges for global aviation,” Etihad Aviation Group chairman Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Al Mazrouei said. “We have strengthened our group leadership with recent appointments and are now in the advanced stages of recruitment for a new group CEO. The board has been very pleased with the caliber of candidates, and we expect to make an announcement in the next few weeks.” Hogan has served as Etihad Airways president and CEO since September 2006 and was appointed as group CEO in 2016. Hogan’s name is synonymous with Etihad; under his leadership he has expanded Etihad from a single airline to a group of allied service organizations and airlines in which Etihad has equity stakes. Etihad Aviation Group comprises five business divisions: Abu Dhabi flag carrier Etihad Airways, Etihad Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners. The group has minority investments in seven airlines: airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia, and Swiss-based Darwin Airline, trading as Etihad Regional. Inset: chief people & performance officer Ray Gammell named Etihad Aviation Group CEO from July 1.

Ray Gammell, the Abu Dhabi-based group’s chief people and performance officer, will assume “full management responsibilities from today,” Etihad said in a statement on Monday. That means Hogan effectively has no official role. His departure is now set for July 1, the earliest possible date after the company previously said he’d leave some time in the second half. Etihad said the move was “consistent” with its management transition plan. Ray Gammell Source: Etihad Aviation Group With Etihad still searching for a permanent CEO, the sudden management handover suggests urgency on the part of its state owners to proceed with a reevaluation of the group’s direction, especially its so-called Equity Alliance strategy. Under Hogan, who ran the airline for more than a decade, Etihad took minority stakes in mostly under-performing airlines in an effort to turn them around while feeding more traffic through its Abu Dhabi hub. Gammel will continue Etihad’s strategic review aimed at repositioning the business for “a prolonged period of challenges for global aviation,” Chairman Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Al Mazrouei said in the statement, adding that a new permanent CEO is expected to be named in a few weeks. Hogan devised the acquisition push as the company sought to catch up with larger Gulf rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways Ltd. While some of its investments have shown a profit, Alitalia filed for bankruptcy last week amid mounting losses and a lack of funds. Hours after the Italian carrier’s insolvency, Air Berlin Plc revealed that Etihad granted the German company financial support for at least another 18 months, including 350 million euros ($384 million) of new funds. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Gammell, an Irishman, joined Etihad in 2009 after working at Intel Corp. and Royal Bank of Scotland. His main responsibility was recruiting more Emiratis into Etihad’s workforce. In addition to his appointment, the company named Ricky Thirion, currently senior vice president of group treasury, as its interim chief financial officer. He replaces James Rigney, who is also leaving on July 1. The departures of both Rigney and Hogan had already been announced by the airline. The appointments are part of a broader management shuffle.

X Irishman Ray Gammell announced as Etihad interim chief executive UAE flag carrier re-evaluating strategy of taking minority stakes in other airlines about 22 hours ago Etihad Aviation Group has named Ray Gammell, from Greystones, Co Wicklow, as its interim chief executive officer         Etihad Aviation Group has named Ray Gammell, from Greystones, Co Wicklow, as its interim chief executive officer. He will take over from James Hogan when the Australian stands down after more than a decade in charge later this year. Gammell, the group’s chief people and performance officer, will assume full management responsibilities for the group immediately, though he will formally take charge when Hogan leaves on July 1st, Etihad said in a statement on Monday. The Irishman joined the carrier, which is the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, in 2009 after working at Intel and Royal Bank of Scotland. Etihad to double Dublin services to Abu Dhabi from July Alitalia to go on sale in two weeks Christoph Mueller tipped for top job at Abu Dhabi-based Etihad The search for a permanent new chief executive continues, and an announcement should be made in the next few weeks, Etihad chairman Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Al Mazrouei said in the release. In the meantime, Gammell will continue with a strategic review begun last year in order to reposition the business for “a prolonged period of challenges for global aviation,” he said. Equity alliance Etihad is examining whether to continue with a so-called equity alliance strategy that has seen it take minority stakes in mostly underperforming airlines around the world in an effort to turn them around while helping to feed more traffic through its Abu Dhabi hub. Hogan devised the plan as the company sought to catch up with older Gulf rivals Emirates, based in Dubai, and Qatar Airways. While some of its investments have shown a profit, Alitalia has filed for bankruptcy amid mounting losses and a lack of funds, and Air Berlin is dividing its business into three in a bid to survive amid competition from local rivals. Etihad said that Ricky Thirion, currently senior vice-president, group treasury, will take over as chief financial officer from James Rigney, who is also leaving on July 1st. The departures of both Rigney and Hogan had already been announced by the airline. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Al Mazrouei James Hogan James Rigney Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Ray Gammell Ricky Thirion Defence Forces Ulster University College Dublin Wicklow Air Berlin Alitalia Emirates Aviation Etihad Aviation Group Greystones Intel Mr Gammell RBS Royal Bank of Scotland Bloomberg Gammell Qatar Airways Abu Dhabi Europe United Arab Emirates United States Dubai  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Construction Sales up 4.4% at Grafton Group with strong growth at Woodies Work How to make a great first impression at a job interview Rugby Ruan Pienaar’s enforced departure hits so many wrong notes Ireland A wooded cycle suitable for all levels Sponsored The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

FREE Registration Home News Archive Features Directory Recruitment Events About Us Advertising Contribute News 8 May 2017 Qorvo’s quarterly revenue hit by delayed smartphone launches in China and Korea For fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 (to 1 April), Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense applications) has reported revenue of $642m, up 5.7% on $607.1m a year ago but down 22% on $825.4m last quarter. Revenue for Mobile Products (MP) was $474m, down 28% on $656.8m last quarter and up just 2% on a year ago, as two leading customers in China and a tier-1 customer in Korea delayed flagship smartphone launches. With Samsung and Huawei comprising just over 10% of Mobile Product revenue each and open-market China lower than normal at about 24%, China fell from 41% of Mobile Product revenue to 35%. Revenue for Infrastructure & Defense Products (IDP) was $168m, roughly equal to last quarter’s record and up 18% on $142m a year ago, due to continued growth in defense, Wi-Fi and Internet of Things (IoT), reflecting the repositioning of the firm’s product portfolio to target high-growth segments. In particular, Wi-Fi grew more than 40% year-on-year, with notable strength in 5GHz power amplifiers (PAs) and 802.11ac front-end modules (FEMs). Defense & Aerospace grew more than 20% year-on-year, with strength in gallium nitride (GaN)-based power amplifiers. “In the March quarter, we collaborated with all major infrastructure OEMs on next-generation 4G and pre-5G macro base-station GaN PAs, we supported 1Gbps throughput in the ZTE Gigabit smartphone, we supplied the industry's first 5G RF front-end in collaboration with Intel, and we achieved full certification of the first single-placement integrated module [spanning all major RF functions required in the main path, including amplifiers, switches and filters] covering low, mid and high bands on a MediaTek baseband,” says president & CEO Bob Bruggeworth. Also during the March quarter, Qorvo shipped its first BAW 5-based bulk acoustic wave filters (launched in the December quarter) in its RF Fusion WiFi integrated front-end modules (iFEMs), in support of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo; “In premium-tier smartphones, we’re enjoying strong demand for RF Fusion for cellular,” notes Bruggeworth. Qorvo added ZTE to the list of customers buying its full suite of RF Fusion solutions, combining low-band, mid-band and high-band placements. “These highly compact solutions cover multiple modes and bands and require more temperature-compensated SAW and more BAW,” he adds. Also during the quarter, Qorvo commenced shipments of Power Class 2 solutions to Sony, LG and HTC, and secured design wins for Power Class 2-capable RF Flex and high-band RF Fusion solutions. The firm also secured multiple design wins at Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and others, in support of performance-tier smartphones. In IDP, during the quarter Qorvo secured an important 802.11ac design win in the recently released Sonos sound bar for home audio networks (incorporating a BAW filter). “The integration of BAW filters into our Wi-Fi solutions is a focus for IDP,” notes Bruggeworth. The firm also secured a design win in a recently launched dual-band 802.11ac wireless router, delivering up to 1.2Gb/s. “We're quickly filling this Wi-Fi sales funnel, including for 802.11ax programs,” he adds. Qorvo also expanded its optical product portfolio by launching five phase amplitude modulation 4 (PAM4) products for data center interconnect applications. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 46.2%, down from 50% a year ago but up from 44.3% last quarter (and exceeding the expected 46%) due mainly to improved product mix (lower low-band PAD volumes) and cost-related activities (ongoing productivity and quality efforts). Operating expenses rose further, from $142.9m a year ago and $157.1m last quarter to $163.1m, including $108.9m in research & development (R&D) and $132.7m in selling, general & administrative (SG&A). Operating income was $133.4m (operating margin of 20.8% of sales), down from $208.7m (operating margin of 25.3%) last quarter and $160.6m (operating margin of 26.5%) a year ago. Net income was $111.7m ($0.85 per diluted share, $0.05 over the midpoint of the $0.70-0.90 guidance range), down from $177.3m ($1.35 per diluted share) last quarter and $142.6m ($1.04 per diluted share) a year ago. Operating cash flow has rebounded from last quarter’s $220.4m to $247.1m (up 50% year-on-year). Capital expenditure (CapEx) has risen further, from $136.5m to $165.8m, primarily due to the timing of filter capacity additions. Free cash flow hence fell further, from $83.9m to $81.3m. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments rose from $495.8m to $545m. This was after Qorvo also returned $51m to shareholders under its $500m share repurchase program. For fiscal first-quarter 2018 (to end-June 2017), Qorvo has lowered its original forecast (of 7-10% sequential revenue growth to $680-685m) by $50-55m to $610-650m. Of the shortfall, about $30m is related to end-manufacturers working through unforeseen inventory, $10m is due to one of the delayed Asia-region smartphone models eventually being canceled, and $10m is due to not seeing the traditional market recovery after Chinese New Year. In contrast, revenue from South Korea’s Samsung should grow. Despite the $630m mid-point of this guidance range being down quarter-to-quarter, gross margin will still rise to about 47%. Operating expenses should rise sequentially by about $5m, due partly to R&D related to custom product development for Qorvo’s largest customer. Net income is expected to be $0.70-0.90 per diluted share. “This guidance reflects normal seasonal effects at our largest customer and weaker-than-expected near-term China demand [roughly flat quarter-to-quarter],” says chief financial officer Mark Murphy. Neverthless, for fiscal full-year 2018 Qorvo foresees strong revenue growth, gross and operating margin expansion. “Our newly released BAW 5 technology has immediately gained commercial traction in cellular, Wi-Fi and other applications,” notes Murphy. “This technology, along with our proven design capabilities, is providing us the opportunity to work on the industry's most complex integrated modules and enabling us to participate in the largest and most attractive markets in RF,” he adds. “IDP’s portfolio continues to grow more attractive, with broad-based exposure to many high-growth markets including 5G, Wi-Fi, automotive, and other IoT [leading to double-digit growth again in IDP for fiscal full-year 2018],” says Murphy. Although we’re a bit slower out of the gate than expected due to near-term softness in China demand, our forecast outlook for the full year of fiscal 2018 looks good.” Driven by the timing of marquee smartphone launches plus continued growth at Samsung, Qorvo expects sequential revenue growth of over 30% in the September quarter then more in the December quarter prior to the normal seasonal decline in the March quarter, amounting to double-digit growth for full-year fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 (though closer to 10%, due to the slow start in China). This will be joined by higher BAW-based product mix [rising from under 30% of Mobile Product revenue now to about 40% by fiscal 2019], higher utilization rates and ongoing productivity and quality improvements to help the firm achieve its 50% gross margin target exiting fiscal 2018. “Operationally, we continue to make solid progress on yield improvements, wafer size conversions [to 8-inch BAW and 6-inch temperature-compensated SAW, complementing significant reductions in die size], capacity rationalizations, sourcing initiatives and other productivity efforts to drive margin expansion,” notes Murphy. OpEx efficiency should continue to improve, achieving operating expenses of about 20% of sales for the year, forecasts the firm. “We are resolute in hitting our operating model of 30% operating margin during the fiscal year 2018,” says Murphy. CapEx is forecast to fall to about $400m, as the firm completes its expansion to support multi-year above-market growth of filter-based products. With strong revenue growth, expanding gross margins, improving OpEx efficiency (lower OpEx as a percent of sales) and lower CapEx, free cash flow is expected to double from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018.

It is also nearly half a year since Samsung and Google flaunted the Chromebook Plus 2-in-1, promised to have full Android app support. Neither have yet come to fruition in any substantial, let alone final way. Although is lesser sibling, the Chomebook Plus, has long launched in the market, the Samsung Chromebook Pro remains unlisted. And, according to The Verge, it could very well be due to that Android app support. It has to be the software right? After all, the Chromebook Pro hardware is notable but not exactly revolutionary. It is basically a high resolution 2-in-1 tablet running on an Intel Core m3 processor. Sure, the Wacom digitizer and S Pen are new to Chrome OS, but Samsung has nearly a year of experience using that technology. Android app support on Chrome OS, on the other hand, is barely through its teething stage. Although it started with the very crude and limited ARC implementation a few years back, this full support, which actually brings Google Play Store to the browser-based platform, is far more comprehensive and ambitious. Implementation, however, has so far been disappointing if early reviews are to be considered. Glitchy and unstable, it shows the technical difficulties of trying to force apps that were written for a different device type and platform to run in a different environment. And then there’s probably the fact that the Chromebook Pro runs on an Intel processor. Although officially supported long ago, Android on Intel platforms haven’t exactly been top performers. That’s not to say that Android apps on Chrome OS still has years of growth to go through. It already does work and is just in need of polish. That polish is probably what is causing the delay of a device that should have launched last month. Google and Samsung, however, no longer have time on their side, as they need to put out a Chrome OS champion really soon to fend off the Windows 10 S threat.

Ever since the Surface Pro 4, consumers have been waiting for the next iteration to release in the market. Many Surface Pro fans are somewhat excited to see the tablet sport the latest Kaby Lake processors from Intel. However, recent events may suggest that Microsoft is due to unveil a new Surface device pretty soon. Unfortunately, the device in question will not be called Surface Pro 5, like earlier reports. According to a recent interview with CNET, Panos Panay, Microsoft’s Corporate VP of Devices, said that there is no such thing as Pro 5. However, he said that the next Surface device would include features that will present meaningful impact to the users. These pronouncements led many to believe that Microsoft is changing the branding for the 2-in-1 tablet and dropping the Pro 5 name. On the flip side, it also means that the successor for the Surface Pro 4 is now nearly within reach. In fact, a recent Twitter post may have shed some light on the matter. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) A few days ago, Panay posted on Twitter about the upcoming Microsoft event in China. And with the post, the hashtag “#Surface” is also present. Now, this could mean a few things. But the most compelling one is the rumor of a Surface Pro 5 release in the said event which is to be held in Shanghai on the 23rd of May. See you in Shanghai. May 23. #MicrosoftEvent #Surface https://t.co/aMgvkkqE52 pic.twitter.com/vzcK9MqIpf — Panos Panay (@panos_panay) May 5, 2017 Whether or not Microsoft is ditching the Surface Pro 5 branding, it is still quite clear that a replacement for the previous model is coming pretty soon. Perhaps, the only thing that can be done right now is to wait and see what Microsoft meant with the said hashtag. For more updates on the Surface Pro 5, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

There are a lot of different specs and features that give ultrabooks the right to call themselves “ultra” over regular laptops, but perhaps one of the most unsung aspects is what brought you to our list of the best portable ultrabooks of 2017. When creating this list we considered both the power and battery life of the ultrabooks in the marketplace, but also wanted to make sure that the top picks were also some of the smallest and lightest possible so they’re ultra-easy on the arm to lug around. All the picks in this list are at most 3lbs or less, and don’t have screens larger than 13.3″ across. This ensures they won’t take up a large footprint on a desk, and also won’t weigh down a bookbag, briefcase, or backpack when you’re already hauling around extra gear and need to save all the weight you can. All these factors in mind, it’s pretty hard not to choose the HP Spectre x360 13 ($1,159) as our #1 pick. This model absolutely knocks it out of the park on every metric, including its versatile 2-in-1 hinge that lets you cut its overall dimensions in half if you feel like tucking the keyboard away underneath for ultimate portability on the fly. Best Portable Ultrabook   HP Spectre x360 13 Dell XPS 13 Lenovo IdeaPad 710s Rank #1 - Editor's Choice/ Best Portable Ultrabook #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating N/A N/A Screen Size 13.3" 13.3" 13.3" CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-6200U RAM 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8 GB DDR3L Display 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Battery Life Up to 10hrs Up to 10hrs Up to 8hrs Touchscreen Optional Storage 256GB PCIe SSD 256GB PCIe SSD 512GB PCIe SSD Dimensions 12.03 x 8.58 x 0.54 inches 11.98 x 0.33 x 7.88 inches 12.09 x 0.55 x 8.43 inches Weight 2.85 pounds 2.7 pounds 2.4 pounds Price $1159.99 $1349.99 $1037.60 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now How We Choose the Best Portable Ultrabook As we mentioned in the previous section, although specs and power were important considerations in compiling our list of the most portable ultrabooks on the market, first and foremost we were looking for anything that shaved down a little weight and size on the edges. Luckily, those two sides of the coin don’t have to be mutually exclusive these days. Thanks to Intel’s latest 7th-generation Core i CPUs, all the ultrabooks on this list can pack in smaller batteries (less weight) and fewer fans (less bulk) thanks to the ultra-efficient, ultra-cool Kaby Lake CPUs. Read More: What Is an Ultrabook? Another main feature that helps to save on space without sacrificing any power is the aforementioned 2-in-1 style, which takes any full-sized ultrabook and cuts everything in half. That way if you’re either working with limited desk space or just need something that you can literally take with you on the go (much like a tablet), convertible ultrabooks make it simple with a flip of the keyboard to the back. Not all the picks we have listed her employ the hinge, but it’s still something you should keep an eye on if portability is your main priority. Why You Should Buy a New Portable Ultrabook Likely one of the best candidates for a new portable ultrabook are students. With individual textbooks that can often weigh 15lbs or more on their own, having an ultrabook that barely adds another ounce to that already-overbearing load of supplies can make it much easier for them to get around campus without having to visit the chiropractor in between every class. Plus, with the smaller overall footprint students will also be able to whip out their laptop and notebooks at the same time without crowding their fellow classmates in a lecture hall. Others who might benefit include engineers or IT staff who constantly need to be running between one department and the next around their building. The light hand feel, quick boot-from-sleep times, and ultra-fast SSDs will ensure that you can get in, out, and on to the next technical meltdown in a matter of minutes (instead of hours). This increases overall productivity and ensures you’re never stuck in one place for too long while you zip around the office! #1 Pick  HP Spectre x360 13/Editor’s Choice Best Portable Ultrabook HP was has been in a slump recently when it came to laptops, but now it’s clear they’re ready to get back on top Price: $1,159.99 | Features: 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U CPU, 0.5″ thick, 2.87lbs WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Powerful and ultra-portable, the HP Spectre x360 shines.  At a mere 0.5″ thick, 2.85lb, and equipped with a 2-in-1 convertible hinge, it simply doesn’t get any more portable than the latest HP Spectre x360 13. Read More: Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook HP has truly changed the game for good with the release of the new Spectre x360 line, incorporating Apple-esque design with powerhouse specs like 512GB of SSD storage, 16GB of LPDDR3 SDRAM, and of course, the brand new Intel Core 2.7GHz i7-7500U CPU. With all those beefy specs it’s hard to believe this laptop weighs as little as it does and takes up barely any space, which is why we couldn’t help but name it the best portable ultrabook 2016! View on Best Buy #2 Pick Dell XPS 13 The Dell XPS 13 is a thing of beauty at only a mere 0.33″ thick from all sides Price: $1349.99  | Features: 2.7lbs, 13.3″ InfinityEdge display, 256GB PCIe SSD WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell XPS 13 continues to revolutionize ultrabook portability.  But maybe you’ve been burned by HP too many times in the past, and a Samsung ultrabook is more your thing? Well unfortunately we’re still waiting for Samsung to actually release their first line of ultrabooks equipped with Kaby Lake CPUs, but in the meantime the new Dell XPS 13 will have to do! Read More: Ultrabook vs. Laptop The XPS 13 is no slouch, obviously, and can stand toe-to-toe with Samsung any day of the week. Offering one of the most beautiful screens in the business thanks to its InfinityEdge display inside a case that would make even the top Samsung designers a little jealous, Dell continues to hone their flagship ultrabook that redefined the genre just a few short years ago. If you’re looking for a bit of extra style with your substance, the Dell XPS 13 is the best portable ultrabook to get. View on Dell #3 Pick  Lenovo IdeaPad 710S The Lenovo IdeaPad 710s isn’t as sexy as others on this list, but it’s still powerful and portable enough to go anywhere in the world Price: $1037.60  | Features: 15.6″ 1920 x 1080 display, 8GB DDR3L SDRAM, 2.3GHz Core i5-6200U CPU WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Lenovo IdeaPad 710S is a portable powerhouse that you can pack to go anywhere.  Last but not least we come to the king of portability, the company who basically invented the “ultraportable” laptop as we know it in the ThinkPad line: Lenovo. The Lenovo IdeaPad 710S may not be a part of the manufacturer’s quintessential lineup of ThinkPad devices, but that’s because this is the next evolution of laptop in nearly every way imaginable. The IdeaPad 710S impresses on the processing front with the help an Intel Core 2.7GHz i7-7500U CPU, but where it really shines is the addition of a 512GB PCIe SSD. For anyone who’s owned a PCIe SSD before, you know just how insanely fast they make everything from loading up a presentation to getting to your favorite photos and videos live. If you want a highly-customizable, endlessly tweakable monster of a machine that could just about fit in your pocket if it wanted to, look no further than the Lenovo Ideapad 710s. View on Amazon Most Important Features Weight Ultrabooks are made to be portable, light, and fast. This has been Intel’s vision for the brand from the beginning, and the weight of a device matters just as much to the company as anything else. None of the ultrabooks on this list weigh anything more than 3lbs, with the closest model being the touchscreen version of the XPS 13 at 2.9lbs out the door. Battery life Sometimes it can be hard when you’re caught in the limbo between wanting a portable ultrabook and one that will actually last a decently long time between charges. The more battery cells you pack into an ultrabook, the heavier it gets. Luckily thanks to Intel’s mandated specs, all the laptops listed here have a minimum battery life of at least 8 hours. 2-in-1/Convertible Design One of the biggest benefits to choosing a convertible ultrabook (or even a plain old laptop) over the clamshell-style competition is the ultimate sense of portability that comes along with it. Convertibles let you turn an ultrabook into an ultra-powerful tablet in an instant, meaning you can either use the screen in one hand while you draw with the other, or just type directly on the screen in case of extra-tight quarters. Dimensions Of course, this wouldn’t be a list of the best portable ultrabooks without addressing the core metric that makes them portable in the first place: their dimensions. Kaby Lake CPUs have made it easier than ever for manufacturers to make their newest ultrabooks ultra-slim, which is why none of the choices on this list are any thicker than 0.6″ top to bottom. Ultra-thin means ultraportable, and it also makes 2-in-1 usage much easier to keep in the hand without feeling uncomfortable over longer periods of time. Mistakes or Things to Avoid Don’t go ultra-portable unless you really need it: It’s tempting to have the slickest, slimmest, and smallest ultrabook of all your friends, but unless that’s your main priority, it’s probably better to check out one of our best value ultrabooks instead. When you’re not as concerned with portability you can squeeze a heck of a lot more power out, all at a lower cost than ultraportables demand upfront. Skimp on larger screens: Although it may be tempting to shoot for a 15″ screen on an ultrabook so you can really take advantage of all their extra power, all that extra display space will only weigh you down in the long run. Not only is the screen itself heavier with added materials, you also need to consider the fact that a larger screen means a larger footprint, which can hurt the whole “portable” goal quite a bit. What Else You Should Think About Now that you’ve read off our list for the best portable ultrabook picks of the year, are there any other things you should consider before making your final buy? Well, it never hurts to find out more about the product category you’re purchasing in, which is why I recommend checking out Ultrabooks vs Chromebooks to find out if there’s a Chromebook that could meet your portability needs at a fraction of the cost. Don’t forget to check out the Best Chromebooks of 2016 either, where only the slimmest and sleekest laptops made the cut. It’s not hard to see why the HP Spectre x360 13 made it to the top of our best portable ultrabook list, thanks not only to its stellar set of specs and drop-dead gorgeous display, but also an ultra-thin, ultra-light (and ultra-portable) profile to boot!

Sign up now close The week in security: Crims get creative as cybersecurity named the biggest risk to nations, SMEs David Braue (CSO Online) on 08 May, 2017 09:48 0 - - - - print email Cybersecurity has hit the agenda so quickly that it is now a “paramount national security risk”, one futurist warned even as French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron weathered an email hack on the eve of the country’s election. Little wonder that another expert suggested that cybersecurity is “by far” the biggest threat to small and medium enterprises. But with results of user education varying dramatically, it never hurts to have another technique to try to get them to use stronger passwords – or to work to secure employees’ home endpoint devices. If nothing else, a concerted effort at improving human defences now will help boost corporate defences to financial cybercrime – which is still keeping banks up at night. As always, reducing the chances of a serious compromise requires a commitment to addressing the basics. China is attempting to address the basics by using regular security checks on IT vendors that are designed to identify vulnerable Internet and networking services early on. They’d be wary of compromises such as a sneaky Gmail phishing attack, which incorporates a fake Google Docs app. That’s a problem given the reliance on cloud-based applications that, a Google executive said, can ease the burden of data protection compliance. Indeed, online platforms require particular vigilance as many warn that a phishing attack or ransomware infection may just be a lead indicator of a broader extortion or fraud attempt. Mac users were being warned about new malware – linked to Russian attackers who recently ported their Windows backdoor program to macOS – that snoops on encrypted connections, while the Xen project was hit with the third highly critical virtual-machine escape bug in 10 months, Intel rolled out a patch to fix a severe vulnerability in some Intel-based business computers, and Android got security patches for over 100 vulnerabilities affecting a range of components. Search engine Shodan took a new approach to botnet management, launching a service that enables security researchers and law enforcement officers to look for malware command-and-control servers. It’s a notable step forward that could help improve the response to new malware families. Security practitioners are still suffering threat alert fatigue, while employers are suffering their own form of fatigue as they try to derive meaning from the range of cybersecurity credentials in the market. This, as experts warned about tightening controls on third-party access and remaining extra vigilant when choosing the right cybersecurity products in the face of often dubious claims by cybersecurity product vendors. Read more Attack, detection metrics improve but security specialists warn against complacency Meanwhile, criminals are continuing to explore new methods for financial exploitation, with fraudulent gift cards becoming increasingly popular. Another group was abusing the Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure to facilitate financial crimes, while others were notching up their success in compromising government agencies with a Frankenstein malware framework built from a range of publicly available tools. Others are sticking to old favourites, with the average ransomware demand now past $US1000 ($A1320). New technologies were causing other problems, too: India’s Supreme Court, for one, was hearing a challenge to a biometric authentication system that forces the use of biometrics identifiers when filing tax returns. These sorts of real-world problems are just some of the many challenges facing innovative security startups, who need to hedge their bets carefully to maximise their chances of survival.

Tuesday, May 9, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2017/05/01/san-jose-may-day-march-expected-to-draw-10000/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News Updated: Thousands Turn Out for May Day March in San Jose By Jennifer Wadsworth @jennwadsworth / May 1, 2017 11 Thousands of people have turned out for the May Day march in San Jose, and it’s safe to say not everyone is a fan of President Donald Trump. (Photo by Greg Ramar) At Silicon Valley’s march for International Workers Day, activists echoed a recurring theme: that the concerns of laborers overlap with those of all marginalized people. Organizers of San Jose’s May Day rally said Monday’s event also took on greater urgency because of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric and attacks on civil rights. “Trump showed us that it’s so easy to play people against each other,” said Huy Tran, a 34-year-old attorney for the Justice at Work Law Group. “But I think this movement is a way to show that we’re all part of a bigger struggle.” Huy joined activists who marched from the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose’s East Side to the SAP Center in downtown. Before the procession took off down Alum Rock Avenue, people cheered and clapped as speakers, poets and dancers took turns on the stage. The crowd responded periodically by chanting in unison. “Get up, get down, there’s a migrant movement in our town,” they shouted. “When our immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” “The people united will never be defeated.” Aztec dancers elaborately adorned in feathers led the way from the East Side to the heart of the city. Trailing behind them, a parade of hundreds that swelled into a conflux of about 3,000 as the evening wore on. One group of marchers carried a huge puppet-like effigy of Trump—orange face distorted in a wrinkled grimace, garish yellow hair, abnormally long red tie. Outside City Hall, activists took bats to “walls of alternative facts,” paper banners scrawled with falsehoods uttered by the Trump administration. Throughout the day, protest signs, costumes and homemade T-shirts inspired countless selfies and snapshots. Twenty-seven-year-old Jayden Lee wore the transgender pride flag as a cape. A woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty raised a torch in her right hand and in her left, a sign declaring that “no human being is illegal.” Students from the Roberto Cruz High School Leadership Academy held up bright and bold-lettered handmade signs. “Something smells bad in the White House,” one read. “We should flush it.” “Yes, he Klans!” “We didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us!!” “We are not immigrants, we are the original Americans.” Roberto Cruz High Principal Yesenia Marquez said a lot of her students were too afraid to show up to class after the November election. But the school held a town hall and a know-your-rights training that empowered the students to act. “Supporting our community means supporting immigrants,”Marquez said. Elsewhere, a poster took a shot at a tone-deaf commercial that tried to co-opt political resistance movements to sell soda. “We need papers, not Pepsi,” it read. “Justice is the opposite of just ICE,” quipped another sign, referencing Trump’s orders to ramp up U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations. Rabbi Melanie Aron’s sign bore a phrase oft-repeated at the march, “No human being is illegal.” She said she attended with two other rabbis on behalf of a Jewish social justice organization called Bend the Arc. “For Jews, supporting immigrant rights comes partly from an identification with our history,” she said. “As a people, we have been refugees, we have been displaced and persecuted. But this is also about basic issues of justice.” People should have the right to keep their families intact, she said, as well as the right to housing and health care, to a dignified job and the chance to build healthy, stable lives. “For some of us, it was a struggle just to be here,” said Maria Guerrero, a 28-year-old barista at Intel. “Some people were scared to take the day off work.” Major tech companies that allowed employees to take the day off to protest had to be pressured to extend that commitment to vendors as well. Dozens of lawyers across the country—including Ruth Silver-Taube, of the Silicon Valley Wage Theft Coalition—offered to represent pro bono workers whose employers retaliate against them for taking the day off to protest. “Some people are still at risk,” Guerrero said. “Subcontractors are seen as less valuable.” At least Guerrero had reason to celebrate, she said. Her union, Unite Here Local 19, ratified a contract two weeks ago that raised the wage floor to $15 an hour and included protections for immigrant workers. The labor deal marked the culmination of nearly 20 months of organizing. Michael Sanchez, a Tesla worker on disability leave, said there’s a lot of fight left before he sees similar resolution at his workplace. Five years of 12-hour days installing underbody batteries at Tesla’s Fremont factory herniated two discs in his neck, leaving him in constant pain but with enough time to rally for stronger worker protections. But attempts to unionize 6,000 workers at the company’s East Bay facility have been met with intimidation and harassment, according the United Automobile Workers, which filed four complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board. “We’re trying to build a union, but there’s that fear factor,” Sanchez said. “People are afraid to speak up.” Jeff Powers, 73, said working conditions have deteriorated in the past two decades. When he became a passenger train conductor for Amtrak 20 years ago, he said, the crews were bigger and enjoyed more institutional support. “The loss of worker protections have led to understaffing in the railroad industry,” he said. “Crews have shrunk, which follows the trends in other industries to require fewer people to do more work.” Maricela Gutierrez, head of immigrant advocacy nonprofit SIREN, noted that South Bay labor activists have long championed immigration reform. But she said the coalition behind this year’s May Day demonstrations has never been more diverse, representing queer and transgender communities, religious and ethnic minorities, feminists, students, renters and every imaginable cross-section of the working class. Supporting each one of those groups means resisting federal policies that exclude refugees and target undocumented immigrants, said Rev. Rowan Fairgrove, a member of the activist group Rise Up for Justice. It also means pushing for laws that protect tenants from eviction and make health care a basic right, said Tom Linebarger, a retired painter and affordable housing advocate.  “This community belongs to all of us,” Gutierrez added, “and we must band together in this political climate to push back against harmful policies from the federal administration that promote hate and fear.” Nassim Nouri, a member of the Santa Clara County Green Party, said the same goes for environmental justice. She pointed to her sign, which named the party’s four core principles: social justice, ecology, democracy and peace. “We can’t stand for one of these without the other,” she said. “We stand for democracy, so we can have peace, so we can protect our ecology and promote social justice.” SJI May Day - 1 Thousands of people have turned out for the May Day march in San Jose, and it’s safe to say not everyone is a fan of President Donald Trump.

South Bay Labor Council is MIA too. Would be interesting if SJI reported SIREN’s parade permit and costs for SJPD staffing and VTA impacts. Or a gift of public funds?

Key Takeaway From Sally Yates: Flynn’s ‘Underlying Conduct’ Was The Problem SHARE TWEET PIN-IT Bill Clark/CQPHO By Allegra Kirkland Published May 8, 2017 6:53 pm Views The Trump administration has insisted for months that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was ousted in February specifically because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. That rationale was dealt a forceful blow on Monday, when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified that Flynn’s “underlying conduct was problematic in and of itself.” Yates repeatedly circled back to Flynn’s “underlying conduct” in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism, saying she made it expressly clear to White House Counsel Don McGahn in a phone call and two in-person meetings that it was a matter of concern. Yates said she couldn’t reveal the nature of that conduct because it was drawn from classified information. But she emphasized that Russia knew about it too, leading the Justice Department under her tenure to believe that Flynn was “compromised with respect to the Russians.” “Not only did we believe that the Russians knew this but that they likely had proof of this information,” Yates testified. “And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security advisor essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is also probing into Russia’s election interference, said on Twitter that Yates’ comments about Flynn’s “conduct” were the “most striking” part of her testimony. Most striking about testimony: Yates' conclusion Flynn's "underlying conduct" was problematic. Not just his lie but what he was lying about. https://t.co/M9ojwUkdcE — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) May 8, 2017 Yates testified that she first met with McGahn on Jan. 26 to provide detailed accounts about Flynn’s actions; how Pence and other senior Trump administration officials were unknowingly making false statements to the public about Flynn’s contacts with Russia; and Flynn’s Jan. 24 interview with the FBI at the White House. The purpose of the conversation with McGahn, which Yates said she continued in another meeting on Jan. 27 and in a phone call on Jan. 30, was to urge the Trump White House to “take action” regarding Flynn. That wouldn’t happen until Feb. 13, several days after the Washington Post reported that Flynn lied to Pence about discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Lauding Flynn as a “wonderful man” who was treated “very, very unfairly” by the media, Trump said he accepted Flynn’s resignation. What exactly Flynn did to ring such alarm bells at the DOJ is unclear. But in the days since he departed the White House, many details have emerged about his work on behalf of foreign governments. Flynn belatedly registered as a foreign agent on March 7, acknowledging that the work his consulting firm was doing while he served as a top Donald Trump campaign adviser and designated national security adviser to the President-elect “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 between August and December 2016 by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm run by a Turkish businessman, according to Flynn’s filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). While he was privy to classified national security secrets, Flynn was meeting with senior Turkish officials and overseeing research and promotional materials for Inovo. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer dismissed Flynn’s lobbying work as a “personal matter, a business matter,” although it was twice brought to the attention of the administration during the transition. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) warned Pence about Flynn’s work for Inovo in a Nov. 18, 2016 letter, while Flynn’s lawyer reportedly told McGahn about it during the transition. Politico later reported that Ekim Alptekin, the Turkish businessman who runs Inovo, has extensive business ties to Russia. Alptekin ran his lobbying efforts with Ukraine-born businessman Dmitri Zaikin, and both men have negotiated business deals with Vladimir Putin’s government, according to Politico. In late March, Flynn offered to be interviewed by the FBI and both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in exchange for a grant of immunity. None of those parties appear to have accepted his offer. Last year, Flynn said that receiving immunity “means you probably committed a crime.” The ousted national security adviser’s legal headaches worsened in early April after financial disclosure firms released by the White House revealed that he failed to inform it and the Office of Government Ethics about speaking fees he received from three Russia-linked firms. In an amended financial filing submitted after he left the administration, Flynn disclosed that he was paid by an air freight company tied to the Russia-based Volga-Dnepr Group, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, and Kremlin-backed propaganda outlet RT. The Trump administration has brushed off responsibility for adequately vetting Flynn before bringing him onboard, shifting the blame onto the Obama administration for granting Flynn a national security clearance and then not revoking it when concerns arose. An hour before Yates appeared before the Senate panel and detailed her repeated, forceful warnings about Flynn’s “problematic” conduct, Spicer acknowledged reports that former President Barack Obama warned Trump not to hire Flynn two days after the real estate mogul won the election, saying Obama made it clear that “he wasn’t exactly a fan.” If there was “truly a concern,” Spicer insisted in his daily briefing, the Obama administration should have suspended Flynn’s security clearance long ago.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

Lifkin Monday, May 8, 2017 at 6:22 pm | י"ב אייר תשע"ז YERUSHALAYIM - Bank of Israel interventions in the foreign currency market aimed at stemming the surge of the shekel have met with little success in recent days. Despite the Bank’s large purchases of dollars, the shekel was continuing to muscle aside the dollar. As of Monday night, the dollar/shekel exchange rate was listed at NIS 3.5951/$, and the shekel/euro rate was at NIS 3.9312/€. Prico Risk Management and Investments CEO Yossi Fraiman assessed the situation: “The continued appreciation of the shekel represents a real threat to local industry. Cheap imports together with damage to the competitiveness of the Israel importer are leading to the closure of factories and the transfer of production to the target markets. Employment in the local economy is becoming more and more dependent on a small group of international concerns operating in it, such as Teva, Intel, Amdocs, Vishay, Eurocom and Bezeq, Formula, Israel Chemicals, and a few others. “In our view, the Bank of Israel, which sees the danger of the slippery slope with the breakthrough of the NIS 3.58/$ level, will continue to intervene in trading with the aim of preventing the exchange rate from sliding towards the lows of the summer of 2014, when the shekel-dollar rate fell below NIS 3.5$, and the low of the summer of 2008, when the rate weakened to NIS 3.24/$ and even lower. We expect the Bank of Israel to intervene on a large scale.” Filed under: Currency Print Email Gmail Related Bank Study: Interventions to Devalue Shekel Have Done Their Job Report: Bank of Israel Will Let Shekel Rise Shekel Breaks Out, Bank May Intervene Pressure Mounts on Bank of Israel to Rein in Shekel Shekel Headed for 3.55?

While Nvidia attempted to hit every corner of the market with its broad-ranging line of Pascal-based cards, AMD attempted to gain ground by focusing on the lower end of the spectrum with its first generation of Polaris-based cards. At the top of the line was the AMD Radeon RX 480, a card aimed at delivering VR-ready performance at around $260. Below that was the RX 470, a solid 1080p performer priced below $240. Both were and remain solid cards, but low supply and high demand saw many buyers paying a premium price for what should have been an excellent value. Now we have the Radeon RX 500 line, AKA not the powerful cards featuring AMD's new Vega architecture everyone was hoping for. AMD is calling the RX 500 series the second generation of Polaris, though it's less of an upgrade and more of a refresh. The line consists of enhanced versions of the RX 460, 470 and 480, along with an $US80 (starting from $129 in Australia) RX 550 card, you know, for the kids. We're focusing on the very familiar Radeon RX 570 and 580. Most of the specs for the RX 570 and RX 580 are exactly the same as last year's RX 470 and RX 480. They're basically the same thing, only slightly more powerful. The RX 580 has had its clock speed upped to 1,257 MHz base and 1,340 MHz boosted over the 480's 1,120/1,266, while the RX 570 tops its predecessor at 1,168/1,244 Mhz to the older card's 926/1,206. Like I said, it's a small but significant improvement. Note that these specs are reference specifications, but AMD isn't releasing reference cards this time around. Instead we've got a slew of board partner offerings available, many of which provide even more of a boost. The Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB card we tested (the RX 580 is also available in 4GB versions) kicks the boost clock up to 1,411 MHz, while the ASUS RX 570 Strix OC card we received boosts to 1,278 MHz. The Sapphire Nitro+ RX 580 is pretty on the bottom, plain on the top and outfitted with striking heat pipes on the inside. Here's a list of RX 570 and 580 partner cards available at launch. AU Editor's Note: All prices have been pulled from StaticICE, using the cheapest price from the largest major retailers (Umart, PC Case Gear, Scorptec, MSY, and so on). You can save a few extra dollars by going to smaller outlets, but this is the base level you can expect to pay. TUL's cards, which also go by the brand name PowerColor, aren't available in Australia, but I've included prices for XFX's range of cards. ASUS $339 for RX 570 STRIX OC 4GB (tested) $299 for RX 570 STRIX 4GB Gigabyte $429 for RX 580 Aorus OC 8GB $389 for RX 580 Aorus 8GB $385 for RX 580 Gigabyte Gaming 8GB $349 for RX 580 Aorus 4GB $339 for RX 580 Gigabyte Gaming 4GB $299 for RX 570 Aorus 4GB $289 for RX 570 Gaming 4GB MSI $409 for RX 580 Gaming 8G $289 for RX 570 ARMOUR 4G Sapphire $459 for RX 580 Nitro+ Limited edition 8GB $419 for RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB (tested) $339 for RX 580 Pulse 4GB $315 for RX 570 Nitro+ 4GB $299 for RX 570 Pulse 4GB XFX $409 for RX 580 GTR-S Black Edition 8GB Crimson $399 for RX 580 GTS Black Edition 8GB $379 RX 580 GTS XXX Edition 8GB It's 2017, and the Asus Strix card is sporting dual DVI ports. This will doubtlessly overjoy someone. Before we get into performance, let me say right off the bat that if you purchased an RX 470 or RX 480 last year, don't feel compelled to trade up to the newer, slightly more powerful models. You've still got a fine card. Save your cash for when the Vega cards come out later this year. AMD's target audience for the Radeon RX 500 series is the reportedly large number of gamers still playing on video cards two years old or older. AMD tells us that audience is more than 500 million strong, some 80 per cent of all PC gamers. The RX 570 is for those looking for a smooth experience on modern games at 1080p. The RX 580 is for those who might be up for pushing towards 1440p. As for the competition, AMD is pitting the RX 580 against NVIDIA $270 Geforce GTX 1060, while the RX 570 has its sights on the GTX 1050 Ti, priced at $185. Performance I took turns swapping the two cards out of my current work system, featuring an Intel Core i7 6700, 16GB of pretty old Corsair DDR4 memory and damn I really need to upgrade my testing PC. I've got a newer system with an AMD Ryzen 1700x and much newer memory, but I decided to stick to the more known quantity for the purposes of benchmarking. Since we already know a lot about how these chips are put together (everybody loves finfet) and in the interest of time, I stuck with the basics. Here come the frames per seconds. If you're looking for absurd numbers, look elsewhere. These are a couple of low to lower-middle range cards with modest goals in mind. Both do an admirable job of handling some of today's tougher games at unreasonably high settings. The Radeon RX 580 hovered around or at the 60 frames per second mark for the more demanding titles, the average dropping below that for Ashes of the Singularity, which is mean, and Metro Last Light Redux, which is always kind of a dick. The RX 570 did its best, keeping its distance from the scores of its more powerful sibling but still putting up a good fight. Richard Leadbetter over at Eurogamer ran a comparison between the newer cards and last year's releases, and the RX 570 performs about the same as last year's RX 480. That's quite a nice bump. The Radeon RX 580 would love to be a card for reliable 4K gaming, but it's probably not going to be that if you stick to ultra settings. Hitman running DirectX 12 managed to break the 60 frames per second barrier here, while the rest hung out in the high 40s, early 50s. Except Metro Last Light Redux. I don't even known why I include it anymore. And look at that Radeon RX 570! If you don't mind 30 frames per second, you'd be hard-pressed to find a card in its price range to handle 4K as well. Final Thoughts That's the key, isn't it? The price range. Before I started swapping in the new Radeon RX 500 series cards, I had a NVIDIA Geforce 1080 Ti in my system, blowing most games out of the water at 4K resolution. But that's a $1000 card. The Radeon RX 580 starts at around $385 for the 8GB version, and it either keeps up with or outperforms NVIDIA's similarly priced GTX 1060 6GB. It's hard to say what's going to happen when AMD starts rolling out its new Vega cards later this year, but that's a worry for another time and likely another price bracket. Things at the lower end of the price pool are heating up as AMD introduces a pair of strong swimmers. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments nightcabbage @nightcabbage May 9, 2017, 12:23pm *yawn* Most boring graphics card release ever? So bad they're not even comparing it with the 400 series, instead comparing it with the 300 series (and even integrated graphics) to make their numbers look better... Let's hope Vega does something interesting... AMD need something in the mid-high+ levels... Their best card only competes with the 1060... Reply 1 PiratePete @piratepete May 9, 2017, 1:51pm This has been really irritating me, It feels like I have been waiting an eternity for AMD to release a high end card and Vega doesn't even look that amazing. I am going to be pretty annoyed if I have waited a year for something with the same performance I could have bought last year. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Neuromorphic Computing Market New Tech Developments and advancements to watch out for 2024 Neuromorphic computing or neuromorphic engineering has been described as the use of large integration systems containing numerous analog circuits allowing the replication of neuro-biological behaviors existing in a human’s nervous system. The neuromorphic computing platform consists of two vital systems based on the custom hardware architecture. Such systems are designed to program neural microcircuits by applying brain-like thought process in cognitive computing and machine learning process. This procedure enables a machine to learn, adapt and function like a human brain does rather than functioning like a normal computer. In addition, to perform such a complex task, the computing platform requires the state-of-the-art circuit technologies and electronic components. For Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/neuromorphic-computing… Which allows the platform to receive new data or knowledge gained from various other sources of neuroscience research, e.g. theoretical neuroscience, brain modelling and experimental neuroscience. The neuromorphic computing systems are programmed as brain inspiring devices, which are capable for low energy and high speed simulations of synaptic plasticity with spiking neural networks. The two neuromorphic computing systems are BrainScaleS system and SpiNNaker system. The BrainScaleS system is purely based on mixed signal and analogue emulations of neuron, synapse of plasticity models with digital connectivity going up to 10,000 times faster than the real time. The SpiNNaker system on the other hand is based on numerical model, which runs in real time on custom digital multicore chips. The simulation and models for this system is provided in Python script, which uses PyNN API. Neuromorphic computing is expected to gain huge momentum in the coming years due to the gaining familiarity of neuromorphic computing technology and rising demand for artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is used as applications in language processing, computer vision and image processing, translation and chatterbots, and non-linear controls and robotics. In addition, increasing application and usage of software in neuromorphic computing is also set to drive the growth of this market. Softwares in neuromorphic computing is used as various applications such as predictive analysis, machine vision, video monitoring, online learning and data modelling among others. There has been an emerging trend of combining embodied models and neuroscience computation for the application of neuromorphic chips in cognitive and brain-based robots. Major companies in the neuromorphic computing market are improving their efforts in their research and development activities and marketing strategies for the commercialization of neuromorphic chips. Such initiatives is expected to help companies penetrate into new areas of market and create awareness for the new technology and products involved supporting the advancement of neuromorphic computing technology. Moreover, the replacement of Von Neumann chips by neuromorphic chips is also expected to bolster the growth of neuromorphic computing industry, exponentially. Neuromorphic chips exhibit qualities such as low power consumption, high speed accuracy and optimum memory usage. However, limited research and development in this market due to huge investment and advanced technologies required, coupled with complexity in the designing and manufacturing of neuromorphic chips are the major factors inhibiting the growth of neuromorphic computing market. The neuromorphic computing market can be categorized into five application segments such as image processing, signal processing, object detection, data processing and others. The signal processing market is expected to show significant growth in the coming years owing to the rising demand for acoustics signal and processing of audio. By end-use, the market can be segregated into five segments such as automotive, consumer electronics, automotive, defense, healthcare and others. The consumer electronics is expected to hold the largest share in terms of end-use application of neuromorphic computing.

Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint Bengaluru: Wipro Ventures’ investments in nine start-ups has allowed parent Wipro Ltd to offer new-age technology solutions in over 60 engagements to some of the firm’s 1,300 customers, highlighting one way in which large IT companies are keeping pace with new technologies. Wipro Ventures was set up by Rishad Premji, Wipro’s chief strategy officer and director on the company’s board, with a $100 million corpus in 2015. Client engagement is one metric which Wipro uses to evaluate the success of investments made by Wipro Ventures, which until now has spent over $25 million in picking minority stakes in nine start-ups across the US, Israel and one in India, according to Premji. “We closed our first investment in June 2015 and we have now done over 60 engagements with clients,” Premji, son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, told Mint on Thursday. “We are on track to invest in 4 to 6 start-ups every year. We have invested in start-ups based in India, Israel and the US across industrial IOT (Internet of things), enterprise chatbots, cybersecurity, big data life-cycle management, business process automation and artificial intelligence.” Increasingly, customers are pushing large IT services firms that work for them to offer solutions and products similar to those offered by smart start-ups. As a result, the large firms have had to expand their offerings—traditionally developing and maintaining applications—to include these. One way companies, both Indian and multinational, do this is by investing in start-ups (and, sometimes, acquiring them). Infosys Ltd and Wipro have set aside $500 million and $100 million, respectively, to invest in start-ups focused on these newer technologies. Both offer start-ups a springboard to take their technologies to the two companies’ Fortune 1,000 clients. “As far as engagements are concerned, we are seeing customer activity across industries and geographies with the underlying theme being automation, improving customer experience and enhancing security. Our teams, in conjunction with our portfolio companies, have done deployments in Australia, Europe, Middle East and the US and we are already seeing repeat engagements in some of our accounts,” said Premji. Wipro Ventures’ $100-million fund is jointly managed by Venu Pemmaraju, formerly a senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and Wipro executive Biplab Adhya. Both Pemmaraju and Adhya are based out of California and report to Rishad Premji. Bets made by Wipro include those in cyber security-focused start-up Vectra Networks and Arizona-based fraud prevention solutions start-up Emailage Corp. Experts said it is encouraging to see Wipro Ventures using client engagement as a metric rather than financial returns. “The main goal of corporate venturing should be strategic benefits, not financial returns. Thus, using new engagements as a metric seems a reasonable one,” said Josh Lerner, professor of investment banking and head of the Entrepreneurial Management unit at Harvard Business School. “Corporate venturing can be a powerful tool for encouraging corporate innovation. But it is not a cure-all. Rather it should be seen as one ‘arrow in the quiver’ that firms can use to respond to a changing competitive environment,” added Lerner. Wipro, which has been working hard at making itself future-ready, has lagged its peers on growth: It reported a 4.9% dollar revenue growth to end with $7.7 billion in revenue for the year ended 31 March, compared to Infosys’s 7.4% growth and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s 6.2% (both companies are larger than Wipro). Nonetheless, Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala has assuaged concerns and stated that Wipro will be back on the growth track by the end of March 2018. In addition to making Wipro tap into the start-up ecosystem, Premji also oversees merger and acquisitions, and over the last two years, the firm has been the most aggressive among Indian IT services firms on this front, having spent $1.14 billion in buying five firms, such as Denmark-based design firm Designit and US-based cloud computing firm Appirio Inc. Infosys, since expanding its venture arm five-fold to $500 million in January 2015, has spent over $60 million and made investments in 13 start-ups and corporate venture funds. Ritika Suri oversees the corporate venture arm. Infosys uses client engagements and the valuation of the start-up in which it has invested as two metrics to evaluate the success of its investments. A company spokesperson declined to share details on the number of client engagements done because of these technologies brought in by these start-ups.

He defeated Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front, a strongly anti-immigrant populist party. Macron, 39, will now become France's youngest head of state since Napoleon Bonaparte. (Adam Taylor,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) PARIS — It was an 11th-hour surprise that seemed to offer final proof of how closely this weekend’s critical French election mirrored the high-stakes American contest last fall. And yet the reaction couldn’t have been more different.  A centrist candidate who embraced globalization was facing off against a populist, anti-immigrant firebrand who spoke warmly of Russia. Terrorism was at the forefront of the discussion. Voter distrust ran high.  And then, minutes before the close of campaigning Friday night, the campaign team of Emmanuel Macron — an independent running under the banner of his brand-new “En Marche!” (Onward!) party — announced that its internal communications had been compromised and scattered across social media.  “Intervening in the last hour of the official campaign, this operation is obviously a democratic destabilization, as has already been seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign,” Macron’s staff said Friday night, minutes before the start of a strict curfew on campaigning, which made further public response off-limits.  The announcement was all too familiar for those who had watched as embarrassing internal communications from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign seeped onto the Internet last summer, much to the delight of her opponent, Donald Trump, who won an upset victory in November. The correspondence, which included discussion of the Democrat’s private email server and the assessment of her own aides that her instincts could be “terrible,” became one of the tools Republicans used to disparage Clinton.  [Clinton blames Russia, FBI chief for 2016 election loss] In France, few people even knew what was in the Macron team's emails. The blanket ban on campaigning meant that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and her National Front couldn’t mention them, though a deputy leader of her party did tweet early Saturday, “Will #Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?” The answer was no. Most media chose to heed a request from the France’s electoral commission not to reproduce the emails’ contents. Le Monde, the major French daily, said in a statement that it had seen part of the documents but would not publish their details before the election, due to the volume of the dump and because the release had “the clear goal of harming the validity of the ballot.”  Voting station volunteers count ballots Sunday, May 7, 2017, in La Penne sur Huveaune, near Marseille, southern France. (AP Photo/Claude Paris) The paper's editor, Jerome Fénoglio, said in an interview that the documents would have been leaked earlier if they had contained damaging information. As it was, he said, “the best hope was to make noise.” He said the response of the media in France carried lessons for journalists elsewhere, including those in the United States who rushed to reproduce pre-election leaks without thoroughly investigating their origins. “Hiding information is not the same thing as refusing to be manipulated by those who diffuse the information,” Fénoglio said. Voters, meanwhile, mostly waved away the news, saying their decision came down to more consequential matters. And they backed Macron by a wide margin, 66 to 34 percent, handing him a decisive victory over Le Pen. “The release is not important to me,” said Michèle Monnery, 74, after casting her vote for Macron in Laon, a small city in the north. “What matters to me is stopping Le Pen.” [Emmanuel Macron's unlikely path to the French presidency] Analysts immediately presumed the intrusion was designed to prop up Le Pen in the final stretch of a bruising campaign that had the power to dictate the future of an integrated Europe. They refrained, initially, from assigning blame for the hack, although experts concluded that its propagation began in the United States with a cluster of Twitter accounts run by members of a far-right movement whose aim is a whites-only state.  Now multiple research firms have linked the hacks to those that compromised the Democratic National Committee last year — links suggesting that Russian intelligence services accused of interfering in the American election may have sought to do the same in France. The finding was made last month, after the first round of voting, by Trend Micro, a Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm that fingered Russian hackers, known variously as Pawn Storm, APT28 and Fancy Bear. Recent analysis by Flashpoint Intel in New York came to the same conclusion, namely that the French hack “appears to be linked to the Russian state-sponsored campaign by APT28.” Supporters of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron celebrate in front of the Pyramid at the Louvre Museum in Paris on May 7, 2017, following the announcement of runoff election results. / AFP PHOTO / PATRICK KOVARIK/AFP/Getty Images Trend Micro, which has been tracking the Russian cyberthreat for years, briefed U.S., French, British and German government officials on a dramatic escalation of the Russians’ hacking campaign in the spring of 2015, said Tom Kellermann, who was the firm’s chief cybersecurity officer until last year.   “The Russians had taken the gloves off,” he said, including by calling on cybercriminals — or what he called “the dons of the cybercriminal community — to act as their Rottweilers.” The campaign was being carried out by hackers working for the GRU, the military spy agency, under numerous monikers. PawnStorm, as Trend Micro calls the group, uses cybercriminals in part to distance its activities from the Russian government. Macron’s campaign said the documents included routine emails and other internal communications interspersed with fake materials. A statement Monday from Mounir Mahjoubi, Macron's digital director, said his campaign had taken numerous cybersecurity precautions, notably by flooding phishing attempts with fake passwords. Mahjoubi said the campaign has faced several attempts each week to access its accounts. The foresight to plant false information represents a savvy strategy on the part of the campaign, cyber-experts said.  “It’s a good practice to do that more and more,” said Alexander Klimburg, an expert on cyberwarfare at The Hague Centre for Security Studies who has been in regular contact with French civil service officers. “For me the question would be more if they were advised by the government to take certain steps.” Here is what you need to know about spear phishing: a targeted attack hackers use to steal your personal information. (Sarah Parnass,Dani Player/The Washington Post) Frederick Douzet, a professor of cybersecurity and geopolitics at Paris 8 University, said the ordeal — addressed highly professionally by Macron’s campaign — did no visible damage to his candidacy.  “If anything, the hack and leak appeared as a desperate maneuver,” she said. Precisely because of the example of the American election, “people are aware that fake news is around, fake documents could be mixed with real documents and that some people are trying to influence the election,” she said. “People are not naive.”  Not just France, but Europe at large, has taken note, said Matthias Wählisch, a computer scientist and expert on Internet technologies at the Free University in Berlin. France knew it was not immune from the sort of attacks that occurred in the United States, he said, and now Germany, which has a consequential election of its own this autumn, is preparing itself, too. Kellermann, the former Trend Micro officer, said he believes that the Obama administration’s response to Russia’s provocations last year was too little, too late — and thus emboldened the Russians to undertake a similar campaign in France. “President Obama should have taken the gloves off ... to block and tackle in networks outside of the United States, and he should have initiated economic sanctions in the summer of 2016,” Kellermann said. If Washington had imposed forceful measures then, “I don’t think the European governments would be dealing with the overt types of influence campaigns that they’re dealing with now.” Nakashima reported from Washington. world worldviews Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, +0.03%  has gained 5.1% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00%  has advanced 6.0% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.03%  has run up 11%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, +1.59% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock rallied 1% Monday to $907.41, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -0.51%  at $29.55. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 4-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +2.72%  market cap of $753.5 billion is more than eight-times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.81%  market cap of $88.8 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which closed Monday at $223.22, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which closed at $143.62, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, +0.65%  to a high of 4.91% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.13%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.63 a share, or about $6.53 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.2 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.27% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.84%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, -1.08% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, -1.14%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to add another raw materials company to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules in place are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -1.06%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, -0.11%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.09% Intel Corp. INTC, -0.76% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.29% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.34% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, +0.07%  had a technology weighting of 14.60% as of April 21, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.02%  had a 19.86% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $166.7 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, +0.03%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.92%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797 through Friday, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 95.0% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 75.3%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. Amazon is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Thursday, after the market closes. If by chance, Amazon says it will split its stock and start paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer. More from MarketWatch Do these 4 things with your finances in your 30s '13 Reasons Why': Sending the Wrong Message?

How IBM wants to bring blockchain from Bitcoin to your data center Blockchain: Overhyped buzzword or real-deal enterprise solution? Video 5 Easy Data Visualizations in R The Linux Foundation announced a new software project under its Hyperledger open consortium aimed at creating a collaboration tool for building blockchain business networks -- or smart contracts -- and their deployment across a distributed ledger. The new project, called Hyperleder Composer, is a modeling language based on JavaScript and with REST API support, that allows non-developers and developers to model their business network. The language also supports modeling of relationships and data validation rules. For example, all blockchain business networks share certain elements, such as assets, participants, identities, transactions, and registries. With existing blockchain or distributed ledger technologies, it can be difficult for organizations to take a blockchain business use case and map the concepts into running code. Similar to public relational databases, blockchain is a public electronic ledger that can be openly shared among disparate users and that creates an unchangeable record of their transactions, each one time-stamped and linked to the previous one. Blockchain ledgers can only be updated by consensus between participants in the system, and when new data is entered, it can never be erased. The blockchain contains a true and verifiable record of each and every transaction ever made in the system. One of the most popular uses of blockchain is for "smart contracts," which allow electronic transactions to self-execute based on preset terms and conditions. Hyperledger, is a global, open source collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. All work done on Composer to date has been done on top of Hyperledger Fabric, a platform for developing applications atop the blockchain distributed ledger. Composer, however, has been designed so that it can be ported to run on other distributed ledger technologies, such as Hyperledger Iroha, a way to incorporate the blockchain distributed ledger into business infrastructure projects, or Hyperledger Sawtooth, a modular blockchain suite. Last year, Intel proposed its version of code for Sawtooth called "Sawtooth Lake," a modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers, which it submitted to the Hyperledger blockchain project. Another current project under Hyperledger is Burrow, a smart contract system built in part to the Ethereum Virtual Machine specification - a block application platform. Hyperledger Composer will offer developers a way to build smart contracts for multiple industries by sharing the components of Iroha, Sawtooth, Burrow or Fabric, according to Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf. For example, the blockchain ledger could enable automated contracts between insurance companies and beneficiaries, Behlendorf said. In such a blockchain smart contract, an insurance company could agree to pay a farmer if drought conditions persist during a season for a set period of time. The contract's blockchain-based software script would then run across multiple server nodes to determine when a drought condition has been met and payment to the beneficiary is in order. "It's a way to automate a lot of potential business processes," Behlendorf said. Another example of a blockchain-enabled smart contract is the electronic documentation or bill of materials for shipping containers as they travel the world on seagoing vessels and railways. The current paper-based system involved in tracking shipments can account for up to half the cost of transport, according to Behlendorf. Maersk Ninety percent of goods in global trade are carried by the ocean shipping industry each year. A new blockchain solution from IBM and Maersk will help manage and track the paper trail of tens of millions of shipping containers across the world by digitizing the supply chain process. "So if you can automate a lot of the documentation processes, you have a chance of cutting many of these costs, which the shipping industry is desperate for," Behlendorf said. For example, IBM and Maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator, recently announced they are piloting a blockchain-based, electronic distributed ledger using Hyperledger Fabric. Smart contracts could also be used to automate the tracking of electronic healthcare records, so that healthcare providers could confirm patient consent each time they want to share the sensitive information between organizations. "There are different implementations of different smart contract systems in each of these four frameworks, but there's the potential [with Composer] to weave these together," Behlendorf said.

Evan Jenkins announced Monday he will challenge Sen. Joe ManchinJoe ManchinOvernight Energy: Clock ticks down on methane rule vote Manchin gets a GOP challenger Manchin hopes White House not 'serious' on cuts to anti-drug office MORE (D-W.Va.) next year. Manchin is seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country, and represents a state easily won by President Trump in last year's election. The former governor is also one of the best-known politicians in his state, however, and he has worked carefully to cultivate an independent image.  That's an image Jenkins will look to attack; on Monday, he argued that Manchin had "changed" since coming to Washington in 2010.  "Joe changed when he got to Washington. West Virginia values? Not anymore," Jenkins says in an announcement vide on his campaign website. Jenkins focuses on Manchin's decision to author compromise legislation in 2013 that would have strengthened background checks on gun sales. That bill, which failed in the Senate, is proof that Manchin won't stand up for the Second Amendment, Jenkins said. "Joe Manchin broke that promise, violating our values and pushing gun control with Barack ObamaBarack ObamaFive takeaways from Yates’s dramatic Senate testimony Overnight Defense: Senate confirms Trump Air Force chief | Yates' dramatic testimony on Flynn | Watchdog sues to get legal basis for Syria strike | F-35s heading to Paris Air Show Overnight Tech: Round two in John Oliver, FCC fight over net neutrality | Sinclair to buy Tribune for .9B | Writers Guild blasts FCC over Colbert | What Macron's win means for tech MORE and the New York liberals," Jenkins says, as footage plays of then-President Obama and others talking about Manchin's work on the bill. Jenkins is a top recruit for the seat, so his entry will help boost Republican hopes that the party can knock off Manchin. Other Republicans are publicly weighing a bid, including fellow Reps.

Republicans are also defending just eight seats overall compared to 25 for Democrats.  Trump won a larger share of the vote in West Virginia than in any state except Wyoming, a fact Jenkins played up.

Twitter Facebook Linux Foundation to develop collaboration tool for building blockchain business networks The open-source project would enable smart contracts to be developed for any number of industries Lucas Mearian (Computerworld (US)) 09 May, 2017 05:38 - - - - print email Comments The Linux Foundation announced a new software project under its Hyperledger open consortium aimed at creating a collaboration tool for building blockchain business networks -- or smart contracts -- and their deployment across a distributed ledger. The new project, called Hyperleder Composer, is a modeling language based on JavaScript and with REST API support, that allows non-developers and developers to model their business network. The language also supports modeling of relationships and data validation rules. For example, all blockchain business networks share certain elements, such as assets, participants, identities, transactions, and registries. With existing blockchain or distributed ledger technologies, it can be difficult for organizations to take a blockchain business use case and map the concepts into running code. Similar to public relational databases, blockchain is a public electronic ledger that can be openly shared among disparate users and that creates an unchangeable record of their transactions, each one time-stamped and linked to the previous one. Blockchain ledgers can only be updated by consensus between participants in the system, and when new data is entered, it can never be erased. The blockchain contains a true and verifiable record of each and every transaction ever made in the system. One of the most popular uses of blockchain is for "smart contracts," which allow electronic transactions to self-execute based on preset terms and conditions. Hyperledger, is a global, open source collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. All work done on Composer to date has been done on top of Hyperledger Fabric, a platform for developing applications atop the blockchain distributed ledger. Composer, however, has been designed so that it can be ported to run on other distributed ledger technologies, such as Hyperledger Iroha, a way to incorporate the blockchain distributed ledger into business infrastructure projects, or Hyperledger Sawtooth, a modular blockchain suite. Last year, Intel proposed its version of code for Sawtooth called "Sawtooth Lake," a modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers, which it submitted to the Hyperledger blockchain project. Another current project under Hyperledger is Burrow, a smart contract system built in part to the Ethereum Virtual Machine specification - a block application platform. Hyperledger Composer will offer developers a way to build smart contracts for multiple industries by sharing the components of Iroha, Sawtooth, Burrow or Fabric, according to Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf. For example, the blockchain ledger could enable automated contracts between insurance companies and beneficiaries, Behlendorf said. In such a blockchain smart contract, an insurance company could agree to pay a farmer if drought conditions persist during a season for a set period of time. The contract's blockchain-based software script would then run across multiple server nodes to determine when a drought condition has been met and payment to the beneficiary is in order. "It's a way to automate a lot of potential business processes," Behlendorft said. Another example of a blockchain-enabled smart contract is the electronic documentation or bill of materials for shipping containers as they travel the world on seagoing vessels and railways. The current paper-based system involved in tracking shipments can account for up to half the cost of transport, according to Behlendorft. Maersk Ninety percent of goods in global trade are carried by the ocean shipping industry each year. A new blockchain solution from IBM and Maersk will help manage and track the paper trail of tens of millions of shipping containers across the world by digitizing the supply chain process. "So if you can automate a lot of the documentation processes, you have a chance of cutting many of these costs, which the shipping industry is desperate for," Behlendorft said. For example, IBM and Maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator, recently announced they are piloting a blockchain-based, electronic distributed ledger using Hyperledger Fabric. Smart contracts could also be used to automate the tracking of electronic healthcare records, so that healthcare providers could confirm patient consent each time they want to share the sensitive information between organizations. "There are different implementations of different smart contract systems in each of these four frameworks, but there's the potential [with Composer] to weave these together," Behnlendorft said. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The senators denounced the administration’s consideration of cutting cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments, which they say "help [insurers] defray the cost of health care insurance for eligible enrollees." ADVERTISEMENT “Despite health insurers, medical providers, and business leaders stating that continuing cost-sharing reduction payments is key to the success of the health insurance Marketplaces and is the 'most critical action' the Administration could take regarding the ACA, the Administration appears to be considering terminating these payments,” the letter said.   The Democratic lawmakers charged the White House with being wishy-washy on CSR payments, using them as a “bargaining chip.”  “The uncertainty being caused by the Administration’s rhetoric is threatening the future of the ACA. Holding the health care of millions of people hostage as a bargaining chip is unacceptable,” they wrote. “We call on the Administration to halt efforts to undermine the law and permanently commit to continuing to make these payments,” they added.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 08, 2017 1:47pm   Comments Share: Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reports first-quarter earnings for fiscal 2018 after the bell on Tuesday, May 9. The company manufactures graphics processor technologies for use in computing, consumer electronics, and mobile devices. Its products are used extensively by computer gamers as well as being increasingly used in the fields of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.  NVDA is expected to report earnings of $0.68 per share, up from $0.46 compared to the same quarter last year, on revenue of $1.9 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Its stock recently hit an all-time high of $120.92 in early February, but dropped to $95.17 in the weeks following its last earnings release. Since then it’s recovered to just below $104 and is up 1.8% year to date. Its performance has been significantly lagging the NASDAQ’s (COMP) 12.3% return so far this year, but it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 (SPX) in 2016. Looking at options activity around NVDA’s earnings release, the market has priced in just over a 8% potential stock move in either direction for the stock, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading leading up to earnings at the May 12 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 105 and 110 strike prices while puts saw heavy activity at the 98 strike. As of Monday morning, the implied volatility is on the higher side at the 70th percentile.    Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Declining PC Business Many chip makers, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), and NVDA have had to adapt their businesses as PC sales decline. PC shipments were down 2.4% year over year to 62.2 million units, according to preliminary data released by Gartner Research. That decline is following a multi-quarter trend of declining PC shipments as more consumers turn to other devices like mobile phones and less consumers purchase traditional computers. Looking to the Future For most tech companies to try to stay viable over the long-run, they need to continually invest in R&D and create new products based on future technological shifts as demand wanes for older ones—like the declining PC business mentioned above. Some of the areas chip makers have been focused on are in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and virtual reality—all of which require a substantial amount of computing power. Investors will find out more when the company reports and, if you haven’t had a chance, make sure to check out what might be expected when The Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) and Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN) report earnings this week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Inspur Will Unveil Its New AI Supercomputer and AIStation at GTC 2017 SAN JOSE, Calif., May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The GPU Technology Conference 2017 (GTC17) will be held from 9 to 11 May, in San Jose, USA. This year's GTC is set in 12 core themes, for example deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), computer and machine vision, etc; setting up 654 small seminars, with 799 guests sharing their knowledge and experience on each of the GPU application field. During GTC 2017, Inspur and NVIDIA and will jointly present a cutting-edge AI supercomputer, AGX-2, with the NVLink™ 2.0 enabled. The AGX-2 is designed to provide maximum throughput for superior application performance for science and engineering computing - taking AI computing to the next level. Inspur, as a Platinum Sponsor, will also present various types of AI application-oriented servers, such as SR-AI Rack, NF5280M5, NX5460M4, and AIStation, a complete AI deep learning cluster management system. Below are the key highlights of the products displayed at Inspur booth (#911): SR-AI Rack – Highest Density of GPU System The SR-AI Rack, jointly launched by Inspur and Baidu at Inspur Partner Forum (IPF) 2017 on April 26, is the world's first rack server that adopts a PCI-e Fabric interconnect architecture design. It breaks the traditional server GPU/CPU coupled architecture through connecting the upward CPU computing/scheduling node to the downward GPU Box using a PCI-E Switch. This allows the independent expansion of CPU's or GPU's, which eliminates the use of redundant parts when performing upgrades from conventional architecture. A single GPU Box in the SR-AI Rack supports up to 16 NVIDIA Tesla GPU cards, providing better expansion capacity than current mainstream GPU servers with 4 cards or 8 cards. The SR-AI Rack can also cascade up to 4 GPU Boxes via the PCI-E Switch for up to 64 GPUs in one daisy chain, for a gigantic compressing computing resource pool. NX5460M4 – Designed for Compute-Intensive and Mission Critical Tasks The NX5460M4 is a high-performance blade server of Inspur I9000; a converged architecture of the blade server series specially optimized for Deep Learning applications, which supports a maximum of 8 Deep Learning computing nodes and 16 GPU accelerator cards in a 12U space, as well as high-density servers, 4- and 8- socket key business servers, software defined storage and multiple computing schemes. This includes heterogeneous computing aimed at providing commercial corporate customers with the Deep Learning infrastructure, featuring high reliability, and high performance. NF5280M5 – Interchangeable High Scalability AI Server Based on the next generation Intel® Xeon® processor microarchitecture, Inspur's new NF5280M5 enterprise rackmount server is ideal for enterprise cloud application, distributed file system server, ERP and small and medium-scale database, virtualization and high end enterprise applications. AIStation - A Complete Cluster Management Software with Tools for Control, Analysis And Productivity The AIStation is a complete AI deep learning cluster management system enabling simple and flexible deep learning, and makes it easy to train and combine popular model types across multiple GPUs and servers.

Finance Search Search WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: May 9 marketsWall Street’s ‘Fear Index’ Has Hit a Two-Decade Low Fortune 500Anti-Pipeline Protestors Shut Down Chase Banks in Seattle JapanIMF Warns Asian Countries to Act Now Before Aging Populations ‘Tax’ Growth Warren Buffett 9 Best Warren Buffett Quotes From the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting Jen Wieczner May 08, 2017 Every year at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, deliver their views and advice on just about any subject their shareholders ask about. The 2017 meeting, which took place in Omaha Saturday, covered topics as diverse as Google and Amazon stock, Wells Fargo, artificial intelligence, the Republican health care bill, and whether Berkshire Hathaway stock will ever pay a dividend. But what is most remarkable about the annual meeting is the way Buffett, 86, and Munger, 93, distill their responses to complex, technical questions into eloquent and pithy nuggets of wisdom that even novice investors can understand. To that end, we've compiled the best Buffett quotes on the hottest topics from the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting 2017. After all, they don't call Buffett the Oracle of Omaha for nothing. On Wells Fargo's Fake Accounts Scandal "At Wells Fargo (wfc) there were three very significant mistakes, but there was one that was worse than all the others ... The main problem was that they didn’t act when they learned about it ... at some point if there's a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. And at that moment, that’s the key to everything, because the CEO has to act. It was a huge, huge, huge error if they were getting, and I'm sure they were getting, some communications and they ignored them or they just sent them back down to somebody down below." On Artificial Intelligence and Self-Driving Cars "I would say that driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to the Burlington Northern. And I would say that if driverless trucks became pervasive, it would only be because they are safer, and that would mean that the overall economic cost of auto-related losses had gone down, and that would drive down the premium income of Geico. So I would say both of those: Autonomous vehicles widespread would hurt us, if they spread to trucks, and they would hurt our auto insurance business." On Coca-Cola and Dieting "I would say I've been eating things I like to eat all my life. And Coca-Cola (ko), this Coca-Cola 12 ounces, I drink about five a day. It has about 1.2 ounces of sugar in it. And if you look at what different people get their sugar and calories from, they get them from all kinds of things. I happen to believe I like to get my calories from this, I enjoy it ... If you told me that I would live one year longer—and I don’t think I would—if I'd live one year longer if I ate only broccoli or asparagus or whatever, or if I eat what I like including Coca-Colas and steak and hash browns, I'd rather eat what I like and enjoy eating what I like than eat something I don't and live another year. "And I do think that choice should be mine. Maybe sugar is harmful and maybe you'd encourage the government to ban sugar ... But I think Coca-Cola has been a very positive factor in the country and the world. And I really don’t want anyone telling me I can’t drink it. I think there’s something in longevity of feeling happy about your life." marketsWall Street’s ‘Fear Index’ Has Hit a Two-Decade Low Charlie MungerCharlie Munger Says He’s a Big Admirer of President Trump’s Position on China warren buffett adviceWarren Buffett Says United Made a ‘Terrible Mistake’ With Dragged Passenger Berkshire HathawayWarren Buffett Bought Apple Because Consumers Don’t Want the ‘Cheapest’ Smart Phone Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Calls GOP’s Health Care Bill a ‘Huge Tax Cut for Guys Like Me’ Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Berkshire Hathaway Stock May Start Paying Dividends Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Artificial Intelligence Will ‘Hurt’ Berkshire Hathaway’s Business Berkshire Hathaway 2017Warren Buffett: Not Buying Google Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Biggest Mistake On IBM and Apple "When I bought IBM (ibm) six years ago, I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has. In terms of IBM and Apple (aapl), I regard them as being quite different businesses ... I was wrong on the first one, and we’ll find out whether I'm right or wrong on the second. But I don’t regard them as apples and apples, and I don't quite regard them as apples and oranges. It's somewhere in between on that." On the Republican Health Care Bill and Taxes "Medical costs are the tapeworm of economic competitiveness. But the tax system is not crippling Berkshire’s competitiveness around the world or anything of the sort. Our health costs have gone up incredibly and will go up a lot more ... And that is a problem that society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with, regardless of which party is in power, or anything of the sort. "In terms of the new act which was passed a couple days ago, vs. the Obama administration [Affordable Care] act, it’s a very interesting thing. All I can tell you is the net effect of that act on one person is that my taxes, my federal income taxes, would have gone down 17% last year if what was proposed went into effect. So it is a huge tax cut for guys like me." On Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos "He has been the CEO almost simultaneously of two businesses starting from scratch. Andy Grove at Intel (intc) used to say if you had a silver bullet and you could shoot it and get rid of one of your competitors who would it be? I think that both in the cloud and in retail, there are a lot of people who would aim the silver bullet at Jeff ... And we missed it entirely. We never owned a share of Amazon (amzn) ... I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen. I admired Jeff, but I did not think he’d succeed on the scale that he has, and I didn’t even think of the possibility that he’d do the things with the cloud services. I never even considered buying Amazon. "If you asked me if while he was building up the retail operation he’d also be doing something that would disrupt the tech industry, that would have been a long shot for me. I really underestimated the brilliance of the execution. It's one thing to dream about, it's another thing to do it ... [Amazon stock] always looked expensive, and I really never thought he would do what he did today. I thought he was really brilliant, but I didn't think he'd be where he is today when I looked at it three, five, eight years ago anyway." On United Airlines and the Industry "We actually are the largest holder of the four largest airlines, and that is much more of an industry call ... We did not buy American Express or United Airlines or Coca-Cola with the idea they would never have problems or never have competition ... And you’ve named a number of factors that just make for a terrible economics. It’s a fiercely competitive industry, the question is whether it's a suicidally competitive industry, which it used to be. I mean, when you get virtually every one of the major carriers and dozens and dozens and dozens of minor carriers going bankrupt, there ought to come a point you find that maybe you're in the wrong industry ... I think it's fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next five or 10 years than the historical rates which caused all of them to go broke. Whether they will do suicidal things in terms of pricing remains to be seen ... It is no cinch that the industry will have some more pricing sensibility in the next 10 years than they had in the last 100 years, but the conditions have improved for that ... But it's not like buying See’s Candies. I like the position. Obviously by buying all four it means it’s very hard to distinguish who will do the best ... There will be low-cost people who come in, the Spirits of the world and JetBlues, whatever it may be, but my guess is that all four of the companies we have will have higher revenues. The question is what their operating ratio is—they will have fewer shares outstanding by a significant margin. So even if they're worth what they're worth today, we could make a fair amount of money. But it is no cinch, by a long shot." On the Future of Berkshire Hathaway "If I died tonight, I think the stock would go up tomorrow." On Layoffs and Partnering with 3G on Kraft Heinz "We don’t enjoy the process at all of getting more productive. Because it’s unpleasant ... It's just not as much fun to be in a business that cuts job as one that adds jobs. So Charlie and I would avoid personally having Berkshire buy businesses where the main benefits are actually having fewer workers. "But I think it’s pro-social to think in terms of improving productivity, and I think the people at 3G do a very good job of that ... When Kraft Heinz (khc) finds whatever amount of business they can do, and they can do it with fewer people, they’re doing what American businesses have done for a couple hundred years and why we live so well. But they do it very fast. They don’t want to have two people doing the job that one could do. I frankly don’t like going through that ... But change is painful. I think it's absolutely essential to America that we become more productive because that is the only way you have more consumption per capita, more productivity per capita." Charlie Munger: "I don’t see anything wrong with increasing productivity. On the other hand, there’s a lot of counterproductive publicity to doing it. Just because you’re right doesn’t mean you should always do it ... It’s terribly unpleasant for the people that have to go through it. And why would we want to get into the business of doing that over and over ourselves? We did it in the past where we had to. I don't see any moral fault in 3G at all, but I do see there is some political reaction that doesn’t do anybody any good."

It leaves the company's upcoming hardware event in Shanghai looking even more mysterious. Microsoft announced the briefing last week, mere days after officially launching its new Surface Laptop. Panos Panay, Microsoft's head of hardware and creator of the Surface, tweeted the event invitations with the hashtag "Surface." The company confirmed to media outlets that new hardware is involved. The obvious device to get an unveiling is the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft's highly-anticipated next-generation convertible to follow the current 18-month-old Pro 4. Originally thought to be launching last month, the tablet's absence at Microsoft's education event makes it a natural fit for the next conference. According to Panay, the fans and analysts have got it wrong though. In an interview with CNET, Panay stated "there's no such thing as a Pro 5," shutting down the rumour mill that's been spinning for several months. Discussing past, present and future Surface products, Panay explained Microsoft's reasons for keeping the aging Pro 4 on sale without a successor being in sight. The company is waiting for the "Pro Next" to have a "meaningful impact," rather than launching it with mere incremental changes. Instead of adding a new processor, tweaking the chassis design and calling it a new product, Microsoft would rather launch significant changes at an extended release cadence. "Meaningful change isn't necessarily a hardware change, which is what a lot of people look for," Panay said to CNET. "They're like, 'Where's the latest processor?' That's not what I'm mean. I'm looking for an experiential change that makes a huge difference in product line." Panay suggested these "experiential changes" could be more physical than what's under the hood. He cited reduced weight and improved battery life as traits that could justify a rebranded device. This compares to the typical annual processor, memory and storage upgrades used by rivals and formerly Microsoft itself. While desired by some, most consumers won't notice the difference. Addressing the increasing age of the Pro 4, Panay said Microsoft is "OK" with the idea that people may no longer buy one. The company is also confident the Surface will be "competitive for five years" though, returning to the idea that adhering to an annual upgrade cycle wouldn't benefit the majority of customers. This doesn't necessarily mean we won't see a new Surface Pro in the near future. Microsoft is reportedly readying new devices incorporating Intel's Kaby Lake processors, alongside other minor changes. However, the updated range won't be rebranded as the "Pro 5," in accordance with Panay's comments. It's thought Microsoft will instead refresh its existing Pro 4 line-up, giving itself more time to work on the far more significant Pro 5. Microsoft's approach to the issue of aging hardware is intriguing as it's fairly unique in the industry. The annual upgrade has become a favourite of tech giants, ensuring they always have an image for selling new products at the expense of reduced development time and less significant year-to-year changes. Microsoft is evidently confident that Surface has sufficient brand appeal to retain its customers for years at a time, allowing it to concentrate on a longer upgrade cycle. Microsoft's Shanghai event is scheduled to take place on May 23rd. The company will "show the world what's next," a claim that now seems to reference a different kind of device altogether. The Surface hashtag indicates something new from the product family will be present on-stage, although it won't be the Pro that's taking the headlines.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Microsoft May 23 Event Is Not About Surface Pro 5 Posted: May 8 2017, 7:40am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   There is no Surface Pro 5, says Panos Panay. Microsoft has announced a hardware event to take place in Shanghai on May 23. One of the rumored products Microsoft could have unveiled at the event is a Surface Pro 5. Panos Panay, corporate vice president for Surface Computing at Microsoft shot down that balloon in a new interview with CNET. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online "There's no such thing as a Pro 5," said Panay. "When it's meaningful and the change is right, we'll put it on market, Meaningful change isn't necessarily a hardware change, which is what a lot of people look for. They're like, 'Where's the latest processor?' That's not what I mean. I'm looking for an experiential change that makes a huge difference in product line," he explains. What will Microsoft unveil on May 23. It will be something in the Surface line-up. Our guess is that Microsoft will just unveil the Surface Pro 4 with new Intel generation chips. Microsoft is not going to Shanghai to unveil something huge like the Surface Phone. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a podcast that the company is working on a phone, but it will be different from how phones look today. This has a similar sentiment as Panay's statement. The mission of Microsoft's Surface hardware line is to innovate and bring a new experience for users that does not exist on the market.  The Surface Phone could be the first smartphone with augmented reality built-in, or some other future user interface functionality. When Microsoft will be ready with the Surface Phone is unclear. It is coming eventually. Microsoft fans should not put too much hope into Microsoft's May 23 event. Nothing big will be unveiled.

DailyCaller The DC Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Outdoors Deals Issues Blogs Send a Tip Columnists Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas           DailyCaller   Search:     Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Outdoors Deals Daily Dealer Wine Club Issues Defense Education Energy Blogs The Mirror DC Trawler Send a Tip US Watchdog Sues For Sally Yates’ DOJ Emails Chuck Ross Reporter 10:11 AM 05/08/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Judicial Watch is suing the Justice Department for copies of former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates’ emails from her brief tenure. The conservative watchdog group filed the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit on Friday, Politico reported. It is seeking Yates’ emails from between Jan. 20 and Jan. 31, the day after President Trump fired her for refusing to comply with his travel ban executive order. Yates, who was appointed to office by President Obama in 2015, will testify later Monday about a separate matter involving Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Yates is expected to tell a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that she warned White House counsel Donald McGahn that Flynn had given misleading answers about phone calls he had in December with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. She reportedly told McGahn that Flynn’s false version of events made him open to blackmail from the Russians. The White House has claimed that rather than giving a full-throated warning about Flynn, Yates’ merely raised the issue to the administration’s attention. Early Monday, President Trump fired off tweets asserting that Yates may have illegally leaked classified information about Flynn’s calls with Kislyak. (RELATED: Trump Implies Sally Yates Leaked Classified Information) President Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13. The official reason given by the White House was Flynn’s misleading statements to Vice President Mike Pence, though White House press secretary Sean Spicer also referred to a “serious number” of other issues. There has already been an indication that Yates’ email records will contain little information about Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration. The Daily Caller filed a Freedom of Information Act request in February for all emails Yates sent or received regarding Flynn between last November and the date of her ouster. A DOJ official who reviewed the responsive records with TheDC in March said that Yates’ inbox contained dozens of emails referring to Flynn, but all but one was a daily update of news articles where Flynn was mentioned. One email sent to Yates on Jan. 27 discussed a separate Flynn controversy, that of his lobbying last year on behalf of the Turkish government. Yates was sent a spreadsheet of pending high-profile agency issues which laid out the DOJ’s interactions with Flynn regarding the lobbying. In August, Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, signed a $600,000 contract with a Dutch shell company operated by a Turkish businessman linked to the government. Flynn disclosed the contract to Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, though his firm claimed to have received less than $5,000 in payments. In March, Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent of Turkey. (RELATED: Here’s What Prompted Michael Flynn To Register As An Agent Of Turkey) The Jan. 27 memo to Yates shows that the Justice Department’s National Security Division contacted Flynn about the lobbying on Nov. 30, nearly two weeks after Trump named him national security adviser. The memo referred to a Nov. 8 op-ed Flynn wrote that was seen as favorable to Turkey. “In light of that editorial and reports in the media about potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey, on Nov. 30, NSD requested additional information from Lt. Gen. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc.,” the spreadsheet reads. (RELATED: Flynn Is Lobbying For Obscure Dutch Company With Ties To Turkish Government) The documents says that Flynn’s lawyers told the Justice Department on Jan. 11 that he likely would be registering as a foreign agent. Sources close to Flynn told TheDC that the White House was informed before and after the inauguration that Flynn would likely be registering as a foreign agent of Turkey. It is unclear whether Yates was involved in the Flynn-Turkey case.

Besides a universally accepted role in philanthropic work of corporations, CSR projects are today achieving greater sustainability in their efforts resulting in growth and change in communities. This evolution has been possible due to the collaboration of corporations with the development sector, especially none governmental organisations (NGOs). Report shows that from the past five decades, the western world has been looking at several dimensions of CSR; legal, ethical as well as discretionary. But in Nigeria, It is only in recent years that dedicated CSR departments and staff have appeared in companies. These trained professionals are designing effective community oriented projects which are transforming communities albeit, in a small focused manner. While it is still contested whether corporations should have social responsibilities beyond a wealth generating function, the world is increasingly seeing corporations fulfilling broader social goals. These have been happening within business firms with initiatives like changing methods of production to reduce environmental impacts, changing employee relations both within the firm and across the firms’ supply chains. The initiatives outside the firm include making infrastructural investments in local communities or as more widely seen in philanthropic community initiatives. Checks reveal that, earlier corporations found it difficult to understand the consequences of social and economic goals. Social goals were directed towards stakeholders and economic goals towards shareholders. It soon emerged that the development of the both these groups needed to be directly proportional and this led entrepreneurs to believe that profit making need not be the only corporate goal. As a result, companies started practicing social responsibility activities on a voluntary basis to attain various results such as building strong company – stakeholder relationship, motivating employees to enhance production, influencing the community for development and reducing the threat to environment. Companies also have a history of adapting the approaches advocated in professional social work. This has resulted in good employee engagement practices besides the engagement of other stakeholders the deprived communities. Speaking to the Daily Times on this issue, a brand management consultant, Bernard Okhakume said, “community development is based on the principles of fairness, equality, accountability, opportunity, choice, participation, mutuality, reciprocity and continuous learning with core emphasis on educating, enabling and empowering community members. True development is facilitated when citizens from all strata of society engage together with a sense of community solidarity through combined processes, programs, strategies, and activities.” While speaking on individuals or groups that could be potential partners for community development through CSR, he said; “the external organizations which can be potential partners for Corporate Citizenship include government and non-government organizations, corporations such as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinational corporations. The emphasis should be on instilling creativity and self-reliance in the community for short and long term goals taking forward Community development as an educational as well as an organizational process.” According to him, “CSR is in line with United Nations’ ‘Global Compact’ initiative which is the largest corporate citizenship and sustainability endeavor with 4700 corporate participants and stakeholders from 130 countries for promoting human right corporate sustainability. Through this initiative, CSR aims to build markets, combat corruption, safe-guard environment and ensure social inclusion through partnerships among business, government, civil society, labour and United Nations. This ever-increasing understanding is reflected in the growth of the community development seen in Nigeria” Speaking on participation and collaboration, he pointed out that, “CSR has an important role in strengthening close link of collaboration, participation and co-operation between corporations and community. For example, Shell Foundation in the Flower Valley and Marks and Spencer in Africa gave aid to underprivileged communities through CSR projects. Malaysian reality show ‘Bersamamu’ of TV3 is sponsored by Syarikat Faiza Sendirian Berhad (SFSB), which is local enterprise-cum-philanthropist who responded to government’s appeal to help impoverished community to improve their livelihoods through help from the local media for publicity and audience support. This show focusses on the life of poverty and every purchase of Faiza’s Product, entitles the buyer to make a donation to Tabung Bersamamu TV3. This is a novel endeavor which may inspire other corporations to help the nation in its effort of alleviating poverty leading to development of community. “Technology corporations can benefit community and support business objectives through their CSR laden technical expertise by facilitating data collection for public organizations. Ex. Intel and IBM in U.S. assisted under-staffed police departments by collecting and processing information of regions with high crime rate.” He added. He also stated that, “through CSR, organizations evolve a corporate sustainability framework based on a set of economic, social and environmental objectives which are progressive. For developed a methodology to assess the employee perspective on sustainable business practices (SBP) which throws light on a corporation’s commitment to be ethically responsible for contributing improving the quality of life of all its stakeholders thus yielding to economic development.” Also speaking, the national secretary of the committee of the defence of human rights (CDHR) comrade Deji Adebowale said; “one of the things that has been responsible for our backwardness in Nigeria is bad government and high level of corruption. We intuitively think of corruption as sand in the wheels of prosperity. This is surely true. Corruption reduces the incentive for a small entrepreneur or a big firm to invest. This robs us of the industry I said was so important, and with it jobs and growth. In many ways, corruption is like a tax on business, one that seldom finds its way into providing public goods.” The government must ensure there is enabling environment for businesses to succeed. Because it is only when businesses succeed that business owners will start thinking of giving back to the society without looking back.

Exclusive: Google is planning a 'Pixel 3' laptop running the 'Andromeda' OS for release in Q3 2017 David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/09/26 7:02am PDTSep 26, 2016 358 Plus 1 on G+ 1116 Share on Facebook 412 Share on Twitter Total Shares1886 Exclusives Google Leaks News Rumors Two independent and reliable sources have confirmed to us that Google is planning a new Pixel laptop to be released in Q3 2017. The project, known internally as 'Bison' and by the informal nickname 'Pixel 3,' will likely be the first brand-new device to showcase Google's combined Android / Chrome OS 'Andromeda' operating system in a laptop form factor. Bison, then, would be the culmination of years of work by Google's Pixel team and Google's Android and Chrome OS teams. We are extremely confident Google plans for the device to run Andromeda. We are also confident that Andromeda is a completely distinct effort from Google's current campaign to bring Android apps to Chromebooks, and that Bison would not be marketed as a Chromebook. Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. As such, it would be more accurate to say Bison will run Android than Chrome OS, and could finally be Google's internal commitment to releasing Andromeda. (This lines up with the narrative The Wall Street Journal presented in its exclusive about the merge effort last year, in which laptops were specifically singled out as the merged OS's first big target.) But before we get into details, let's discuss our confidence in this rumor. Unfortunately, this one is tricky. We are unable to share any primary source materials, including renders of any hardware. We also believe Bison's specifications, while we will provide them, are very much subject to change. Given it's a year or more from its planned release, Bison could evolve substantially or even be cancelled - so we want to be absolutely clear when we say that specifications are not set in stone. Let alone Bison's release being a certainty, especially if Andromeda runs into delays or the OS project sees a change of direction. But we're going to share what we can today, because it's just too interesting not to. And despite all of our asterisking in regard to future uncertainty, we are exceptionally confident that the information and sources we're working from are legitimate and trustworthy. As such, we're not assigning a number to this one - it's just not a good fit for that system. So, let's dive in. Bison is planned as an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3" display, but Google also wants it to support a "tablet" mode. It's unclear to us if this means Bison will be a Lenovo Yoga-style convertible device, or a detachable like Microsoft's Surface Book, but I'm personally leaning on the former given how thin it is. Powering it will be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM. This seems to suggest there will be two models. It will also feature a fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm jack (!), a host of sensors, stylus support (a Wacom pen will be sold separately), stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that will last around 10 hours. The keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic and force detection similar to the MacBook. Google plans to fit all of this in a form factor under 10mm in thickness, notably thinner than the aforementioned Apple ultraportable. Given the MSRPs of past Pixel laptops, you might expect this is shaping up to be one costly little device, and while not cheap, Google's planned pricing is still competitive: Bison is pegged to start at $799. As I said, the Wacom stylus would be sold separately, and Google is aiming for a retail launch in Q3 2017. And by the time Bison launches, Google wants to be ready to showcase Andromeda running a variety of enterprise, developer, and stylus-driven apps on the device - a way to argue that Bison and Andromeda will create a laptop experience that is truly attempting to rival Apple and Microsoft. So, if you were wondering why there wasn't a fresh Chromebook Pixel for 2016 (and we have no reason to think one is coming on October 4th), this is probably the reason. Chromebook Pixels may well be dead as of next year - Andromeda is the way forward. What do Bison and Andromeda mean for Android, and for Android phones and tablets? Well, right now: probably not much. Google will announce its Pixel smartphones on October 4th, and they will be running Android 7.1. Google may well tease Andromeda at this event. But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day, even if an Andromeda demo manages to steal the show. Here in 2016, Google is attempting to paint a vision of a united hardware front inside the company - to legitimize the idea that Google can build consumer hardware products to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung (at least hypothetically). Andromeda will still be off on the horizon, but there's no doubt it's a huge piece of Google's long-term strategy puzzle. But this same time next year? I think it's likely we'll see Google show us the first laptop with the power of Android and the best of Chrome OS, a truly watershed moment for Android and Google. Whether the resultant operating system, even if it is largely powered by Android underneath, will still be called Android isn't something I could hope to guess at. Maybe Google doesn't even know. But as to what it means for Chromebooks? I think the Journal had it dead on a year ago: Chrome OS and Chromebooks (perhaps with a new name) will continue, but Android with Chrome OS features baked-in, aka Andromeda, is the new hotness, and will mark a major shift in Google's OS strategy. All I can say is I really hope we get a taste of what that future looks like next week.

What i do understand that Google aims to give people with android phones the ability to Use Continuity the same way Apple does with their devices. The question is, can Google compete with true OS computer with their price tag? Aaron Given how rotten the Windows store is, I'd say it's chances are good. I have a Windows 10 convertible now and should have just saved my money. nirmitlamed I think that we should first look at the price tag. Right now Chrombook Pixel cost 1299$. With that kind of price tag most people would choose Macbook air which start at 899$ price tag and it has better OS and good support. You can even go with 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display at the same price tag (1299$). Now If we talk about PC laptops it has even more variety. For my opinion if the price tag remains high don't see how people will prefer Android+ChromeOS over true OS like Apple OS and Windows. Greyhame Their plans are to demo it with enterprise software. In other words, in their minds, it would be a "true OS". Aaron With a starting price at $799, I would give it a shot. What it can do as a productivity device is yet to be seen, of course, but even before being properly announced it's already better than Windows 10 as a 2 in 1. And iPad Pro is just iOS blown up to tablet size, which I only mention because there are no 2 in 1 MacBook options. Tl;dr If done right Andromeda could be big. It won't overthrow Windows or MacOS, but it could take a nice piece of the pie. deppman Just curious, how do you define a "true OS"? Is it one that allows complete control of your hardware? Too bad OSX, Windows, OS2, and virtually every OS ever released doesn't make the cut. Is installed user base important and number of applications? If they are, then Android far outpaces all other OS's on both fronts. Maybe its the ability to recompile the kernel and write optimized device drivers? Whoops, none of these commercial OS's allow that. Maybe its the fact that "real" OS's don't try to lock you into an ecosystem? Except, of course, Apple and MS are definitely guilty of that with iOS, OSX, Windows 10, and Windows phone. Maybe a "real OS" doesn't phone home and send keystrokes back to company servers? Oh whoops, there's Windows 10 again. According to these criteria the only "true OS's" available are various *nix distributions. So what precisely IS the criteria for a "real OS" that you are referring to? shadowx360 Not of that matters for the consumer and business that wants to get work done. I think he means a versatile OS that can run on at least laptops, desktops, and maybe servers with full featured third party software support. Basically macOS, not iOS. Something you can run a full version of Word and Photoshop on, something you can take to work and do everything you can do on a Windows or macOS machine. I can see Andromeda only really succeeding if it gets third party support or finds a way to run full featured Windows or Linux apps. Otherwise it's just the equivalent of a glorified iPad Pro. nirmitlamed You already knows what i mean you just stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. What i mean about "True OS" is the ability to do the most simple tasks and in the same time to have the ability to do a more complicity tasks for power users. I am sure you can figure out yourself what is the difference between Android+Chrome OS and Windows or Mac OS. deppman My point is there really isn't much of a difference between Android+ChromeOS vs. W10 or OSX. And what little difference exists is being systematically removed by Apple and MS respectively. They're all OSs locked into curated ecosystems. At the same time, Android and Chrome, both being OSS, have a vibrant community that allow Android to do many things that OSX and Windows can't, even without rooting or stepping outside of the Google store. My Pixel C, for example, is in many ways more capable than a MacBook Air. What you haven't figure that out for yourself yet is that your criteria for what constitutes a "real" OS are nebulous, quaint, and out of date. nirmitlamed First of all i would very love to hear about what you can do better with your Pixel C that you can't do on MacBook Air for example. About the criteria "real" OS, again don't be stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. I don't, so neither should you. For my opinion Chromebooks are for specific kind group of people and not for everyone. There are a lot of apps missing that were built over the years in Windows and MacOS from video player to editing to games and download managing and so on. Android OS is great but please don't compare its apps ecosystem to Windows and MacOS apps. Every company that has its app on different OS, build its android app to match the main idea how would one use its app on the way in the palm of their hand. There is a different between sitting on a chair in-front a computer than using your small mobile devices on the couch, bathroom and on the way. That is one of the reasons why you won't find all the same features in every OS. Surely what google is planing to its computer line is very interesting but could it really compete with Windows and Mac? i doubt that. Since you own a ChromBook computer i would love to hear your thoughts on that. Can ChromeOS do every task Windows and MacOS can? Mayur Gondhalekar I agree with you that Chrome OS is a limited OS with a specific usecase. I own a chromebook since 2 years and its my go to device for simple tasks like websurfing or streaming and even light stuff like creating word documents or excel etc. (Google docs works with conversion to MS word or excel in the end). Where it trumps Windows is its always on nature and simplicity. I never have to deal with slow moving OS or a update pop up every now and then. Especially on some new budget Win PCs you have only 32GB storage and that Win 10 update keeps killing these devices. Now if with a new OS designed for laptops, Google can create the experience of MAC then it can surely ba a hit. I dont ever see windows as competition when it comes to performance. But in terms of app availibilty, it would have to match Windows and Mac. But if it does then who knows...Honestly for stuff like playing videos or music etc most people are moving to streaming services where you do not really need native apps. What remains is work related apps and media editing apps. Skunky As you said, chromebooks are designed for certain people, or maybe even as a secondary "grab and go" computer for Mac or Windows users. the main people that will use chrome os are perhaps students (depending on what their needs are), older people who need something simplistic, people who just want to type documents, browse the web, play web based games (and future android games), facebook video chat (and use other messengers when android apps become available), photo editing (there are some pretty nice photo editors in the web store, and soon to be with android), for people who don't need all of the extras that Windows or Mac comes with. I don't know why some people have to be 1 sided, why can't people learn to evolve and find ways to use a new OS without bashing it- challenge yourself to do what you normally do on your Mac or Windows 'but on a different platform' in an alternative way. (i've learnt how to do some neat things on my chromebook and with computers in general that i wouldn't have learnt if i would have just stuck with Windows and hadn't challenged myself). VAVAMk_2 We can define what a real desktop OS isn't at least: iOS Keith Earns I second this. Criticizing google for not licensing windows or mac OS on their new laptop is ridiculous. They have an OS based off a linux kernel, linux I would classify as a "TRUE OS". Chromebook linux support has been decent, I have no reason to believe the new pixel would not support linux, and for that price it pouts some nice hardware. "Productivity" arguments are still being made? Docs/sheets/slides is really comparable to office, and if you're an editor you're probably using WP anyway so whats the problem? Glaiket Anne Clyde The burning question as to what constitutes a True OS is a subject fraught with perplexity and often extremely difficult to discern. At present my thoughts on this often controversial subject are mine and mine alone, however, for the sake of whatever i offer the following. Take any clean OS then inject with say that old favorite of theirs the sasser virus, disinfect to a certain degree, then lay back and listen to the sound it makes as it crashes through a neighbors sunroof from your penthouse geek caves. Smoke a fag, tweek ,twerk eat repeat. In no time at all you will be listening to the pitter patter of tiny zx81's romping all over your once blissfull lives. Dale Upton Wow, he meant like a laptop dude not a tablet, somthing robust enough to compete with mac os and windows, I can help you off that high horse is you like? Comment_Cop None of these things define an OS but yeah I get it, you want more control. So do I when it comes to Windows. Drew Ciccotelli I remember when people didn't pay less than 2000 for a new MacBook Pro. Drew Ciccotelli Why anyone has a Windows 10 machine now is beyond me. I'm on an XP at work and it's running the Chrome browser like a champ. Aaron I wanted a 2-in-1 so I would only have to carry one device when I travel, as opposed to a laptop and tablet, and I still needed Windows' software compatibility. Money not well spent. I would have been happier with two devices. I wanted to give 10 a chance, and 10 has been a headache. Drew Ciccotelli 10 is just them wanting to be Google but still having that Mircosoft pay to play bug up their ass. Drew Ciccotelli It's too ad heavy and Internet reliant. James Briano Oh, c'mon. We all know you're typing on one right now. Chris Why? What will this do that a surface can't? Run some android games? Nicholas Conrad Surface Pro 3 (i5) was such a disappointment it's what convinced me to try a Chromebook in the first place. Chris That's funny I went the opposite direction. I loved my chromebook but it hit a wall in usability so I switched to surface and it's been amazing. Charlie I almost can't think of any reason I'd prefer a Chromebook over a tablet with a very good add-on keyboard/sleeve/case/stand with a Bluetooth keyboard (and mouse). Except for price? Because there are some extremely cheap Chrome books out there. Drew Ciccotelli You mean a Pixel C then. Charlie For $499, it ain't bad. But I still feel like it won't be beating Android when it comes to apps and versatility. But I do like the design, yes. That hardware plus Android, I'd be willing to at least test that out for a couple of months. Definitely. Nicholas Conrad It was too big and heavy to use as a tablet for any length of time, and the type-cover kickstand combination made it precarious at best as a laptop substitute. The type-cover itself was a pretty terrible typing experience, and the offset trackpad, while probably comfortable for right-handers, was incredibly cramped and awkward to use as a left-hander. The SP4 type cover improved in those areas somewhat. Windows 10 has gotten a lot better over time, but at launch there were several driver issues with it that were super frustrating being MS hardware. Not least of which was it would often go completely dark when removed from the dock, requiring a hard reset to wake again. With no status LEDs, even performing a reset on it was oddly difficult and frustrating. The only thing that was genuinely awesome about it was the pen, but that only ever really worked in onenote. And all of that comming in at several hundred dollars more than an equivalently speced mac, which I used to mock for being so overpriced.... Yeah, I bought a $200 redurb Dell Chromebook, and have been much happier with a real keyboard and which I can actually use on my lap. I gave the surface back to work and just used the Chromebook instead. It works as well as, or better than Windows for 95% of everything I need to do. Occasionally I run into CrOS limitations, but I have an old Windows box I can boot up when needed. Drew Ciccotelli What did the Chromebook cost and how much was the Surface? Charlie How about just run Android in general. With the ease of use and versatility of all that Android has to offer: not only things like the Play Store support with all it's apps but maybe also more manufacturers willing to take the plunge and invest and make these type of devices? And how about price? Some people are also just done with Windows. And all it's iterations/versions. I'm one of them. I'll go with Android (Remix OS for instance) and Ubuntu any day over WIndows 10. But that's a matter of taste, even so, still means I'd prefer Andromeda over Windows 10. Chris You're sick of all the different versions and you're going to android...not the best choice. I don't see myself being able to use android for work in the foreseeable future. I used a chromebook for 75% of my master's degree until it just literally was not possible to use anymore and I got a cheap SP3 and man that thing is just amazing. Charlie But... Things might be looking a bit different in a year, when this comes out? Which is why they might be developing it? Plus, it depends on what your needs are. I have a work PC at work. Which will either be Windows or macOS. I know some companies that have been trying Ubuntu though. It depends on what type of job you have, if Windows is really necessary. But for personal use. I think I could get by fine on Android. Chris For sure android will do everything for personal use for me also. I dunno. We've been told so many times the updates would get better I've given up. Remember the update alliance? hahaha Charlie That's true. But Pixel does indicate Nexus, which means with this specific device... You might be alright. Plus Google could try and pull an Android Wear/Auto on us... Hardware (with minimum requirements) left up to device manufacturers, but software updates are handled by (mostly) Google. juanjeremy2012 why not just a plain laptop Deckard_Cain Just wish they would also include a dedicated GPU. :( AMD's open-source drivers for Linux are even in great shape. xsilas43 AMD does not develop for the mobile platform, so for the laptop maybe but not in the width they are going for. Dan Gul Zen platform might change that. We might see AMD in these in the second iteration of these machines. Who knows. Depends on how well AMD executes on Zen. Kian Ronald Grey LOL Thats a joke. Jay T Intel's iGPU's are now pretty fast and efficient. My current laptop has an i5-6200U with a HD520 GPU, and it can play fairly intense games at 1080p without breaking a sweat. Also, when not doing anything intense I get 6-10 hours of battery life. techfreak243 it's never outdated. PVL_93_RU It's too good to be outdated Evan Nope!

No I haven't read the Article yet, but I want it! aliablow It's been a while since Google managed to spark genuine interest and anticipation. But this... What a time to be alive, indeed! So much hype for the 4th! Ash At this rate, I'm convinced Google is going to stop sending you invites to press events if you keep leaking their major plans like this. Rita El Khoury That's one option. The other is that Google secretly hates to love AP or loves to hate it. John Doe It is not the AP, the problem is with Google. The WSJ already leaked this a while back so Google needs to control their employees. Bewear I know this might sound pointless, but I hope you can install the OS of your preference on it. John Doe Will Andromeda be the next version of Android? Meaning, will the Pixel phones and other devices will be upgraded to it and have all the devices under one OS or like Apple (macOS, OSx, etc.)? aliablow If Android becomes Andromeda, I can only imagine the level of fragmentation. Perhaps Google found a way to tackle that issue once and for all with seamless updates similar to Chromebooks. One can only hope. Just_Some_Nobody Google needs to drop the Java runtime and go with something else. This might be a good time to do it. They could keep the old java runtime as a backwards compat. layer, but kill it for all new development. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I'm just wondering when you guys are going to rename to Andromeda Police. Todd At least they won't need to change the AP logo. L3Chiffre Domain name "andromedapolice.com" was registered yesterday... devilfriend lol seriously though, I wonder how many XDA-Developers users know what an XDA is. PVL_93_RU Well it derived from PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) so I guess the XDA has a same meaning? JL Maybe Andromeda is Android 8. Leonard Wong Getting poor @ 2017 Rita El Khoury You're waiting until 2017 to get poor? I'm getting poorer way before. SimonSaid 8 days, to be precise. bdbplatano That seems like forever away, can't wait. 😬 SimonSaid Does AP have any idea whether this is solely a laptop OS or whether it is ultimately destined for phones and tablets too? David Ruddock It's hard to know without having a much more detailed understanding of Google's vision, and we just don't. If I were to speculate, I'd say that there'd be a single OS Google will push commercially (maybe still called Android), and that certain devices like laptops and large tablets would be able to use certain features that would particularly benefit their form factor (like Chrome OS's windowed operation). Even if it this stuff would be baked into every Android device, some of it would only be exposed for certain hardware / interfaces. This could also allow for Continuum style functionality a la Windows 10, where your phone could "project" a desktop operating environment. But again: that is complete speculation. I doubt even Google fully understands where they want to go with this yet. SimonSaid Thanks, David. I suppose what everyone wants to know is whether this will finally solve Android's 'Update Problem'. Hopefully we'll soon learn enough about Andromeda's architecture to answer this question. All aboard the hype train! Alex I personally hope the codename Andromeda lives on to production. Such a cool name. Roger Siegenthaler And that google doesn't know yet is scary, MS knew over 10 years ago when they started minwin and dropped development of CE that they wanted to get one OS/Kernel on all devices and it still took them so long and numerous restarts to get there. Now how many restarts and how long does it take a company without a plan now to achieve this. David Ruddock I'm not a developer or engineer (obviously), but I think the smartphones of today are a lot more like laptops than the smartphones (and proto-smartphones) of 10 years ago. Microsoft was trying to solve a much harder problem there - bringing an ancient OS never designed for mobile to mobile. Android already does x86 and ARM, and it uses the Linux kernel. I don't think there's much to stop Android from running on a laptop (hell, Android laptops, crappy ones, exist), so much as there hasn't been a good reason to run it on a laptop. I don't really think the projects are comparable - Google's is much more a question of "why" than "how." Roger Siegenthaler That's assuming Linux is really capable of what NT is now, which I have serious doubts about considering google's public dumping of linux for embedded/IoT tech and is trying to replace it with fuchsia on every platform. I have the feeling if the world's largest user of a kernel says (paraphrased) "this kernel does not scale well" you're going to believe them and not just say that linux can do so with no problems. It's definetely easier for google then for MS but not so much that the engineering part is "easy" Syukri Lajin that is why google work on more than 1 projects at the same time :P no actual direction, just see which work the best, kill the others, start new projects with slightly different objective, and repeat. Justin W So, Honeycomb vs. Gingerbread. Got it. On a serious note, I'd love some continuity features. Google seems to be going in the wrong direction with that when it comes to their messaging app (Allo), but I'm hoping they're truly working to better that and the overall continuity features in Android. Defenestratus RIP Android? demarcmj Probably just those RIP to those Android quasi-laptop, tablet-with-keyboard things that like 10 people ever bought anyway. Defenestratus Yeah I'm a kickstarter backer of the superbook which has real appeal for me. Not so sure anymore. philosopher_Mk More like RIP Chrome os, this is Android for laptops. Suicide_Note Maybe. Just maybe. bdbplatano I wonder how this all fits in (if at all) with fuchsia ConCal RIP Jide Carson Saldanha Lol yep 😂 Google coming directly at Remix OS. Tho Remix works on Windows/Mac PCs so... Stephen Sharp I mean, after all, Google Drive killed Box, Google+ killed Facebook, Google Docs killed Office Quite frankly, Google has a history of killing nothing except its own products XD Ace killed all but fb AJE Google Doc did not kill Office. Office is still the king especially in business. jesuguru He forgot the /s ConCal I mean those are a bit different. Jide isn't Microsoft or Facebook. Jide just got off the ground this year. No way can you say Jide is the Facebook or Microsoft of their space. Carson Saldanha Hell no Justin W Probably no. bugdroid Nope. Good_Ole_Pinocchio This shall now be called - "MAJOR BISON" http://www.sumthing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SF13.png person Likely what the name is referring to in the first place :P Good_Ole_Pinocchio No no no... Don't take my credit away! I coined the term... Now i shall collect my 10 cents for every mention. PVL_93_RU It's Master, not Major Qbancelli I have a hard time getting excited about something that won't launch for at least a year. bort118 I don't!! AHHHH!! bdbplatano Especially when dealing with Google thartist Maybe not everything is about GETTING EXCITED. But yeah, it might be that far because Andromeda needs some time yet to reach 1.0 Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is going to be amazing!!!! Dmitriy Romanov These leaks are going really out of hand. There is no surprises anymore just because someone from google leaks all shit to AP. Nayners People want leaks, then don't want leaks. Your comment type gets old. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You do realize that AP is in the business of providing news/leaks? And news they have brought. Thanks, AP! aliablow Actually for me, these leaks actually pique interest cause a lot of the details are unknown. Think of these as a teaser or a trailer for a movie. Dmitriy Romanov Yeah. Nowadays movie trailers can tell everything about movie and even main plot. Thats what AP is doing with these exclusives Jarrett Lennon Kaufman How awful of them to dare release news that, if they didn't, someone else would. Awful of them to do their jobs. Dan It will then be discontinued in Q1 2018 when Google pivots to a new strategy of running [insert new software here] on [insert new device here]. Such is the experience of those who buy Google's consumer devices thinking, "No, really, this time Google is really committed to this product line!" Defenestratus Yes. So much this. PerhapsNever But, there are actually quite a few of their products that they are still supporting (and enhancing)... Chromecast, for instance. Nope.jpeg What did the Chromebook say to the Pixel 3? "Bison." Cod3rror I have to agree. One thing that Apple has that neither Google nor Microsoft (new MS) has is that Apple comes up with a long term plan and sticks to it and so far their long term visions setup by Steve Jobs have been on point. With Google everything is in beta. And with Microsoft, it's always "wait for the next version, that one will be great!". Sk0ly The one thing Apple has is users that will literally buy any piece of crap they roll into their apple store showcase. Cod3rror What a foolish thing to say. Whether you like to admit or stick your hand in the sand and deny, is that Apple makes very good products. iPhone is still the gold standard for quality. The same with Mac, the same with Macbook, iPad (Android tablets. Remember them?), watch (remember the beta version Android watches?). Sk0ly Apple makes good quality devices overall, I won't deny that but I wouldn't call them a "gold standard" at this point. They have had issues related to quality on the last three iPhones. Bendgate where your phone bends under normal use, antennagate where you are "holding it wrong". And yes, I think the use of gate in every issue is dumb. I actually disagree that the Apple watch is a superior product. The OS is really terribly thought out and yet it is the best selling. Why? Because it is Apple. Bottom line, Apple users will buy whatever Apple tells them to. That is a general statement but rings very true. The company was so arrogant that they thought they could sell a $15,000 Apple Watch. On the software front, it is a really bad situation. Apple Maps is absolute garbage (although it has improved) and Apple Music is still a way crappier service with Apps that aren't on par with Spotify or Google Music. The point I was making is that they force people to buy products, adaptors, accessories to stay within their ecosystem. They preach sustainability but use proprietary connectors and force people to buy overpriced adapters that add to e-waste globally. The Macbook is a nice piece of hardware but I'm sorry, OSX is not as good of an OS as Windows. It seems to have cornered a niche in design and editing but anyone who knows computers will tell you about its limitations. As far as tablets go you are correct. Android tablets have not delivered and the iPad ecosystem has flourished as a result. Bottom line, Apple is not perfect, far from it. Cod3rror Apple is not perfect, but it's the closest one to it out of three (Apple, Google, Microsoft). Apple sells expensive products, everybody knows that. You pay for tech + "luxury", they simply would not be able to sell cheap products, look at iPhone 5c. As for the ecosystem, you either go by Apple's ecosystem or you don't get an Apple product. If you use the product the way Apple intended it to be used, you'll really enjoy it and have a great time, that's what most people do and they are quite happy about it. I personally don't, so I don't use Apple products. But for an average person, Apple is the easiest, most seamless experience out there. Apple also provides the easiest backup/restore functionality, something that Google still does not properly do. Next, let's talk about support, if you buy an iPhone, you will get support for at least 4 years, this is something no Android or Microsoft phone can claim. Hell, Google does not even support Nexus properly, as I mentioned, everything is a beta with them. At any moment they might change their mind, or scrap it and do something else, there is no feeling of stability. As for services, Google has a huge lead on Apple on services, which are not Apple's strong point. But Google's own services work better and are better designed on Apple's products. I cannot comment about OSX itself, just the hardware, so I will take your word for it. Personally, I don't have much interest in it, and I too prefer Windows to OSX and even to Linux. However, most people that I know that tried OSX, switched. Finally, Apple innovates, even though many people don't like to admit it, they do push things forward. They pushed the retina screen, they pushed the fingerprint sensor, etc... Watch as future phones have pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback. Hrishikesh Bisen Well actually Android Watch OS is wrost in all Watch OS Sk0ly Let's try that again in English Charlie Well, Android is here for 8 years isn't it? And Nexus phones/Pixel products are also still being supported? No? AlRegals Google TV...... Sk0ly Bad example. Google TV was ahead of its time and the Cablecos were the ones who murdered that platform, not google. If we are doing a comparison, how about the Microsoft Courier or Windows Phone 7 or Apple with the Newton. PVL_93_RU Android TV is dead too though Sk0ly Hahaha you are joking right? You realize like 80% of television manufacturers this year are shipping TVs running Android TV right? On top of that, google is aggressively backing the Xiaomi mii box. I do wish for a pixel player one day though. Hrishikesh Bisen Where did you get this figures, Although I'm sure Samsung and LG doesn't support Android TV. Sk0ly Sony, Sharp, Philips, Vizio, RCA, Hisense, etc. I'll admit that stat was a bit overzealous when considering Samsung Smart TV and the recently purchased WebOS for LG. With that said, Sony, Philips, and Sharp sell a lot of TVs and Android tv is a way better experience. I love my Nexus player, albeit a bit buggy but would love to see a pixel branded Android tv box but I doubt that would happen. Sk0ly OK, maybe 80% was pushing it but the list of OEM's is very long. Sony, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Vizio, TCL, RCA, Bang & Olafsen, Vestel, Arcelik Pretty much the only major manufacturers not on board are LG because they bought WebOS from HP and have invested in it, Samsung because they have years of investment into their platform, and Panasonic because they don't care about a decent smarttv platform. Of that list, the first three sell a lot of TV's (Sony/Sharp/Philips) and the smaller vendors are on the rise. https://www.statista.com/statistics/267095/global-market-share-of-lcd-tv-manufacturers/ Samsung & LG combined for about 30% of the market last year and are on the decline. Having used all three platforms, Android TV is by far the best experience. Android TV added a ton of OEM's this year and I expect that to continue as Samsung and LG will not be able to compete on developers. This is because A. There is already a large community of Android Developers so they don't need to learn to code for a new platform and B. It will be on more brands, reducing the need to create a variety of different apps for different platforms. Charlie So we agree that it can go either way? thartist You're quite right, but at least at this point it's not about branching into unnecessary experiments like ChromeOS, but converging OSs. And in the end it all aims to converge on Fuchsia, the one for all, like Microsoft did with Windows 8+. browngeek Port it to the Pixel C already! David Ruddock It's already been said to us that Google is using Pixel C as a test platform for Andromeda (as 9to5G said, they also used N9, but we think they've moved on), but before people go nuts: that doesn't necessarily mean anything in terms of Pixel C ever getting Andromeda officially. browngeek Juicy! Read on Android Authority that the N9 was being tested, but no mention of the Pixel C. Faheem Ahmed ONLY IF THEY MAKE ANDROID SO POWERFUL....THAT IT COULD RIVAL WINDOWS 10(AMAZING FEATURES AND SOOOO MUCH SETTINGS AND STUFF) THEN someone755 I think Microsoft crippled Windows 10 enough that you'd only need support for running Windows programs (Steam, Adobe CS, Office etc.) and enough drivers to support the majority of today's devices to take over people's computers with your own OS. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Crippled in what way, exactly? Windows 10's their best desktop OS yet. Andromeda will need to rival it for me to switch. someone755 For me, every way. There is nothing better in w10 than in w8.1. The Start menu is a mess, the updates are just horribly executed ("Hey, do you want this upda-- TOO LATE WE INSTALLED IT ALREADY AND REMOVED A PROGRAM YOU WERE USING"), the fact they're trying to force their mobile apps in a desktop environment by making a crippled Settings app etc. I miss Charms, the Start screen, and a less-shitty version of Windows Update, along with a better Control Panel. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Interesting. I've found it to be consistently better in nearly every way except for tablet experience, which I rarely use, and which has been improved dramatically anyway. You're literally the first person I've seen prefer 8.1. Normally everybody hates 8.x with a passion for irrational reasons. someone755 I really don't understand the hate. Compared to Windows 7, so little was changed, -- other than some minor design tweaks, the Start screen and Charms, very little was changed -- and it could easily be used as a desktop platform, without the silly apps and Store being shoved down your throat. And most of the Settings app's options were still available through the Control Panel and elsewhere. I don't get who dictates to these people what to like and what to religiously hate, but there has got to be a site or magazine that tells people what's popular right now. Because there is no reason why people would just unanimously agree that something sucks this much. Roger Siegenthaler Ignoring all the group policies and enterprise related stuff what you're suggesting is still a massive amount of work. Let alone the driver part is a massive issue. Lare2 All sound nice ..... But where's Allo .? someone755 Allo? You mean the already released and lame chatting app? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Allo? On the Play Store already? Lare2 I guess a "/s" was necessary .. LOL Suicide_Note https://media1.giphy.com/media/g1xNFWSvnnFJu/giphy.gif jesuguru ...for liposuction Suicide_Note Among other things. blindexecutioner What the pixel C should have been. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman And likely was supposed to be. Stevie_Wonder Teasing it the 4th, presenting it start of next year, telling us it will release soon at the end of next year, buying it in Q2 of 2018 and a year or 2 later the whole thing is abandoned. I really hope not, but one can not be a bit pessimistic with all the stuff Google is doing and not doing anymore. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman This is a touch different from some communications app. This sounds like the entire direction of the most successful software platform Google has, combined with the second most successful software platform Google has. Stevie_Wonder I totally agree. Wasn't referring to only the communication-app-maze Google is dropping it's users in. But with all the name changes (Nexus to Pixel, Chromecast to Cast) and the doubt around support (will the old Nexus get the new updates from 7.1 and the launcher the Pixels will get) and slow release of products around the world, Google isn't really strong in building a lifetime platform. Except, over time, with Android. Chrome OS still has to prove itself in my eyes and while I really hope this is going to work, I think they should've done this from the start.. and with announcing things way ahead of release, the hype train goes to another station. Yes, combining their most successful software platforms (do they have others?) sounds great, but they should've done it earlier and should already be able to bring it out, instead of a year later. Grimmjow Meh krazyfrog Hardware aside, what sort of third party app ecosystem are we talking about here? The laughable Android tablet apps? The utterly hilarious Chrome OS "apps"? Or something completely new? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The former, but with a push to make them actually happen. philosopher_Mk Probably Android apps + desktop version of Chrome browser. PVL_93_RU That's Chrome OS TedPhillips and GoogleTV alexg Yeah what about the watches?? Justin W Well, considering Chromebooks run Android apps and they look just fine (you'll recall that Android 7.0 added easy resizability, I'm sure), I'd expect Android appsand Chrome (with all it's extensions and apps) in a desktop-browser version. Andrew Bone And it's all built on Fuchsia... Right? bdbplatano That's what I was wondering too. Surely they have to have some kind of interplay philosopher_Mk Nope,have you read the article ? Andrew Bone Yes, Android is built on top of the Linux platform (as is Chrome OS). I was just wondering if they might swap that out for Fuchsia. David Ruddock No. It's built on Android. Andrew Bone So Linux (as the underbelly of Android) could not be swapped out with Fuchsia? I just presumed that would be the only reason google would start at the bottom and work their way up. Carson Saldanha He didn't read ur article lol Captain_Invisible That's IoT... right? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I would personally wager that a break from the Android name might come with this. Because if this is going to be a desktop-class OS, then the entire control of updates and other factors needs to shift to Google for the first time for ALL devices. That requires a fundamental rethinking of how the OS works with OEMs and how it's presented to consumers from them, which to me would justify a new name so people can confidently recognize the difference. Captain_Invisible Andromeda would be such a cool name, but I doubt it's going to be anything but a code name. Jared I dunno, if you squint real hard you can combine Android and Chrome to make And-rome-da or Andr-ome-da. Basically Android+Chrome?... Da (Russian for yes). jesuguru Chrandroid? _jsw_ Bison Savings Account: Activated! (if it's a dud, I can always buy the 2018 Pixel XXL) Yura Kazimirov Can it run Overwatch is the real question! David Prieto "Via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa" So, what type of features are we talking about? David McClellan I'm assuming this is multiwindow support, not just split screen. An application "dock" as opposed to a launcher, and extension support I would assume. Also having access to ChromeOS/Desktop Chrome API's would be awesome for webapp integration. David Prieto What API again? philosopher_Mk Desktop ui,desktop browser, seamless updates , better right click support, multi window . David Prieto Yeah, those seem to make sense and are already on their way to being implemented, or don't look like they'd be a lot of work But then it wouldn't be "merging" Android and Chrome OS, as much as turning Android into a usable desktop system and ditching Chrome OS. Would it? philosopher_Mk Yes, I guess they are just making Android more usable desktop system and ditching Chrome os. It makes sense , Android is their most successful product since Google search. David Ruddock We'd like to know, too! But at this point, we don't. David Prieto It can be fun to speculate tho :-P Jason Allen They already did the boot feature. Maybe the other features are security features like the chrome OS reboot to reset everything. David Ruddock Sure - seamless updates is definitely the first big one. Itchy_Robot Let us know if you hear anything about better security updates. I really love how my 8 year old Asus windows 7 (updated to Win10 for free) still gets security updates. I hope Google is trying to eventually move to that model rather than the "2.5 years and your out" model they currently have. The way the OS is structured now relies on 3rd parties implementing the security updates rather than Google pushing it directly to the user. I hope one day Google can get their OS in shape to handle 'direct to the consumer' security updates. Captain_Invisible Updates. Zaptor99 Google is exhausting !!!! Carson Saldanha I have a feeling it'll be like the Surface Pro's. It'll run full Android in tablet mode and Chrome OS in laptop mode. b_boogey_xl Is this how they plan on taking control of Android? By making another OS but this time they have full control over it… 🤔 J3R3MY_H Not sure what Andromeda does for me that Android apps in ChromeOS doesn't do. Hopefully I'll understand better next week. a.d.AM And why do I want this? What will it do that Android or Chrome OS hasn't done? I've never once said "oh, I have to pull out my Chromebook to take care of this task." This will flop just like Allo. Stephen Sharp People have been pushing for Android as a desktop OS since before it was even really a tablet os pfmiller It's never made sense to me why people have wanted that though. Neither the OS nor the apps are well suited to desktop use. Stephen Sharp How so? I grant you the chicken & the egg problem of scalable Android apps, but I believe that's what Android apps are for on ChromeOS - a trojan horse, or a red carpet, getting developers to get their apps ready for this But, how is Android not suited for a desktop besides UI (which will be solved when Google actually ships Android for a particular formfactor and not before) pfmiller It's just designed for a touch screen which does not make for a good desktop experience. Sure, you can rework the whole interface of the OS and apps to make them work on a desktop, but why? There are already desktop OSs and applications that do everything you need. Stephen Sharp Why have the same ecosystem for your Laptop, Phone, Tablet, Car, TV (Console for me thanks to Shield), and Watch, pay-once-run-everywhere? No no you're right I don't know what I was thinking :P Stephen Sharp That's still just UI. Nothing inherently wrong with the OS for Desktop use. And if Jide (the behemoth that it is) can make Android work nice on a desktop, surely Google can. As for why, buy-once-run-everywhere apps. Also, Android is awesome because reasons thats why mattcoz It will hopefully deliver a full-fledged desktop OS, that's what Android and Chrome OS haven't done. a.d.AM But what will it do that OSs have not been able to do previously? Combining them givess me more apps I guess, but I've never felt any lack of apps. If you're telling me it'll run apps that Android or Chrome could never run, that would be something! Being able to use apps like Paper, Traktor, and other iOS only apps would be huge. But i have a feeling it'll be another google fail. Combine 2 OSs with no additional benefits. Typical modern innovation. mattcoz Apps (ugh, I still hate that word) are not the issue here. Android and Chrome OS have never been viable alternatives to Windows or OSX or any decent Linux distro. Will Andromeda? Time will tell. Wes C >But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day Have we forgotten about the smartwatches?? I really need to replace my OG G Watch... http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/11/exclusive-these-could-be-googles-upcoming-android-wear-smartwatches/ Chris Yessss I would love a nice replacement for my Gear Live thartist Smartwatches are a fad gone. br_hermon Flood of thoughts running through my head but 1st thoughts... "Android" as a beloved brand and I hope Google sticks with it to brand this going forward. Samsung must be prepping for full court press with Tizen right now and see the "writing on the wall" in terms of Google's current/past Android / OEM relationship structure. Cory Wilson I just hope as far as updates go, it's more chrome OS in those regards m0ritz They should just develop it for the Pixel C... This tablet was planned to run Chrome OS... And it's still the strongest tablet on the market. Stephen Sharp Maybe they will offer the option, who knows Captain_Invisible By then it will be about two years old, so I really doubt that. mattcoz They should just develop it for what would be 2 year old hardware? How does that make any sense? roberto.elena What a downer, I wanted to buy a chromebook (a decent one) later this year or early next year, as soon as the Android apps on Chrome OS became a stable option, but now... too many unknowns for the future of current chromebooks. Stephen Sharp Get a refurbed Chromebook Flip to hold you over roberto.elena Unfortunately the availability of Chromebooks is not so good in my country compared to the US. TigerMike901 Well, given the info, I guess I can't wait to see some kind of demo to see the real benefits of Andromeda. Right now I just can't imagine it could do more for me than ChromeOS with Android apps baked in. I mean honestly, I don't really see much of a difference in merging the two to form Andromeda. Stephen Sharp Well in a few years it will do one thing better than Android Apps on Chromebooks: it will still exist. If this is true, it makes more sense than Android Apps on Chromebooks, and Android on Chromebooks are either the trojan horses to get developers to finally make Android Apps that scale well for a laptop formfactor, or a swan song and a parting gift (or maybe both) Scott Miller Correction: Android apps on Chromebooks did not descend from the ARC project. They ditched that approach in favor of a full Android subsystem. This was actually a critical argument in court with Oracle recently. David Ruddock That's correct. The initial approach (ARC) wasn't utilized, but as you said, a new one then emerged. Sorry if the language there was inartful - I meant more that it descended theoretically, not technically. I was just trying to show that it had no relationship to the Andromeda project, not trying to imply that ARC itself powered Android apps on Chrome OS (this was also asked at I/O, where Google gave a similar answer about ARC being abandoned). Quentin SILVESTRE I think their comment is more about the general idea behind the two approaches. Sure the tech changed a lot, but it was still inspired by the desire to have android apps working on chrome os. Andromeda is a merger of two OSes and is a much bigger project. Meaning : Knowing andromeda was a long way off, they probably figured they should find a way to bring android apps to chrome os as we know it today. Plus it gives time and hardware for developpers to prepare for a version of android that would span acrosse multiple form factors. Rocco Augusto While Google did ditch ARC technology as an extension that could be loaded into Chrome, they still do refer to the Android subsystem/container as ARC in the Chrome OS code base. So technically, you're both right. :) JD I don't know. Based on how Google's past hardware undertakings have been I don't really want to pay premium dollars to be a beta tester. Announcements like this setup Surface level expectations. Looking at the Pixel C that was definitely not Surface level polished product. It was and still is a half finished work in progress, and with Google only promising 24 months of major releases I'm tired of paying to be a beta tester just to be abandoned with a half finished product. If they promised 3-4 years of support I might jump or if the technology allowed for a windows type experience where I could upgrade drivers(I know that's not how it works). At this point Google seems to be going in a paradigm shift, I'm going to sit back and wait till they settle in and head towards to polish phase (Which I don't think they'll ever head in). I'm just a bit tired of the throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach, they need focus. Patrick Plante If they bake us a full compliant Android device that has a full Chome browser, I'm sold, that would the the exact thing I would want, best of both world. You could add real multi-window management and that would do the trick. Not talking about side by side here, while useful, I would like to get real window management. Stephen Sharp This + full access to Bash (maybe in a developer mode) and I wouldn't need anything else :P Patrick Plante Forgot that, you're right! Stephen Sharp I suppose the same people asking "why" now asked "why" in 2010* when Google first started beta testing Chromebooks, and this makes more sense than ChromeOS did back then. ChromeOS doesn't do anything that Android can't, merely things that Android currently doesn't do David Ruddock This is an excellent way to put it, and I've long thought something similar. Android has huge advantages over Chrome for hardware extensibility, content ecosystem, and developer support. One of those you could maybe, eventually replicate in Chrome OS. But two you could not. PVL_93_RU By content ecosystem - do you mean apps/programs? And is developer support an issue for ChromeOS when they're bringing over millions of Android apps and extensions aren't going away from Chrome? jesuguru Is running Android apps in a subsystem on ChromeOS the same as running natively on Android/Andromeda? PVL_93_RU good point, of course Native will be superior TedPhillips i would strongly disagree about 'hardware extensibility'. crOS's sane approach to hardware is exactly why there is no update lag, OEM churn, premature EOL of devices, or platform software fragmentation. android's approach to hardware is spaghetti meets wall, and first one to drop support after the sale - wins. Patrick Plante Someone knows if the october 4th event is livestreamed? If yes, someone has a link that will stream it and/or the exact time of the event, including UTC. Thanks. TigerMike901 Google usually live streams these things on Youtube....but the link probably won't be up until the 4th. sleepinlight So, there's really no news on what this means for phones? I'll be honest, this is cool and all, but this is probably the least interesting way that this news could have taken shape for me. I was really hoping this would be more about fixing problems with Android on phones (updates/fragmentation, poor way of handling background services, performance issues) than putting Android on a laptop. Duder12 Huh? They already are by ignoring the OEMs and doing their own thing. The pixel line will finally give them the control of the software/hardware they need. pfmiller The Nexus phones already gave them the control of the software they needed. He's talking about for devices that Google doesn't control. Stephen Sharp Why not both? They could be starting in a formfactor that OEMS haven't cared about, so "wrestling control" from them wouldn't be a problem. Google learns how best to do updates, then they come for the Android TVs, then the tablets, then smartwatches, then phones Antics Uh oh. Concern: will "Android" remain alive as available to anyone via AOSP but "Andromeda" is Google's proprietary fork (akin to the Nexus factory images) or new proprietary OS (as the article[s] suggest) and will only be available for Google's devices as to try to compete with Apple's other computing solutions? Meaning, "Andromeda" may never end up on other manufacturer's excellent hardware. Duder12 So the other manufacturers can ruin he operating system and the brand like they do now? No thank you! I dont need Andromeda Touchwiz Samsung laptops. Railwayman Other manufacturers can't 'ruin' anything if Google put certain rules in place. You should compare with Windows Phone 7 - it launched on devices from HTC, LG and Samsung - all of them running a similar OS with some small differences. You could also look at desktop Windows and Linux, which runs on several different computers despite being the same system (Ubuntu is always Ubuntu regardless of brand name of the computer). Andromeda will fail IF Google attempt to make it 'in-house' only but will be successful if they make it available for other OEMs - with strict requirements of allowed modifications (i.e. they can bundle with different apps and services but not touch the system itself). KChristainsen pass Adithya Pc Inb4 Andromeda Police comments Defenestratus I already checked the domain registrar and its been taken :P alexg None needs that grizzlyjon83 I just can't see ChromeOS sticking around for too long after Andromeda. It'll be the Windows RT of the Google world. Duder12 Yep I agree TigerMike901 Whether ChromeOS exists after Andromenda or not, Google has to support it for a few more years to come. ChromeOS saw a big adoption in the education space, and abandoning it would surely leave a sour taste for many after making the large investments. I think it will either be around or be supported for a while, and then Andromeda will fully take over. In Google's End of Life document on Chromebooks, many models are stated to be supported up to 2020, and some recent models through 2021. Stephen Sharp I don't see them abandoning it at all. Quite frankly ChromeOS already does all it needs to do for those who adopted it, and add Android apps to the mix and it does more than enough. It can live on on the backburner for a while merely getting Chrome browser and security updates, and hopefully, eventually, users of ChromeOS will see Andromeda doing everything they need and more, and switch over grizzlyjon83 That's a fair point about the education space. Regardless, it'll probably get phased out eventually, but it will make it more of a slow death. deppman ah, come on. ChromeOS isn't *that* bad :) PVL_93_RU I don't think they need to spend too much resources to support it though. They basically roll the updates out at the same time as Chrome for other platforms, since the software department is entirely on Google's part and the OEMs only provide the hardware (the Chromebooks), so the worst that can happen is it will slowly fade away as Andromeda takes over both mobile and desktop class of Google products Mix My dad told me his favorite animal before he walked out the door and something bad happened to him but I will never forget it, Bison...... I am hoping that the phone and 7" tablet are not $600+ CAD...fingers crossed PVL_93_RU inb4 no LTE capability David Ruddock That doesn't actually seem to be planned at the moment. But it could change. PVL_93_RU Well the Pixel C still doesn't have an LTE version either so... I'm not holding my breath :( Ace AP has pretty much stripped Google off from any surprises in Oct 4th, we know almost everything now...it'll now be like attending the event as deja vu Joris Griffioen Yeah, kinda sad really. Unless they come with some real surprises. Like non-fugly Pixel phones for instance... PVL_93_RU That's what always happens though. Still excited for the event, since we don't EXACTLY know how the whole Andromeda thing is gonna work or look etc wrkerr At first glance of the headline, I read a Pixel 3' laptop, and so I started imagining a laptop with a 36" screen. :) TJStrat Looks like Google is inspired by Microsoft. A PC OS which runs apps. This sounds like Windows 10 to me. Nick Interesting. Developer driven apps. Would be pretty cool to see a suite of android development apps on their new platform, but not sure the market needs to be skewed anymore like the messaging scene. Now if only I didn't have to have a mac to develop for iOS, sigh. Still is exciting though. jon I seen this coming years ago. i hope google releases the os in a iso format. but probably not Marko Šaric Cool, I guess. More expensive shit that I can't afford but would like to. Anyway, all I would be doing on that laptop would be refreshing Android police 8 times a day and watching YouTube. keithzg For that you could probably just hook a monitor and keyboard up to a Raspberry Pi ;) Madis After all this, why was the original article about Andromeda claimed to be wrong then? To discourage leaks? http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/29/wsj-google-reportedly-plans-to-merge-chrome-into-android-form-single-new-os-in-2017/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/02/google-refutes-rumors-of-chrome-os-merging-with-android-says-its-here-to-stay/ person Technically nothing has changed. They've said that Android and Chrome weren't merging but that they'd bring the best of each platform to the other. Design and apps are coming to ChromeOS though whatever will end up in Andromeda is yet to be known. Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Madis Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Well, yes, because it's still 2016. They could "bring the best" from/to each other, but if Andromeda is real, I bet at least one of those OSs (Chrome OS) will still be discontinued eventually, ending up with a merge. Maybe if phones get better, they'll discontinue Android too and use Andromeda with wired full computer capabilities (you know, Continuum). person Potential has no bearing on intent or feasibility. Regardless of whether a merger could happen at some point in the indefinite future, as it stands now that is not the case. ChromeOS and Android coexist; there is no merger. Jordan L take my money. bugdroid Ok. Lawrence Q3 2017 ZzzZzzZz Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Is the Andromeda name confirmed for commercial launch? Or will it be Android Desktop a la Android Wear? TigerMike901 Android Desktop running Andromeda? :) Jamie Moore Q3 of 2017? Glad I got my Pixel LS... keithzg And I'm still choked that Google refused to sell me one, although admittedly I rarely use a laptop. 1pixel What a time to be alive Deckard_Cain Why no dedicated GPU??? Stephen Sharp For Android games? They aren't there yet bmlsayshi As a person who loves Android and finds it vastly preferable to the alternatives... I have to ask why? Why kill Chrome OS like that? It's different enough and single purposed enough. I don't wan't Chrome on Android. I don't even care about Android on Chrome. I LOVE Chrome OS but I don't foresee using it on Android. Charlie You don't even know HOW the products/OSD is designed , will be rolled out and/or in what sense it will be replacing Chrome OS. It's still a year away. Just relax, and see where this take us. It might be a smoother transition than you think. keithzg /me switches .com to .ca, sees price go up to $1,257.28 with another $100 in shipping, weeps Amit_N At $799, I can buy a laptop with 256 SSD and i7, that can power any damn linux distro along with Windows. Am I the only one that is not sold with this devices? Jaime I'm in the market for a new laptop, care to give me an example of which laptop can I get with the internals you mentioned? Thanks! Amit_N I have older version of this laptop with i5, I absolutely love this laptop. Total value for money. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015P3SKHQ Jaime Awesome, thank you! keithzg I have a first-hand Pixel, and it's the construction that has me still holding onto it instead of buying a newer laptop. The screen ratio is actually pretty fantastic and you don't find it anywhere else, and as someone who's allergic to branding (well, as allergic as people are to wifi, which is to say that it's all in my head but I'm rabid about it) the unadorned metal lid is a godsend. I dual-boot mine with ChromeOS and Kubuntu; if Google had ever deigned to sell the second-gen Pixel here in Canada I would've bought that too. warcaster Hopefully they make some $200-$250 ARM variants as well, not 100% Intel as they've been pushing so far with Chromebooks. Even Andromeda notebooks with Zen APUs would be a breath of fresh air. keithzg Huh? There's plenty if ARM Chromebooks. Or do you mean Pixel devices? 'Cause the most recent of those, the Pixel C, was also ARM. MJ My questions are.... Will I be able to install this Andromeda OS on a laptop I already own? Would I be able to install a different OS on this upcoming "Bison" aka Pixel 3 device (easily)? I get the feeling this is just another step down the road to turn desktop PCs into locked down smartphones with a monitor and keyboard/mouse. meijin3 Any news on the Pixel C running Andromeda? PVL_93_RU It'd be very weird if it didn't considering on the base system level it can theoretically at least dualboot Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Could Google unveil "Universal Apps" at the Oct 4th event ?? PVL_93_RU universal apps? person Insinuating that they aren't already? deppman This was so obvious in 2012; Google should have had a Jide-remix-like skunkworks project on this *then*, not in 2015. It's like captain obvious finally walked up to Sergey and slapped him in the face. I'm happy with this direction, and really look forward to the OS. I just wish they'd gotten on it sooner. TedPhillips bleh, I need to go reread the andromeda article.... as someone who's into both ecosystems from a technical angle, putting cros bits into android, instead of android bits into cros still seems like the much worse option... doesn't mean it won't be successful, but i think the world would be a better place with the reverse. keithzg Yeah, ChromeOS's guts are a much saner, much more standard stack. Android suffers from a lot of NIH syndrome under the hood by comparison. I suppose with how Google has been trending towards being more proprietary and locked-down recently it makes sense they'd go that direction, but it's still disappointing. drksilenc I read that as a 3' pixel laptop at first... Brian These sound a lot like Reef and Kevin chromebooks? keithzg So I wonder if it'll be available in Canada like the Pixel C, or weirdly unavailable here like the Chromebook Pixels. Although about a year out is admittedly too soon to be worrying about availability, heh. Luxferro If it doesn't have replaceable storage (m.2 SSD), then I'll never be interested in google's premium laptops. It was the reason I did not buy the previous Pixel laptop. Stephen Sharp I'd like to sign up for the giveaway, please :P Adal With all these exclusive Google article in AP, i have a feeling Sundar Pichai is directly working with AP. is he your primary source of leaks? :) Peterson Silva No, they just have someone hidden under his desk. Shhh, don't tell him :D PVL_93_RU that's because the AP crew are actually Google employees, but shhh, nobody should know this juanjeremy2012 man i just hope it doenst lose the slickness of chromebooks. chromebooks do 90% of what you do better than windows and if they added an off line office suite that number would jump to 97%. juanjeremy2012 i dont want these expensive aluminum ultrathin things. i just want a decent plastic design like what is on hp stream or dell latitude that doesnt flex for about $500 JohnCalla $800 for a 12" Android laptop. Not seeing much of a market for this. Jonathan Ramos Wait why 2017? Seems like a great time to release. I doubt anyone is rushing out and getting Pixel tablets running Android this Christmas. LewisSD Just sayin, I totally wrote a thread about this merger of Android and Chrome 4 years ago on androidandme. I'm stoked to see Google make it happen! Chris Johnston so the question is... will this gain market share and actually be viable? or will this be steam OS part 2? I know, different applications and all, but they are both built off of linux. Chris Skipper 9 reasons why Andromeda HAS to be a Chrome OS mode inside Android: 1. Google has said Chrome OS is here to stay and not only said that Chrome OS would continue to exist, a spokesperosn also confirmed to The Verge that BOTH Android and Chrome OS will continue to exist, which means they will continue to be offered as separate products. 2. Hiroshi Lockehimer, SVP of Andorid, Chrome OS, and Google Play has told JR Raphel that he made no sense of the rumors that first came out 3. Even though Hiroshi Lockheimer said he couldn't make sense of the rumor, the original Wall Street Journal report even though mentioned that Android remained as the dominant system, they said that Google would continue to maintain Chrome OS but the focus would be using Chrome OS to expand Android onto PCs. 4. Eric Schmidt in TechCrunch has said that you don't get rid of one or the other, but that technlogy moves forward when one can be wrapped into the other and mentioned how the environments can come together, but mentioned that the OS system attributes should be separate. 5. To make the two operating systems into one operating system, you would need to save both the advantages of using Chrome OS and the advantages of using Android. You can decide to merge Android into Chrome OS but that would require virtualization or dual booting. Then if you decide to do Andromeda without continuing to offer Chrome OS, you lose the advantages of Chrome OS. 6. Google wouldn't be building Fuchsia if they knew they could just merge Android and Chrome OS which means there would be no intention on writing a new OS and like Hiroshi said, if they thought about both of these on day one the foundation would've been built to have the best of both but Android and Chrome OS 7. There will not a "desktop version of Android" because the material design showcase does not show a desktop version of Android. It shows Chrome OS. That freeform mode is hidden deliberately because it's only there to create APIs so that way Android apps on Chrome isn't like the beta where there are fixed sizes and you can't resize your Android apps. 8. An AndroidCentral journalist claims that the Pixel C was made to run Android but with a desktop version of Chrome with ARM APIs even though the Pixel C was planned with Project Athena, Frankenboard, and then they decided to just flash Android. 9. AndroidPolice says Andromeda is Android and that Chrome OS will still be something else and now you see BOTH TABLETS AND PCs being tested with this new OS while Chrome OS has never been on anything else but a PC. What Google would have to do to build Andromeda as a mode within Android: 1. Take the Chrome browser from the Chrome OS client and make it an app inside Android. 2. Create a Quick Setting inside Android that opens this app when pressed. 3. Now you have a Windows 8 esquesqe functionality for Android (except that one environment wouldn't be used as a launcher for the other). 4. The utility used to tap into the container for Chrome OS would be used so that way it would tap into the same libs used in the Android System so that way Android Apps can function in the Chrome browser inside the Android System. 5. The utility also packages Android APKs into Chrome Packaged Apps but instead the utility would be tweaked to use redirects in place where the Android APK files would go, like your APK, saves, and states, with the redirects pointing towards the system/app or system/priv-app folders inside the root. The browser would also use the utility to write and delete in that same folder. 6. Finally, when you go into the browser the browser will start a clean new instance and then read the Android apps currently open on recent apps and then do a new instruction that does a call to launch the corresponding CRXs on the browser and then execute the states that are persistently saved as you use Android apps. When you leave the Webtop Mode via an option in the Chrome OS status area, the browser will make the same call to the Android System by having your apps cleared and then opening up the same apps that were opened on the browser and then also executing the states that are being persistently saved as you use your Android apps on Chrome OS. The final result is to create a hybrid operating system where you can use Android as a tablet like you always have been doing but now you'll be able to connect a mouse to your tablet and then be able to switch your UI between Android System UI and Chrome Ash Window Manager with zero interruptions. You would also be able to use your phone as a desktop by connecting it to a display using this same mode. MuleForRent Prevent owners from upgrading the SSD and you'll still sell a lot. Let us add serious storage and Microsoft/Apple will be in for a terrible shock MuleForRent One of the great possible outcomes here is an office suite application 'reset' that strips the crazy complexity and bulk out of native apps. I'd switch from Windows just to get nicely designed, simpler versions of Outlook and Word. Google Docs is great for lots of stuff, but native apps still have their place, and Gmail in all forms is still unpleasant to look at and use. TONY ALDO Q3 2017? ugh talk about cock tease. captainhurt chrome os is NOT about PROVIDING features or apps, but rather about BEING, as an os is defined, a platform to deliver features and apps. Chrome is ALL ABOUT being a platform that is an inherently secure, inherently up-to-date, inherently backed-up, simple, low-cost, lightweight, very fast, cloud-based easy-to-use thin-client. TheSpaceUnicorn The only thing that would make me interested in an Andromeda laptop is full Adobe CC being on it. That's my one requirement for any laptop. Quentin Menini Will Andromeda be called "pixel OS" ? mudi1 its hard incredibly hard to play and win in Microsoft's field, many tried but all lost. if google planning to give a worthy alternative of MS windows then its nothing less then going against titans . i go point wise - 1. AAA gaming is the shied of windows OS and if google wants to succeed they must target AAA gamer requirements. 2. google must start making deals with game devs to code their games on Vulkan API coz 95% AAA games code on DirectX which is MS proprietary . if they code on vulkan then they can be easily playable on google notebook. 3. GPU licensing can play a major role for ex just give amd 20-30$/chip as license and get their big gpu tech like 1024 core Polaris gpu, then couple that with ARM cpu cores ... this will allow google to cut cost like magic bcoz 8 core A73 core cpu built on 10nm node will require just 16 mm2 of die space so cost of soc will be much lower then intel offering hence google will have a price advantage and i choosed AMD polaris coz all console games developed on amd GCN arch. 4. give more support to ARM arch as there is more competition like qualcomm, mediatek, Kirin, imagination and more competition means much faster pace of performance/dollar. 5. fully flagged performance notebook should start with price tag of 400 dollar so that wide adoption will face no trouble . 6. last but most imp - add dedicated external gpu feature on notebooks yes i said external gpu , same way as razor core link - http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core thats much needed feature and if google does that then it will sell like hot cakes. just do this and whole gaming community will make a shift to gogole. Hadrian Węgrzynowski > Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. First part of this sentence is wrong. ChromeOS had experimental ARC (App Runtime for Chrome), but it went nowhere near to support all of Android apps. They abandoned this approach and went with separate Android container beside ChromeOS. You even written about it [1], it is mentioned in Wikipedia [2]. [1] http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/22/chrome-android-apps-show-stable-chrome-os-first-time/ [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS#Android_applications - second paragraph person A descendant as in they are both part of the same initiative--bringing Android apps to ChromeOS. Andromeda is not. indiandragon Lol, 'merging Chrome features into Android' Isn't that why chrome is there in Playstore already ? If at all something, this should be Android x86 running chrome as front end. Assuming that this is capable of running Android apps natively by design, I'm not sure how google plans of keeping Chrome OS project alive. Pixel Spot If Google uses the "Pixel 3" name for the laptops, what will they do then for the "Pixel 3" phones? Drew Ciccotelli What do you suppose Fuchsia is gonna run on? Andy Chow Not sure I'm happy about this. ChromeOS has been the perfect OS on a laptop so far. Those that say "for the same price I can get a MacBook pro" just don't get it, and probably never will. I didn't get the Pixel C because it wasn't ChromeOS. dontpanicbobby For as minute there I thought they were selling a 3 foot laptop. I had to re-read the title. Akash1NY Well this never happened... :-/ jet sky i wont waste any money on this os on my pc and even it is free os because of google ads alway sucks Dustin Mingo Any thoughts on whether this could be related to the Samsung Chromebook plus that recently came out?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Remotely Managed Private Cloud Emerges as Popular Model for Consuming OpenStack Infrastructure BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Smart organizations are getting sophisticated about workload placement across public and private clouds based on the Three C’s – capabilities, compliance and cost, said Jonathan Bryce, executive director of the OpenStack Foundation during his opening address today at the OpenStack Summit. The OpenStack ecosystem is evolving to deliver private cloud infrastructure in new ways, including Private Cloud-as-a-Service (PCaaS), remotely managed in a user’s data center of choice. During the OpenStack Summit keynotes, GE Healthcare presented the benefits of Private Cloud-as-a-Service through their partnership with Rackspace. According to Patrick Weeks, senior director of digital operations for GE Digital, “The remotely managed OpenStack solution provided the most flexible solution to drive applications to a cloud environment while protecting sensitive data and benefiting from access to internal applications on our private network.” The OpenStack Foundation today announced a new category within the OpenStack Marketplace to feature vendors who offer remotely managed private cloud solutions powered by OpenStack. The OpenStack Marketplace allows users to research and compare products and services from the OpenStack ecosystem, according to criteria such as interoperability tests, API versions, regional availability and hardware requirements. OpenStack service providers featured in the new Remotely Managed Private Cloud category include: Aptira Managed Cloud Canonical BootStack Cisco Metacloud EasyStack ESCaaS IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Local Mirantis Managed OpenStack Platform9 Managed OpenStack Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud UnitedStack UOS Whether on-premises or hosted in the service provider’s data center, PCaaS means that the vendor is responsible for architecting, monitoring, patching and upgrading the OpenStack infrastructure. In turn, enterprises do not have to hire a team to manage the infrastructure behind their firewall. At the same time, they benefit from OpenStack’s open APIs and competitive ecosystem, and experience significant cost savings versus traditional infrastructure. Users can even achieve substantial savings over public cloud as scale increases and workloads stabilize. “Public cloud gives you value on day 1,” said Lauren Nelson, principal analyst at Forrester Research. “Enterprises have struggled with DIY approaches where it takes a long time to learn the technology, build and integrate, and develop the new processes to support it. It may take years before general developer access is granted. In 2017, enterprises are looking for a day 1 private cloud. Converged and/or remotely managed private cloud problem-solves for this fundamental issue that has stalled productivity and adoption. This delivers the real speed of public but with the benefits of a local cloud.” “OpenStack is a diverse and rich ecosystem of projects at different stages of maturity,” Arturo Suarez, BootStack product manager, Canonical. “Canonical BootStack pioneered the Build, Operate, (Optionally) Transfer model of consuming OpenStack, allowing enterprises and telcos like Tele2 to overcome complexity by providing a reliable cloud, fully operated, so customers can focus on workloads.” “With OpenStack traction evolving from early adopters to mainstream enterprise, there is an increasing need for a fast, easy and predictable model to run OpenStack,” said Sirish Raghuram, chief executive officer at Platform9. “As evidenced by marquee recent customer wins Platform9 is announcing today based on our OpenStack-as-a-service offering, remotely managed OpenStack is the right approach by the foundation to further accelerate mainstream OpenStack adoption.” “Thanks to EasyStack’s remotely managed private cloud solution, we get great agility for business, and our people are dramatically reduced from daily operations since Day 1,” said Xiangdong Pei, IT department manager of TIANHE-CLOUD. “Thus we can focus more on business innovation.” About OpenStack Summit Boston Thousands of participants from 60+ countries are attending OpenStack Summit Boston this week to discuss how to combine open source technologies including programmable infrastructure and container orchestration frameworks to deliver speed, agility and cost savings. Users from Bloomberg, China Mobile, Department of International Trade for the UK, Fidelity, Gap, Google, Harvard, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, US Army Cyber School and Verizon are speaking.
